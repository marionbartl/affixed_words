DOUGLAS , Arizona ( CNN ) --
It 's a tale of homeland security concerns blocking wildlife management , and the hue and cry that ensues .
This photo , taken by Warner Glenn in 1996 , is believed to be the first of a live jaguar in the United States .

When most people think of jaguars , they think of the jungles of Central and South America , not the remote desert ranges between the United States and Mexico .
That region is known as mountain lion country , and that 's what rancher Warner Glenn thought he was tracking when he saddled up his mules on a summer day 12 years ago near Douglas , Arizona .
Glenn has hunted mountain lions for 60 years , since he was eight years old .
But Glenn was stunned when he saw what his hunting dogs had chased up to a high mountain perch .
The rancher took what 's believed to be the first photo of a live jaguar in the United States .
But it was n't his last .
In 2006 , some 40 miles away , Glenn and his hunting party again cornered a jaguar -- a different one .
Jaguars , an endangered species , have a breeding population in northern Mexico .
Scientists believe there are no more than 120 left in the wild there .
It 's believed that since 1910 , the cats are only visitors north of the border .
They have been virtually unstudied here until recently .
But Glenn and other conservationists worry that the possible return of breeding jaguars to the United States could be stopped in its tracks .
The reason : the border fence .
Last month the Department of Homeland Security waived 30 environmental laws to finish 470 miles of the fence by the end of the year .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff told Congress that the agency continues to talk to some 600 landowners along the border to get their input .
But in order to comply with the congressional mandate , he said , there is no time to deal with " unnecessary delays caused by administrative processes or potential litigation . "
" We are currently in a lawless situation at the border , " says Chertoff .
" I feel an urgency to get this tactical infrastructure in .
And although we 're going to be respectful of the environment , we 're going to be expeditious . "
Two environmental groups , Defenders of Wildlife and the Sierra Club , have filed appeals with the U.S. Supreme Court , claiming the waivers are unconstitutional and set a dangerous precedent .
" National security and environmental protection do not have to be at odds with each other , " says Defenders of Wildlife spokesman Matt Clark .
" If we can drop this arbitrary deadline for constructing the fence and go through the proper procedures , then there are inevitably ways to minimize environmental impact , but as it is now it 's throwing all of those laws out the window . "
Mountain lion tracker Jack Childs also worries about the impact of the fence on local wildlife , especially the jaguar .
Childs captured the first video of a live jaguar in the late summer of 1996 , a few months after Warner Glenn .
Watch Childs and Glenn talk about efforts to preserve the jaguar »
" I knew historically there had been a few jaguars sighted in Arizona but in the last hundred years never in any numbers . "
His encounter sparked a passion for the big cats .
Along with wife Anna and biologist Emil McCain , he created the Borderlands Jaguar Detection Project .

Childs and McCain hike into remote mountain areas where the jaguars roam and have placed more than 50 motion sensor cameras near the border .
They 've taken 69 photos of three different jaguars since 2001 , including several of the same cat Childs first saw in 1996 .
He has nicknamed that cat Macho B .
A jaguar 's spots are like fingerprints -- each cat has a unique set .
One of the spots on Macho B resembles a Pinocchio cartoon figure , and that 's how they identify him .
" We spend a lot of time walking along the border during the daytime , and we actually find his tracks going through the fence , so we know for sure that he crosses back and forth , " says Childs .
" A fence like that is going to inhibit wildlife movements and migrations back and forth .
It 's not going to effectively stop human traffic .
They 've got wire cutters and torches . "

Childs says the fence also has an impact on wildlife because drug runners and human traffickers have been pushed up into the mountain areas to avoid the fence in the lowland valleys .
" It 's impacting the animals number one , what 's going on down there .
It 's almost brought my wildlife study to a stop because they ( the traffickers ) are tearing down my cameras as fast as I 'm putting them up because they think we 're taking pictures of them . "
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service finds itself in a unique position .
Its mission is wildlife and habitat protection , but it must uphold another federal agency 's mission to override environmental concerns .
Bill Radke , manager of the San Bernardino Wildlife Refuge , says the Border Patrol is trying to work with his agency .
" The hope is that by working with Border Patrol that we can meet the national security mandate and at the same time protect the wildlife , " says Radke .
" Border Patrol is putting up camera towers but are putting them up on areas that are off the refuge .
They 're working on barriers but not barriers that would impede wildlife and large animals like jaguars . "
At 6 foot 6 , with steely blue eyes , dressed in leather chaps astride his mule , rancher Warner Glenn is every inch the American cowboy .
And he is a man forever changed by his encounters with the jaguar .
He has written a book , " Eyes of Fire , " about his experience .
He says he'd like to " invite Mr. Bush to come out on a mule " so he can see " what 's going on here in these mountains . "
For Glenn , the cat represents all that is wild about the Southwest .
" It would be a loss to me that maybe my granddaughter or my daughter would n't be able to see one like I have .
It 's just an animal that 's a beautiful , magnificent cat and they 're having a little bit of trouble surviving .
But they 're doing it , and I would hate to see us do anything that would cause the survival of that cat to go backwards .
" I'm a livestock rancher , but I would n't mind donating a few calves to that jaguar , so to speak . "
Biologist Emil McCain agrees .
" They are part of our natural heritage .
They are part of the American West .
They are part of the American wild as much as the bald eagle or the grizzly bear , and the jaguar is really special because it is such an elusive and beautiful creature [ that ] it evokes a sense of imagination and curiosity about the natural world . "
Though the jaguar is elusive , conservationists say the animal is caught -- in the political crossfire at the border .

When John McCain wants to talk economic policy with voters — especially female voters — he sends out Carly Fiorina , a former CEO of Hewlett - Packard , a senior adviser to McCain ’s presidential campaign , and chairwoman of the Republican National Committee ’s Victory Fund .
For example , days ago , after Barack Obama accused McCain of proposing an additional $ 300 billion in tax breaks for “ big corporations and the wealthiest Americans , ” Fiorina appeared on CNN to defend the Arizona senator .
( She first claimed that Obama was wrong to say that ExxonMobil would receive additional tax breaks from McCain , but then she acknowledged McCain ’s tax cuts for all corporations would cover big oil companies . )
And this week , McCain dispatched Fiorina on a speaking tour in Ohio and Pennsylvania targeting female voters .
She ’s even been mentioned as a possible McCain running mate .
But why should anyone listen to — let alone vote for — Fiorina ?
Her stint as a corporate titan was more mixed than master - of - the - universe .
In 1999 , Fiorina took over Hewlett - Packard , the troubled computer company , becoming one of the top women in Corporate America .
Previously , she had built a successful career mostly in marketing and sales at AT&T and Lucent , but she had the not - so - good fortune to be taking the helm of an engineering - driven tech company as the tech boom was ending .
Her solution to HP ’s ailments was controversial : buying Compaq .
She pushed the $ 19 billion acquisition over the opposition of many HP stockholders , including , most notably , Walter Hewlett , the son of the company ’s founder , who argued the merger would not make HP more competitive .
At HP , Fiorina developed the reputation of a manager who knocked heads together — or who chopped them off .
And there were massive layoffs during her tenure .
In 2003 , the company announced it would dismiss almost 18,000 people .
( That year , the firm posted a $ 903 million loss on $ 56.6 billion in revenue . )
When the outsourcing of jobs turned into a national political issue , Fiorina became the poster - girl for an industry campaign aimed at blocking any legislation that would restrict a company ’s ability to can American employees in favor of workers overseas .
She and executives from seven other tech companies issued a report that argued that any such measures would hurt the U.S. economy .
The best way to increase American competitiveness , they declared , was to improve schools and , yes , reduce taxes .
At a Washington press conference , Fiorina said , “ There is no job that is America ’s God - given right anymore .
We have to compete for jobs . ”
The remark did not go over well with critics of outsourcing , who have ever since used it as an indicator of corporate insensitivity .
Fiorina ’s stint at HP was marked by other moments of controversy .
In March 2004 , after HP shareholders voted 1.21 billion to 925 million to expense stock options , she opposed the move , essentially opting to stick with accounting practices ( that were used by other corporations ) that did not reveal a company ’s true value .
That same year , Forbes reported that Hewlett - Packard was “ among many other U.S. companies that kept offices in Dubai and were linked to Iranian traders there . ”
The article suggested that HP and other countries were skirting export controls to trade with Iran .
And in early 2005 , Fiorina announced that pop star Gwen Stefani would join the HP design team and work on the company ’s line of digital cameras .
Fiorina was n’t around long enough to see her Plan Stefani to completion .
In February 2005 , she was pushed out of HP .
The company ’s board , with which she had been battling for years , had had enough of her .
The Compaq merger had not yielded the benefits — improved shareholder returns and greater profits — she had promised .
At the time of her dismissal , Hewlett - Packard stock was trading at about the same price as when she first unveiled the Compaq deal .
Eighty percent of the company ’s operating profits were coming from its old - line printing business .
She had not succeeded in reviving HP as a computer - selling powerhouse .
The day she was dumped , the company ’s stock price rose 7 percent .
That was Wall Street exclaiming , Hooray .
As Robert Cihra , an analyst with Fulcrum Global Partners told Money magazine , “ The stock is up a bit on the fact that nobody liked Carly ’s leadership all that much .
The Street had lost all faith in her and the market ’s hope is that anyone will be better . ”
A Business Week post - mortem noted ,
Management experts say Fiorina , through the Compaq acquisition , created a good executive team with a can - do attitude .
That helped a rank - and - file , engineering - focused organization consider how to market products instead of simply making them .
But the charismatic leader refused to delegate operations to top lieutenants managing HP ’s far - flung divisions .
What ’s more , she had a tough time getting them to work together … .
As a result , many of the execs who came to HP through Compaq have jumped ship since the merger .
That left Fiorina with much the same slate of HP ’ers who were in key positions before the blockbuster deal .
Larry Magid , technology analyst for CBS News , observed ,
There is plenty to criticize about Fiorina ’s tenure at HP .
At this point , the changes that Fiorina made did n’t turn out so well for the thousands of Hewlett - Packard and Compaq employees that were laid off and the millions of HP stockholders who lost equity since she took over .
HP stock is worth less today than it was in 1999 .
Dell and IBM stock has increased in value .
But Fiorina did fine for herself .
She departed the company with a $ 21 million severance package .
“ I doubt very much that she ’s worried about making ends meet , ” Magid cracked .
In her 2006 book , Tough Choices , Fiorina defended her management of HP and claimed the firm ’s subsequent successes were a result of changes she had implemented .
But it had been a rocky tenure at best .
Nevertheless , McCain is deploying Fiorina as a surrogate on economic policy and as an ambassador to women voters .
But in this time of economic insecurity , there ’s not much about Fiorina ’s time at HP that can be reassuring to voters ( female or otherwise ) experiencing financial jitters .
After six years at Hewlett - Packard , she ended up symbolizing not one but at least three corporate excesses : outsourcing , M&A-mania , and golden parachutes .
Workers and shareholders did not prosper during her reign , but Fiorina made millions , got a book deal , and now is a top PowerPointer for a presidential candidate .
She ’s a real American success story — for corporate Republicans .

REPORT from SF BAY World Ca n’t Wait
July 18 , 2008
BERKELEY CA : On June 21 , 2008 , World Ca n’t Wait and others mobilized once again at the Marine Recruiting Station ( MRS ) - this time , because the rightwing pro-war biker - based “ Gathering of Eagles ” ( GOE ) had announced a media event to show how much they Support the Troops .
Their star attraction was rightwing talk radio screecher Melanie Morgan .
Morgan and the GOE came onto the scene as defenders of the Marine recruiters and the war through last February ’s “ Battle of Berkeley . ” 
They ’ve demanded that Berkeley “ apologize ” for calling for the recruiters to get out of town .
A few of us began the day at 5:15 a.m .
The nominally anti-war City of Berkeley had police already guarding the MRS as the sun rose on three CodePINK women chalking the sidewalk with anti-war slogans .
Soon , sixteen more officers arrived carrying riot gear .
( This was not a surprise ; the Berkeley Police Department hyperventilates whenever WCW is coming . )
By 8:30 , WCW members were waiting for the GOE , whose publicity claimed 500 bikers would soon arrive to support the recruiters .
It was surprisingly quiet , but you could feel the tension , anticipation and excitement as more activists with signs , banners and serious orange began to gather .
Other groups joining us were Revolution Club , 911 Truth , CodePINK and A.N.S.W.E.R. Coalition , and all day other folks showed up too .
For the next five hours , together we succeeded in standing against the war and the recruitment of our youth .
( The 24 - hour live camera installed by FOX News on a building across the street was presumably streaming all this live . )
Imagine what it would mean if in Berkeley of all places , pro-war “ love it or leave it ”  bikers could belligerently demonstrate SUPPORTING THE WAR without any resistance .
These right - wing foot - soldiers for the empire ( and that is the job they are doing , whether individuals in GOE intend to or not ) really mean it : no city can be allowed to stand up against the war or the recruiters who serve it .
Think about what it would mean to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan ( and now Iran too ! ) if Berkeley were to “ apologize . ” 
Not only can we NOT apologize , we ’ve got to build even stronger resistance .
( In fact a local Iranian merchant has recently come to take photos of our MRS protests to post on Iranian websites .
He ’s told us with great emotion that right now our actions mean a great deal to people in Iran . )
The two - sided confrontation lasted for hours .
GOE had a permit so they had the sidewalk and doorway of the MRS , and a big sound system .
But instead of staying across the street , WCW took our chants , signs , and our bold understanding of the real truth of this war and these recruiters “ “ and we went right into their midst .
All morning our chanting was interspersed with constant face - to - face conversation : our all - ages , very orange crew challenging the GOE ’s older and very red - white - and - blue crew .
The GOE never numbered over 100 “ “ including their people who stayed safely across the street under the FOX surveillance camera , waving American and Marine Corps flags , and constantly filming us .
Our numbers were less than theirs , but we were able to have considerable interaction .
Many confrontations that nearly got out of hand were expertly handled by WCW activists to avoid violence .
There were a few incidents , like when a biker bully intimidated a youth and then hit him — while Berkeley police stood by and watched , doing nothing .
Protesters gathered round and with our show of our numbers , we sent the bully on his way screaming and screeching .
When questioned about why they just stood watching as the biker attacked the youth , an officer explained “ That ’s not what we ’re here for . ” 
( A complaint is being filed . )
In fact the police only roused themselves when the PRO - war people complained that somehow our chants and verbal challenges made them feel “ threatened , ”  which shows why the police were there : to protect the message of Melanie Morgan and her band of warmongers .
( And no , the mainstream local media did not cover the fact that our counter - demonstration effectively prevented the entire GOE media stunt from coming off as planned ) .
Well , it ’s obvious why right - wing political assaults like the GOE invading downtown Berkeley have to be countered .
But it ’s also true that we ourselves can learn something from close - up encounters like this .
We realize that the leaders of groups like GOE are n’t particularly interested in rational political dialogue , or in real facts about how destructive and wrong the U.S. ’s endless war on the world is for the people of the world .
Melanie Morgan is a political operative , a tiny cog in a whole network of right - wing and neo - fascist elements connecting forces like the Horowitzers and Young Republicans , right - wing talk radio , and anti-immigrant vigilantes .
However , some of the vets and others who are at this moment part of that camp are not without their own contradictions
The WCW Call says “ ” ¦we speak for the majority , here and around the world , and as we get this going we are going to reach out to the people who have been so badly fooled by Bush ” ¦ ” 
Some of these “ badly fooled ”  people were right there at the MRS .
A lot of the GOE are ( or say they are ) military vets .
We got into debates about American history , about what happens when America goes to war , about what the real world is really like , about the “ official truths ”  that go with those wars “ “ Iraq had no WMDs , Vietnamese villages had to be destroyed to save them , America wages wars to protect freedom and democracy .
Some GOEs were willing to argue .
Others were n’t .
We told people if they did n’t believe us they could go online and check out the Winter Soldier hearings .
Some of the GOE men got very enraged at seeing our mixed - nationality crew , and to those in our group who are n’t white , they ’d spit in our faces : “ Where are you from ?
Where are you from ? ” 
We ’d say , “ I ’m from the world , what about you ? ” 
The GOE side included some Latinos , and a few Native Americans and African Americans too .
Some of these people were hearing and watching us as we ’d argue right back , asking these men why they think living in the U.S. makes them more special than other people .
There were women in the GOE , too .
A lot of times it was hard to get the conversation past the level of them just insulting us or yelling how we the protestors are wrong because people have to support the troops .
But we persisted .
There were not any youth in their group , however .
One Latino biker was especially belligerent and loud , and one of us started arguing with him in Spanish .
After a while , another WCW guy came up to the guy ’s buddies and asked them if they thought America should be an English - only country ?
Their unanimous reply , of course : “ HELL YEAH ! ” 
So he walked back over and interrupted : “ Hey man , your buddies over here do n’t think you should be speaking Spanish ! ” 
We wish a camera had captured the look on this biker ’s face as he tried to process that while continuing to argue ( although now in English ! ) how America is the best country in the world , but casting uneasy glances at his “ friends . ” 
Some of the GOE wear Confederate flag patches .
We started lots of conversations by demanding to know how anyone today could uphold slavery .
Usually the guys wearing the Confederate flag were n’t going to listen , but it was crowded and lots of people could hear .
And it was n’t only Black people in the GOE crew whose bravado fell a few notches as we hammered on our questions : “ Are you sorry the South lost the Civil War ?
How far back do you want to go ?
Back to segregation ?
Back to lynching ?
Back to slavery ?
How far ? ” 
We tried to avoid name - calling , and we tried to keep our agitation , chants , and arguments focussed on the real world : ( “ One million Iraqis dead “ “ is THAT what you support ? ” 
“ ¦ “ Murder , rape , torture , war “ “ that ’s what they ’re recruiting for ! ”  “ ¦ “ Fallujah , Haditha , Guantanamo Bay !
This is the truth the recruiters do n’t say ! ” )
We kept sticking to the actual facts of history and the present , and demanding the GOEs defend the wars and torture as good for the majority of people in the world ; we kept insisting people say these things are good or bad .
We listened to their arguments , and then we ’d expose why they were wrong .
But beyond any single fact , we also came back time and again to why it ’s so wrong for people living in this country to think the lives of Americans are more important than other people ’s lives .
As the morning went on , some of the GOE people retreated from more debate with us ; they kept running out of arguments long before we did .
And others started telling us that they ’re vets , or patriots , or loyal Americans , and ” ¦.
“ I actually DON ’T support the war ” ¦ [ or sometimes , “ I hate George Bush ” ¦ ”  ] , but we HAVE TO support the troops ! ” 
Melanie Morgan showed up eventually .
Her rah - rah - America - Number - One speech was hard to hear because someone “ “ a lot of someones “ “ let the voices of the Iraqi and Afghani people be heard .
We had on display lots of photos and color displays of the war crimes we ’re trying to stop .
Now we crowded in around the speaker area and there was much screaming , and sirens , filling the air with what this war actually sounds like .
Morgan ended her speech and then introduced GOE ’s climax : recorded “ patriotic music . ” 
First she “ dedicated this song to World Ca n’t Wait ”  — and played Taps .
We yelled , “ Are you mourning the million Iraqi people killed in this war based on lies ? ” 
As she left the stage , we could not believe our ears as the chords crescendoed into — the Battle Hymn of the Republic .
We started right in agitating over the music : “ Wrong song !
Wrong side !
Do you know the lyrics ?
Do n’t you know American history ?
Do you realize who John Brown was ?
That song is about the abolitionists !
It ’s against slavery !
This song supports everything you ’d have been against !
You ’d better stop playing it right now !
You ’ll get confused ! ” 
From their expressions , at least some of the GOEs found this information new and shocking .
Soon afterward , they turned off their music , said it was lunchtime , and repeated their big announcement about reversing their previous boycott of Berkeley businesses .
Instead , every GOE protestor would now go buy lunch and gas for their hogs , especially patronizing all the businesses who now display pro-war window signs ( they named all three , to big cheers ) .
And to show their power , today the GOE was going to spend only $ 2 bills , so Berkeley merchants could see how much their livelihoods are threatened if they do n’t hurry to apologize , stop opposing the war , and start supporting the troops .
With this terrible threat , the GOE mounted up , gunned their motors , and rode off .
We ourselves circled up for a closing rally .
People talked about why we had come out today , how we will continue , and what difference we are determined to make by continuing .
The pro-war bikers come around once in a while .
The military recruiters are preying on our youth every day .
And WCW has plans to gear up all summer long so that by September especially the high school youth are ready to not only join into more protests , but spread this resistance throughout this community and this whole Bay Area .
Recruiters out !
Stop the War !
This is worth everyone fighting for .
Most people recognize MediaDefender for their clumsy anti-piracy efforts , but there is much more to them than that .
In fact , they are warming up advertisers and record labels to use LimeWire and other file - sharing software to distribute millions of legitimate , but branded , MP3s .
MediaDefender has been experimenting with P2P marketing for quite some time now .
Last year , it earned the company $ 560,000 and they hope to increase this figure in 2008 .
This new revenue stream is very welcome for them , since their anti-piracy operations are n’t as profitable as they used to be .
P2P marketing is a win-win situation according to MediaDefender , both advertisers and filesharers will benefit .
It gives the advertiser “ access to passionate fans of any choosing ” and filesharers “ … get what they wantâ€ ¦ free content with unique and compelling offerings that fit their personal tastes . ”
But wait a second , what a strange world we are living in .
A few months ago , Jammie Thomas lost her court case , and was ordered to pay the RIAA hundreds and thousands of dollars because she shared a few songs , and now the same record labels use filesharing networks to distribute their branded MP3s .
Similarly , the IFPI is trying to educate kids and parents about the great dangers of filesharing , while the record companies they represent hire MediaDefender to distribute authorized content on LimeWire and other P2P networks .
So , on the one hand record labels are going after people who distribute their files online , and at the same time they spam these networks with authorized copies .
Strangely enough , there is no way for the filesharer to make sure whether a file is authorized or not .
I ’m not a lawyer of course , but this double standard must have some legal implications .
MediaDefender is even hosting a branded copy of Kayne West ’s ‘ stronger ’ on their own servers , and I assume they would n’t be infringing copyright .
Of course we asked MediaDefender to shed their light on some of these questions , but unfortunately , they did not respond to our inquiries .
Probably too busy spoofing or DDoS - ing random BitTorrent trackers .

Oh god .
There is no hope .
The other day I glanced at the web site of the Lake Chapala Society , a social club of sorts for expats around Mexico ’s Lake Chapala , an hour south of Guadalajara ( where I live ) .
Clicking on  Safety ,  I found a long list of reasons why you should never , ever use a firearm to protect your home and family .
No .
See , you might miss , or be scared , or the intruders might take it away and shoot you , and they might be all mad and hurt you when all they wanted was your television .
No , the best thing is to let them do what they want , and then maybe they wo n’t do anything bad to you .
This supposedly was written by a retired cop but , if so , he ( or quite possible she , judging by the tone ) does n’t sound like any cop I have known , which is whole lots .
Anyway , his , her , or its advice , is  Leave the guns to people who are trained and prepared to use them . 
Which he says he is .
Nuts .
To begin with , cops usually know little about guns .
They get a bit of training in the police academy , and then once or twice a year go to the range to fire a couple of magazines .
Being actually good with a pistol requires putting tens of thousands of rounds downrange .
Street shooting , which is what cops do in the unlikely event that they do any shooting at all , requires training of the sort offered by IPSC or , years back , Jeff Cooper and Chuck Taylor .
A few cops will learn on their own .
When I went to shoot at the NRA range on Waples Mill Road in northern Virginia , I saw an occasional dedicated cop .
But police departments do n’t engage in real training because it costs a lot , takes a lot of time , and just is n’t worth it .
The average cop never fires his weapon in line of duty .
It serves chiefly as a badge of authority .
Smith ( I ’ll call him or her ) implies further that no one who is n’t a cop knows how to use a pistol .
He needs to get out more .
In the small - town South of my boyhood , everybody had guns .
We used them for hunting , for shooting varmints , and for plinking .
My father gave me my first rifle when I was eleven in Athens , Alabama .
In high school in Virginia , the first day of deer season was a school holiday because the teachers knew the boys would all be in the woods .
When I was fifteen , friends and I often went to the dump in Colonial Beach at night to snap - shoot rats .
I later went to a federal fire - arms school at Parris Island in South Carolina .
You may have heard of it .
So did hundreds of thousands of other kids .
The emphasis was on deadly force .
At Camp Lejeune we did fire - and - maneuver with live ammo .
( Also flamethrowers and 3.5 " rocket launchers , though I do not recommend these for home defense . )
If Smith were to check the number of men who have gone through the Army or Marines , he would find that very large numbers of people have had training in the use of firearms .
But what I dislike most about Smith ’s advice is his advocacy of helpless passivity .
It embodies a profound change in American attitudes , which once favored self - reliance .
Now it ’s reliance on the group .
Do n’t take primary responsibility for your defense .
No , that would be violent , or scary , or macho , and all .
No , let the criminals do whatever they want with you , rely on their merciful natures , and call 911 if you survive .
This is exactly what Smith advocates .
If I were a criminal , I would love this guy .
His advice is bad .
He says , correctly enough , that most intruders want chiefly to steal things .
Think a little .
At two a.m. , you hear a noise and turn on the lights .
You find two guys with knives .
You can now identify them .
They have knives .
Focus on this point .
Knives , and you can identify them .
Do you see where this leads ?
If they leave you alive , you will call the cops immediately after they leave .
They know this .
If they tie you up , well , you are tied up in the presence of two career criminals with knives .
This may work for Smith , but I ’ll pass .
It just is n’t optimal .
If they leave you conscious and tied , you will begin shrieking for the neighbors as soon as they leave .
The neighbors will call the cops — and you can identify the intruders .
In the real world , criminals are not always interested only in your television .
They will accept such side benefits as offer .
This engenders fascinating situations .
They discover your daughter of sixteen in her bedroom .
 Hey , little girl , you ’re real cute .
Let ’s get a better look .
Take those pajamas off .
You get to watch .
They may or may not choose to leave witnesses .
If you think these things do n’t happen , regularly , you have never been a policeman in a big city .
A friend of mine , a Chicago cop , tells of arriving at the scene of a break - in .
The intruders had beaten the man unconscious and , among other things they did to her , bitten the woman ’s nipples off .
Literally .
I remember going one night to a hospital with a DC cop to interview a rape victim of fifteen .
She was screaming , sobbing , choking , the doctors trying to sedate her .
Messed up for life .
Smith is right :
Do n’t have a firearm in the house .
It might make them mad .
They just want your TV , see .
In Virginia to get a concealed - carry permit , you attend a mandatory class on how to use a pistol .
One of the instructors when I did it was a ( very competent ) female agent of the FBI .
She talked to the class , some of whom were women , about rape .
She made the obvious point that very few women have the slightest chance of fending off a two - hundred pound deviate perhaps armed with a knife .
A small concealed - hammer revolver , fired maybe through a coat pocket , can easily be handled by a woman of ninety pounds .
Studies show that a rapist who has been shot several times loses ardor .
We ’re talking way beyond Viagra .
What is true of intruders is that they do n’t want a firefight .
When you rack a round into the chamber of a semi-auto , the sound is unmistakable and means only one thing : Someone is preparing to fire .
You have to want a television very badly to go against someone who audibly is planning to kill you and audibly has the means .
You can do as Smith wants — let them do it , whatever it is , and then call a qualified professional .
Or you can shoot the sons of bitches .

The Concordat between the Vatican and the Nazis , Cardinal Secretary of State , Eugenio Pacelli ( later to become Pope Pius XII ) signs the Concordat between Nazi Germany and the Vatican at a formal ceremony in Rome on 20 July 1933 .
Nazi Vice - Chancellor Franz von Papen sits at the left , Pacelli in the middle , and the Rudolf Buttmann sits at the right .
The Concordat effectively legitimized Hitler and the Nazi government to the eyes of Catholicism , Christianity , and the world .

What is the Iranian government up to ?
For once the imperial coalition , overstretched in Iraq and unpopular at home , is proposing jaw , not war .
The UN security council 's offer was a good one : if Iran suspended its uranium enrichment programme , it would be entitled to legally guaranteed supplies of fuel for nuclear power , assistance in building a light water reactor , foreign aid , technology transfer and the beginning of the end of economic sanctions .
The US seems prepared , for the first time since the revolution , to open a diplomatic office in Tehran .
But in Geneva , 10 days ago , the Iranians filibustered until the negotiations ended .
On Saturday President Ahmadinejad announced that Iran has now doubled the number of centrifuges it uses to enrich uranium .
A fourth round of sanctions looks inevitable .
The unequivocal statements Barack Obama and Gordon Brown made in Israel last week about Iran 's nuclear weapons programme cannot yet be justified .
Nor can the unequivocal statements by some anti-war campaigners that Iran does not intend to build the bomb .
Why would a country with such reserves of natural gas and so great a potential for solar power suffer sanctions and the threat of bombing to make fuel it could buy from other states , if it accepted the UN 's terms ?
Those who maintain that Iran 's purposes are peaceful clutch at the National Intelligence Estimate published by the US government in November .
While it judged that Iran had halted its nuclear weapons programme in 2003 , it saw the country 's civilian uranium programme as a means of developing " technical capabilities that could be applied to producing nuclear weapons , if a decision is made to do so " .
The latest report from the International Atomic Energy Agency notes that no fissile material has been diverted from Iran 's stocks , but raises grave questions about some of the documents it has found , which suggest research into bomb - making ( Iran says the papers are forgeries ) .
Those of us who oppose an attack on Iran are under no obligation to accept Ahmadinejad 's claims of peaceful intent .
Nor do we have to accept the fictions of our own representatives .
The security council 's offer to Iran claimed that resolving this enrichment issue would help to bring about a " Middle East free of weapons of mass destruction " .
But like every other such document , it made no mention of the principal owner of weapons in the region : Israel .
According to a leaked briefing by the US Defence Intelligence Agency , Israel possesses between 60 and 80 nuclear bombs .
But none of the countries demanding that Iran scraps the weapons it does n't yet possess are demanding that Israel destroys the weapons it does possess .
This subject is the great political taboo .
Neither Brown nor Obama mentioned it last week .
The US intelligence agencies provide a biannual report to Congress on the weapons of mass destruction developed by foreign states , which covers Iran , North Korea , India , Pakistan and others , but not Israel .
During a parliamentary debate in March the British defence minister Bob Ainsworth was asked whether he thought that Israel 's nuclear weapons are " a destabilising factor " in the Middle East .
" My understanding , " he replied , " is that Israel does not acknowledge that it has nuclear weapons . "
Does Mr Ainsworth really buy this nonsense ?
If so , can we have a new minister ?
If Iran builds a bomb , it will do so for one reason : that there is already a nuclear - armed state in the Middle East , by which it feels threatened .
But we make the rules and we break them .
The non-proliferation treaty ( NPT ) obliges the five official nuclear states , of which the UK is one , to work towards " general and complete disarmament " .
On Friday , the Guardian published the notes for a speech made last year by a senior civil servant , which suggested that the decision to replace the UK 's nuclear missiles had already been made , in secret and without parliamentary scrutiny .
Since then defence ministers have told the Commons on five occasions that the decision has not yet been made .
They appear to have misled the House .
At the Geneva conference on disarmament in February , one delegate pointed out that the " chances of eliminating nuclear weapons will be enhanced immeasurably " if non-nuclear states can see " planning , commitment and action toward multilateral nuclear disarmament by nuclear weapon states " like the UK .
If the nuclear states " are failing to fulfil their disarmament obligations " , other nations would use this as an excuse for maintaining their weapons .
Who was this firebrand ?
Des Browne , the secretary of state for defence .
A man of the same name is failing to fulfil our disarmament obligations .
Browne claims that Britain must maintain its arsenal because of proliferation elsewhere , just as those proliferating elsewhere say that they must develop their arsenals because the official nuclear nations are n't disarming .
With the exception of France , none of the other European states feels the need to deploy nukes .
But the UK keeps preparing for the last war .
Of course , no one is refusing to disarm ; it 's just that the task keeps getting pushed into the indefinite future .
Opponents of British nuclear weapons maintain that a new generation of warheads would survive until 2055 .
The permanent members of the UN security council draw a distinction between their " responsible " ownership of nuclear weapons and that of the aspirant powers .
But over the past six years , the UK , US , France and Russia have all announced that they are prepared to use their nukes pre-emptively against a presumed threat , even from states that do not possess nuclear weapons .
In some ways the current nuclear stand - off is more dangerous than the tetchy detente of the cold war .
The danger has been heightened by the US government 's current offensive .
Condoleezza Rice , the secretary of state , is demanding that other countries accept her plans to destroy the last remaining incentive for states to abide by the NPT .
The treaty grants countries which conform to it materials for nuclear power on favourable terms .
It 's a flawed incentive - as the spread of civil nuclear programmes makes the proliferation of military material more likely - but an incentive nonetheless .
Now Rice insists that India should have special access to US nuclear materials despite the fact that it has not signed the NPT and has illegally developed nuclear weapons .
If she is successful , this effort - and the concomitant US demand that India is recognised as an official nuclear power - will blow the NPT to kingdom come .
The treaty which survived the cold war , and which remains the most important of the wilting guarantees against global annihilation , is being nuked for the sake of a few billion dollars of export orders .
Here 's where it gets really depressing .
The Bush administration 's proposal has been supported by both John McCain and Barack Obama .
The contrast between Obama 's position on India and his statements on Iran could not be greater , or more destructive of the inflated hopes now vested in him .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's insistence that Iran enriches its own fissile material , and the guessing game he is playing with Israel , the atomic energy agency and the UN security council is irresponsible and staggeringly dangerous .
But if I were in his position I might be tempted to do the same .

The B3 burrito , Saharas NASCAR Cafe , Las Vegas , NV
Contributed by :
One for the history books , the NASCAR Cafe in Las Vegas Nevada used to have a 6 pound burrito challenge .
Over 4000 tried , with only 42 completing the challenge in less than 90 minutes .
While one burrito challenge dies , surely there must be another somewhere to take its place ?
From : http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2009/jun/26/burrito-enters-bouts-eaters-heavy-favorite/
When the burrito leaves the kitchen , its announced over a public address system like a train arriving at a station or a boxer entering a ring .
The fight is between the burrito and the guy who thinks he can take it down .
If the burrito wins , it costs $ 20 .
If you win , the burrito is free and you get a lifetime pass on the Saharas roller coaster .
And probably a car to yourself when you ride it .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Jesse Helms , a die - hard anti-communist firebrand who championed a wide range of conservative causes in his 30 years in the U.S. Senate , died early on Friday , aged 86 , his foundation said .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
A blunt - talking product of the Old South , the lawmaker from North Carolina was known as “ Senator No ” for opposing just about anything that obstructed his conservative view of the world .
He retired in 2003 after five terms in the Senate .
Helms died at 1:15 a.m. in Raleigh , North Carolina , according to a notice on the Web site of the Jesse Helms Center , a foundation established to promote his legacy .
“ Laura and I are deeply saddened by the passing of our good friend and a great American , ” President George W. Bush said in a statement .
“ Jesse Helms was a kind , decent , and humble man and a passionate defender of what he called ‘ the Miracle of America . ’ ”
The one - time radio commentator turned congressional power broker pursued an ideological agenda that was anti-communist , anti-liberal , anti-gay and anti-affirmative action .
He also held a deep distrust of international organizations and many foreign governments .
“ He was one of the giants of the ‘ 80s and ‘90s in the United States Senate , ” former Republican Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi told Fox News .
For years ,
Helms played a key role in U.S. foreign policy as chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee , embracing a strong U.S. national defense and what he regarded as a moral foreign policy .
This made the Republican curmudgeon a hero to fellow American conservatives , yet a villain at home and abroad to those who saw him as a symbol of U.S. isolationism and a foe of social progress .
His name became synonymous with social conservatism .
FOREIGN POLICY HAWK
The Heritage Foundation , a conservative research group , said the defeat of Soviet communism and the rise of the late President Ronald Reagan would not have happened without Helms ’ “ intrepid leadership at decisive times . ”
Helms served as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee while Republicans controlled the Senate from 1995 to 2001 .
But no matter which party had control , Helms was a force in Congress , even when failing health forced him to travel the halls on a motorized scooter .
“ Under his leadership , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was a powerful force for freedom , ” Bush said .
“ And today , from Central America to Central Europe and beyond , people remember : in the dark days when the forces of tyranny seemed on the rise , Jesse Helms took their side . ”
In his 2005 memoir “ Here ’s Where I Stand , ” Helms explained he had embraced the “ Doctor No ” nickname .
“ It was n’t meant as a compliment , but I certainly took it as one .
There was plenty to stand up and say ‘ No ! ’ to during my first term in the U.S. Senate , ” he wrote .
His battles with the United Nations led to a 1999 deal to repay U.S. debts to the world body in return for U.N. reforms and he co-sponsored legislation that invoked economic sanctions to punish foreign businesses that invested in Cuba .
In March 2002 , Helms made headlines and won praise from some former critics when he expressed regret for being a latecomer to the global fight against AIDS and vowed to press for more money to combat the disease in his final tour of Capitol Hill .
You can't see the text of the proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) because it 's being drafted in secret , but it 's not so secret that the RIAA does n't get to submit its own wishlist to the government .
Knowledge Ecology International , an NGO that works on trade and public knowledge , published the alleged list ( hat tip to Michael Geist ) late last week .
I hope you like mandatory ISP filtering .
Filters are n't just for faucets
ACTA architect , USTR Susan Schwab
William Patry , Google 's top copyright lawyer , wrote recently about news from several sources that indicated such ISP filtering language was making its way into the text of the treaty .
The RIAA certainly hopes so , asking the government to require " Internet service providers and other intermediaries to employ readily available measures to inhibit infringement in instances where both legitimate and illegitimate uses were facilitated by their services , including filtering out infringing materials , provided that such measures are not unduly burdensome and do not materially affect the cost or efficiency of delivering legitimate services . "
Of course , " repeat infringers " should also have their Internet connections cut off , and ISP liability ( both direct and secondary ) would be increased , and any " deeplinking " to infringing content could incur liability .
That last provision should go over really well with search engines .
The RIAA 's points , taken in tandem , seem aimed at gutting the best part of the DMCA ( yes , it was n't all bad ) , the " safe harbor " rules that gave ISPs immunity from material passing through their networks .
In the RIAA 's world , ISPs would themselves become filters and enforcers , cutting off users and immediately removing access to material based simply on a phone call .
In addition , P2P use would be generally banned on government computers .
Lock up the polycarbonate
It 's not just Internet users and ISPs that would feel the heat , though ; traditional CD stampers are still targets .
The RIAA suggests that countries " with high rates of production of pirated optical discs " be required to institute a licensing system that would control both the manufacture and export of discs — even supplies of optical grade polycarbonate would be restricted .
Replicators around the world would also be required to " maintain complete and accurate records " so that rightsholders could figure out who ordered a batch of infringing discs , and unique ID codes would need to stamped into each disc for easier tracking .
Do n't ask , do n't tell
As we 've noted in our past ACTA coverage , the hysteria over " iPod- searching border guards " seems largely misplaced .
The real rightsholder concerns here are to crack down on big pirate stamping operations on the one hand , and Internet P2P use on the other .
Unfortunately , while rightsholders appear to have access to government treaty - makers , the public has been largely excluded from the process so far .
That might be less important when trade deals are really of concern only to specific industries , but the Internet , it 's fair to say , has broader applications than swapping copyrighted songs .
Is it really too much ask that the billions of users this might affect get a say in the treaty before it emerges full - grown into the light of day ?
Tonight I noticed this image go by on Reddit .
It accompanies this Wikipedia article on the age of consent .
I noticed something interesting .
There seems to be a strong correlation between a young age of consent ( 12 to 15 years old ) and Catholic countries .
I created this little graphic to illustrate .
This image shows the age of consent .
The blue countries have an age of consent between 12 to 15 ( disgustingly , the age of consent in Yemen is nine , but forgo that for this experiment ) .
Hover your mouse over the image .
It should switch to a shrunken version of this image , which shows various flavours of Christianity by colour .
The Catholic countries are yellow .
What ’s the cause of this correlation ?

WHEN writing about litigious issues , big British newspapers favour phrases such as “ he strenuously denies all wrong - doing ” ( possible translation : has no convincing explanation of his behaviour ) ; “ has failed to dispel speculation that ... ” ( was scandalously involved in ) , as well as words like “ controversial ” ( outrageous ) and “ murky ” ( corrupt ) .
Such expensively lawyered prose helps present a semblance of balance that usually protects editors against the severity of English libel law .
A good lawyer might in any event have cautioned the Kyiv Post , an English - language newspaper in the Ukrainian capital , not to headline a column about municipal property deals with “ Appalling Kyiv City Council Land Grab ” .
And he would certainly have demanded a thorough fact check before drawing a comparison with tactics used in other dealings by Rinat Akhmetov , one of the richest men in the country .
That would have been wise , for Mr Akhmetov reacted to errors in the article by suing the paper not in Ukraine but in London , using the city 's most fearsome defamation lawyers , Schillings .
The paper published an apology on February 21st .
To many people , the striking aspect of this was not its effect on Mr Akhmetov 's standing but the fact that a Ukrainian tycoon was suing a Ukrainian paper ( owned by an American ) in London .
Even the Kyiv Post 's 100 subscribers in Britain give an English court the right to hear the case .
That followed a similar judgment last year against Rachel Ehrenfeld , a New York - based American author who has written about the support of some Saudis for Islamist terrorism .
She was successfully sued in London by a Saudi for a book she had published in America that had sold only a handful of copies in Britain .
Even more striking was a second victory won by Mr Akhmetov earlier this year , against Obozrevatel ( Observer ) , an internet news site that does not even publish in English .
Like Ms Ehrenfeld , the defendants did not appear in court and judgment was entered against them in default .
Damages will be set in a compensation hearing later this year .
Schillings declined to comment , but a statement on its website reads : “ By seeking redress in the courts of England , Mr Akhmetov will ensure that there will be a fair legal process . ”
Perhaps .
But for those used to the defence of free speech entrenched in America 's First Amendment , English law seems anything but fair .
It is not just that defending a libel action costs the equivalent of $ 200,000 - plus up front , and much more if you lose .
The plaintiff has to prove only that a statement was defamatory ; it is up to the defendant to justify it , usually on grounds of truth or fairness .
The growing use of English courts by foreign litigants is arousing increasing concern among free - speech campaigners such as Chris Walker of Freedom House , an American lobby group .
He terms it “ manna from heaven for deeply illiberal and fantastically wealthy ex-Soviet oligarchs and Middle - Eastern oil tycoons .
Everyone knows the potency of the English laws and everyone takes it into account , at an incalculable cost to free speech . ”
Yet given the reputation of English courts , and long - standing rules in other countries about recognition of their judgments , it is hard to find a legal counter - attack .
In response to the Ehrenfeld case , the state of New York last month passed the “ Libel Terrorism Protection Act ” , which explicitly protects residents ' assets against foreign defamation judgments .
But that is little comfort to other Americans and is likely to face legal challenges .
Some English judges have been worrying privately about the potential for abuse , and foreign litigants in future may face tougher scrutiny , particularly in actions against publishers with little presence in Britain .
But litigants are also becoming more sophisticated .
When a British tabloid , the News of the World , published a story about Max Mosley , a motor - racing administrator , he turned ( unsuccessfully as it happened ) to a court in France , which has strict privacy laws , to make the paper remove from its website a video which purported to show him engaged in sado - masochistic sex acts .
Mark Stephens , a London lawyer , says “ libel tourism ” is giving way to “ libel and privacy cruises ” , where people are seeking the most favourable jurisdiction they can find .
Courts further afield may be even harsher and less predictable .
Time magazine is appealing against a recent Indonesian Supreme Court judgment that ordered it to pay one trillion rupiah ( $ 100 m - plus ) to the family of the late President Suharto , whom it accused of corruption in 1999 .
( This newspaper is one of a score of amici curiae petitioning for review of the verdict . )
In English law , dead men can't sue .
But ( to be safe ) : Mr Suharto vehemently protested his innocence .
Joe Klein wonders why American blood and treasure is being expended over which Shiite group controls which town in Iraq : " Perhaps it is that Sadr 's Mahdi Army is the most potent force opposed to long - term U.S. bases in Iraq — and that a permanent presence has been the Bush Administration 's true goal in this war .
I suspect the central question in Iraq now is not whether things will get better but whether the drive for a long - term , neocolonialist presence will make the situation irretrievably worse . "
One should n't , however , underplay the extent to which the Bush administration may have no real motive at all .
When you 're establishing an indirect rule relationship with a local proxy like Maliki and his regime , you risk circumstances in which the tail wags the dog .
We like Maliki because we have " influence " over him .
To retain that influence , we need to be useful to him .
He wanted to fight Sadr , but could n't take him down alone , so our troops had to fight , too .
His fights are now our fights , even if his fights do n't really have anything to do with our interests .

We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Three decades ago , during an earlier energy crisis , Ronald Reagan strode into an Atlanta hotel for a political meeting .
As he approached the auditorium , someone asked :
" Governor Reagan , as a conservative , do n't you think the 55 miles - per - hour speed limit imposed by the government to save gas is a violation of our freedom ? "
In his amiable manner , Reagan chuckled quietly and , as I recall , he replied something like this :
" Well , that could be .
But , speaking just personally , I think it 's not a bad thing if we all slow down just a bit and enjoy the scenery a little more . "
We could all use that kind of common sense today as gas rises past $ 4 .
Many ideas are being put forth to ameliorate an energy - price crisis that threatens job security and economic growth in the United States .
Famous oilman T. Boone Pickens wants to build huge turbines all over the Midwest to harness wind energy .
Many members of Congress want to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) where – at today 's prices – there is probably $ 1 trillion worth of oil waiting to be pumped .
In California , moves are afoot to make the state the renewable energy capital of the nation .
But – and there always seems to be a " but " – all of those ideas take time .
Five years to build substantial wind farms .
Ten years to tap Arctic oil .
Meanwhile , The Wall Street Journal has published predictions that a barrel of oil could reach $ 200 as soon as the end of this year .
If that happens , gasoline would hit $ 6 a gallon .
Woe is us .
Or maybe not .
Instead , the time may be ripe for individual citizen action – like the Minutemen of 1775 .
After all , is n't that how we got this great country started 233 years ago ?
There are two steps we can take right away that could have greater impact than oil from the Arctic .
They are so simple and straightforward that they are seldom mentioned .
But Americans took these steps during World War II , and they worked .
First , drive slower .
Second , drive less .
The savings of gasoline from these two steps would be phenomenal .
( More on that in a moment . )
During World War II , Congress and President Franklin Roosevelt mandated a nationwide 35 m.p.h. speed limit .
At that time , 35 m.p.h. was the most efficient speed for autos .
Even more important , it helped preserve automobile tires , which was crucial because Japan had cut off American access to natural rubber from Southeast Asia .
Today , 35 m.p.h. is no longer the best speed for autos with their sleek designs and advanced transmissions .
Newer vehicles generally get the highest gas mileage somewhere between 45 and 55 m.p.h. , says David L. Greene of the National Transportation Research Center at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Knoxville , Tenn .
The main force reducing mileage is air drag , says Dr. Greene .
The faster you go , the greater the drag .
Drag forces increase exponentially , so doubling your speed from 40 to 80 increases drag fourfold .
It makes a huge difference , for at 80 m.p.h. your car pushes against wind with the force of a hurricane .
Consumer Reports tested the effect of higher speeds on gas mileage .
David Champion , director of auto testing , found that boosting the highway speed of a 2006 Toyota Camry cut gasoline mileage dramatically :
• 55 m.p.h. – 40.3 miles per gallon
•65 m.p.h. – 34.9 miles per gallon
• 75 m.p.h. – 29.8 miles per gallon
On a hypothetical 1,900 - mile round trip from New York City to Disney World in Florida , the Camry would use 47 gallons of gas at 55 m.p.h..
But at 75 m.p.h. , it would burn nearly 64 gallons – a $ 70 difference .
Ideally , if we all bought 45 m.p.g .
Toyota Prius hybrids , US gasoline use would drop in half , from 9.3 million barrels per day , to under 5 million barrels a day .
Of course , that wo n't happen .
So a practical and immediate response would be not only to drive slower , but also drive less .
Government made that happen in World War II by limiting most drivers to four gallons of gas per week .
That 's unlikely now .
But consider this :
If everyone could reduce their driving by just 10 percent , the savings would total nearly 1 million barrels of gasoline every day .
How much is that ?
Well , it amounts to about half our daily oil imports from Saudi Arabia .
It also would be equal to the highest expected production of oil if we drill in ANWR .
And we can do it today .
Mr. Pickens notes that America will spend $ 10 trillion in the next 10 years on imported oil .
US wealth is draining fast overseas .
But as individuals , we can turn this around .
Today .
Do n't wait for Barack Obama , or John McCain , or some whiz kid in Silicon Valley to solve this problem .
None of them can do it quick enough .
It 's up to us .
Save gas , and win this fight .

Obama says Republicans trying to scare voters Associated Press
Published : Thursday July 31 , 2008
Print This Email This SPRINGFIELD , Mo. - Democrat Barack Obama , the first black candidate with a shot at winning the White House , says John McCain and his Republican allies will try to scare them by saying Obama " does n't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills . "
Obama did n't make clear what distinctions McCain was likely to raise regarding the presidents on U.S. currency , men who are white and , for the most part , much older than Obama when they were elected .
McCain has not raised Obama 's race as an issue in the campaign , though he has said that Obama lacks experience .
Stumping in an economically challenged battleground state , Obama argued Wednesday that President Bush and McCain will resort to scare tactics to maintain their hold on the White House because they have little else to offer voters .
" Nobody thinks that Bush and McCain have a real answer to the challenges we face .
So what they 're going to try to do is make you scared of me , " Obama said .
" You know , he 's not patriotic enough , he 's got a funny name , you know , he does n't look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills . "
Asked Thursday if Obama was referring to race , Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said , " No . " " What Barack Obama was talking about was that he did n't get here after spending decades in Washington , " Gibbs said .
During a round of appearances in Missouri , Obama worked to link McCain to the unpopular Bush , saying the Republican senator from Arizona would serve the equivalent of a third Bush term if elected .
He said the country can't afford more of the same and expects different results .
" That 's a definition of madness , but that 's what John McCain is offering .
He 's offering Bush economic policies and Karl Rove politics , " Obama said .
He pressed the theme later at a rain - soaked barbecue in Union , Mo . " They 're going to say I 'm a risky guy , " Obama said .
" What they 're going to argue is I 'm too risky .
The real risk is that we miss the moment , that we do not do what 's needed because we 're afraid . "
For its part , McCain 's campaign on Wednesday released a withering television ad comparing Obama to Britney Spears and Paris Hilton , suggesting the Democrat is little more than a vapid but widely recognized media concoction .
" He 's the biggest celebrity in the world , but is he ready to lead ? " the voiceover asks in the ad , which mixes images of Obama on his trip to Europe last week with video of the 20 - something pop stars .
Obama 's campaign quickly responded with a commercial of its own , dismissing McCain 's complaints as " baloney " and " baseless . "
Throughout the day , Obama argued that McCain " thinks we 're on the right track , " drawing boos from his audiences .
" These anxieties seem to be growing with each passing day , " Obama said .
" We can either choose a new direction for our economy or we can keep doing what we 've been doing .
My opponent , John McCain , thinks we 're on the right track . "
That elicited boos from some of the 1,500 people who filled a Springfield high school gymnasium .
When an AP - Ipsos poll asked the " right track , wrong track " question this month , 77 percent said they thought the country was on the wrong track .
The same poll set Bush 's approval rating at 28 percent .
Both were records for the AP - Ipsos survey .
" It 's true that change is hard , change is n't easy , " Obama said .
" Nobody here thinks that Bush or McCain has a real answer for the challenges we face so what they 're going to try to do is make you scared about me . "
Obama also compared himself to western legend Wild Bill Hickok , who he said had fought a duel in Springfield .
" I 'm ready to duel John McCain on taxes right here , quick draw , " Obama said , prompting a quick retort from the other side .
" If Barack Obama wants this so - called duel then why did he and his entourage run for the hills when John McCain challenged him to 10 town halls ? "
McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds said .
Obama responded after shaking hands at a restaurant in Lebanon , Mo . " I do n't hear very much positive from Sen. McCain , " he said .
" He seems to be only talking about me .
You need to ask John McCain what he 's for , not just what he 's against . "
Caroline Kennedy is soliciting opinions on potential vice president picks for Obama .
Caroline is the reluctant operative
The question bounced around the Internet and tumbled from the lips of Washington insiders :
Why would Barack Obama choose Caroline Kennedy , a reluctant public figure with little affection for modern politics , to vet the next Democratic vice presidential candidate ?
A month into the search , as one of two remaining members of the search team , Kennedy is emerging as an active participant , slipping largely unnoticed around Capitol Hill for private meetings and exercising the kind of discretion that made her an appealing choice in the first place .
Despite initial skepticism in some quarters that her appointment was window dressing , associates and at least one member of Congress who met with Kennedy describe her as an engaged and savvy operative .

Consider these scenes last month at Democratic National Committee headquarters .
Shortly after Obama finished his meeting two weeks ago with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus , Kennedy slipped out the back door of the office and moved unseen past a knot of TV camera crews loading equipment on their trucks .
Wearing sensible silver flats and clutching a folder in one hand , Kennedy escaped onto Independence Avenue to hail a cab with Eric Holder , the other half of the search team .
A week later , as dozens of reporters filtered into a first floor DNC meeting room for a briefing from Obama campaign manager David Plouffe , Kennedy once again eluded most of the gathering media mob .
“ One of the great assets and gifts that Caroline brings to the process is confidentiality and discretion , ” said Paul G. Kirk Jr. , board chairman of the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation and a former Democratic National Committee chairman .
“ She would n’t be sharing what she did with anyone other than her team and her candidate . ”
Indeed , when Obama clinched the nomination , he told reporters to expect to hear nothing from him or his campaign until he introduces his vice presidential pick .
It did n’t quite start out that way , as Holder and James A. Johnson , who was picked to lead the team but later resigned amid questions about his business dealings , attracted a crush of media coverage when they visited the Capitol several days later to consult with members of Congress .
( Kennedy did not participate in those meetings . )
Since then , the process has drawn considerably less attention .
When Sen. Debbie Stabenow ( D - Mich . ) huddled with the team at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee headquarters on June 17 , even one of the senator ’s top communications aides was not clued in on key details .
“ They were discreet meetings , ” the aide said .
Kennedy tapped Rep. Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick , a Michigan Democrat and chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus , for advice .
She did the same with Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - Calif . ) .
Rep . Joe Baca , a California Democrat and chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus , said that when he met with the search team two weeks ago , he found Kennedy doing more of the talking than Holder .
With a soft voice and an unassuming demeanor , Kennedy peppered Baca with questions , asking for opinions on specific candidates and pulling ideas from him about who Obama should choose .
“ I felt connected with her , ” Baca said .
“ You felt like you wanted to have a conversation with her . ”
They asked whether there were any Republicans who Obama should consider , Baca said , suggesting that “ they were open to looking at both sides . ”
“ She is definitely deeply involved , ” Baca said .
“ Her assessment and evaluation and recommendations are going to be considered highly . ”
Kennedy offered her phone number to Baca at the close of the meeting , he said .
The vice presidential search post rounded a months - long conversion from observer to full - bore participant in what Kennedy , 50 , has described on the campaign trail as the most important election since she was a child .
“ She is quite selective about what she chooses to be involved in , ” said John Seigenthaler Sr. , a member of the Profile in Courage award committee at the Kennedy library .
“ For the most part , it is fair to say those interests have focused on the work of the JFK library , but there are other areas where she has not hesitated .
People who have n’t observed her in those roles might be surprised that she was willing to accept it . ”
“ People who have watched her participate in the Kennedy library understand that for her , it is a commitment and it was not something she would take lightly , ” Seigenthaler added .
For years , her public profile was as private as the process she is now helping to administer .
While her late younger brother , John Jr. , entered the media world and occasionally basked in the spotlight , Caroline Kennedy has sought to avoid publicity altogether .
She has raised money for the New York public schools , written and edited several books , and earned a law degree from Columbia University .
But when Kennedy stepped to the microphone at American University in January to publicly endorse Obama , she looked slightly out of her element .
“ Hi , everyone , ” she said shyly to the crowd of thousands .
When they chanted Obama ’s slogan , “ yes we can , ” Kennedy peered down at the podium , setting up a stark contrast with the voice - straining speech from her uncle , Sen. Edward M. Kennedy , that followed .
Five months later , though , Caroline Kennedy would find herself at the center of what Obama has said would be his most important decision before Election Day .
“ I would n’t be surprised that she is taking this on as virtually a full - time assignment , because that is just her way , ” Seigenthaler said .
“ Once she decides that this is something that is important , her commitment will be absolute . ”

RawStory :
Voting along party lines Wednesday morning , the committee said Rove broke the law by failing to appear at a July 10 hearing on allegations of White House influence over the Justice Department , including whether Rove encouraged prosecutions against Democrats .
UPDATE : From the House Judiciary Committee :
" Today 's vote was an important statement by this Committee that no person - not even Karl Rove - is above the law . " said Chairman John Conyers , Jr. " This week 's Inspector General report on the pervasive politicization of the Department of Justice particularly underscores the urgent need for Mr. Rove to testify before Congress .
Any suggestion that the matters for which Mr. Rove was subpoenaed are not important , or that no Administration misconduct has been revealed , is just inconsistent with the facts .
Our investigation has revealed Mr. Rove to be a key figure in the firings of US Attorneys , and the questions about his role in the Siegelman case only continue to mount . "
" Today 's vote demonstrates that the House will not tolerate Mr. Rove 's flawed excuses for avoiding his responsibility to obey a Congressional subpoena , " said Rep. Linda Sánchez , Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law .
" We are serious about defending the legislative branch 's constitutional oversight role , and it 's time for Mr. Rove to get serious about following the law . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. exports have been helped by a weaker dollar and this is providing a boost to an otherwise weak economy , Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said on Saturday .

U.S. exports have been helped by a weaker dollar and this is providing a boost to an otherwise weak economy , Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart said on Saturday .

“ The U.S. dollar has depreciated against the euro and on a trade - weighted basis .
The export sector of the U.S. economy has benefited and remains quite strong .
Export growth has diluted - but not offset - the negative trend of the U.S. economy , ” he said in prepared remarks .
A copy of his speech , to the Southern Center for International Studies Young Professionals in Atlanta , was released to media in Washington prior to delivery .
The dollar has slipped to record lows against the euro and other major currencies this year as the Fed slashed interest rates to offset the fallout from a housing crisis that has chilled growth .
Its benchmark overnight funds rate has been lowered since September to 2 percent from 5.25 percent .
“ The U.S. economy is in the midst of a pronounced slowdown , with very little growth recorded for two consecutive quarters .
The weakness was initially centered in the housing sector but has become more widespread , ” Lockhart said .
He also described inflation as “ elevated ” due in part to higher energy and commodity prices .
But he did not dwell on how he saw price pressures evolving in the speech , and mainly focused on the prospects for emerging economies .
“ Global economic integration has progressed in recent years to the point that a slowdown in the United States will unquestionably be felt , but not as severely as imagined by some , ” Lockhart said .
“ Domestic growth momentum in many emerging economies will attenuate the influence of U.S. weakness .
And the accumulation of foreign currency reserves by these countries - the result of trade surpluses - provides an accessible resource to stimulate their own domestic growth to offset weaker exports , should that weakness materialize , ” he said .
Lockhart also said there were good reasons why emerging economies were investing their foreign exchange reserves in more mature capital markets like the United States .
Lockhart said the money would keep flowing , citing a high appetite for savings ; domestic currency controls ; immature domestic banking systems ; and “ the propensity of households in the United States to undersave and overspend . ”
“ In my view , we can expect these “ upstream ” capital flows to continue for some time , ” he said .

Government officials have been quietly stepping up counterterror efforts out of a growing concern that al Qaeda or similar organizations might try to capitalize on the spate of extremely high - profile events in the coming months , sources tell ABC News .
Security experts point to next month ’s Olympics as evidence that high - profile events attract threats of terrorism , like the one issued this past weekend by a Chinese Muslim minority group that warned of its intent to attack the Games .
Anti-terror officials in the U.S. cite this summer and fall ’s lineup of two major political parties ’ conventions , November ’s general election and months of transition into a new presidential administration as cause for heightened awareness and action .

An international team of researchers has created the first complete high - resolution map of how millions of neural fibers in the human cerebral cortex -- the outer layer of the brain responsible for higher level thinking -- connect and communicate .
Their groundbreaking work identified a single network core , or hub , that may be key to the workings of both hemispheres of the brain .
The work by the researchers from Indiana University , University of Lausanne , Switzerland , Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne , Switzerland , and Harvard Medical School marks a major step in understanding the most complicated and mysterious organ in the human body .
It not only provides a comprehensive map of brain connections ( the brain " connectome " ) , but also describes a novel application of a non-invasive technique that can be used by other scientists to continue mapping the trillions of neural connections in the brain at even greater resolution , which is becoming a new field of science termed " connectomics . "
" This is one of the first steps necessary for building large - scale computational models of the human brain to help us understand processes that are difficult to observe , such as disease states and recovery processes to injuries , " said Olaf Sporns , co-author of the study and neuroscientist at Indiana University .
Until now , scientists have mostly used functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) technology to measure brain activity -- locating which parts of the brain become active during perception or cognition -- but there has been little understanding of the role of the underlying anatomy in generating this activity .
What is known of neural fiber connections and pathways has largely been learned from animal studies , and so far , no complete map of brain connections in the human brain exists .
In this new study , a team of neuroimaging researchers led by Hagmann used state - of - the - art diffusion MRI technology , which is a non-invasive scanning technique that estimates fiber connection trajectories based on gradient maps of the diffusion of water molecules through brain tissue .
A highly sensitive variant of the method , called diffusion spectrum imaging ( DSI ) , can depict the orientation of multiple fibers that cross a single location .
The study applies this technique to the entire human cortex , resulting in maps of millions of neural fibers running throughout this highly furrowed part of the brain .
Sporns then carried out a computational analysis trying to identify regions of the brain that played a more central role in the connectivity , serving as hubs in the cortical network .
Surprisingly , these analyses revealed a single highly and densely connected structural core in the brain of all participants .
" We found that the core , the most central part of the brain , is in the medial posterior portion of the cortex , and it straddles both hemispheres , " Sporns said .
" This was n't known before .
Researchers have been interested in this part of the brain for other reasons .
For example , when you 're at rest , this area uses up a lot of metabolic energy , but until now it has n't been clear why . "
The researchers then asked whether the structural connections of the brain in fact shape its dynamic activity , Sporns said .
The study examined the brains of five human participants who were imaged using both fMRI and DSI techniques to compare how closely the brain activity observed in the fMRI mapped to the underlying fiber networks .
" It turns out they 're quite closely related , " Sporns said .
" We can measure a significant correlation between brain anatomy and brain dynamics .
This means that if we know how the brain is connected we can predict what the brain will do . "
Sporns said he and Hagmann plan to look at more brains soon , to map brain connectivity as brains develop and age , and as they change in the course of disease and dysfunction .
The study was supported in part by the J.S. McDonnell Foundation , the University of Lausanne , Center for Biomedical Imaging ( CIBM ) of the Geneva - Lausanne Universities , Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne and the National Institutes of Health .
T. Boone Pickens Says Peak Oil Reached , Plans World 's Largest Wind Farm
June 8th , 2008 by Carol Gulyas
When one of Texas ’s richest oil men bets big on wind energy , it gets attention .
Yesterday NPR ’s Living on Earth broadcast an interview with Mr. Pickens , who shared the salient facts about his planned wind project :
It will be the largest in the world , he reckons , at 4,000 megawatts
It will provide enough power for 1,300,000 homes
It ’s a $ 10 billion dollar project from which he plans a 15 % - 25 % profit
Asked why he is investing in wind now , Pickens replied :
“ For a number of years I ’ve watched the wind turbines develop — and I feel like it ’s time for it .
I think that oil has peaked at 85 million barrels in the world .
We ’ve got to develop other forms of energy — wind , I think solar will be next , and I hope I ’m still around to be in the solar deal . ”
( Pickens is 80 years old .
But what if Congress does n’t vote to extend the wind Production Tax Credit ?
“ Well , I think they ’ll vote on it .
They ’ll either do that or they ’ll give some kind of carbon credit because , the wind has to be developed in the United States .
We ’re now importing 72 percent of the oil we use every day .
I think everybody can see that we ’re gonna break the country if we pay 700 billion dollars a year for , uh , imported oil …
… I ’ve got a good team of people that are knowledgeable in wind energy , and I do n’t worry about it .
I think it ’s a good project , and it ’ll do well and we ’ll make money .
And it ’ll help the country . ”
I took a look at Pickens ’s bio on Wikipedia .
He grew up poor but worked hard .
He became a geologist in the 50’s , which “ were difficult times for the oil industry and petroleum geologists . ”
He stuck at it and obviously his bet on oil paid off ; Pickens is worth $ 3 billion now .
But he ’s moving on — to wind .

Opinion is still split on whether Ms. Fiorina or her successor as chief executive , Mark V. Hurd , deserve credit for Hewlett ’s success after Ms. Fiorina drove through the company ’s $ 25 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2002 .
By many accounts , Ms. Fiorina was superb at marketing , mixed on strategy , bad at execution  and extraordinarily successful in unifying the board against what Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld of the Yale School of Management calls her “ street bully ” leadership style .
Image Carly Fiorina , an adviser to Republican presidential candidate Senator John McCain , on Mr. McCain 's campaign bus .

Mary Altaffer / Associated Press
“ What a blind spot this is in the McCain campaign to have elevated her stature and centrality in this way , ” said Mr. Sonnenfeld , the senior associate dean for executive programs at the management school and one of Ms. Fiorina ’s sharpest critics .
“ You could n’t pick a worse , non-imprisoned C.E.O. to be your standard - bearer . ”
But Mr. McCain , as Ms. Fiorina put it , does “ clearly not ” share the views of her critics .
To the contrary , he so proudly calls on Ms. Fiorina in her regular appearances with him on the campaign trail  he calls her an American success story “ who began as a part - time secretary ”  that he seems to be suggesting that Ms. Fiorina , true or not , might have a role in a McCain cabinet .
As a result , Ms. Fiorina has been buzzed about as a potential commerce or Treasury secretary or even as a McCain running mate , although some Republicans close to Mr. McCain swiftly dismiss the idea of her as vice president .
But the view within the campaign is that it can only help Mr. McCain ’s standing among women to have Ms. Fiorina mentioned as a possibility for high - profile office in a McCain administration , particularly when he is trying to win over the supporters of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton .
In the meantime , Ms. Fiorina has done little to tamp down speculation that she might run for office herself , including the California governorship in 2010 .
“ I would be disingenuous if I said it has never occurred to me , ” Ms. Fiorina said about running in general .
“ And in part it occurs to me because people keep asking .
When I give speeches , people raise their hand  ‘ run , run , run . ’ ” For now , she said , “ I ’m focused on getting McCain elected . ”
Guantanamo Bay , Cuba
The name of the Central Intelligence Agency cannot be spoken in the war crimes trial here .
No records of the agency ’s interrogations of Salim Ahmed Hamdan can be subpoenaed , and no agent can be called to testify about what he or she learned from Osama bin Laden ’s former driver .
When defense attorney Harry H. Schneider Jr. attempted to demonstrate how many interrogations Hamdan had undergone in the months after his November 2001 arrest -- at least 40 -- he could n’t list the CIA along with more than a dozen other agencies including the Secret Service and what was then known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service .

The prohibition against naming the CIA came in a “ protective order ” issued by the court at the government ’s request .
The tribunal ’s deputy chief prosecutor , Army Col. Bruce A. Pagel , could n’t say which agency sought the shield or what arguments were made to justify it .
“ It ’s a bit absurd to go through an entire trial pretending that the CIA does n’t exist , ” said Matt Pollard , a legal advisor for Amnesty International here to monitor the proceedings .
“ The CIA plays a role with the detainees at Guantanamo Bay that has never been fully acknowledged , and the bottom line is that national security should never be claimed against any evidence of torture or human - rights violations . ”
Not loving it

Former FBI Al Qaeda expert Ali Soufan brought Hamdan Filet - O - Fish sandwiches from McDonald ’s to get on the prisoner ’s good side .
Fellow agent George M. Crouch Jr. discovered that Hamdan had an affinity for Mickey D fries and was more forthcoming when his junk - food jones was satisfied .
But the 38 - year - old Yemeni soon learned what regular visitors to the Golden Arches have known for decades :
You ’ve got to get ‘em while they ’re hot .
Crouch told the court how he tried to bring in an order from the McDonald ’s on the Navy base , which is no more than a 10 - minute drive from the interrogation site .
But on that July day in 2002 , he was blocked from entering for more than an hour by military guards .

“ Mr. Hamdan even appreciated that McDonald ’s fries are not good cold , ” Crouch told the court , eliciting laughter from the judge and jurors .
Brief briefings
To have an impressive backdrop for the government ’s daily spin on the tribunal proceedings , a Pentagon engineering unit built and furnished a press briefing room inside the abandoned hangar that houses journalists covering the Hamdan trial .
At a cost of nearly $ 50,000 , the news - conference room at Camp Justice -- as the Expeditionary Legal Complex is known -- has one serious problem :
You ca n’t hear a thing when the giant air conditioner is turned on , and you ca n’t breathe when it is n’t .

The roaring AC is turned off just seconds before the Pentagon public affairs officers approach the podium in front of the Stars and Stripes and the five flags of the uniformed services .
In southern Cuba ’s scorching summer temperatures , it ’s a matter of minutes before brows start beading with sweat and journalists start tugging at their collars .
The stifling heat has made the media opportunities uncharacteristically brief .
Proof of life
In a rare bow to Geneva Convention prisoner - of - war protections , the tribunal gives Hamdan the right to approve the courtroom sketch artist ’s renderings of the defendant .
Advertisement
The Geneva Convention prohibits the “ parading ” of POWs , and although the Bush administration has steadfastly refused to classify the Guantanamo detainees as POWs , officials have used the parading ban to prevent images of the detainees from being made public .
Sketch artist Janet Hamlin showed her first drawing to the defendant after the opening day of testimony Tuesday .
It drew a big smile and a double thumbs - up from Hamdan .
His pleasure at being depicted might have reflected Hamdan ’s appreciation of a rare chance to let his family in Yemen get a glimpse of him after a nearly seven - year absence .
Hamdan has a fourth - grade education and has learned little English during his detention -- all but a few months of it in solitary cells .

Guards have taught their charges hand signals common in the United States , like the thumbs - up , to aid communication .
They asked for it
Complying with the letter , if not the spirit , of a judge ’s months - old order to turn over records of Hamdan ’s six - year detention here to defense lawyers , the prosecution delivered more than 500 pages of evidence 12 hours before his trial began Monday .
“ It was a document dump , ” said the tribunal ’s deputy chief of defense , Michael Berrigan .
Many pages in the jumble lacked dates or letterhead , and the page sequence did n’t correspond to the discovery list issued by the judge , Navy Capt .
Keith J. Allred .
Advertisement
To sort through the mess , the tribunal defense chief , Army Col.
Steve David , conscripted seven other detainees ’ defense lawyers -- on the base to consult with their clients -- to spend the night combing the documents for information important to Hamdan ’s case .
One nugget was raised in court Friday : Civilian defense lawyer Joseph McMillan grilled FBI agents about a practice outlined in a secret document to “ exploit the sense of disorientation ” common among newly arrived detainees .
“ At the end of the day , there ’s only one government , ” Berrigan said of the prosecution ’s excuse that other agencies had held up compliance with Allred ’s discovery order .
“ The bottom line is that the defense is not equipped , under the rules we have to operate under , to present an adequate defense . ”

Hodges ’ knack for making things grow in odd environments has been on display at the Land Pavilion in the Epcot theme park at Walt Disney World in Florida and the Biosphere 2 project in Arizona .
Here in the northern Mexican state of Sonora , he ’s thinking much bigger .
The Earth ’s ice sheets are melting fast .
Scientists predict that rising seas could swallow some low - lying areas , displacing millions of people .

Hodges sees opportunity .
Why not divert the flow inland to create wealth and jobs instead of catastrophe ?
He wants to channel the ocean into man-made “ rivers ” to nourish commercial aquaculture operations , mangrove forests and crops that produce food and fuel .
This greening of desert coastlines , he said , could add millions of acres of productive farmland and sequester vast quantities of carbon dioxide , the primary culprit in global warming .
Hodges contends that it could also neutralize sea - level rise , in part by using exhausted freshwater aquifers as gigantic natural storage tanks for ocean water .
Analyzing recent projections of ice melt occurring in the Antarctic and Greenland , Hodges calculates that diverting the equivalent of three Mississippi Rivers inland would do the trick .
He figures that would require 50 good - sized seawater farms that could be built within a decade if the world gets cracking .
“ The only way we can stop [ sea - level rise ] is if people believe we can , ” said Hodges , whose outsize intellect is exceeded only by his self - assurance .
“ This is the big idea ” that humanity has been waiting for , he believes .

With his trademark floppy hat , an iPhone wired perpetually to his head and a propensity to assign environmental reading homework to complete strangers , Hodges might be dismissed by some as an eccentric who has spent too much time in the Mexican sun .
“ When I first met Carl , I thought he was a philosopher , ” said actor Sheen , a longtime friend .
Still , experts including Dennis Bushnell , chief scientist at NASA ’s Langley Research Center , say seawater agriculture could prove to be an important weapon in the fight against climate change .
Hodges has already built such a farm in Africa .
Political upheaval there shut much of it down in 2003 .
That ’s why he ’s determined to construct a showcase project in North America to demonstrate what ’s possible .

All he needs now is $ 35 million .
That ’s where salicornia comes in .
A so - called halophyte , or salt - loving plant , the briny succulent thrives in hellish heat and pitiful soil on little more than a regular dousing of ocean water .
Several countries are experimenting with salicornia and other saltwater - tolerant species as sources of food .
Known in some restaurants as sea asparagus , salicornia can be eaten fresh or steamed , squeezed into cooking oil or ground into high - protein meal .
Hodges , who now heads the nonprofit Seawater Foundation , plugged salicornia for years as the plant to help end world hunger .
Do-gooders applauded .
The private sector yawned .
Then oil prices exploded .
Hodges saw his shot to lift his fleshy , leafless shrub from obscurity .

That ’s because salicornia has another nifty quality :
It can be converted into biofuel .
And , unlike grain - based ethanol , it does n’t need rain or prime farmland , and it does n’t distort global food markets .
NASA has estimated that halophytes planted over an area the size of the Sahara Desert could supply more than 90 % of the world ’s energy needs .
Last year , Hodges formed a for - profit company called Global Seawater Inc. to produce salicornia biofuel in liquid and solid versions .
He lugs samples of it around in a suitcase like some environmental traveling salesman .
The enterprise recently planted 1,000 acres of salicornia here in rural Sonora , where Hodges has been doing preparatory research for decades .
That crop will provide seed for a major venture planned 50 miles north in the coastal city of Bahia de Kino .
Global Seawater is attempting to lease or buy 12,000 acres there for what it envisions will be the world ’s largest seawater farm .
The plan is to cut an ocean canal into the desert to nourish commercial ponds of shrimp and fish .
Instead of dumping the effluent back into the ocean , the company would channel it further inland to fertilize fields of salicornia for biofuel .
The seawater ’s next stop would be man-made wetlands .
These mangrove forests could be “ sold ” to polluters to meet emissions cuts mandated by the Kyoto Protocol on climate change .

“ Nothing is wasted , ” Hodges said .
Global Seawater already has a small refinery to process salicornia oil into biodiesel fuel , which Hodges believes can be produced for at least one - third less than the current market price of crude oil .
Leftover plant material would be converted into solid biofuel “ logs ” that he said burned cleaner than coal or wood .
NASA is interested in testing fuel from Hodges ’ halophyte .
So are cement makers and other heavy industries .
Retired executives from some major corporations are so encouraged by the potential that they are helping Global Seawater raise capital and focus on generating returns for investors .
Fernando Canales Clariond , former Mexican secretary of the economy and member of one of the nation ’s most powerful industrial families , recently joined the board .
“ The world does n’t move because of idealism , ” he said .
“ It moves because of economic incentives . ”

Fellow board member Anthony Simon , former president of marketing for Unilever Bestfoods , put it more bluntly .
“ Carl is a wonderful scientist , ” he said of Hodges .
But he “ is a lousy businessman . ”
Hodges has sold assets and maxed out credit cards over the years to keep his seawater dreams afloat .
But it ’s not for the prospect of a big payday .
A lifetime of studying the Earth ’s ecosystems has convinced him that the planet is in peril .
He ’s determined to help get things back in balance .
Driving through the sun-scorched Sonora countryside , he pointed to abandoned grain silos and crumbling concrete irrigation channels , tombstones of failed efforts at conventional farming .
“ It ’s a dust bowl , ” Hodges said .
“ We ’re going to making it bloom again . . . with a new kind of agriculture . ”

Some environmentalists are dubious .
Wheat and cotton flourished here until farmers pumped aquifers nearly dry .
Shrimp aquaculture operations have fouled the Sea of Cortez with waste .
Channeling millions of gallons of seawater inland could have similar unintended consequences for fragile deserts , said biologist Exequiel Ezcurra , former head of Mexico ’s National Ecology Institute .
“ We have had catastrophes in the past , so we have reason to be concerned , ” he said .
Hodges says his project has met all environmental requirements posed by Mexico .
The biggest catastrophe , he said , would be to do nothing in the face of climate change .
“ My father once told me , ‘ Carl , there is a special place in hell reserved for fence sitters . ’ ”

The son of a horse trainer , Hodges grew up around racetracks .
His dad once traded their Phoenix home for some thoroughbreds , moving the family briefly into a shed .
A stomach for risk - taking landed the young scientist in the top spot at the Environmental Research Lab in 1967 at the age of 30 .
There he decided that farming must be adapted to utilize saltwater , which accounts for 97 % of the world ’s water supply .
His team ’s work on shrimp cultivation fueled the explosion in Mexico ’s aquaculture industry .
The leader of Abu Dhabi sent his lab $ 3.6 million on a handshake to build a saltwater greenhouse system for growing vegetables in that arid emirate .
Brando took a shine to Hodges after meeting him at an environmental gathering in the late 1970s .
The reclusive star hosted the wonky scientist several times at his private island retreat of Tetiaroa in the South Pacific , an area especially vulnerable to sea - level rise .
“ Marlon understood global warming , ” Hodges said .
“ He thought we were running out of time . ”

Hodges ’ model for the Mexico project is a seawater farm he designed for the government of Eritrea , an impoverished , bone - dry East African nation perched on the Red Sea .
Opened in 1999 , the farm consisted of ocean - fed ponds of shrimp and fish , whose waste was used to irrigate 250 acres of salicornia that the Eritreans converted into animal feed .
A 150 - acre mangrove wetland provided habitat for wildlife .
Political upheaval crippled the operation .
But at its peak the farm generated hundreds of jobs and turned famine - prone Eritrea into a modest exporter of shrimp .
Video footage of the endeavor shows a lush oasis of green in the desert .
“ It was a miracle , ” said Tekie Teclemariam Anday , an Eritrean marine biologist who now works with Hodges in Mexico .
“ People viewed him like a messiah . ”
Whether Hodges ’ Big Idea wins a wider group of converts remains to be seen .
Advertisement
NASA ’s Bushnell says seawater agriculture has enormous potential .
He praised Hodges ’ science as “ superb . ”
Still , he said algae might ultimately prove to be the best plant - based biofuel because it can produce much more fuel per acre .
Hodges is “ a pioneer , ” Bushnell said .
“ But first - movers generally are n’t the successful ones at the end . ”
Hodges contends that all manner of renewables are needed to wean the planet from its oil addiction .
Still , his talk of stopping sea - level rise and reinventing agriculture is so audacious that some of his own backers have cautioned him to tone it down .
But longtime friend Sheen says Hodges is n’t likely to .
“ We have to be outrageous in our efforts to solve ” climate change , the actor said .
“ Carl is on a mission to save the world . ”

" " Syringe and toxic substance on this lethal injection .
DavidHills / Getty Images
For thousands of years , many governments have punished people convicted of certain crimes by putting them to death , using various means to accomplish this .
The death penalty is considered by many to be the ultimate form of punishment for those who have committed society 's most heinous crimes , including rape and murder .
As times have changed , so have the methods of execution .
The idea of someone being put to death is not a pleasant one .
About 54 of the world 's countries and 35 American states have a death penalty [ source : Amnesty International ] .
The vast majority of executions in 2009 took place in China , Iran , Iraq and Saudi Arabia [ source : Amnesty International ] .

The form by which prisoners are executed is changing .
In America and a growing number of other countries , lethal injection has become the most commonly used form of capital punishment , replacing other forms such as hanging and the electric chair .
In this article , we 'll examine how lethal injection is carried out and what a prisoner experiences in the days prior to execution .

I 've been noticing a lot of talk in the media , in the US government and amongst our crowd ( gold / silver bugs ) about the sky high price of oil and what we can do about it .
I am begging the friends of gold and silver to read chapters 29 and 30 of John Perkins book " The Secret History of the American Empire " ( www.johnperkins.org/paperback) where he very clearly explains how the US Dollar was taken off the " gold standard " and put on the " oil standard " implemented by Kissinger , Shultz and Cheney back in 1971 .
Most of us now know ( or at least have the suspicion ) that the prices of most commodities are rigged by computer programs run through the banking cabal and orchestrated by the Federal Reserve New York office .
OIL is no exception .
It is more than likely that oil is 100 % controlled by a computer trading program run by the banking cabal and friends inside the US Government .
Just like gold and silver , the oil supply / demand characteristics are not relevant to a manipulated , false price that can be set and steered by a few digital entries in a computer trading program .
The US will continue to hide it 's huge oil reserves in " national parks " , " nature preserves " and " ecologically sensitive areas " as well as suppress any fuel alternatives ( such as the electric car or hydrogen from water ) that would circumvent the need for high priced oil until the US Dollar " oil standard " is abandoned .
http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3340274697167011147
As Perkins explains , the high price of oil and the requirement to trade oil in US Dollars is essential to supporting a " strong dollar policy " .
GATA has shown that this also includes the price suppression of gold and silver .
Perkins relates first hand knowledge that in the 1970's , with the help of the UK , Israel and the Saudis , the US was able to orchestrate the formation of OPEC and jack up the price of oil globally thus necessitating the need for more and more US Dollars for the world to buy oil .
Today is no exception .
With oil trading over $ 130 a barrel the world needs $ 4 Trillion dollars annually to facilitate these oil purchases .
The most ingenious part of the " oil standard " plan is that working with " friendly " oil producing governments , the most of the oil profits were funneled back into the United States through large US based corporations .
Today these oil profits are more likely to show up as " investments " from Sovereign Wealth Funds to bail out the Western banks .
The long policy of the US to use other people�s scarce natural resources before our own may have seemed brilliant to some but the blow - back has turned the world against the USA ..... a country that was founded on truth and honesty but has built its power base upon lies and deception .
It is true what Chris Powell said at the " GATA Goes to Washington " conference :
" THERE ARE NO FREELY TRADED MARKETS ANYMORE "
But I think a better question may be : " Since the invention of computer trading programs , has there EVER been " freely traded " markets ?!)
The " little man behind the curtain " is alive and well !

Beyond the initial , senseless tragedy of innocent people murdered by Jim Adkisson in a Tennessee church , two disturbing facts about the killer were brought to light by the Knoxville police .
Fact one : the police found a four - page letter written by Adkisson in which he cited his hatred for ' the Liberal Movement ' as motivation for the crime .
Fact two : the police found various writings by right - wing pundits known for their violent rhetoric on TV and radio present in Adkisson 's home , including books by Sean Hannity , Michael Savage , and Bill O'Reilly .
Both of these facts touch on issues of law , politics , and more broadly : civil society .
And while it may be easy to say that the letter is more relevant than the books , there is a strong case to be made that the presence of right - wing books in the house of a self - proclaimed murderer of liberals not only touches in some way on the horrific crime committed , but also invites a broader discussion about one of the most important topics in contemporary America .
That topic is : Violent rhetoric and its destructive impact on America 's civic life .
Violence vs. Violent Rhetoric : the Physical Body vs. Civic Body
A basic distinction will be helpful in order to see the significance of right - wing literature in Adkisson 's house .
In order for the American democracy to work , two types of bodies must be functioning well -- must be ' healthy . '
The first body is physical .
If you make a fist with one hand and gently tap yourself on the chest , you will quickly discover the physical body .
This is the easy body for us all to see and understand .
Likewise , it is easy for most people to understand that if the physical body is injured or -- as in the Knoxville tragedy - - murdered , then any role in a democratic system comes to an end .
The old political joke makes the point better than any anthropologist could , 'Dead people do n't vote -- except in Chicago . '
The logic in the punchline , of course , is that if a dead person is found to have voted , it is not a sign that he system is working , but that the system has given in to corruption .
The second body is political and , because it is not tangible , much harder to conceptualize .
In fact , it 's not really a ' body , ' but we use the ' body ' metaphor to help us understand what this abstract thing is .
It is the civic body , the collection of all individuals in a given system engaging in the various acts that maintain our system of self - governing .
If we were born in Jefferson 's time , the easiest way to see that civic body would be to walk down the street and join your 20 neighbors at your local village meeting or pick up a broadsheet newspaper .
Nowadays , the easiest way to see the civic body is to tune our television set into a political talk show .
The civic body is primarily a place where people share ideas and information in conversation , the purpose of which is to know what we need to know in order to make the decisions necessary to do what needs to get done .
Whereas blood runs in the veins of the physical body , the veins of the civic body are filled with a certain kind of talk : an open and ongoing conversation .
Now , what we can see right away is that these two bodies are completely dependent on each other .
If typhoid breaks out or a flood destroys a town , nobody will be around to participate in the conversation .
Likewise , if one person acts in such a way so as to prevent others from speaking , no matter how healthy people are physically , the civic body collapses .
If the physical body comes under threat on a large enough or meaningful enough scale , the result is an almost immediate shift in the nature of American democracy .
If enough people 's homes are destroyed by flood or fire , or if a loved community leader is assassinated or imprisoned , the result is often a collapse in civic stability .
What is rarely discussed , however , but is absolutely essential to understanding the current state of American democracy , is that the same kind of shift happens if we the civic body is undermined -- in particular if the kind of conversation running the civic body changes from a free and open exchange of ideas and information to one marked by violent rhetoric , violent ideas , and violent behavior .
When the dominant conversation in the civic body shifts from pragmatism to violence , the state of American democracy shifts , too .
Rather than turning to civic space to communicate ideas , learn information , and work collectively to solve problems , a civic body marked by violent rhetoric becomes an arena driven by the need to vent frustration , enforce opinion , and eliminate rivals .
Violent Rhetoric : Poison in the Civic Body
Taken as a whole , violent rhetoric poisons the civic body , thereby undermining the fundamental dynamic of American democracy : people engage in an ongoing conversation for the purposes of getting things done .
Interestingly , the civic body is not such a fragile flower as many people believe .
It can tolerate a certain amount of violent rhetoric from individuals and still maintain its overall health .
The problem is not from violent rhetoric communicated from one individual to another individual , per se , but from violent rhetoric from one person amplified in such a way that it reaches millions of people all at once : broadcast media .
This is why the threat violent rhetoric poses to American democracy did not really appear until the advent of large scale broadcast technology -- radio .
With the rise of television and the accompanying industry of mass - scale book sales , individual sources of violent rhetoric have reached the point where they overwhelm the civic body .
The poisoning and subsequent collapse of the civic body from violent rhetoric initially takes the form of a shift in the way people talk and , but quickly gives way to a shift in how people act .
When violent rhetoric saturates the civic body via the media and other broadcast sources , people stop exchanging information , start hurling opinion .
The dominant questions , 'What is the information ?
What is the history ?
What is the goal ? ' gets displaced by the monolithic imperative , ' Do I agree ? '
Civic identity shifts when the conversation shifts .
In a healthy civic body , an engaged citizen is someone who learns and analyzes information , examines problems , and formulates solutions .
In a poisoned civic body , an engaged citizen is someone who offers opinions , expresses disdain for different opinions , and gathers with like - minded people to oppose those who differ in opinion .
O'Reilly 's Violence : Theory , Metaphor , Performance
With this broader distinction in mind , it is important to note that Bill O'Reilly 's work poisons the civic body with three distinct kinds of violence that he broadcasts via TV , radio , and large - scale book sales .
First is O'Reilly 's violent theory .
To see O'Reilly 's violent theory , one need only crack open a copy of Culture Warrior .
In that book , O'Reilly claims that the United States is engaged in a ' war ' between traditionalists and progressives .
O'Reilly offers this broader theory as the explanation for the kind of work he does -- including both is on - air persona and his writing .
Second is O'Reilly 's overuse of violent metaphor .
Everything that O'Reilly writes is framed through metaphors of war , boxing , and physical confrontation .
Watching O'Reilly on TV or reading his books , one can hardly find an idea that is not presented in violent metaphoric terms .
Third is O'Reilly 's signature violent style of performance .
In many ways , O'Reilly 's popularity is due to his ability to play act violence or near violence on TV in a way that is credible .
In the 1980s , there were many TV personalities whose talk shows often erupted into fights or thrown chairs .
O'Reilly uses the same tools , but on a much more sophisticated level - - often leaning forward in his chair with violent gestures towards his guests .
To detractors of O'Reilly , this behavior is often critiqued as childish .
To his supporters , it is exhilarating .
From Frustration to Violent Habits
O'Reilly 's books and broadcasts are significant in the Tennessee murder because they are part of a broader media market that undermines the civic body and turns individual frustrations into violent civic habits .
In learning of Adkisson 's hatred for ' the Liberal Movement ' and his collection of right - wing books , one is struck by the sheer amount of right - wing punditry that advances a similar logic of liberals destroying America -- and pushes the idea that the destruction of liberals is a logical response .
The overlap between the style of talk , the intellectual themes , and the performance put O'Reilly and Adkisson in a disturbingly common arena .
That arena can be described as a place where civic actors turn their frustration into violent habits -- into violent expression , violent theories , and violent performance .
The broader issue , of course , is not whether Bill O'Reilly 's book -- and Michael Savages ' book and Sean Hannity 's book -- caused Jim Adkisson to pick up a Remington shot gun and kill members of a Tennessee church who he perceived as worth of death because they were liberals .
The more important question is how Bill O'Reilly 's work -- layered as it is with multiple forms of violent rhetoric and performance and broadcast to levels that it impacts millions of lives daily -- has contributed to a fundamental collapse in the civic body .
And once that collapse happens , violent results follow .
' Take a Stand ' Against Right - Wing Violent Rhetoric
What Americans should demand coming out of this Tennessee shooting is not just more compassion towards other citizens , but that the American media ' take a stand ' against right - wing violent rhetoric .
We should also demand that the conversation that results form this demand not be undermined by small talk about people being nice to one another .
Certainly , manners are important , but the larger problem is not individual acts of hate or intolerance -- even if those are often the acts that result in so much pain .
The real issue is a privately held media industry that amplifies violent rhetoric and broadcasts it so much that the result is a poisoning and collapse of our civic body .
By calling for a return to a healthy civic body , we can do our part to honor the victims of the Tennessee tragedy last week .
WASHINGTON  With the Republican Party in need of money for the November elections , former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani has offered to appear at fund - raisers around the country for G.O.P. candidates .
But there is a catch :
He wants some cash out of the deal .
Mr. Giuliani ’s aides have told the National Republican Congressional Committee and Congressional candidates that if he makes an appearance , he wants the candidates to help him get rid of his presidential campaign debt .
The unusual request underscores the financial predicament Mr. Giuliani finds himself in , after he ended his presidential bid this year with roughly $ 3.6 million in campaign debt .
Traditionally , prominent party figures help lower - tier candidates by headlining fund - raising events in return for good will and future political alliances , but do not receive funds themselves .
Mr. Giuliani ’s debt includes a $ 500,000 personal loan that he made to the campaign , according to his latest campaign finance report .
This tiny puppy , named Hope , was born without front legs .
You know what that means : it was time to create a robopuppy .
Orthotist David Turnbill created a custom support for Hope using a couple of model airplane wheels , and each one of the " legs " can move up and down independently , allowing Hope to pivot and turn .
If you were to say this is the most adorable thing ever , you might just be right .
Hit the jump for a video of Hope getting fitted for her superlegs .
[ DailyMail via Best Week Ever via Jezebel ]
You could gargle bitumen and bin-juice for half an hour , and it could n't leave a nastier taste in your mouth than this macho action thriller about a secret fraternity of assassins .
It is directed by Timur Bekmambetov , evidently brought over to Hollywood on the strength of his wildly successful Russian movies like Day Watch .
The stars are Angelina Jolie , sporting her now familiar default smirk , and our own James McAvoy stepping up to his first A - list role .
The spectacle of their strange gym - built bodies , variously starved and pumped , and the boring , risk - free digital " stunts " , ca n't distract you from just how dreary and insidious the whole business is .
It looks as if it has been written by a committee of 13 - year - old boys for whom penetrative sex is still only a rumour , and the resulting movie plays like a party political broadcast on behalf of the misogynist party .
James McAvoy plays
Wes , an ordinary nerdy guy who has an office job which totally sucks .
He 's pathetic , a loser , on medication for anxiety attacks , of all the spurious and ridiculous ailments .
His best friend is a bullying jock who is boning Wes 's whiney and nagging girlfriend on the sly , and incidentally adding insult to injury by mooching cash off
Wes for the necessary contraceptive materials .
But Wes 's untermensch life is turned around when Angelina Jolie pops up out of nowhere in a drugstore , saves
Wes from a mysterious , spectacular attempt on his life , and shoves the gibbering soon - to - be - ex - nerd into her flashy automobile for a crash - bang chase along the city freeway , exchanging fire with the gunman .
Wes is evidently hated by the forces of darkness because , quite without knowing it , he is a ninja of topping people ; his own father , a master assassin whom he never knew , has just been killed by the shadowy opposition .
It is his fate to be a master killer , and it is the job of Jolie - known simply as " Fox " - to force him to step up , to accept his destiny and enter the Fraternity , a secret society of bespoke killers dedicated to taking out important bad guys .
The Fraternity hides out inside what looks like a castle modelled on Balmoral , disguised as a community of weavers .
Their super - sexy way of shooting people - apart , obviously , from the usual technique of doing it with outstretched arm , gun tilted 90 degrees , face insouciantly pointing away from the victim - is to use a special bullet with corkscrew grooving .
This , and a slight whiplash with the shooting arm , will cause the bullet to curve round corners , a setpiece which perhaps shows the influence of David Beckham .
Wes of course blossoms into an alpha-male , and even gets some liplock action with Angelina , which looks like he 's snogging a singed sofa .
Weirdly , though , it is Wes 's pre-heroic life which is given the most passion by Bekmambetov .
None of the violence and the action have a fraction of the beady - eyed intensity with which the director invests the moment where Wes quits his job and tells his boss to shove it .
Because his boss is a fat ugly woman .
This horrible bitch is always snapping at him and she gets her comeuppance in a big way , her obesity being a clear sign that she 's asking to be brought low and laughed at .
Her existence is briefly reprised at the end of the film , when one of Wes 's bullets whistles through the doughnut she 's gobbling .
I have to say I do n't think I 've seen a film recently which expresses hatred of women quite so openly , and fervently , as this one .
In a way , Wes 's boss is the most vivid female character in the film , more powerfully and pointedly conceived than the others : more than Wes 's horrible , duplicitous girlfriend , who gets to be humiliated by seeing Wes kissing Fox and more than Fox herself , who is basically an honorary male .
This is a film where womankind is represented by irrelevant sleek babes and obese comic foils , an ugly whorehouse aesthetic which really does sock over its contempt for femaleness very , very powerfully indeed .
Perhaps it 's absurd to worry in these terms about a silly , disposable movie like this .
And yet I can't help thinking that if a film treated any ethnic group the way this treats women , it would find itself in pretty hot water .
And it 's sad to see Angelina Jolie , a performer with style - who moreover did the assassin role with considerably more wit and charm in Mr and Mrs Smith - trundled out for this piffle .
It 's also sad to see James McAvoy offer an IQ - discount in a similar way .
In an ideal world , the title would have the word " Not " tacked on to the front .
The header , colmask and footer divs are 100 % wide and stacked vertically one after the other .
Colmid is inside colmask and colleft is inside colmid .
The three column content divs ( col1 , col2 & col3 ) are inside colleft .
Notice that the main content column ( col1 ) comes before the other columns .
To prevent wide content ( like long URLs ) from destroying the layout ( long content can make the page scroll horizontally ) the column content divs are set to overflow : hidden .
This chops off any content that is wider than the div .
Because of this , it 's important to know the maximum widths allowable at common screen resolutions .
For example , if you choose 800 x 600 pixels as your minimum compatible resolution what is the widest image that can be safely added to each column before it gets chopped off ?
Here are the figures :
All the dimensions are in percentage widths so the layout adjusts to any screen resolution .
Vertical dimensions are not set so they stretch to the height of the content .
No CSS hacks
The CSS used for this layout is 100 % valid and hack free .
To overcome Internet Explorer 's broken box model , no horizontal padding or margins are used in conjunction with a width .
Instead , this design uses percentage widths and clever relative positioning .
SEO friendly 2 - 1 - 3 column ordering
The higher up content is in your page code , the more important it is considered by search engine algorithms .
To make your website as optimised as possible , your main page content must come before the side columns .
This layout does exactly that :
The center page comes first , then the left column and finally the right column ( see the nested div structure diagram for more info ) .
The columns can also be configured to any other order if required .
Full length column background colours
In this layout the background colours of each column will always stretch to the length of the longest column .
This feature was traditionally only available with table based layouts but now with a little CSS trickery we can do exactly the same with divs .
Say goodbye to annoying short columns !
You can read my article on equal height columns if you want to see how this is done .
No Images
This layout requires no images .
Many CSS website designs need images to colour in the column backgrounds but that is not necessary with this design .
Why waste bandwidth and precious HTTP requests when you can do everything in pure CSS and XHTML ?
No JavaScript
JavaScript is not required .

When Blizzard unveiled Diablo III earlier this week , it did n't come as much of a surprise to anyone .
Well , there was one guy who thought Starcraft 3 was being developed alongside Starcraft 2 with a projected release date of one week prior to the release of the game it was following , but no one has taken Cliffy B. seriously since he predicted that Mario would never appear in another video game after Super Mario Sunshine .
Sure , it did n't blow any minds , but the announcement came as welcome news .
Diablo II is still the first thing I install on my computer after a trojan - laden lolita incest hentai comic forces me to reformat .
It 's hard to believe that in the last eight years no one has been able to step in and create a better action - rpg .
It 's even harder to believe that a ten year old girl can lubricate her entire body with egg yolks then squirm into the urethra of her mother 's penis and follow it until she returns to the womb , but I saw the drawings .
It can happen , people .
After watching the Diablo III gameplay footage , I was really excited .
The visuals were fantastic , a lot of small improvements had been added without seeming to get in the way of what makes the series great , and by the end of the video I found myself moving my mouse around the screen as if I was playing .
That 's sad , but what 's even sadder is that I 'm not a big - time game journalist so I can't come up with a term like " gamesturbation " to describe the lonely and desparate act while making myself cool and quotable .
Imagine my surprise when I discovered that my positive impressions were irrational and baseless , while most of the internet saw the game for what it truly was :
A personal insult to them and a serious threat to all they hold dear .
If you find that you 've mistakenly become mildly optimistic about the game , read on to find out where I went wrong so you can adjust accordingly .
My Initial ( Wrong ) Opinion :
Wow , it 's the world from Diablo in 3D , rendered like a painting to retain the 2D flavor of the previous games .
The dark and ominous themes are still there , only now we do n't have to use our imaginations to fill in the details suggested by blocky sprites .
The Internet 's ( Correct ) Opinion : Wow , it 's a shitty cartoon !
This is NOT the same world that Diablo I and II took place in .
No way .
Do I see a rainbow ?
I 'm sorry , but rainbows do n't exist in the Diablo universe .
I have read all the lore , and there is not a single mention of rainbows in there .
Big surprise that Blizzard retconned rainbows into Diablo .
Vapid morons .
Who do they think they are ?
I 've been playing this series they created for years , and they fuck everything up like they own it .
Here 's the dark and gritty Diablo II , which Diablo III should look like :
Here 's a cartoon :
Or is that Diablo III ?
I honestly can't tell .
Blizzard should give the game a dark atmosphere by literally making the game too dark to see anything and then maybe add some film grain on top of everything .
If the technology is available , the black silhouette of a thumb could get in the way of the player 's view to obscure the game from time to time and add to the game 's overall darkness .
Canadian copyfighter Howard Knopf has suggested ( presumably with tongue firmly planted in cheek ) that recording artists whose music is played by torturers in Gitmo are owed performance royalties :
Leaving aside the legal niceties about whose law if any applies in that dreadful place , one can only wonder if ASCAP might not want a piece of the action .
After all , it went after the Girl Guides not so long ago .
And if it could try to make a buck off Girl Guides , who are nice people , why not alleged terrorists ?
Why should terrorists enjoy free music ?
Today was the qualification round of Google Code Jam 2008 .
This year Google remodelled the contest format , moving from the traditional competition arenas where you code using some of the pre-specified languages ( usually C++/ Java /Python/VB ) directly into a window and the code is compiled and run server - side , to a more open format where you just download an input file and submit the output of your program .
I liked this change very much , because it brings two good advantages for the competitors : first , you can use the editors , environment and programming tools that you ’re most comfortable with ; second , you can use any programming language that you want ( as long as its freely available ) .
This is definitely cool because if , for example , some complex math problem appears , one could even open some free math environment like Sage or Scilab to solve some integrals or matrix equations .
In the past I ’ve participated of such contests coding in C/ C+ + and I was warming up for this year ’s edition in C++ and maybe Perl if some tricky parsing gets needed , but then I decided to try something a bit different this time and check how nice it would be to participate in the contest using JavaScript .
Turns out it was totally cool !
Before the contest started , I coded a little JS arena to make it quicker to work with my code , without the need of saving and reloading files all the time .
It also supports working with the input / output in a way which is generally expected by such competitions : by reading one line at a time , getting the values as strings or numbers , and printing to the output one line at a time , generally one line for each test case .
It is similar to Jesse Ruderman ’s JS Env , albeit much simpler , but with the added twist of accessing an input .
Another available feature is actually running two different source codes as input altogether , useful if you want to code some helper functions but do n’t want them to keep visually distracting you ( The helper functions are kept in a hidden textarea that you can toggle ) .
Having the opportunity to work in the contest using a language full of features like arrays with built - in sorts , RegExp , lambda functions , OOP , Hashmaps / Dictionaries / however - you - call - it makes a lot of difference when you are running against the time to solve an algorithm problem .
And it was also very nice ( and geek ) to use Firefox as my development environment for the contest , as it ’s already the case for many people doing webdesign entirely using FF and its great extensions .
The qualification round has ended , now let ’s see how far I can go with JavaScript in the next rounds !
As this arena is not only useful for this contest , but also if you want to do some quick JavaScript coding / parsing , I ’ve put it online ( JS Arena ) .
It comes loaded with the code and input from one of the problems of the qualification round ( which was about search engines ) , but you can just erase the pre-loaded text and type your code .
The whole CSS and scripts are contained in a single .htm file because it was easier to submit to the contest , and it makes it easier too if you want to grab the file for offline usage .
( CNN ) -- A Democratic congressman from Mississippi plans to hold a hearing into how millions of dollars worth of supplies meant for Gulf Coast hurricane survivors ended up being given away as surplus property .
Rep. Bennie Thompson says he 'll hold a hearing into how supplies for Katrina victims were diverted .
Rep. Bennie Thompson , chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security , called the situation " a debacle . "
In June , CNN revealed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had warehoused $ 85 million worth of household goods for two years before giving them away to federal agencies and 16 states .
But Thompson said there is still a great need for basic supplies in Mississippi .
" We just think that FEMA needs to come and tell the committee how such a debacle could occur , and in the process , what are they going to do to assure Congress and the taxpaying public that it will never happen again , " Thompson said .
The household goods were meant to help Gulf Coast households rebuild .
But they sat in FEMA warehouses for two years before the agency declared them surplus property and gave them away in February .
The state of Louisiana had not asked for any of the supplies , prompting outrage there after the original CNN report .
Since then , the state has taken steps to claim some of the stockpiles and distribute them to groups working to resettle victims of Hurricane Katrina , the 2005 storm that flooded New Orleans and ravaged the Mississippi Gulf Coast .
Mississippi took the supplies it was offered but did not give them to Katrina victims .
Instead , as CNN reported this week , the state distributed them to prisons , volunteer fire departments , colleges and other state agencies .
Thompson said he was stunned at how Mississippi officials made " a mockery of the whole process . "
" I 'm disappointed that my state decided that prisoners had a higher priority than Katrina victims and has made no effort to correct it even when this mistake was made , " he said .
" Any time items intended for victims of Katrina end up in the hands of the Department of Corrections or state employees , then clearly , Mississippi dropped the ball . "
Watch victims tell why they need the items »
Thompson said his committee would " ask all the tough questions " and demand any documents associated with the matter .
" So we are prepared , if necessary , to put those officials under oath , " he said .
" We are prepared if necessary to subpoena any and all documents relative to this situation . "
FEMA spokesman Marty Bahamonde said the agency welcomed any congressional hearing .
" We always make ourselves available to answer the questions .
That 's something we are always ready to do , " he said .
FEMA said it was costing more than $ 1 million a year to store the supplies , but officials have not been able to answer why the agency did n't get the supplies to Katrina victims .
FEMA said the agency has launched an internal probe into the issue .
Jim Marler , director of Mississippi 's surplus agency , failed to return repeated phone calls over several months to explain what happened there .
But spokeswoman Kym Wiggins said the agency was not told the items were still needed -- a statement that did n't sit well with groups working to rebuild the stricken coast .
Bill Stallworth , executive director of the Hope Coordination Center in Biloxi , said he and other community leaders would have begged for the FEMA stockpiles had they known they were available .
" When I hear people stand up and just beat their chest and say we 've got everything under control , that 's when I just want to slap them upside the head and say , ' Get a grip , get a life , ' " said Stallworth , also a Biloxi city councilman .

website directory , which is part of the WWW Virtual Library System , features over 2000 carefully selected , annotated links in 37 international affairs categories .

A wiry man in his late 30s hangs near the top of a 40 - foot wall , the toes of his climbing shoes barely gripping the sheer face .
He clings with his left hand and pauses , swinging his right arm to the side , loosening the muscles .
Then he raises his head and lunges , thrusting his right hand above him and catching a rock hold with his fingertips .
With a few more moves he arrives at the top .
Under normal circumstances this extreme rock climber would be worth watching .
But what makes his effort even more remarkable is that he happens to be blind .
Born with retinoschisis , a rare disease akin to macular degeneration , Erik Weihenmayer was sightless by age 13 .
Even so , he continued to pursue his dream of mountaineering , and he succeeded :
In 2001 he became the first — and to date the only — blind climber to summit Mount Everest .
Today he is climbing with the aid of a tool that allows him to “ see ” in a new way — with his tongue .
In normal vision , light hitting the retina provokes electrical impulses that the brain translates into images .
What the tool , called the BrainPort , does is convert light into electrical impulses that stimulate the tongue instead of the retina .
With more tactile nerve endings than any other part of the body except the lips , the tongue can discriminate two points spaced less than a millimeter apart .
That degree of resolution is far beyond what the current BrainPort array , with only 611 electrodes , provides .
But tests have shown the BrainPort delivers enough information for users like Erik to navigate with .
“ Climbing ! ” Erik calls out to his partner .
He places the device in his mouth , raises his head , and “ surveys ” the wall before him .
Electrical impulses from the BrainPort become to him “ a tactile image that I ’m interpreting in space . ”
Erik reaches for a handheld slider that controls the zoom level and field of view of the BrainPort so that he can “ see ” one or two rock climbing holds on the wall some 2 or 3 feet above him .
Then he slowly and deliberately raises his right hand , reaches up , grabs hold , and begins to pull himself up the wall .
His feet secure , he hangs for a moment , adjusts the zoom again , then tentatively puts his hand out and above him again , this time missing the hold by half a foot .
Judging the distance of an object in space is particularly difficult even with the device , Erik says .
To help him figure out how far away something is , he sometimes waves his hand — an object of known size and distance — in front of himself first to get a sense of scale via the BrainPort array .
The feedback helps him assess the distance of his next rock climbing hold .
Testing the BrainPort , Erik says , involves “ learning to climb in a new , different way .
I ’m learning another language in the same way someone would be learning Braille or French for the first time .
I ’m figuring out how to map it spatially . ”
The challenges are significant .
The BrainPort provides information in two dimensions , like a line drawing on a piece of paper , but the user ’s brain must learn to translate this information into things like perspective , dimension , and location in space .
When Erik first used the BrainPort , the images in his brain appeared as unidentifiable shapes and lines , but over time , through practice , his brain adapted , eventually translating the tactile sensations into recognizable patterns and symbols .
Erik has experimented with the tool at his home in Golden , Colorado .
He could find and grab a coffee cup placed on the center island in his kitchen ; play soccer with his daughter Emma in their large downstairs playroom , kicking the ball back and forth over some 15 feet ; play rock - paper - scissors ; and compete in a game of tic - tac - toe by identifying x’s and o’s on paper mounted on an easel .
Later , the two moved out to the snowy front yard to play hide - and - seek .
Eventually Erik could detect Emma ’s movement as well as locate a snowman .
Outdoor environments remain particularly challenging , though .
“ Outside , shadows create lines , which appear on the tongue as objects in space , ” Erik says .
“ For sighted people , the eyes and the brain quickly make adjustments , but the BrainPort does n’t always keep pace with the shadows , and one has to learn to interpret these situations and contexts . ”
Paul Bach -y - Rita , the cocreator of the system Weihenmayer is testing , challenged conventional wisdom when he proposed that “ we see with the brain , not with the eyes . ”
He insisted that the brain was flexible enough to learn to interpret data coming in on a different kind of channel .
Bach -y - Rita died in 2006 , but Wicab — the company he cofounded in Middleton , Wisconsin , in 1998 — continues to work on devices based on the idea that one sense can substitute for another .
By 2004 , Wicab had gained support for its research from the National Eye Institute , one of the federal agencies of the National Institutes of Health .
Wicab intends to create a BrainPort vision device for consumers , and over time the company has made it much less cumbersome .
The prototype Erik first worked with in 2003 was bulky , comprising a webcam with a fixed field of view and a shoe box full of hardware that drove a basic 144 - electrode array , all connected and run through a laptop computer .
The current BrainPort prototype includes hardware contained in a belt - mounted 6 - by - 6 - by - 4 - inch box , three sensitive cameras with a 90 - degree field of view , and user - operated zoom and contrast control .
Still , despite significant improvements in size and portability , the current prototype is not cosmetically appealing or portable enough for ordinary use .
Wicab plans eventually to integrate microcameras and microprocessors into eyeglass frames ; a dental appliance will incorporate the tongue display , allowing the user to touch the display intentionally with the tongue , but also to pull it away and talk .
Low - power radio frequency transceivers will link the cameras , processors , and tongue arrays ; later on , wireless technology will connect these elements .
Other applications for the BrainPort include assisting military divers in challenging low - light and no-light search - and - rescue operations , says Rich Hogle , Wicab director of product development .
“ Imagine that you ’re floating in a dense brown fog in daytime and visibility is such that …there ’s no up , down , left , or right , and now your job is to swim 200 yards in a straight , level line , turn 180 degrees to the left , and swim back in a line parallel to the first .
If you ’re off by a few degrees in either direction , or too shallow or too deep , you might miss what you are looking for .
Now imagine doing the same thing , in the same brown fog , at night . ”
In research funded by the Defense Ad­vanced Research Projects Agency , Wicab researchers used BrainPort technology to help military divers swim in a straight line in low - light and no-light conditions .
“ For this project we used a digital compass to provide directional information that was then displayed on the tongue as a tactile pattern , ” Hogle says .
“ While swimming in the target direction , the diver ’s eyes and ears were able to remain focused on the operational tasks at hand . ”
Erik Weihenmayer hopes that the de­vice will eventually benefit other members of the blind community , especially those who have never experienced vision .
“ I wonder how great one ’s learning curve would be if you used this device two hours a day , every day .
All of these blobs and circles and lines you would be able to learn and interpret .
If you gave it to a blind child , his spatial understanding of the world would be through his tongue .
It ’s a compelling thought . ”
The BrainPort provides a window into the vast complexity of our senses , Weihen­mayer says .
“ I ’m reminded how amazing the brain really is , with its incredible ability to differentiate all this information .
It ’s a trip to be able to ‘ look ’ at a hold and reach for it .
For me , it ’s beyond science .
It ’s a kind of vision .

The US airplane is part of a counter - narcotics taskforce in the Caribbean
Venezuela has demanded an explanation from Washington after a US military aircraft violated its airspace .
The US ambassador in Venezuela 's capital , Caracas , has been summoned to explain Saturday 's event .
US officials said a naval plane on a counter - narcotics mission had " navigational problems " that led it to briefly enter Venezuelan airspace .
Tension has been rising in the region with both the US and Colombia accusing Caracas of financing Colombian rebels .
' Series of provocations '
Venezuelan Defence Minister Gustavo Rangel said the US jet had been tracked by his country 's air defences over the Venezuelan - owned island of La Orchila on Saturday .
Mr Rangel told a news conference that the US aircraft " practically flew over " La Orchila - where Venezuela has a military base and President Hugo Chavez has a residence - and another island before turning back .
" This is just the latest step in a series of provocations , " he said .
US officials admitted the incident later on Monday .
" Support of Venezuelan air traffic control was greatly appreciated as they rendered assistance in guiding the US aircraft to international airspace , " the US Joint Interagency Task Force South said in a statement .
" A US S - 3 aircraft conducting counter - drugs operations lost navigational situational awareness causing it to fly into Venezuelan airspace off the mainland coast , " the statement added .
The Florida - based task force conducts counter - narcotics operations in the Caribbean .
The S - 3 is a reconnaissance aircraft .
The BBC's James Ingham in Caracas says it comes at a time of increased tension in the region , with both the US and Colombia accusing Venezuela of financing the left - wing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) .
Colombia says various documents prove that Venezuela has funded the rebels .
Mr Chavez insists he has never provided any support .
The US violation of Venezuelan airspace comes two days after a similar claim was made against Colombia .
The Bogota government denied that its troops had crossed into Venezuelan territory on Friday .
Our correspondent says the latest row will further increase tension between Venezuela and two countries it clearly sees as threats .

Reverse autocomplete
This is a proposal for a small improvement on the autocomplete feature , commonly found in many applications .
To my knowledge , it has n't been described or implemented elsewhere .
If you know otherwise , or have some comments or suggestions , drop me a line to the address below .
[ note 1 . Introduction 2 . Problem 3 . Solution 4 . Implementation
Autocomplete is a well - known user interface feature implemented in many different kinds of software :
Web browsers complete the address typed in the address field with entries from the browsing history Word processors ( Word , Openoffice.org ) have an autocomplete option which suggests previously entered words to speed up typing Programming editors ( Vim , Emacs , Eclipse ) can autocomplete function names , member variables or other text depending on the current context Most input boxes on web pages ( except those for passwords ) have autocomplete
In command line terminals or interpreted programming environments ( Matlab , R , etc. ) it is possible to autocomplete the typed command or the directory / file name ( usually with TAB or ESC key )
In Google Suggest , as soon as I start typing , a drop - down list appears with popular queries that match with what I typed so far
When I enter the first few letters of an email address or name of the person , most email clients ( both Desktop and web - based ) offer to complete the rest of the address many other examples ...
There are many variations in the implementation details of this feature :
User interface : can be a drop - down box ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 ) or text inserted directly , in many cases with auto - selection ( 1 for some older browsers , 2 , 5 )
: can be a drop - down box ( 1 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 ) or text inserted directly , in many cases with auto - selection ( 1 for some older browsers , 2 , 5 ) Exact / fuzzy match : in case of word processors or web queries it is often useful to allow for fuzzy matches , thus providing spell correction ( for example in Google Suggest , if I enter " amrei " , it offers to correct " American ... " ;
In web browsers if I start typing the address omitting the beginning " http : // " , autocomplete still works correctly )

In web browsers if I start typing the address omitting the beginning " http : // " , autocomplete still works correctly )
Where is the suggestion database stored : in memory locally or remotely on server .
While the first solution is much more responsive , the latter allows the usage of larger databases ( as in the case of Google Suggest ) .

Make suggestion from past input of user or from larger database
of user or from Full or partial autocomplete ( example for partial autocomplete is the command line interface , where autocompletion is done until the first point of ambiguity )
( example for partial autocomplete is the command line interface , where autocompletion is done until the first point of ambiguity )
Completion is for atomic elements from a list or in a stream of continuous text ( between two separators , such as word boundaries )
from a list or in a ( between two separators , such as word boundaries )
Passive or active autocomplete ( wait for user to ask / always suggest completion , if available ) ( the command line interface is an example of the first )
( wait for user to ask / always suggest completion , if available ) ( the command line interface is an example of the first )
Suggest one completion / suggest a list of completions ranked according to some criteria ( possible criteria are : most frequent , most recent , etc . )
ranked according to some criteria ( possible criteria are : most frequent , most recent , etc. ) many other details ...
While there are many different approaches in designing an autocomplete system , I believe most existing systems use either a simple set / list when there are only a small number of elements , or a variant of the prefix tree ( trie ) , or Radix tree data structures for many elements .
They dynamically fill up this structure with elements , which are then matched against the text that appears to the left of the cursor .
One drawback , in my opinion , of existing implementations ( including all of those mentioned above ) is that they do n't look at the location of the cursor and the text to the right of the cursor .
Of course , when the cursor is at the rightmost position , which is the case most of the time , there is nothing to look at .
In some cases however , the user is going back to make some correction .
In this case , autocomplete behaves in various ways in the implementations I 've seen , but none of them feels really natural .
Let 's see some examples of this behaviour :
I enter " German football team " in Google Suggest , then I change my mind and go back to change the query to " Italian football team " .
Autocomplete does n't help me with this .
Even when I entered " Italia| football team " , ( the | sign shows the cursor location ) , autocomplete does n't do anything , as it does n't look to the right from the cursor .
For the record , " Italian football team " is a frequent query , if I type it normally from the beginning , as soon as I get to " f " , Google Suggest knows what I want .
Google Suggest seems to look at the text as a whole , trying to autocomplete to the right , ignoring the cursor . [ note ]

In the browser I typed " mail.yahoo.com " .
Then I want to go to " mail.google.com " next .
Even though " mail.google.com " appears in the history , when I correct the middle part , such as to " mail.g|.com " or even " mail.googl|.com " , the autocomplete is clueless .
Again , the same behaviour as before .
.
Then I want to go to next .
Even though " mail.google.com " appears in the history , when I correct the middle part , such as to or even , the autocomplete is clueless .
Again , the same behaviour as before .
I entered a command in the terminal , but realized the file path was wrong .
I go back , delete part of the path , use TAB to ask for help , and manage to enter the correct address .
In this case the autocomplete works , it knows where the cursor is , but it still ignores the text to the right of the cursor .
Suppose , I typed the path " /home/myuser / Desktop / myStuff " , then I went back to change " myuser " to " otheruser " .
Autocomplete does help me with that , it inserts " otheruser " , but it has no idea that " otheruser " does not have the directory " / Desktop / myStuff " and this messes up the command .
The natural behavior in this case would be not to do autocompletion , unless the string to the right of the cursor ( until the first separator ) is also part of the autocompleted text ( the path exists ) .
If space is the separator , I can hit a space and go left to it , and then autocomplete works again without looking to the right .

I typed " jenny@fictivecompany.com " in the e-mail To : field .
Now I go back to change it to " jennifer@fictivecompany.com " .
Even though this address is in the address book , " jen|@fictivecompany.com " does not activate the autocomplete .
This problem is similar to the previous one , but in this case space and the comma can both be considered a separator , as the boundary for autocompletions .
The solution is to simply take whatever method there was to search for the text before the cursor , and use it to match the text after the cursor as well .
If a prefix tree is used , it is convenient to store the text to the right in reversed form for easier search .
Most of the time the text after the cursor will be empty , so there wo n't be much overhead .
When the cursor moves back , simply match the text both before and after the cursor , and only do autocomplete if something matches with both sides .
Example :
" United | America "
" are the separators or the boundaries of the text box
| is the cursor
a string is a candidate for autocompletion if it matches " United " in the left search tree and matches " America " in the right search tree , so " States of " can be correctly inserted .
Traditional autocomplete :
Bidirectional autocomplete :
Bidirectional autocomplete , also appending at both ends [ note ] :
Enter names of American presidents ( autocomplete is done on the whole name ) ...
Try for example " Theodore Roosevelt " , then change " Theodore " to " Franklin " .
Notes
This example implementation in javascript is based on AutoSuggest v1.0 .
I modified the code to perform the reverse search as well .
Both the original and the modified version are under LGPL .
For the cursor location code I modified this script .
As this is just a user interface proof - of - concept , I do n't recommend using the javascript code as such , as it is not more than a quick hack .
Text left and right of the cursor is shown for more clarity .
Note that I did n't use any of the complex data structures mentioned , all we have is a simple array , as can be seen from the source .
It was pointed out that the idea is not entirely new , but still it is surprising that as of now , it does not exist in mainstream applications .
Zsh performs the kind of validation of paths that was mentioned earlier .
Emacs does allow for backward / forward matching .
And of course , I did not claim that matching with wildcards was a new idea , obviously this is only a subset of regular expression matching .
The idea is only to use the cursor location and the claim that if there is already a mechanism for autocompleting in the traditional way , it can be extended to look forward from the cursor , without any overhead .
Matching in a more general context is discussed for example here .
Many people have pointed out that in order to be useful , an autocomplete system has to be able to append both to the beginning and the end of the text , regardless of the cursor position .
In this way " States|of " should also match " United States of America " , the same holds for " t|f " for example .
This feature is mostly independent of the original idea to take cursor position into account .
One possible issue is that this way sometimes too many suggestions are offered , especially for short strings .
An other issue is that if we allow to expand the string at both the beginning , the end and at cursor location , a simple structure such as prefix tree can not be used for matching , which could be a problem for large databases .
Arbitrary matching based on regular expressions can be done of course , but it is computationally more expensive .
Additionally , fuzzy matching can also be allowed , to correct misspellings , as Google Suggest does .
I appreciate all the comments and suggestions on reddit and news.yc .
In particular , " zem " and " yxhuvud " on reddit pointed me to the " gaddag " data structure aimed at solving a similar problem when filling in crossword puzzles or playing scrabble .
EDIT : 2010
As of now , Google has a new autocomplete behavior on their main search page which is more advanced than the earlier Google Suggest and seems to solve most of the problems discussed in this write - up , and more .
For example the " Italia| football team " example works as expected ( it seems however , that not the cursor location itself is used ) .
Between July 2008 and July 2010 this write - up has been viewed close to half a million times and it has been covered on some usability blogs .
I wonder if anyone picked up the idea of this post and implemented it in some system .
In the applications mentioned in this post or in other applications I am aware of , as of 2010 ( EDIT : 2014 ) no such feature is observable .

PARIS  Iran ’s Revolutionary Guards test - fired nine missiles in war - game maneuvers on Wednesday , including at least one the government in Tehran described as having the range to reach Israel .
The tests drew sharp American criticism and came a day after the Iranians threatened to retaliate against Israel and the United States if attacked .
State - run media said the missiles were long - and medium - range weapons , and included a Shahab - 3 , which Tehran maintains is able to hit targets up to 1,250 miles away from its firing position .
Parts of western Iran are within 650 miles of Tel Aviv .
The tests , shown on Iranian television , coincided with increasingly tense exchanges with the West over Tehran ’s nuclear program , which Iran said is for civilian purposes but which many Western governments suspect is aimed at building nuclear weapons .
On Tuesday , the United States and the Czech Republic signed an accord to allow the Pentagon to deploy part of its contentious antiballistic missile shield , which Washington maintains is intended to protect in part against Iranian missiles .
Every year around this time , an email circulates across the Internet speculating that on August 27th , Mars will look as big as the Moon in the sky .
And every year , I go ahead and debunk it .
Here ’s a link to last year ’s version .
Once again , I ’d like to inoculate all my Universe Today readers , to make sure you understand what ’s going on , and you ’re prepared to explain to your eager friends why this non-event is n’t going to happen .
Say it with me .
Mars wo n’t look as big as the Moon on August 27th .
This strange hoax first surfaced on the Internet back in 2003 .
An email made the rounds with the following text :
The Red Planet is about to be spectacular !
This month and next , Earth is catching up with Mars in an encounter that will culminate in the closest approach between the two planets in recorded history .
The next time Mars may come this close is in 2287 .
Due to the way Jupiter ’s gravity tugs on Mars and perturbs its orbit , astronomers can only be certain that Mars has not come this close to Earth in the Last 5,000 years , but it may be as long as 60,000 years before it happens again .
The encounter will culminate on August 27th when Mars comes to within 34,649,589 miles of Earth and will be ( next to the moon ) the brightest object in the night sky .
It will attain a magnitude of - 2.9 and will appear 25.11 arc seconds wide .
At a modest 75 - power magnification Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye .
By the end of August when the two planets are closest , Mars will rise at nightfall and reach its highest point in the sky at 12:30 a.m .
That ’s pretty convenient to see something that no human being has seen in recorded history .
So , mark your calendar at the beginning of August to see Mars grow progressively brighter and brighter throughout the month .
Share this with your children and grandchildren .
NO ONE ALIVE TODAY WILL EVER SEE THIS AGAIN
There are a few problems with this .
The first problem is that the email does n’t actually mention the date ; it just says August 27th .
This means it can live on for years and years , going around and around the Internet , forwarded by gullible people to their friends .
The second problem is that it ’s wrong .
Mars is n’t going to be making a close approach on August 27 .
The close approach this email is discussing happened back in 2003 .
It did indeed get closer than it had in at least 50,000 years , but this was a very small amount .
On August 27th , 2003 , Mars closed to a distance of only 55,758,006 kilometers ( 34,646,418 miles ) .
The Moon , by comparison , orbits the Earth at a distance of only 385,000 km ( 240,000 miles ) .
Mars was close , but it was still 144 times further away than the Moon .
Instead of appearing as a huge red orb in the sky , Mars looked like a bright red star .
Observers around the world set up their telescopes , and took advantage of this close encounter .
But you still needed a telescope .
And if you read the email carefully again , you ’ll see that it ’s trying to explain that .
There ’s an extra paragraph break .
The last sentence of second paragraph is hanging .
It says , “ At a modest 75 - power magnification “ , but there ’s no period .
The next paragraph starts up with the text , “ Mars will look as large as the full moon to the naked eye . ”
In other words , if you put one eye into the telescope and looked at Mars , and kept your other eye looking at the Moon ( which is n’t actually humanly possible ) , the two orbs would look roughly the same size .
Mars and Earth do come together every two years , reaching the closest point on their orbits – astronomers call this “ opposition ” .
And we ’re in one of those years .
But it ’s not going to happen on August 27th .
Instead , we ’ll make our opposition on December 18th , 2007 .
At this point , Mars will be 88.42 million km ( 55 million miles ) – further away than its 2003 opposition .
NASA is taking advantage of the upcoming opposition , and will launch the Phoenix Mars Lander in August .
The spacecraft will make its shortest possible journey to reach Mars , arriving early next year .
And by next July , it ’ll be time to write this article all over again .

Environmental Graffiti should get the award for “ worst possible bar chart ever ” for this unbelievable piece of art …
Who said bar charts are only for serious data interpretation , they can be used to have such fun 🙂
Also read Garr Reynold ’s comments on this as well .
Happy Thursday .. 🙂
As any military historian will testify , among the most difficult of maneuvers is the strategic retreat .
Napoleon ’s retreat from Moscow , Lee ’s retreat to Appomattox and MacArthur ’s retreat from the Yalu come to mind .
The British Empire abandoned India in 1947  and a Muslim - Hindu bloodbath ensued .
France ’s departure from Indochina was ignominious , and her abandonment of hundreds of thousands of faithful Algerians to the FALN disgraceful .
Few Americans can forget the humiliation of Saigon ’ 75 , or the boat people , or the Cambodian holocaust .
Strategic retreats that turn into routs are often the result of what Lord Salisbury called “ the commonest error in politics … sticking to the carcass of dead policies . ”
From 1989 to 1991 , with the collapse of the Soviet Empire and breakup of the U.S.S.R. , America had an opportunity to lay down its global burden and become again what Jeane Kirkpatrick called “ a normal country in a normal time . ”
We let the opportunity pass by , opting instead to use our wealth and power to convert the world to democratic capitalism .
And we have reaped the reward of all the other empires that went before :
A sinking currency , relative decline , universal enmity , a series of what Rudyard Kipling called “ the savage wars of peace . ”
Yet , opportunity has come anew for America to shed its imperial burden and become again the republic of our fathers .
The chairman of Chiang Kai - shek ’s Kuomintang Party has just been hosted for six days by Beijing .
Commercial flights have begun between Taipei and the mainland .
Is not the time ripe for America to declare our job done , that the relationship between China and Taiwan is no longer a vital interest of the United States ?
Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki ’s government wants a status of forces agreement with a timetable for full withdrawal of U.S. troops .
Is it not time to say yes , to declare that full withdrawal is our goal as well , that the United States seeks no permanent bases in Iraq ?
On July 4 , Reuters , in a story headlined “ Poland Rejects U.S. Missile Offer , ” reported from Warsaw : “ Poland spurned as insufficient on Friday a U.S. offer to boost its air defenses in return for basing anti-missile interceptors on its soil . …
” ‘ We have not reached a satisfactory result on the issue of increasing the level of Polish security , ’ Prime Minister Donald Tusk told a news conference after studying the latest U.S. proposal . ”
Tusk is demanding that America “ provide billions of dollars worth of U.S. investment to upgrade Polish air defenses in return for hosting 10 two - stage missile interceptors , ” said Reuters .
Reflect if you will on what is going on here .
By bringing Poland into NATO , we agreed to defend her against the world ’s largest nation , Russia , with thousands of nuclear weapons .
Now the Polish regime is refusing us permission to site 10 anti-missile missiles on Polish soil , unless we pay Poland billions for the privilege .
Has Uncle Sam gone senile ?
No .
Tusk has Sam figured out .
The old boy is so desperate to continue in his Cold War role as the world ’s Defender of Democracy he will even pay the Europeans  to defend Europe .
Why not tell Tusk that if he wants an air defense system , he can buy it ; that we Americans are no longer willing to pay Poland for the privilege of defending Poland ; that the anti-missile missile deal is off .
And use cancelation of the missile shield to repair relations with a far larger and more important power , Vladimir Putin ’s Russia .
Consider , too , the opening South Korea is giving us to end our 60 - year commitment to defend her against the North .
For weeks ,
Seoul hosted anti-American protests against a trade deal that allows U.S. beef into South Korea .
Koreans say they fear mad - cow disease .
Yet , when a new deal was cut to limit imports to U.S. beef from cattle less than 30 months old , that too was rejected by the protesters .
Behind the demonstrations lies a sediment of anti-Americanism .
In 2002 , a Pew Research Center survey of 42 nations found 44 percent of South Koreans , second highest number of any country , holding an unfavorable view of the United States .
A Korean survey put the figure at 53 percent , with 80 percent of youth holding a negative view .
By 39 percent to 35 percent , South Koreans saw the United States as a greater threat than North Korea .
Can someone explain why we keep 30,000 troops on the DMZ of a nation whose people do not even like us ?
The raison d’etre for NATO was the Red Army on the Elbe .
It disappeared two decades ago .
The Chinese army left North Korea 50 years ago .
Yet NATO endures and the U.S. Army stands on the DMZ .
Why ?
Because , if all U.S. troops were brought home from Europe and Korea , 10,000 rice bowls would be broken .
They are the rice bowls of politicians , diplomats , generals , journalists and think tanks who would all have to find another line of work .
And that is why the Empire will endure until disaster befalls it , as it did all the others .
Findings of a three - year study by researchers at the University of California , Riverside and the University of Florida , Gainesville run counter to the popular belief that women have better language skills than men .
In a study of 200 university students , the researchers found that women and men performed similarly on tests of language and reading skills .
Differences in brain organization between men and women may be driven by sex differences in brain size , they said .
“ People have said women have relatively larger language areas of the brain , ” said Christine Chiarello , UCR professor of psychology .
“ In none of our language tasks were women better than men .
When you account for differences in brain size between men and women there are few differences in the relative size of areas .
While there are differences between men and women , those differences are minimal compared to the wide range of individual differences in both sexes . ”
The study , “ Size Matters : Cerebral Volume Influences Sex Differences in Neuroanatomy , ” was published recently in the journal Cerebral Cortex .
The researchers gathered demographic data , tested language and reading skills , and performed magnetic resonance imaging to map brain structures of 100 female students and 100 male students .
The men and women were similar in age , parental education and proportion of students who were right - or left - handed .
There were great individual differences in brain organization , brain size and where language and speech are processed , Chiarello said .
For most people , speech and language are processed in the left half of the brain .
Differences in brain size account for much of the variance in brain structure size that at first glance might appear to be attributable to sex , Chiarello said .
On average , the brains of men in the study were 13 percent larger than the women .
Men and women “ confront similar cognitive challenges using differently sized neural machinery , ” the researchers wrote .
Their findings imply that “ any sex - specific adaptations to overall brain size are not associated with large relative differences in the size of various cerebral regions .
In this respect , our results suggest that brain size matters more than sex . ”
Study co-authors include Chiarello ; Christiana M. Leonard and Stephen Towler of the Evelyn F. and William L. McKnight Brain Institute of the University of Florida ; UCR graduate students Suzanne Welcome and Laura K. Halderman ; Ron Otto of the Computerized Diagnostic Imaging Center , Riverside ; and Mark A. Eckert of the Medical University of North Carolina .

Australia 's government has launched an ambitious effort to build a new fiber - to - the - node national network that will provide at least 12 M bps connections to 98 percent of Australia 's population .
The two percent who wo n't have access will be covered under a program called the " Australian Broadband Guarantee " that provides funds to ISPs working in underserved areas .
( Note to US regulators : this is what 's known as a " national broadband strategy . " )
The national government plans to spend up to AUS $ 4.7 billion on the project , which certainly is n't enough to fund the network .
The money is intended more as an incentive ; the network will be built and operated by a private company that will invest substantial capital of its own , but the government stake is intended to 1 ) make sure that a national fiber network gets built , 2 ) that it reaches almost everyone , and 3 ) that it functions in the public interest .
This could go wrong in plenty of ways , of course .
The company that wins the bid will certainly lean on regulators to let it operate with few regulations and open access rules , something already visible in incumbent telco Telstra 's submission to the government ( PDF ) .
Telstra wants to build the network , but it also wants the government to ease up on the open access rules that could force the operator to separate its wholesale and retail businesses ; there might not be enough return on investment , otherwise .
The Competitive Carriers ' Coalition , which represents the small ISPs which need wholesale access to the new network , calls Telstra 's proposal " obscene " ( PDF ) when it will be funded in part with taxes .
In fact , says the group , the money does n't really matter .
What 's important is the network rules , since it 's unlikely that a second , competitive national broadband network will be built in the near future .
The CCA 's vision of an open - access fiber network fits with the comments filed by both Google and the Government of Queensland .
Google 's interest in broadband has become apparent all over the world , as Google tells any regulators who will listen that it got its start on an open network ( broadband also lets more people access Google 's services , of course , and provides a larger ad audience ) .
The company wants to see open , nondiscriminatory , wholesale access to the fiber network , but it also has special interest in traffic management .
Google points out ( PDF ) that Australians are already one of the most " managed " countries in the world , with average broadband caps of 14.75 GB per month .
In addition , providers routinely offer access to " unmetered " services that they own or that they have done a deal with .
On the new fiber network , Google wants these sort of arrangements to end .
Queensland 's vision of the future
The Government of Queensland agrees ( PDF ) with the need for open access , but it wants a further restriction : the network operator wo n't be able to offer retail service of its own .
This should ensure it treats all ISPs equally , though potential network builders are sure to complain that this wo n't allow them to make enough cash .
Furthermore , Queensland suggests that all new construction get fiber - to - the - home , not just to the node .
The government wants the network completed on an aggressive timetable over the next few years .
Its willingness to provide cash , leadership , and a regulatory regime for the new fiber network could ensure good - quality connections for most Australians , though because of its geographical isolation , bandwidth costs might still remain among the most expensive in the world ( Australia has only a few international cables that handle Internet traffic ) .
In countries that are committed to surging ahead with broadband , a rough consensus appears to be forming : fiber backbones , mandatory wholesale access , and government leadership .
We 've seen it in countries like Japan , Sweden , and Australia , among others , and many other countries still mandate line - sharing , like the UK and Canada .
The US now sticks out for ditching its line - sharing rules and for having no national broadband push or universal service regime for broadband .
States like California , Kentucky , and North Carolina are hashing out their own solutions , and Congress is considering making broadband service eligible for money from the Universal Service Fund , but a national broadband strategy certainly would n't hurt .
And , if we could really have " big broadband " ( 100 Mbps ) and significant new competition for $ 100 billion , it would n't even be that expensive .
WASHINGTON - Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson sought to reassure an anxious public Sunday that the banking system is sound , while also bracing people for more troubled times ahead .
" I think it 's going to be months that we 're working our way through this period - clearly months , " he said .
Paulson said the number of troubled banks will increase as they struggle to cope with big losses on bad mortgages .
The government this month took over IndyMac after a run led it to become the largest regulated thrift to fail .
" Of course the list is going to grow longer given the stresses we have in the marketplace , given the housing correction .
But again , it 's a safe banking system , a sound banking system .
Our regulators are on top of it .
This is a very manageable situation , " he said in broadcast interviews .
Paulson used appearances on the Sunday talk shows to tell people that deposits up to $ 100,000 are fully insured .
He said no one has lost a single penny on an insured deposit in the 75 years that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has operated .
" We 're going through a challenging time with our economy .
This is a tough time .
The three big issues we 're facing right now are , first , the housing correction which is at the heart of the slowdown ; secondly , turmoil of the capital markets ; and thirdly , the high oil prices , which are going to prolong the slowdown , " he said .
" But remember , our economy has got very strong long - term fundamentals , solid fundamentals .
And you know , your policy - makers here , regulators , we 're being very vigilant . "
The secretary appeared on " Face the Nation " on CBS and " Late Edition " on CNN .
' UNDER THE SEA 3D ' ' UNDER THE SEA 3D ' VIDEO Q&A VIDEO Q&A NEW YORK  Indiana Jones , Batman and The Mummy may be the characters that come to mind when you think of movie icons angling to make a comeback at theaters this summer .
But the biggest marquee name promoting a sequel is n't fictional .
It 's IMAX .
The company known for its giant movie screens and rib-rocking sound has begun a construction boom that will increase the number of IMAX ( IMAX ) venues in North America nearly 80 % by the end of 2009 as it outfits new and old theaters alike with its proprietary digital projectors .
That 's part of a larger plan to win back the confidence of investors , theater owners , Hollywood studios and consumers following a period marked by steep losses , a failed effort to sell itself , and questions about the integrity of its financial reports when a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry led to restatements .
" Some people wrote us off as a dinosaur , " says co-CEO Richard Gelfond .
" They said , ' Until we see where IMAX is going , we do n't want to do business with them . ' "
The campaign by Gelfond and fellow co-CEO Bradley Wechsler will hit its stride in July when AMC Entertainment theaters in Baltimore and Washington , D.C. , open IMAX venues that will be the first to deploy its new digital projectors .
If the digital theaters appeal to the popcorn crowd — people typically pay an additional $ 3 per ticket for an IMAX film — then Hollywood studios likely will make more big releases available to IMAX .
They likely will find it especially appealing for the growing number of flicks being made in 3 - D. Potential blockbusters that will appear in IMAX this year include Speed Racer , Kung Fu Panda , The Dark Knight , and Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince ( which will include some scenes in 3 - D ) .
Next year 's slate includes a 3 - D version of DreamWorks Animation 's Monsters vs. Aliens .
IMAX also is talking to sports leagues — executives declined to say which ones — about beaming live broadcasts on the supersize screens .
" IMAX has developed a differentiated experience , which we like , " says AMC chief executive Peter Brown .
" We 'd like to have it be that you could come in to one of our ( multiplexes ) and have a variety of experiences at all sorts of different price points . "
Gelfond and Wechsler hope other theater owners will share that view :
Their company can grow only if exhibitors cut deals to have them build new IMAX theaters or retrofit existing ones .
It will take time to convince some skeptics that IMAX can pull off its ambitious transition to digital .
IMAX paid $ 17.1 million last year in interest on $ 160 million in long - term debt , which must be refinanced at the end of 2010 .
Those payments contributed to the 61 % growth in its 2007 net loss vs. 2006 to $ 26.9 million on revenue of $ 115.8 million , down 9.3 % .
" Solvency questions are the thrust of the bear story on the stock , " says Roth Capital Partners analyst Richard Ingrassia , who had soured on the company until last August .
" They still have a couple of quarters of hangover from the period when exhibitors were n't ordering anything and IMAX did n't have a digital product to offer them . "
IMAX may quell some of those concerns today when it unveils two deals providing access to as much as $ 36 million in additional funds , bringing its total spending power to about $ 55 million .
Its largest investor , Douglas Telecommunications founder Kevin Douglas , agreed to pay $ 18 million for 2.73 million new IMAX shares .
When that closes , expected later this week , Douglas will own nearly 20 % of IMAX .
As part of the private placement , he has agreed not to increase his ownership stake or seek a change in control for at least five years .
In addition , IMAX 's bank , Wachovia Capital Finance , increased its line of credit to as much as $ 30 million from $ 12 million currently and removed a covenant that required IMAX to generate an undisclosed amount of cash flow .
The company also said in its annual report that it 's addressing eight auditing problems identified by its accountants , PricewaterhouseCoopers .
Some analysts say that IMAX has already won back their confidence .
" At this point , they 're as clean as a whistle as they can be , " says Research Associates analyst Marla Backer .
She adds that IMAX 's resources to outfit new theaters " is not a concern in 2008 , 2009 and probably not in 2010 . "
During that period , she and others say , IMAX will generate sufficient cash to keep it from joining Cinerama and Cinemascope in the graveyard of widescreen movie formats .
Drama has been building for years " They 're getting great movies , " says Merriman Curhan Ford analyst Eric Wold .
" The new theater pace will be huge over the next two years .
And I predict them turning profitable in the fourth quarter and staying profitable ever after . "
That would be a suitably theatrical ending to a drama that started as early as 2000 .
" We knew that there was a structural flaw in our business model — prints were disproportionately expensive in IMAX , " Wechsler says .
Studio payments for " prints in the conventional ( film ) business are about $ 1,000 apiece .
In IMAX it 's $ 22,000 for a 2 - D print and $ 45,000 for a 3 - D print . "
What 's more , celluloid was starting to become anachronistic .
Hollywood studios and theaters are converting to digital with films delivered on relatively small hard drives .
" When you have platters ( for celluloid IMAX films ) that weigh 250 - to - 500 pounds , you need forklifts and storage , " Gelfond says , " It 's rather Rube Goldberg - esque . "
IMAX had to join the rest of the industry and convert to digital .
But it could n't just buy equipment designed for conventional theaters .
The bulbs , tiny mirrors and other mechanisms used in most digital projectors did n't generate enough light to completely illuminate IMAX screens .
" We had to wait for the technology to catch up , " Wechsler says .
" There were significant hurdles with something as simple as the color black , which is very important . "
Faced with that uncertainty , and with dwindling orders to build new IMAX venues , the co-CEOs in early 2006 hired Allen & Co. and UBS to look for a buyer .
" We felt that the changes ( at IMAX ) would have been painful in a public context , and we were right , " Gelfond says .
The pain became acute that August .
IMAX shares plummeted more than 40 % the day after it reported that it still had n't found a potential buyer — and that the SEC was investigating a possible accounting irregularity .
Regulators questioned IMAX 's decision to record revenue from theaters it was hired to build before they opened .
" It put tremendous internal stress on the organization , " Wechsler says .
" The time and effort involved ( to sort out the issues ) were a significant cash drain .
In terms of exterior perceptions , it was another cloud around IMAX . "
Some shareholders filed class - action lawsuits ; several are still pending .
Investors " had a huge short position ( a bet that IMAX shares would fall ) and we wanted to prove them wrong , " Gelfond says .
" The challenge was daunting , but there was only one way to go , which was up . "
A breakthrough to go digital
They needed a light to get IMAX out of that dark period , and around mid-2006 technicians seemed to have a promising solution to the screen - illumination problem .
They developed a process , and software , that fused and enhanced images from two projectors .
To preserve the trade secret , they called the technology a " flux capacitor " — a joking tribute to the device that made time travel possible in the 1985 hit Back to the Future .
The first big test for the $ 15 million development project took place in a Toronto warehouse .
The company created a makeshift IMAX theater and hired a research firm that invited people to watch a series of clips and answer the question :
Is this IMAX ?
Satisfied with the initial response , the company in mid-2007 made a deal with AMC to turn one of its screens in Toronto into an IMAX venue and show the prototype to technicians from studios and theater chains .
As the positive reviews rolled in , IMAX had to grapple with one more problem — and a big one at that :
Its business model had become obsolete .
IMAX required theater owners to pay the company about $ 1.6 million to build and equip a venue , and then let IMAX collect as much as 5 % of its ticket sales .
IMAX installs curved , wall - to - wall screens .
Seats also are configured to ensure that virtually everyone can see the entire image — which is especially important for 3 - D films .
But theater owners did n't want to take a risk on IMAX while it was in trouble , and following disappointing ticket sales for films including V for Vendetta , Poseidon , Ant Bully and Open Season .
Many questioned whether Hollywood would continue to make hit films available to IMAX .
To overcome theater owners ' jitters , IMAX offered to shoulder some of the construction costs and operate the screens as joint ventures .
IMAX gets close to half of the box office revenue , plus a cut of concession sales .
Deals start rolling in for IMAX AMC gave the digital and joint venture package a powerful endorsement with a deal that was unveiled in December .
It agreed to deploy its new digital projectors at 100 screens in 33 markets including New York , Los Angeles , Chicago , Washington and Miami .
In March , Regal , the No. 1 theater owner , agreed to joint ventures for 31 digital systems in 20 markets .
IMAX says that theaters like these deals because there are n't enough popular films to fill seats at the multiplexes .
With IMAX , " You 're bringing new people into the theater , " Gelfond says .
" The studios would n't give us 12½ % of the box office ( and exhibitors ) would n't give us 40 - something % of the revenue if they did n't believe that . "
The executives say that they 're talking with virtually every studio to score promising films .
The biggest titles currently scheduled come from Warner Bros. and DreamWorks .
There 's one prominent holdout : " Disney has been challenging for us , " Gelfond says .
IMAX was talking with Pixar before it was acquired by Disney , he adds , " so we 're hopeful that as Pixar 's influence increases at Disney , they 'll see the value of IMAX . "
For now , though , Gelfond and Wechsler say that the company has shifted its focus from dealmaking to the nuts - and - bolts work needed to get the new digital venues running .
Each one has a playbook with plans for everything from seat placement to ways IMAX movies should be marketed .
" One of my favorite sayings in life is , ' Good news is bad news , and bad news is good news — but you can't tell until later , ' " Gelfond says .
" No one believed that we could ( successfully go digital ) .
Well , now we 've done it .
And we and our shareholders will get the benefits . "

Police said the shooting is gang - related and may stem from threats reported in the neighborhood earlier in the day .
Investigators would not say whether the alleged threats were directed at the family of the little girl , but they did say it is unlikely she was the shooter 's target .
After Christopher Hitchens wrote a Slate article suggesting that waterboarding was n't really torture , readers suggested that he try it himself .
He did .
So what did it feel like ?
Hitchens recounts how he was lashed tightly to a sloping board , then , " on top of the hood , three layers of enveloping towel were added .
In this pregnant darkness , head downward , I waited until I abruptly felt a slow cascade of water going up my nose … I held my breath for a while and then had to exhale and – as you might expect – inhale in turn . "
That , he says , " brought the damp cloths tight against my nostrils , as if a huge , wet paw had been suddenly and annihilatingly clamped over my face .
Unable to determine whether I was breathing in or out , flooded more with sheer panic than with water , I triggered the pre-arranged signal " and felt the " unbelievable relief " of being pulled upright .
The " official lie " about waterboarding , Hitchens says , is that it " simulates the feeling of drowning " .
In fact , " you are drowning – or rather , being drowned " .
He rehearses the intellectual arguments , both for ( " It 's nothing compared to what they do to us " ) and against ( " It opens a door that can't be closed " ) .
But the Hitch 's thoroughly empirical conclusion is simple .
As Vanity Fair 's title puts it : " Believe me , it 's torture . "
LOS ANGELES ( AP ) --
This was how the Boston Celtics of yesteryear -- Cous and Russell and Bird and Hondo and the Chief -- would do it .
Digging deep , they fought for every loose ball , scrapping with grit and guts , champions clad in green .
These Celtics are no different .
And they are just one win from another NBA title .
" Yeah , " Kevin Garnett said .
" I can taste it . "
In their comeback season , Boston saved its biggest one of all for the finals .
The Celtics rallied from a 24 - point deficit and beat the Los Angeles Lakers 97- 91 on Thursday night to take a commanding 3 - 1 lead in this history - rich series and move within one victory of a 17th championship that seemed impossible a year ago .
" I do n't want to get overjoyed , " Paul Pierce said .
" I want to go out there to try and win Game 5 on Father 's Day and then I 'll be able to breathe .
Right now , I 'm waiting to exhale . "
He 's not alone .
A rivalry between the league 's two most storied franchises -- with some of the game 's biggest names and biggest moments -- now has a rally for the ages .
No team had ever overcome more than a 15 - point deficit after the first quarter , and Elias Sports Bureau said it was the largest comeback in the finals since 1971 .
One thing 's for sure , it will forever be remembered in the annals of Celtics - Lakers lore .
When the final horn sounded , Pierce , an L.A. kid playing in front of family and friends , doubled over in exhaustion and exuberance .
The Celtics , the team he stuck with through 10 years , including a 24 - win season in 2006 - 07 , had done the impossible .
" It 's definitely a great win , one that you 're going to put up there in the library and break back out one day for your kids to watch , " Pierce said .
" But I want nothing more than that ring right now . "
Pierce scored 20 points , Garnett had 16 points and 11 rebounds and Ray Allen had 19 points , two coming on a marvelous reverse layup in the fourth as Boston 's Big Three , thrown together last summer by general manager Danny Ainge to revive a franchise accustomed to hanging banners from the rafters , put the Lakers on the brink of a summer vacation .
It took an epic comeback to do it , and now the Celtics can reclaim their place atop pro basketball with a win in Game 5 on Sunday night in Los Angeles .
No team has ever recovered from a 3 - 1 deficit in the finals .
Kobe Bryant scored 19 points on 6 - of - 19 shooting but the league 's MVP could n't rescue the Lakers when they needed him most .
Lamar Odom had 19 points -- 15 in the first half -- and Pau Gasol , whose addition in a midseason trade was supposed to give the Lakers their final piece to complement Bryant , had 17 points and 10 rebounds .
Trailing by 18 points at halftime and seemingly done when they fell behind by 20 with 6:04 left in the third quarter , the Celtics outscored the Lakers 31 - 15 in the third quarter to pull within 73 - 71 going into the fourth .
The remarkable rally was reminiscent of what Los Angeles did in Game 2 , when the Lakers trimmed a 24 - point deficit to two in the fourth quarter before the Celtics regrouped to open a 2 - 0 lead .
But Boston had another 12 minutes to finish off theirs , and the green - and - white did .
" Some turnaround in that game .
The air went out of the building , " said Lakers coach Phil Jackson , who was asked what he told his club afterward .
" Well , it 's not over .
This is not over .
The series is not over . "
Boston 's comeback included a 21 - 3 run over the final five minutes , fueled by two 3 - pointers from Eddie House , who was getting more playing time because of Rajon Rondo 's tender left ankle .
The Celtics were still down by double digits with 2 minutes left in the third but closed the quarter with a 10 - 1 run , capped by P.J. Brown 's dunk -- a slam that could be felt all the way back to Boston 's North End .
The Celtics finally caught the Lakers at 73 - all on Leon Powe 's jumper in the lane with 9:05 remaining , tying the score for the first time since it was 2 - 2 in the first minute .
At that point , the Lakers looked lost , confused , you name it .
And when House hit an 18 - foot jumper with 4:07 remaining , the Celtics had their first lead , 84 - 83 .
Boston 's bench erupted , Lakers fans gasped and it was just a matter of time before they were heading out of Staples Center wondering what went wrong .
Allen , one of the game 's purest shooters , then drove to the basket and made a reverse layup as dramatic as the Celtics ' comeback .
" It was huge , " Boston coach Doc Rivers said .
" It was really supposed to be a middle pick - and - roll with Kevin and Ray , and Ray waved Kevin off because he liked the matchup that he had already , so he did n't want to bring another defender in to help .
It was a great call by Ray .
The layup was just tremendous . "
Bryant , who except for a 36 - point performance in Game 3 has been an ordinary superstar in his try for a fourth championship ring , did n't score in the first half .
He tried to rally the Lakers and got them within 89 - 87 with one of his patented twisting layups .
But James Posey drilled a 3 - pointer for Boston to make it 92 - 87 with 1:13 left .
Derek Fisher 's long jumper got the Lakers within three .
But Pierce was fouled and made two free throws , forcing Jackson to call a timeout with 47 seconds to go .
As the Lakers headed toward their bench , Pierce pumped his fists , flexed his muscles and let out a yell .
At the other end of the court , Bryant hung his head .
" They were determined not to let me beat them tonight , " he said .
" I saw three , four bodies every time I touched the ball . "
Surrounded by Hollywood stars on their own back lot sound stage , the Lakers were seeking their 10th straight win at home in the postseason and were about to drop the " if necessary " tag from Game 6 .
Now , they have to hope they can force the series back to Boston .
For the third time in this series , commissioner David Stern met with the media before the game .
It was an unusual step for the league 's long - tenured leader , who went on the offensive to defend the integrity of NBA officials under fire in the Tim Donaghy scandal .
Maybe the next investigation should focus on what happened to the Celtics in the first quarter .
L.A's crowd , notorious for arriving late , leaving early and spending more time text messaging and talking on cell phones than clapping , was much more involved than in Game 3 .
They roared when Lakers Hall of Fame center Kareem Abdul - Jabbar presented the game ball to officials and were on their feet when Los Angeles blasted to a 16 - 6 lead .
By then , Odom had scored eight points , doubling his total from Game 3 and the enigmatic forward finished the first quarter having made all six field goal attempts and scoring 13 points .
Moments later , Garnett went out with his second personal , and with the NBA 's best defender on the bench , the Lakers ran wild .
Odom made consecutive jumpers from the top of the key to put Los Angeles ahead 26 - 7 .
The Lakers eventually pushed their lead to 45 - 21 when Sasha Vujacic , whose 20 points sparked his team in Game 3 , nailed a 3 - pointer and it was the Boston Massacre , West Coast style .
But the Celtics would n't quit .
" Once we got the lead , obviously , we were thrilled to death , " Rivers said .
" As far as we were down , nothing was going right for us , and we just hung in there . "
Game notes
Some of Hollywood 's brightest stars glimmered , including the usuals : Jack Nicholson , Denzel Washington and Dyan Cannon .
They were joined by former NFL star Jerry Rice , actress Jennifer Garner with husband Ben Affleck , singer Justin Timberlake and Arizona quarterback Matt Leinart .
...
The Celtics and Lakers finished with the best records in their respective conferences .
It 's the first time teams with the top marks have met in the finals since Indiana and Los Angeles in 2000 .
The last team to have the league 's top record and win the title was San Antonio in 2003 .

Two hours before tipoff , two seats in the lower bowl were going for $ 3,500 apiece through an on - line ticket brokerage .
ISFAHAN , Iran ( Reuters ) -
The oil market is plentifully supplied and the rally to record high prices is “ fake and imposed ” , Iran ’s president said on Tuesday , blaming a weak U.S. dollar which he said was being pushed down on purpose .

“ At a time when the growth of consumption is lower than the growth of production and the market is full of oil , prices are rising and this trend is completely fake and imposed , ” President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in a televised speech .
“ It is very clear that visible and invisible hands are controlling prices in a fake way with political and economic aims , ” he said when opening a meeting of the OPEC Fund for International Development in the central city of Isfahan .
With high fuel prices sparking protests worldwide , Iran ’s anti-U.S. president also took aim at high energy taxes in consumer nations .
He said there was an “ unfair ” difference in income between energy exporting and importing countries .
Iran , the world ’s fourth - largest oil exporter , has repeatedly said the market is well - supplied and blames rising prices on speculation , a weak dollar and geopolitical tension .
The Islamic Republic is embroiled in a deepening standoff with Western powers over its nuclear plans , which the United States suspects is aimed at making bombs .
Tehran denies this .
Iran has often said it sees no need for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) to boost output , as the United States and other big oil consumers want .
“ As you know the decrease in the dollar ’s value and the increase in energy prices are two sides of the same coin which are being introduced as factors behind the recent instability , ” said Ahmadinejad .
Saudi Arabia plans to lift output to 9.7 million barrels per day ( bpd ) in July , United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon said on Sunday after meeting Saudi Oil Minister Ali al - Naimi .
That would be a rise of 550,000 bpd or over 6 percent since May and would take Saudi crude output to its highest monthly rate since August 1981 , according to U.S. Energy Information Administration data .
“ WRONG ”
But a senior Iranian oil official , Hojjatollah Ghanimifard , was quoted as saying that increasing production by even 500,000 bpd would “ not create a balance in prices . ”
Iran ’s OPEC governor said any output increase should be ratified by the oil group ’s ministers .
“ If Saudi Arabia acts to increase its output unilaterally it is a wrong thing , ” Mohammad Ali Khatibi was quoted as saying by the state broadcaster .
Oil fell $ 2 on Tuesday after touching a record near $ 140 the previous day , when prices see - sawed in a $ 7 range on Monday , supported by the weak U.S. dollar and pressured by Saudi Arabia ’s plans to raise output .
Ahmadinejad reiterated his view that oil should be sold in a basket of currencies rather than dollars , an idea which has failed to win over other OPEC members , except Venezuela .
“ The ever - increasing decrease in the dollar ’s value is one of the world ’s major problems , ” he said .
He expressed support for a proposal by Venezuela ’s President Hugo Chavez to create a bank constituted by OPEC members to act as a counterweight to U.S. influence in the world .
He also advocated the establishment of an oil bourse .
Iran has for more than two years been increasing its sales of oil in currencies other than the dollar , saying the weak U.S. unit is eroding its purchasing power .
Ahmadinejad , who has called the dollar a “ worthless piece of paper ” , suggested a part of its decline was deliberate , without naming any country .
“ The planners for some big powers are acting to decrease the dollar ’s value , ” he said .
“ For years they imposed inflation and their own economic problems on other nations by injecting the dollar without any support to the global economy . ”
TULSA — While dog-sitting for his mother earlier this month , Bryan Whalen discovered video recordings of his mother and two other people engaging in sex acts with three dogs , according to an affidavit filed Monday in Tulsa County .
Authorities have charged Diane Whalen , 54 , and Donald Roy Seigfried , 55 , with crimes against nature , a felony that includes bestiality , said Capt .
John Bowman of the Tulsa County sheriff 's office .
Seigfried was arrested and released Tuesday on $ 10,000 bail .
Bowman said Whalen had not been arrested , but authorities were in contact with her lawyer .
Bryan Whalen was feeding and taking care of his mother 's dogs when he stumbled on the tapes June 1 and then turned them over to the sheriff 's office , according to the affidavit .
Diane Whalen was in the hospital at the time , according to the document .
She had complained of possible food poisoning , but the illness turned out to be appendicitis , which required surgery , the court record says .
Bryan Whalen said he and his girlfriend found the tapes in a storage case while he was looking for medications that his mother 's doctor had requested , the affidavit says .
It appears as though Diane Whalen was attempting to sell the videos over the Internet , according to the affidavit .
Bryan Whalen turned in more than 200 pieces of evidence from the home .
After subsequent searchers of the home , authorities found 193 CD - ROMs and DVDs , 67 VHS tapes , 12 cassette tapes , two floppy discs , two computer flash drives and one photo album showing the sex acts , according to the document .
Bryan Whalen also turned in a tripod and video lighting equipment , and it appears the videos were shot at Diane Whalen 's home , according to the affidavit .
The affidavit says Diane Whalen is shown on the tapes engaging in sexual acts with dogs .
The affidavit alleges Diane Whalen was selling the videos through e-mails and instant messages .
Two members of the Whalen family contacted Wednesday declined to comment for this story .
European leaders said they had no " plan B " if the treaty was rejected Substantial vote tallies across Ireland show the European Union Lisbon reform treaty has been rejected , Irish Justice Minister Dermot Ahern has said .
European Commission head Jose Manuel Barroso said all indications were that Ireland had indeed rejected the treaty .
He called for other states to continue their ratification processes and said a solution should be sought .
The treaty must be ratified by all 27 members .
Only Ireland has held a public vote on it .
With results in from 39 of 43 constituencies , the No campaign was ahead by 53.6 % to 46.4 % , state broadcaster RTE reported .
Mr Ahern was the first senior figure from the Irish government to admit that it looked like the treaty had failed .
" It looks like this will be a No vote , " Mr Ahern said on live television .
" At the end of the day , for a myriad of reasons , the people have spoken . "
Obviously it 's disappointing .
It 's quite clear there 's a very substantial No vote
Dermot Ahern , Justice Minister
Q&A : Irish referendum Mark Mardell 's Euroblog
In quotes : Referendum reaction
He said it looked like other EU countries would ratify the treaty , so an Irish No vote would leave the EU in " uncharted waters " .
Mr Barroso said he had spoken to Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen and agreed with him that this was not a vote against the EU .
" Ireland remains committed to a strong Europe , " he said .
" Ratifications should continue to take their course . "
Mr Barroso said EU leaders would have to decide at a summit next week how to proceed .
The people of Ireland have shown enormous courage and wisdom in analysing the facts presented to them and making the decision they have
Declan Ganley , Libertas
UK to press ahead Send us your comments However , the BBC's Oana Lungescu in Brussels says the third failed referendum in three years on the EU 's reform plans is bound to undermine the bloc 's public legitimacy and dent its confidence when it faces other big players on the world stage .
France and Germany quickly issued a joint statement expressing regret over the Irish result .
European leaders earlier said they had no " plan B " for how to proceed if Ireland 's electorate voted No. Declan Ganley of the anti-treaty lobby group Libertas said that if the No vote had indeed triumphed that it was " a great day for Ireland " .
" The people of Ireland have shown enormous courage and wisdom in analysing the facts presented to them and making the decision they have , " Mr Ganley said .
The No campaign was a broad coalition ranging from Libertas to Sinn Fein , the only party in parliament to oppose the treaty .
Confusion Correspondents say many voters did not understand the treaty despite a high - profile campaign led by Mr Cowen , which had the support of most of the country 's main parties .

Mr Cowen accused the No camp of " misrepresentation " , saying voters had voiced concern about " issues that clearly were n't in the treaty at all " , the Irish Times reported .
Turnout is said to have been about 45 % .
Commentators had predicted that a low turnout figure would suggest a rejection .
The treaty , which is designed to help the EU cope with its expansion into eastern Europe , provides for a streamlining of the European Commission , the removal of the national veto in more policy areas , a new president of the European Council and a strengthened foreign affairs post .
The treaty is due to come into force on 1 January 2009 .
Fourteen countries out of the 27 have completed ratification so far .
The Lisbon Treaty replaces a more ambitious draft constitution that was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 .
Just over three million Irish voters are registered - in a European Union of 490 million people .
In 2001 , Irish voters almost wrecked EU plans to expand eastwards when they rejected the Nice treaty .
It was only passed in a much - criticised second vote .

In New York City , where taking illegal handguns off the streets is high on the mayor ’s agenda , thousands of firearms make it into the hands of law enforcement officers each year .
Once they ’ve been seized in crimes , whether after long and ignominious careers or short but violent ones , and once their owners have been prosecuted , the guns must be destroyed , never to be used again .
The New York field office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives periodically takes the guns it gathers to an industrial stretch of road in Westchester County , about 20 miles north of Manhattan , to a scrap metal processing plant in Elmsford , N.Y .
There they are chopped up into tiny pieces and sold for about 25 cents a pound .
In the words of federal agents , it is where guns go to die .
Their steel remains are shipped to foundries as near as New Jersey or as far as China , India or Turkey , said Daniel J. Graap , 39 , the co-owner of the plant , Brookfield Metal Company .
The steel is ultimately used to build , say , iron water pipes , reinforcement bars , chain - link fences or appliances .

At least 60 people have been killed and more than 150 wounded after a series of bomb blasts tore through the city of Jaipur in western India , officials say .
The bombs went off near historic monuments in the crowded old city at one of the busiest times of the day .
The head of state police said it was a terrorist attack .
Reports suggest the death toll could rise .
Jaipur , in Rajasthan , is a popular tourist destination about 260 km ( 160 miles ) from the Indian capital , Delhi .
No group has admitted planting bombs in Jaipur .
It is not yet clear what the motive for attacking the city might be .
Most people in Jaipur are Hindus but the city has a large Muslim minority .
Correspondents say it has no history of religious violence .
There have been sporadic bomb attacks around India in recent years .
The police have had little success in bringing prosecutions .
Crowded markets
Up to seven blasts were heard in the heart of Jaipur , capital of Rajasthan state , starting at around 1915 local time ( 1345 GMT ) .
Each came a few minutes apart and eyewitnesses spoke of panic and then a stampede in the crowded old walled city .
Television pictures showed scenes of twisted debris and pools of blood on the streets .
RECENT BOMB ATTACKS
August 2007 : Bombs in open - air auditorium and restaurant in Hyderabad kill more than 40 May 2007 : Bomb in historic Hyderabad mosque kills 14 February 2007 : Twin blasts on train travelling from Delhi to Pakistan kills at least 66 people near Panipat July 2006 : More than 160 killed by seven bombs on train network in Mumbai March 2006 : Bombs at Hindu temple and railway station in Varanasi kill 15 October 2005 :
Three blasts in Delhi kill 62
In pictures : Jaipur bombings " I heard a deafening noise and I thought it was a [ gas ] cylinder blast , " Hemanth Modi said .
" There was smoke and I could not find my son .
Then I found him , " he told NDTV news channel .
" According to the information I have received 60 people have died and 150 have been injured , " said Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje .
A BBC correspondent at the main hospital in Jaipur says doctors there say they have counted 45 bodies brought to them .
Medical authorities have appealed for blood donations for the injured .
Police reinforcements have been deployed in the city to maintain order .
Seven bombs were placed in cars or shops , including in several markets , police said .
An eighth was defused .
One exploded close to Jaipur 's most famous landmark , the historic Hawa Mahal , or palace of winds .
" It 's a terror attack .
There was no [ intelligence ] report of this , " police director general AS Gill told reporters .
" The way it has been done , the attempt was to cause the maximum damage to human life , " he added .
Security has been stepped up at airports and railway stations across the country , officials said .
Indian President Pratibha Patil and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh condemned the attacks and the prime minister appealed for calm .
Jaipur is an extremely popular stop on India 's primary tourist circuit known as " The Golden Triangle " , which takes in other historic sites of Rajasthan and the Taj Mahal in Uttar Pradesh state .
It is known as the Pink City , for the colour of its forts , palaces and city walls .
On Tuesdays many devotees flock to a popular shrine in Jaipur 's old city .

Plan To Build The World 's First Zero- Waste , Zero-Carbon City Gets Financial Backing
July 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
General Electric and Mubadala Development have just announced a multi-billion dollar partnership that will give a huge financial boost to a plan to develop a clean - energy walled city in the United Arab Emirates .
Masdar City , scheduled for completion in 2015 , will get all of its energy from sustainable sources , and will create zero net greenhouse gas emissions .
It will also be completely car - free .
As part of its partnership with Mubadala , GE will fund a giant research center in the heart of the city that will house a think tank of technologists working to develop sustainable energy and water technologies .
The company will also commit up to $ 50 million to Masdar ’s cleantech investment fund .
Abu Dhabi is n’t exactly known as a bastion of sustainability — it has one of the highest energy consumption rates in the world , and its man -made islands are n’t doing any favors for coral reefs , oysterbeds , and fish stock .
However , you have to give the UAE some credit .
In addition to Masdar City , Abu Dhabi has created the Estidama Initiative — an ambitious plan to make Abu Dhabi the sustainability capital of the Middle East .
It would certainly be interesting ( and ironic ) if the city managed to use its oil wealth to wean itself off non-renewable energy .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
English poetry began , for me , with Anne Boleyn's other man – or one of them , at least .
At the dawn of Renaissance verse in England , and at the heart of the lethal court of Henry VIII , Sir Thomas Wyatt turned his misadventures in love and politics into lyrics that still crackle with a sinister eroticism .
To a suburban teenager , the sulky sexiness of this voice that reached out from the 1530s struck like lightning – " once in special , / in thin array , after a pleasant guise /
When her loose gown did from her shoulders fall /
And she caught me in her arms long and small ... "
So , almost as fiercely , did its fearful strangeness : those candlelit flickers of guilt , conspiracy and dread that hinted at state terror lurking in the shadows of the bedchamber .
Did Wyatt ever sleep with Anne Boleyn ?
The king , who jailed him , spared his life after her fall – and any courtier subject to royal suspicion tended to find that head and body promptly parted company .
In any case , Wyatt – and the gifted teacher who brought him to me – ignited the flame of past , as well as present , poetry .
" And therewithal sweetly did me kiss /
And softly said , ' Dear heart , how like you this ? ' "
Such electric moments can make the poetry of distant times blaze with such heat and light that it vapourises every question of history , of form and technique .
All the solemn rigmarole of canons and traditions , of genres and influences , fades into a dreary background buzz .
Yet the poetry that endures always shows that spontaneity needs structure .
Poets who talk over the centuries about the most intimate feelings also keep up a constant dialogue with one another , and with their art .
Wyatt nods to the Italian love poetry of Petrarch .
And he recalls his home - grown master , Geoffrey Chaucer , too : Tom Paulin writes of this poem ( " They flee from me that sometime did me seek " ) that " Wyatt 's ear is still tuned to the alliterative rhythms of Middle English verse " .
Within , and behind , the throes of passion , the poetic professional hones the tools , checks the competition and refines the craft .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Tomorrow , The Independent print edition begins a series of 14 booklets devoted to " Great Classic Poets " in English .
They will be written by Michael Schmidt , professor of poetry at Glasgow University and a publisher of modern and classic poetry at Carcanet Press .
His ongoing books in the Story of Poetry series tell this never - ending tale of conversations between poets with unrivalled clarity and scope .
Readers could not wish for a better guide .
Yet critical talk of the ways in which great poets recruit and transform their predecessors ' work can deter poetry lovers .
They often prefer plain text to muffled context .
Besides , our ruling metaphors of poetic interchange somehow misfire .
" Influence " sounds dull , or medical ( too close to influenza ) .
" Canons " seem to fit in best with medieval church law .
" Tradition " and " heritage " fall like lead on modern ears .
Even in 1920 , when TS Eliot published his ground - breaking essay on " Tradition and the Individual Talent " , he knew that the concept had set him a steep uphill task .
" You can hardly make the word agreeable to English ears , " he grumbled , without some " comfortable reference to the reassuring science of archaeology " .
Modern variants such as " intertextuality " belong to the geeks on the rusting Star Trek bridge of academic theory .
As for " classic " poetry , Henry Miller 's Tropic of Cancer delivered a popular verdict : " Every man with a bellyful of the classics is an enemy to the human race " .
When the French theorist Roland Barthes deprecated the stuffy " classic " work in favour of texts that counted as " modern " , the peerless Frank Kermode nimbly riposted that what Barthes called modern , he would call " classic " .
And what Barthes called classic , he would call " dead " .
However defined , the line of English poetry that begins with Chaucer is not dead .
Even a verse epic four centuries older – Beowulf , whose sole Old English manuscript dates from around AD1000 – can still prompt a hi-tech blockbuster movie .
And Hollywood 's interest in the slayer of the monster Grendel ( and his mama ) would never have flickered into life had Seamus Heaney not published his flinty , gripping translation of the poem .
Turn to Heaney 's Beowulf , though , and you find that this canonical starting - point thinks of itself as a latecomer .
After our hero has despatched the monster , feasting revellers are entertained by a bard with his ear to history : " a carrier of tales / a traditional singer deeply schooled / in the lore of the past , linked a new theme / to strict metre " .
Even within his own poem , Beowulf 's feats take shape in time - honoured verse .
Eliot 's essay quips that " some one said : ' The dead writers are remote from us because we know so much more than they did . '
Precisely , and they are that which we know . "
More than a millennium ago , the Beowulf poet would have agreed .
So , in the classroom or at the multiplex , the canon survives .
But over the past century , its creation has come under closer scrutiny than ever .
Critics such as Eliot and Pound re-ordered the monuments as part of their own artistic mission : down with Shelley , up with Donne .
Feminist writers and critics cleared space for women ; their post - colonial counterparts for non-European authors – and so on , in a familiar tale of reclamation and renewal .
Now , the dust has in part settled on this labour of revision .
Yes , many poetic monuments have shifted position .
But , remarkably , almost all of them still stand .
Far from ushering in the slaughter of " dead white males " feared by right - wing punditry , the new canon has spread at the pace of a boom - time metropolis .
Within it , poets such as Kipling – dismissed not long ago as a tub - thumping throwback – attract more serious attention .
Philip Larkin has survived his spell in the critical dock ( on charges of misogyny and racism ) to beguile not only poets , but novelists such as Martin Amis and Ian McEwan .
Carol Ann Duffy , surely the best - loved living British poet , keeps up an endless dialogue with the " tradition " as she grapples with the words and thoughts of Larkin , Auden and others .
The title poem of her new collection for children , " The Hat " , embodies the history of English verse as it trips over time from skull to skull , mouth to mouth : " Whose head , whose head , whose will I settle on next ? "
Duffy 's game of pass - the - bardic - crown ends with Ted Hughes .
Many would now place it on her head .
This stubborn persistence of the canon enrages the poetic avant - garde .
In which case , these must be furious times for them .
Recently , one of the poetic bestsellers V C on Faber 's list has been a 600 - year - old verse narrative : Simon Armitage 's galloping new translation of the Arthurian myth - adventure , Sir Gawain and the Green Knight .
Armitage writes that , within a week , the idea of transforming Sir Gawain from Middle into Modern English had gone " from a fanciful notion to a superstitious ( and preposterous ) conviction that I was put on the planet for no other reason than to translate the poem " .
British poets do n't come much cooler than Armitage .
He will soon publish a memoir ( Gig ) about his thwarted rock - star ambitions and the happy blending of a pop sensibility with poetry in his life , and work .
It has nothing to say about Sir Gawain but plenty about Ian Curtis , Mark E Smith , Morrissey and other talents that a poet of today might admire .
From the " Gawain " poet to Ted Hughes and the Arctic Monkeys , Armitage can juggle inspirations and influences with even - handed glee .
You might call this post - modern eclecticism , or another sign of impatience with the limits imposed by poetic schools , cliques and movements .
Either way , the canon of English poetry is now visited by writers more often as a supermarket than as a shrine .
To a conservative such as Eliot , this pick - and - mix pluralism would have been anathema .
His canon outlined the descent of values as well as of verses .
Writing about Virgil , he could overtly link the shaping force of a " classical " poem with the sway of the Roman Empire and its marbled verities .
So today 's notion of the literary past as an open - all - hours superstore to be rifled and ransacked at will has few parallels in poetic history .
Revisions of the poetic canon now take the form of accretion , rather than substitution .
Where will it all end ?
Matthew Arnold was one of the first critics to fret about the fate of a consensual tradition in a commercial , populist age .
In some respects , his yearning for " sweetness and light " has triumphed .
Today , 140 years after his critique of the " Philistines " in Culture and Anarchy , state endorsement and support of the arts – including poetry – has surpassed his fondest mid-Victorian dreams .
Yet his own verse has grown into a temple of that hallowed past , ripe for expropriation by less reverent brands of bard .
Last year 's most acclaimed poetic debut was Daljit Nagra 's collection , Look We Have Coming to Dover !.
The title piece quotes Arnold 's great ode of doubt and foreboding , " Dover Beach " , as a prelude to a clash of British modes and manners with the raucous energy of Nagra 's Punjabi migrant families , " babbling our lingoes , flecked by the chalk of Britannia " .
Would Arnold have approved of Nagra 's verse masala ?
By rights , he should have done .
In poem after poem , Nagra frames the demotic " babble " of British Asian life and talk against the poetic tradition , ancient and modern – from George Herbert to Paul Muldoon .
If ever a poet talked back to the canon , Nagra does .
Not that he 's alone ; John Agard 's celebrated squib from the 1980s , " Listen Mr Oxford Don " , put the case impeccably : " I ent have no gun / I ent have no knife / but mugging de Queen 's English / is the story of my life . "
Still , life – and even Oxford – moves on .
One of the best - known Oxford English dons today , Paulin , has for years mugged the QE himself with the knobbly clubs of Ulster vernacular speech , in his own demotically enriched poetry .
Class , as well as culture , has spurred creative backchat from late arrivals to the high table of verse .
Nagra has clear affinities with Tony Harrison from Leeds , who for 40 years has wittily and angrily claimed his place in a tradition that formerly could find no room for any self - raising baker 's son .
" So right , yer buggers , then ! " snarls the sonnet " Them and [ uz ] " from his magisterial sequence The School of Eloquence – a poem about the sound of Keats in a Yorkshire lad 's mouth , and the schoolmaster who scorned his pronunciation : " We 'll occupy / your lousy leasehold Poetry . "
Yet Keats was himself a low - status , much - mocked " cockney " who laboured under the vicious snobbery of his age .
In 1818 , Keats expressed the hope , and wish , that " I think I shall be among the English Poets after my death " .
Another outsider , he felt that a true and just order of poetic merit ought to exist beyond the whims of fashion and prejudice .
This was hardly what Eliot had in mind when he claimed that the historically aware writer feels " that the whole of the literature of Europe from Homer and within it the whole of the literature of his own country has a simultaneous existence and composes a simultaneous order " .
Eliot 's hierarchy of bards would constitute a canon very different to Keats's , and Harrison 's , meritocracy .
Yet the desire to belong with the big shots of the past seems to burn even more fiercely in authors who have suffered the pangs of exclusion .
In an early poem , from 1948 , Derek Walcott – the future Nobel laureate from the island of St Lucia – gives voice to a narrator who feels that his life " must not be made public / Until I have learnt to suffer / in accurate iambics " .
A spellbinding magician when it comes to the forms of verse , Walcott moved a long way beyond mere " accurate iambics " .
Still , he has never stopped wrestling creatively with the giant ghosts of European poetry and art .
His most spectacular embrace of the past came in 1990 with Omeros .
This epic of " our wide country , the Caribbean sea " manages to swallow both Homer and Dante in its roped - together tales of fishermen in love and the colonial history of their island home .
Walcott , too , believed he had to fight to join the inner circle .
A younger poet such as Vikram Seth feels he 's pushing at an open door – not least because he has the key .
The author of A Suitable Boy – always a poet , long before his excursion into fiction – now owns a rectory in Wiltshire once occupied by George Herbert himself .
Recently , " in Delhi but thinking of Salisbury " , Seth wrote a series of poems about living in Herbert 's house , and his " deep affinity " with the courteous revenant from the 17th century who " stands just out of mind and sight /
That I may sit and write " .
" He might influence me , " writes Seth , " but would not wish to wrest me from myself " .
It takes a lot to wrest a strong poet from himself or herself .
Yet even the strongest senses the need to shake hands across time with the best of the past – though some may fear the urge might fade .
" Old Poets " , from Elaine Feinstein 's aptly titled new volume Talking to the Dead , reflects that " We were so sure /
The words of their poems would last , / and that the next generation / would be equally in love with the past " .
If " love " can encompass every shade of rivalry and argument , she has every right to her confidence .
Poetry itself , as the imprisoned Wyatt came to know , can be the most stalwart paramour of all .
THE POEM THAT CHANGED MY LIFE
Andrew Motion , Poet Laureate
I Look into my Glass , by Thomas Hardy
I look into my glass ,
And view my wasting skin ,
And say , " Would God it came to pass
My heart had shrunk as thin ! "
For then , I , undistrest
By hearts grown cold to me ,
Could lonely wait my endless rest
With equanimity .
But Time , to make me grieve ,
Part steals , lets part abide ;
And shakes this fragile frame at eve
With throbbings of noontide .
I came from a very non-bookish background , in which poems had played no part whatsoever , so it was entirely down to my English teachers to light me up – or not – about poems .
And it happened very spectacularly right at the start of my A - level course when there was a fantastic chance for promiscuous reading and I began to be taught by Peter Way .
He is now a close friend because he pretty much gave me my life , imaginatively and intellectually speaking .
He gave us all this poem to read .
It 's about Hardy looking in a mirror and regretting that he has an old man 's body encasing the energies of young man , the " throbbings of noontide " as he calls them .
It 's a slightly odd choice to give to children , but it just went into me like a spear .
I 'd never felt anything like it before .
It made me want to read everything he had written and read other poems that were like that , Larkin , Edward Thomas and all the other people who have become so important to me over the years .
And it made me want to write – and , moreover , write like that – something that looks very plain but which has a tremendous emotional resonance to it , a glass that looks like it has got water in it but then it turns out to be gin .
That remains my ambition – to write things that look simple but have an emotional kick to them .
It did change my life – it changed it and made it instantaneously .
Bonnie Greer , Writer
365 , by Emily Dickinson
Dare you see a Soul at the White Heat ?
Then crouch within the door -
Red - is the Fire 's common tint -
But when the vivid Ore
Has vanquished Flame 's conditions ,
It quivers from the Forge
Without a color , but the light
Of anointed Blaze .
Least Village has its Blacksmith
Whose Anvil 's even ring
Stands symbol for the finer forge
That soundless tugs - within -
Refining these impatient Ores
With Hammer , and with Blaze
Until the Designated Light
Repudiate the Forge -
My favourite poet , lately , is the 19th - century American Emily Dickinson .
Dickinson is very mysterious to me , hard to grasp .
She is that rare artist who is completely dedicated to charting and expressing her inner landscape .
She is not a public poet , but a recluse , who , like Blake , invents a cosmology , a universe .
I could say her own cosmology , her own universe , but of course this is not true .
It is everyone's .
My favourite poem is " 365 " .
The poems have no titles .
In it , the " Belle of Amherst " plunges in , leaving the rest of us behind , just as Stephen Hawking 's mind does , or the music of the jazz genius Ornette Coleman does .
" 365 " is about the soul – something that trendy , dumb books extolling atheism want us to believe does not exist .
How can that be true when you read lines like this ?
Rowan Williams , Archbishop of Canterbury
Love Bade Me Welcome , by George Herbert
Love bade me welcome , yet my soul drew back ,
Guilty of dust and sin .
But quick - ey'd Love , observing me grow slack
From my first entrance in ,
Drew nearer to me , sweetly questioning
If I lack 'd anything .
' A guest , ' I answer 'd , ' worthy to be here ' ;
Love said , ' You shall be he . '
' I , the unkind , the ungrateful ?
Ah , my dear ,
I can not look on thee . '
Love took my hand and smiling did reply ,
' Who made the eyes but I ? '
' Truth , Lord , but I have marr'd them ; let my shame
Go where it doth deserve . '
' And know you not , ' says Love , ' who bore the blame ? '
' My dear , then I will serve . '
' You must sit down , ' says Love , ' and taste my meat . '
So I did sit and eat .
Poetry involves heightening the tension in words .
Herbert 's " Love Bade Me Welcome " is typical of him – literally conversational , but highly patterned , immensely self - aware .
It 's about meeting God , and our fear of being forgiven or accepted .
Tension builds as the writer 's stratagems are dismantled .
The last line – " So I did sit and eat " – is as deliberately flat as could be : the ultimate release .
It is the poem I most often revisit .

An extract from ' V ' , by Tony Harrison
Next millennium you 'll have to search quite hard
To find my slab behind the family dead ,
Butcher , publican , and baker , now me , bard
Adding poetry to their beef , beer and bread .
With Byron three graves on I 'll not go short
Of company , and Wordsworth 's opposite .
That 's two peers already , of a sort ,
And we 'll all be thrown together if the pit ,
Whose galleries once ran beneath this plot ,
Causes the distinguished dead to drop
Into the rabblement of bone and rot ,
Shored slack , crushed shale , smashed prop .
I first came across ' V ' on a Channel 4 film by Richard Eyre , shot in Beeston Hill cemetery near Leeds .
It had an incredible effect on me .
It was directly relevant – a Northern perspective on the late Eighties , charting the decimation of jobs and the collapse of social structures through the image of a graveyard that has been vandalised .

Soft Collision
The moon Prometheus slowly collides with the diffuse inner edge of Saturn 's F ring in this movie sequence of Cassini images .
The oblong moon pulls a streamer of material from the ring and leaves behind a dark channel .
Once during its 14.7 - hour orbit of Saturn , Prometheus ( 102 kilometers , or 63 miles across ) reaches the point in its elliptical path , called apoapse , where it is farthest away from Saturn and closest to the F ring .
At this point , Prometheus ' gravity is just strong enough to draw a " streamer " of material out of the core region of the F ring .
Initially the dust - sized material drawn away from the ring appears to form a streamer pointing ahead of Prometheus in its orbit .
( All orbital motion is towards the right in the movie . )
Over time , the streamer falls increasingly farther behind Prometheus because material in the F ring is orbiting slower than the moon .
The streamer gets longer and a darker " channel " starts to be seen ( to the left of the streamer in the movie ) .
The creation of such streamers and channels occurs in a cycle that repeats each Prometheus orbit : when Prometheus again reaches apoapse , it draws another streamer of material from the F ring .
But since Prometheus orbits faster than the material in the ring , this new streamer is pulled from a different location in the ring about 3.2 degrees ( in longitude ) ahead of the previous one .
In this way , a whole series of streamer - channels is created along the F ring .
In some observations , 10 to 15 streamer - channels can easily be seen in the F ring at one time ( see PIA07712 ) .
Eventually , a streamer - channel disappears as shearing forces ( i.e. , Keplerian shear ) act to disperse the constituent dust particles .
The movie shows just under half of a complete streamer - channel cycle .
The dark frames in the movie represent the period during which Prometheus and the F ring pass through Saturn 's shadow .
The images in the movie were acquired by the Cassini spacecraft narrow - angle camera on Nov. 23 and 24 , 2006 .
The movie sequence consists of 72 clear spectral filter images taken every 10.5 minutes over a period of about 12.5 hours .
The original images were cropped to show only the region around Prometheus and the nearby portion of the F ring .
The movie covers the region between 138,000 and 142,000 kilometers ( 86,000 and 88,000 miles ) radially from Saturn and 1 degree in longitude from Prometheus on each side .
Each frame was reprojected such that the vertical axis represents distance from Saturn and the horizontal axis represents longitude around Saturn .
Image scale is 10 kilometers ( 6 miles ) per pixel in the vertical direction ; the images cover 0.005 degrees of longitude in the horizontal direction .
Because of the reprojection , the F ring appears straight , rather than slightly curved , as it otherwise would .
Since the F ring has an elliptical shape , its radial distance from Saturn varies by about 1,000 kilometers ( 620 miles ) around the ring .
This accounts for the apparent vertical movement of the ring over the course of the movie .
Only a very small part of the ring appears in each of the reprojected frames , so the difference in the ring 's radial distance from left to right across any single frame is small enough as to be effectively unnoticeable .

Computer Programmer Leads Police to Wife 's Body Hans Reiser got a reduced sentence for agreeing to show police the body .
July 7 , 2008  -- ABC
News has learned that convicted murderer Hans Reiser led police to a body he says is that of his estranged wife , Nina .
In exchange for revealing the location of the body , Reiser is expected to get his conviction reduced from first degree murder to second degree murder , and will likely serve less jail time .
On April 28 , a California jury convicted Reiser , 44 , of first degree murder in the disappearance of his wife , even though her body had not been found .
The sentencing , originally scheduled for July 9 , has been postponed until forensics on the body are complete .
A first degree murder conviction would result in a sentence of 25 years to life in prison , while the second degree conviction carries a sentence of 15 to life .
ABC's " 20/20 " previously reported on the case of Nina Reiser , a 31 - year - old doctor and mother of two , who went missing on Sept. 3 , 2006 .
She had been in the midst of an acrimonious divorce from her husband , a well - known computer programmer .
Reiser , shackled to his defense attorney , William Du Bois , led police on a long hike in California 's Redwood State Park to a ravine where his wife was buried deep in the ground inside a plastic bag .
In addition to Reiser and Du Bois , the prosecution trial attorney , Paul Hora , and Judge Larry Goodman -- presiding over the Reiser case -- were present on the hike .
The body will be recovered tonight , and a coroner 's van is standing by .
Search for Bride Ends in Murder
Reiser was a child prodigy who dropped out of junior high school and enrolled at the University of California , Berkeley , at age 15 .
After college , he made his mark in the business world , starting a technology company and developing a new computer file system some consider revolutionary .
Reiser went to Russia in 1998 looking for cheap labor for his computer business , and a bride .
He met Nina in 1998 , and by May 1999 , Reiser married his Russian bride .
Nina was , by then , five months pregnant .
A bizarre wedding video shows a nontraditional wedding -- Reiser 's best friend Sean Sturgeon , dressed in drag , was the maid of honor .
The couple were happy in the early years of their marriage , giving birth to a son , Rory , and daughter Niroline .
But fights about how those children were being raised were at the center of a marriage that began to crumble .
Reiser lost custody of his children in the divorce proceedings before his wife 's disappearance .
Nina disappeared more than a year ago after dropping off the couple 's children at Reiser 's home .
After the disappearance , even without a body , it did n't take long for police to arrest Reiser and charge him with his wife 's murder .
After a six - month trial , he was convicted of her murder in April .

The ACTA draft is a scary document .
If a treaty based on its provisions were adopted , it would enable any border guard , in any treaty country , to check any electronic device for any content that they suspect infringes copyright laws .
They need no proof , only suspicion .
They would be able to seize any device - laptop , iPod , DVD recorder , mobile phone , etc - and confiscate it or destroy anything on it , merely on suspicion .
On the spot , no lawyers , no right of appeal , no nothing .
The draft contains other draconian measures .
It proposes a governing body for copyright protection that would operate outside organisations such as the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) and the UN .
In short , it proposes a global police force , answerable to no one , with intrusive powers that vastly exceed those currently available to adherents of the concept of intellectual property .
The proposed treaty is being sponsored by a small group of US Congress members , all of whom Wikileaks says have received significant contributions from major record companies and film studios .
As they say , " follow the money " .
The first newspaper to break the story was Canada 's The Ottawa Citizen , which in a story by Vito Pilieci on May 24 picked up on the Wikileaks posting .
Since then the blogosphere has been rife with stories about the move .
Most commentators are outraged that such a proposal is even being considered .
For 10 years in this column and elsewhere I have been arguing that the concept of copyright , and by extension most forms of so - called " intellectual property " , are irrelevant in the digital era .
I was once , with just a few others , a voice in the wilderness .
Now most people I talk with agree .
The copyright mafia have tried all sorts of things , including the absurdity of Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) , which attempts to use technology to hobble technology .
They have maliciously prosecuted individuals for the " crime " of copying music from one medium to another .
DRM is struggling , but we still see stupidity everywhere .
Apple does n't let you copy stuff off your iPod - you have to use third - party software to perform what should be a simple task .
Foxtel 's iQ and Austar 's MyStar do n't let you copy stuff off those boxes to other media .
Downloaded movies self - destruct after a limited time .
It is still illegal in Australia to copy a CD to another CD ( only " format shifting " is allowed ) , or to record a TV show for any other purpose than watching it once .
Whether this absurd treaty becomes reality or not , it indicates the lengths to which some are prepared to go .
They will use any means to fight a technology that threatens their anachronistic monopoly of the distribution of digital content .
Clever people are taking advantage of the technology to develop new business models and reach new audiences .
Bands are bypassing record companies and going direct to consumers .
Authors are publishing online .
Small moviemakers are finding new outlets through the wonders of the internet .
The big record companies and film studios have a clever answer - turn everybody into criminals .
Use treaties and laws to try to prevent people doing what comes naturally and , in the digital age , easily .
The most that can be hoped of the proposed ACTA treaty is that , if it comes into being , it will further expose the futility of legislating against the key advantage of digital technology - the ease with which content can be stored , copied and transmitted .
Where the technology is liberating people and content , the powers of reaction are attempting to stifle it .
Fortunately they are on the wrong side of history .
When the full details and consequences of this treaty become widely known , I believe the effect will be the opposite of what its authors intend .
It contains so little understanding of the way the digital world works that the backlash against it will be massive , accelerating the inevitable death of the out - of - date business models it is vainly trying to protect .

Gary Kildall
As the founder and chairman of the board of Digital
Research , Gary A. Kildall developed the first operating system for a
microcomputer during 1972 and 1973 .
He called it the CP / M ( Control
Program / Monitor ) operating system and it became his company ’s first
product .
In addition , he designed the DR Logo programming language for
the IBM PC and he developed PL / 1 , one of the first high - level
languages for microcomputers .
A native of Seattle , Kildall was born on May 19 , 1942 .
He
received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of
Washington in 1972 .
He then joined the Navy and taught computer
science at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey , California ,
where he continued to teach after his discharge from the Navy .
In 1984 Kildall formed a new company called Activenture
Corporation ( recently renamed KnowledgeSet Corporation ) to explore the
potential of optical - disc publishing .
In 1985 , Activenture announced
they would publish Grolier ’s Encyclopedia in a CD ROM
format .
Kildall retains the position of chairman of the board at
Digital Research along with his position as president of KnowledgeSet
Corporation .
We went to Digital Research on a Monday morning via Highway 1
along the California coastline .
The scenery is some of the most
spectacular in the country and the coastline is dotted with more
resorts than computer - related businesses .
Digital Research and
KnowledgeSet , both started by Gary Kildall , are two of the few
high - tech companies in the area .
I could n’t help but wonder how one
could coop oneself up in the characteristic dingy , dimly lit office to
write source code , knowing that such stunning beauty was right outside
the door .
But Gary Kildall seems to have no difficulty devoting
attention to his work , and appreciating the surroundings during his
leisure time .
Kildall likes to work and play equally hard .
His “ toys ”
include a new Lamborghini Countach , a Pitts aerobatic biplane , and a
Rolls Royce .
Gary came to meet with us in a conference room around noon .
He
is tall , with red hair and a trim beard , and he was wearing crisp new
western - style blue jeans , a white cowboy snap shirt , and boots .
Having
just come from a weekend in Tahoe where , he confessed , he ate too
much , he ordered a Diet Pepsi while the rest of us called for
sandwiches .
And with that , Gary , in his reserved and calculated
manner , discussed programming with great seriousness and passion .
In
fact , we had pulled him away from writing source code for his latest
CD ROM encyclopedia project in order to do the interview .
One reason
he had started KnowledgeSet was so that he could get back to the nuts
and bolts of programming , away from the management demands of his
first company , Digital Research , which has grown so large .
Gary often
turned to the white board to draw diagrams or illustrate important
points as he explained the meticulous , creative process he goes
through to write code that makes computers perform .
INTERVIEWER : You taught at the Naval Postgraduate
School .
If you were to go back and teach again , would you teach any
differently ?
KILDALL : Probably not , because I do n’t program any
differently now than when I was teaching .
I would teach the course I
enjoyed most , the data - structures course .
It goes back to the
fundamentals of programming : simplifying the problem .
Part of the
programming process is general problem solving .
How do you solve a
problem that ’s complex , whether it ’s designing a computer program or
constructing a building ?
You start at the point where you think it ’s
too hard to solve , and then you break it down into smaller
pieces .
That ’s what I try to teach .
INTERVIEWER :
It ’s difficult to teach problem - solving
principles .
How did you go about it ?
KILDALL : On the first day in a particular data - structures
class , I said , “ We ’re going to have a little test .
Put your books on
the floor and get a piece of paper .
I want you to write a program that
will symbolically solve differential equations .
Given a polynomial ,
the program should differentiate the polynomial and produce the
symbolic , not numeric , result . ”
So the students started writing away ,
thinking , and scratching their heads .
This went on for about ten
minutes , then I told everyone to stop .
I asked them to think about how
they approached solving that problem .
What tools were they using ?
Were
they starting to write a program ?
Were they thinking about
mathematics ?
Were they starting to write little examples down ?
That
whole quarter we worked with the techniques and tools of problem
solving .
Then , in the final exam , I gave them the same problem I had
given them to solve on the very first day .
INTERVIEWER :
What were the most important principles your
students had learned when they completed your classes ?
KILDALL : I taught two things that are important for students
to learn : problem solving and how to study .
Knowing how to study takes
care of getting through tests and leads to other school - survival
skills .
And if you learn how to solve problems , you can go through
life and do pretty well .
INTERVIEWER : How would you characterize your own
particular style of writing programs ?
KILDALL : I follow very definite procedures which work for
me , though they may not work for other people .
I start with drawing
the data structures , and I spend a lot of time thinking about them .
I
also think about what the program has to go through before I start
writing code .
Programs are like mechanical devices ; the way one piece of code
works with another is very similar to the way one gear meshes with
another gear .
Building code is a little like building a
transmission .
The PL / 1 compiler I wrote a few years back is a good
example .
People said it was impossible to write a compiler on a
microcomputer , but after a couple years of work , it was considered one
of the best optimizing compilers around .
Once the data structures are developed , I start writing small
chunks of code that I improve and monitor along the way .
Checking them
as I go assures me that the changes I make are localized ; and if I
have problems , I discover them immediately .
This whole process of
iterative improvement requires speed , so for me at least , it ’s very
important to have fast edit , execute , and debug cycles .
This method
does n’t work as well on a mainframe or a card - batch system because you
ca n’t make small changes and check them out .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you prefer to work in an interpretive
environment ?
KILDALL : No , I do n’t like existing interpreters very
much .
I ’d like to have one for a systems language like C that would
parallel an existing compiler , but it ’s still questionable how well
that would work , because most systems programs are
performance - oriented or timing - dependent .
If I had a very effective
interpreter–something like I used when I developed PL / M , or now maybe
C–an interpreter might be worthwhile using .
INTERVIEWER : How did you get interested in
programming ?
KILDALL : I originally planned to be a high school math
teacher , and started taking math courses at the University of
Washington .
But a friend of mine had this FORTRAN statement card ,
showed it to me , and told me it was going to be a really big thing .
I
became so intrigued I had to get into it .
So I took an
assembly - language programming course and FORTRAN right after that , and
I was hooked .
I found I liked programming for the same reasons I liked
to build models , cars , and things of that sort .
I found constructing a
program to be a similar experience .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you remember the first program you
wrote ?
KILDALL : Yes .
It calculated the number of seconds between
any two times of the day and any two calendar dates .
That program is
still around ; every time I clean my desk I find it , like old clothes I
find in my closet .
INTERVIEWER : What about the first professional program
you wrote ?
KILDALL : I wrote it at the navigation school my father
owned .
We used to prepare tide tables by hand for one of the local
publishing companies in Seattle .
I wrote a FORTRAN program that
calculated the tides .
It was the first program I made money on –$ 500
or so .
INTERVIEWER :
So how did you happen to begin working on
the CP / M operating system ?
KILDALL : The operating system was actually just a little
fragment of a very large project .
I was working with XPL , a language
for mainframe computers , written by Bill McKeeman at Stanford .
I
developed a similar language called PL/M , a programming language for
microcomputers .
I was trying to get PL / M to run resident on the 8080
microprocessor , and I had to write an interface to communicate with a
disk drive .
It turned out that the operating system , which was called
CP /M for Control Program for Micros , was useful too , fortunately .
INTERVIEWER :
So when you were developing CP / M you had no
idea it would be so successful ?
KILDALL : No , I did n’t know CP / M would be such a hit , but it
was very clear to me that floppy disks would be .
I had been working
with paper tapes for a year and a half .
A floppy - disk drive was $ 500
and a paper - tape reader with a fancy punch was over $ 2,000 .
Just by
looking at the cost comparision of the two drives , I realized the
floppy disk would be a commercial success .
INTERVIEWER : Some programmers throw out code and start
over when they run into extremely serious problems with their code .
Do
you ever do that ?
KILDALL : No , because my problems never get serious enough to
start over .
I never would have been coding if I did n’t think I had the
right data structure .
Whenever I tear code apart , it is usually
because the underlying data structures were n’t any good , not because
of the algorithms I applied .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you use comments when you write
code ?
KILDALL : Rarely , except at the beginning of procedures , and
then I only comment on the data structure .
I do n’t comment on the code
itself because I feel that properly written code is very much
self - documented .
Once I get the algorithms down , I start writing code
directly on the machine .
I do n’t even write it on a piece of paper
before it goes into the computer ; it just does n’t seem necessary .
The
actual coding process has always been a little scary for me because I
do n’t know if I ’m writing the right code , nor do I know what I’ll
write next .
It just seems to come out .
Sometimes I realize the code’s
not exactly right , but I also realize intuitively that it will relate
to something else–it will factor out and become right even if I do n’t
know exactly how at the time I ’m writing it .
The magical part is that , at some point , all at once the whole
thing comes together .
It ’s like taking a logical Boolean expression
that simplifies and simplifies until , bam , you ’ve got it .
When I reach
the point where the code coalesces , I ’m certain the program will work ,
and I also have no doubt I did it about the best way it could be
done .
I do n’t completely understand the process , but it sure seems to
work for me , even when I make fairly massive changes to data
structures and algorithms .
INTERVIEWER :
Is writing code always an unknown and
difficult process ?
KILDALL : No .
When I code without pressure to meet a
deadline , it ’s very relaxing .
Sometimes when I ’m scheduled for a long
plane ride , I ’ll take a little portable along and code just for
fun .
In fact , even when there ’s a deadline , it ’s fun to sit at a
terminal and let the code flow .
It sounds strange , but it just comes
out of my brain ; once I ’m started , I do n’t have to think about it .
INTERVIEWER :
Have you ever been unable to get the code to
work just the way you envision ?
KILDALL : There are very few cases where someone has gone
into my code and said , “ We could have done it a lot better , ” but there
are times when it just does n’t come together .
The editor in the DR
Logo interpreter is a good example .
I had some pieces of code I knew
were not quite right–it worked fine but had n’t factored out correctly
and just was n’t right .
The engineers who took over the code zeroed in
on that piece of programming , but we did n’t have time to make changes
because we had to get the product out .
That ’s the kind of thing you
hope never happens , but it does sometimes , so you go back and fix it ,
and learn something about your style .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you think programming is something you
can practice as you would practice the piano ?
KILDALL : Well , you can practice in a sense .
Seymour Papert
has this notion that kids learn to be inventive by tinkering with
gears and other mechanical gadgets .
The skills you learn and practice
with this kind of play carry over into other areas .
Papert is
certainly talking about my childhood experience .
My father was a great
craftsman .
I used to stay and watch him by the hour , and then I would
go outside and try to imitate him with my own hammer and nails .
Data structures , which are the foundations of programs , are
mechanical by nature , like the things I played with as a kid .
So , in
that sense , I practiced programming .
The big difference is that
building something out of wood or steel takes hours of labor ; if you
do n’t do it right , you have to go back and rebuild .
Programs can be
altered instantly .
INTERVIEWER :
How else can you build your repertoire as a
programmer ?
KILDALL : You need to study other people ’s work .
Their
approaches to problem solving and the tools they use give you a fresh
way to look at your own work .
You need to learn only a small set of
procedures before you can write a program .
For example , when you ’re
writing compilers , the first thing you write is a scanner , which is a
little tool you use a lot .
Once you learn those tools , it becomes a
matter of putting pieces together .
You grab pieces from here and there
and stick them all together .
Looking at programs others have written
gives you new ideas for constructing coherent code .
That ’s why , as a
teacher , I spent a lot of time with students showing them clean
algorithms I had picked up .
INTERVIEWER :
You ’ve talked about how you taught
others .
Has anyone or anything influenced your style of
programming ?
KILDALL : I ’m very pragmatic .
I like to build programs that
are fast and small , and use clear , concise algorithms .
I learned that
style from the early Burroughs 5500 , a very advanced machine for the
day , which was based upon the ALGOL philosophy of block - structured
languages .
The ALGOL compiler was probably one of the nicest pieces of
code to come out at that time .
I spent hours trying to fix and change
the compiler .
Working with it so closely affected the way I think
about programming and had a profound influence on my
style .
Fortunately , the ALGOL philosophy became the basis for design
of popular languages like Pascal and C , so the style works for me .
INTERVIEWER :
One hears stories about the crazy hours
programmers keep .
How about you ?
Do you have a certain
routine ?
KILDALL : My pace varies during the development of the
program .
At some points , the code gets explosive and I have everything
inside my brain at one time : all the variable names and how they
relate to one another , where the pointers start and where they end ,
disk access , et cetera .
All sorts of things go on in my brain that I
ca n’t put on paper simply because I ’m always changing them .
I ’d spend
more time writing than I would coding , and I ’d never get the project
done in a reasonable amount of time .
When the data structures are so new , they require intense
concentration to keep them organized in your head .
So at this point in
the process , I ’ll usually start at 3:00 a.m. and work until maybe 6:00
p.m.
Then I ’ll have dinner , go to bed early , get up again pretty early
in the morning , and keep banging on it until things are calmer .
During the calm times , when my pace is more relaxed , I come up with
solutions for the next phase .
When I ’m trying to solve a problem that
has a series of steps , I take them in order , one at a time–step A ,
step B , then step C. I ’ve tried , but I just ca n’t work on C until B
has been Completed .
I take short vacations during the lulls because I like to enjoy
life , too .
That ’s the time I go out and fly airplanes just to get
away .
It ’s good for my work , because I always come back with some
fresh ideas .
INTERVIEWER : Does your flying airplanes have any other
impact on your programming ?
KILDALL : I certainly hope my program planning is better than
my flying .
I ’ve heard that quite a few programmers are also fliers .
I
know Charles Simonyi flies a helicopter .
And both Fred Gibbons and
Vern Rayburn were very interested in flying .
Programmers like flying a plane because it is a mechanical process
just like programming .
Also , people who like computers like gadgets ,
and airplanes are just loaded with gadgets .
They ’ve got all the dials
and wheels and knobs you could ever want to play with .
You get to play
a little dangerously because it ’s the real thing , not just a video
game .
Computers are very abstract , but airplanes are real .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you ever get tired of
programming ?
KILDALL : I do n’t think of my work as tedious , if that ’s what
you mean .
When I go on vacation I look forward to returning to
work .
The only time I do n’t want to come back is when the code
explodes .
Then it becomes tough because I ’m working under pressure to
get the code back together .
When you ’ve got the code all ripped apart ,
it ’s like a car that ’s all disassembled .
You ’ve got all the parts
lying all over your garage and you have to replace the broken part or
the car will never run .
It ’s not fun until the code gets back to the
baseline again .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you find anything aesthetically pleasing
in your work ?
KILDALL : Oh , absolutely .
When a program is clean and neat ,
nicely structured , and consistent , it can be beautiful .
I guess I
would n’t compare a program with the Mona Lisa , but it does have a
simplicity and elegance that ’s quite handsome .
Stylistic distinctions
of different programs are intriguing , very much like the differences
art critics might see between Leonardo ’s Mona Lisa and a Van Gogh .
I
like the LISP programming language so much because it ’s so
pleasing .
There ’s a concise form of LISP called the M expressions .
When you write an algorithm using M expressions , it ’s so beautiful you
almost feel it could be framed and hung on a wall .
When I was working on my Ph.D. thesis , I was trying to solve a
difficult global flow analysis problem .
I knew there had to be a
solution , but I just could n’t crack it .
Finally , when I got a clean
mathematical model , I coded the algorithms in LISP .
The program took
only two hours to write , and it was beautiful ; it did exactly what I
wanted it to do .
At that point , I had no direct proof the program
worked , but every example I ran through LISP was functioning the way I
expected .
I wrote the same program in XPL , which is a systems language
for running compilers .
Later , when I got proof that the program was
correct , I found it was based on the concepts of the very pretty LISP
program , not the concepts developed in the relatively ugly XPL
program .
INTERVIEWER :
Do you consider programming to be an art or
a science ?
KILDALL : There certainly is some art in it .
But a lot
of programming is invention and engineering .
It ’s much
like a carpenter who has a mental picture of a cabinet he’s
trying to build .
He has to wrestle with the design and
construction to get it into a physical form .
That ’s very much
what I do in programming .
Programming has some science as well , though not a
lot .
Experimental science means you hypothesize , try things , and
compare results , and in that way programming is science .
You may have
a concept of how a retrieval system should work , but it ’s not until
you run it with sufficient data that you can see the mechanism
operating and get some statistics .
But remember , I ’m in one special area of programming : compilers ,
operating systems , retrieval , and other system software .
A programmer
who specializes in graphics , for example , may have an entirely
different view of the programming world .
Because graphics programmers
are dealing more with the physical world –talking about the way light
sources affect objects , for instance –there may be a lot more
mathematics and science involved in their work .
You know , I also think
programming is very much a religious experience for a lot of
people .
INTERVIEWER :
What do you mean when you say programming is
a religious experience for a lot of people ?
KILDALL : Well , if you talk about programming to a group of
programmers who use the same language , they can become almost
evangelistic about the language .
They form a tight - knit community ,
hold to certain beliefs , and follow certain rules in their
programming .
It ’s like a church with a programming language for a
Bible .
FORTH is a good example ; it ’s a programming language that is
probably close to being a religious experience for many people .
When
FORTH first came out , its disciples claimed any algorithm could be
done ten times faster .
That was a typical claim .
If you argued that
point or any other , you found yourself talking to a brick wall and you
definitely were n’t allowed in the church .
Now I do n’t mean to be
derogatory about the people who use that language .
It ’s a very
supportive group and a very effective language , but the discussions
were not based on reason .
They were based on belief .
By saying this ,
I ’ll probably get about a thousand letters about FORTH and the
religious experience people are having over it .
But I ’m not putting
myself in a special category either ; I can preach about the wonders of
LISP all day .
INTERVIEWER :
What do you think will be the future role of
computers ?
KILDALL : Basically , our technology tends to simplify
mechanical processes .
That ’s why computers have been so successful : We
take things normally done with cogs , wheels , and relays , and do them
with vacuum tubes and then with semiconductors .
Look at automobiles ,
for example .
More and more of the processes in the automobile , like in
the 1984 Corvette , are being turned over to the semiconductor or its
equivalent .
When semiconductors take the place of speedometer cables
and tachometers , they turn the car into a less expensive and more
reliable product that is easier to produce .
Computer systems are going
through identical changes right now ; the hard disk drive is a
mechanical device .
Because it is mechanical , we know it will
eventually go away .
We do n’t know how it will go away , but we know
it ’s a prime target .
Some gadgets and processes will continue to function mechanically ,
such as wheel bearings on cars , because it ’s pretty hard to make those
from a semiconductor .
But many other things in our daily lives will go
through the transition from mechanical to electronic .
The print
industry is a good example ; CD ROMs and optical storage are becoming
important there now .
Computers help to get away from the mechanical
processes of printing : running printing presses , laying out and
pasting up by hand , setting up the cameras .
The semiconductor will
take over the mechanical process .
But computers wo n’t stop
there .
Right now they control the production of print but not the
actual display of information .
Right now , a very big bottleneck–one of the reasons why the
personal computer industry is in the doldrums–is that we have a
difficult time thinking about what to do with computers once we get
past spreadsheets and word processing .
We do n’t know what the next
step is .
We ’re stuck .
It goes back to what I was saying about the dependence of
programming on beliefs rather than reason .
Ultimately the problem is
that we , as a society , took the big computers that we understood and
applied their underlying architecture , languages , and concepts to the
development of microcomputers .
As we move toward using computers as
controllers , we will find that communication between processors will
become more important than the processes they are carrying out .
Then
we will be forced to change the way we code .
That will be a very slow
evolutionary process .
INTERVIEWER :
So the future really depends on our ability
to free ourselves from old patterns of thinking ?
KILDALL : I felt strongly in the early days of
microprocessors that they should be used primarily as embedded
processors , talking to one another and coordinating the transition
from mechanical to electronic processes .
That ’s where I felt the
computer industry was going .
I saw them as replacements for random
logic , with engineers being the primary users of these small
machines .
In fact , someone from Lawrence Livermore Labs suggested I
develop a BASIC for the microcomputer –that was probably in 1974 .
I
told him that was the most stupid idea I had ever heard .
Who would
want to do a BASIC for microprocessors when they were being put into
such tools as inventory - control systems , cathode - ray tube displays ,
and word processors ?
Obviously , I was wrong about that .
It turns out
that one of my thesis students , Gordon Eubanks , did very well with C
BASIC , as did Paul Allen and Bill Gates .
Somehow we have to break loose from the ways we think about
microcomputers if we want to stimulate advances in computers .
People
at home do n’t want to buy another computer system .
They bought one and
there was no real use for it .
They do n’t want to be ripped off
again .
And we ’re talking about 95 percent , not 5 percent , of computer
users .
There are 16 million television sets sold every year ; there ’s
no reason why we should n’t sell 16 million gizmos with embedded
microprocessors .
INTERVIEWER :
You mentioned CD ROM a minute ago , and its
potential impact on the printing industry .
Will it have any other role
in the evolution of computers ?
KILDALL : Optical storage will clearly pull the computer
industry in a new direction .
When we worked with floppy disks , we were
just making little machines out of big machines .
And we have n’t yet
gone a whole lot farther than that today .
Optical storage is completely different .
We ’re not talking about
computing anymore ; we ’re talking about putting information into
people ’s hands .
People now might buy personal computers because
somebody else told them they should , but with optical storage , people
will buy computers because they want the information .
Computers will
be competing more with publishing .
INTERVIEWER :
So information could take the form of an
electronic encyclopedia , like the one you ’re putting on CD ROM ?
How do
you envision the design–both the retrieval system and the
enhancements ?
KILDALL : I take the concept for the initial product , get an
overall idea of what I want to do , and start coding right from the
nucleus , letting it expand in the direction it flows .
As long as I
do n’t limit the fundamental data structures , features can be added .
We
did a videodisc called the Knowledge Disc , which carried over nicely
into CD ROM retrieval systems .
All text was done with
bit - mapped fonts at the pixel level .
A very nice side effect of
working with pixels is that pictures go into the whole thing very
cleanly and nicely .
So we do n’t have to go back and do total redesigns
of anything to add images to text that already exists on the CD
ROM .
It ’s a problem if the design does n’t let you add features at a
later date .
If you have to redo a program , the hours you spend can
cause you to lose your competitive edge .
A flexible program
demonstrates the difference between a good designer and someone who is
just getting a piece of code out .
Right now , we ’re going full speed ahead just to blast as many
people out of the water as we possibly can .
We ’re hoping to be ready
by the first part of 1986 .
Economically , we have no choice but to go
fast and to use this technology .
It ’s the best .
Then we make sure that
we license the rights to it .
INTERVIEWER :
Are knowledge systems part of where you see
the home market going ?
KILDALL : Yes .
People do n’t usually go home to work .
Some
tasks people do at home are related to work , like keeping track of
taxes or running a little home business .
But mostly they go home to
relax .
I think games and entertainment are valuable .
We have a lot of
trouble figuring out how to entertain people at home .
And TV does a
good job right now ; competing with “ Dynasty ” is extremely
difficult .
One possible computer application is something to help kids
study .
My fourteen - year - old daughter is taking some hard courses and
she needs help studying .
Computer applications like that would give me
a direct benefit :
My child does better and that helps her in the
future .
That ’s clearly an important area for development .
Another area for development is providing general information about
selected subjects , such as medicine .
People go to doctors for many
reasons .
Some are psychological .
But sometimes they only want medical
information .
It costs a lot to go to the doctor , and if people had
less expensive ways to access that data , they would .
Here ’s another
example :
When I want a car , I try and shop L.A. , San Francisco , and
San Jose to get the best prices .
But it ’s virtually impossible to get
the facts about car dealers because people who do n’t want you to be
able to shop like that are protecting the information .
I ’d be a
candidate for that information because it could save me thousands of
dollars , not to mention a lot of time .
I ’d pay a reasonable amount to
get it .
We want to develop applications that will give people a definite
economic advantage if they buy them .
That ’s why we went for an
encyclopedia as the first CD ROM application .
Everyone knows
encyclopedias usually cost about $ 1,000 .
Someone can rationalize
buying a computer that has the encyclopedia , if it ’s in the same price
range as the printed encyclopedia .
INTERVIEWER : How friendly will this machine be ?
KILDALL : Well , I do n’t think it ’s a matter of friendliness ,
because ultimately if the program is going to accomplish anything of
value , it will probably be relatively complex .
Some people suggest that machines would be friendlier if input
could be in a natural language .
But natural language is probably the
worst kind of input because it can be quite ambiguous .
The process of
retrieving information from the computer would be so time - consuming
that you would be better off spending that time getting the
information directly from an expert .
Expert systems will be the ultimate in user friendliness .
But we ’re
a long way from having the expert in the box .
The doctor - in - a - box ,
although a phenomenal product , is incredibly complex .
It would have to
be perfect .
Someday , we ’ll have programs like that .
I just do n’t know
how far off they are , and there are lots of problems to solve along
the way , but that ’s the fun part .

See that battered old Hermes Standard 8 typewriter there , in a fetching shade of institutional brown ?
I 'd practically saw my own leg off to own it .
Why ?
Because I 'm a huge Douglas Adams fan , and that battered old thing is the very typewriter DNA used to bring The Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy to the world .
A surprisingly analog gadget , for such a self - avowed technology fan as he .
And get this : it 's actually on sale by a British bookseller , as part of a package with a " fine " condition first - edition copy of Hitchhiker's .
The package , complete with autograph on the typewriter lid , will set you back over $ 25,000 .
A vastly , hugely , mind - bogglingly big sum .

There are a number of OCR products on the market , but do n’t go for your wallet just yet .
If you own Microsoft Office , you already own software capable of Optical Character Recognition : Microsoft Office Document Imaging .
You can use Microsoft Office Document Imaging to grab text from a scanned document and convert it into a usable Word document .
I have an essay typed out on paper .
Is there a way to get my essay onto the computer without re-typing it ?
OCR stands for Optical Character Recognition , and is the process of converting written or printed text into into a form that can be understood by a computer .
Using OCR , your computer can take text from a scanned page and insert it into a text file , or word processing document .
Scan the source of your content
Microsoft Office Document Imaging is able to perform OCR on TIF files , so step number one is to scan your documents .
Fire up your scanner , and scan each page in TIF format .
Load your documents into MODI
Next , you must load your documents into Microsoft Office Document Imaging .
Click “ Start ” .
Click “ All Programs ” .
Click “ Microsoft Office ” .
Click “ Microsoft Office Tools ” .
Click “ Microsoft Office Document Imaging ” .
In Microsoft Office Document Imaging , click “ File ” , then “ Insert File ” .
When asked for the file to be inserted , locate the scanned TIF file containing your document .
If you have scanned each page of your document into a separate TIF file , repeat this process for each TIF file .
After the first file is inserted , you will be asked whether you want to insert at the beginning , middle , or end of the document upon inserting each successive page .
Make your selection and click “ OK ” .
Once all the pages of your document have been inserted into Microsoft Office Document Imaging , you are ready to start the OCR process .
Click on the “ Send Text to Word ” button .
It is located at the top of the screen in the middle of the menu bar , and appears as a white page with an arrow pointing towards a blue “ W ” .

A dialog box will ask whether you wish to insert all the pages , or just the ones that are selected .
Make your choice and press “ OK ” , and the text of your essay will be inserted into a Microsoft Word Document .
You are now free to format , edit , and save your new word processing document .
How my son fled his strict billionaire Arab father to come and live with me again in Surrey
When Tariq Al Habtoor asked his father in February if he could go to a rock festival with his friends , he already knew the answer .
Deprived of independence throughout his adolescence , if he was n’t surrounded by four burly bodyguards he was being mollycoddled by 12 maids .
And when he was n’t within the confines of his private school , he was being dragged on to the polo pitch with his devoutly Muslim father .
So the chances of being allowed an evening ’s freedom were , the 16 - year - old reasoned , fairly remote .
Reunited : Sarra and Tariq at home in Surrey
Yet when he was given the all - too - predictable ‘ no ’ , he snapped .
He sneaked past the security guards at the family ’s gated Dubai mansion and spent the next couple of hours strumming happily on his air guitar .
But it was only after he returned home that he really faced the music .
Rashid Al Habtoor banished his son to one of the many apartments he owns in the Middle Eastern state , and left him under the strict surveillance of his surly staff for two days .
With no school , no polo and nothing to do but ponder his claustrophobic existence , Tariq began to plot a way out .
In April , his plans came to fruition .
Tariq , dressed in his school uniform and with no luggage except his satchel , bypassed his bodyguards , hailed a taxi to Dubai International Airport and boarded a plane to London .
For the first time in nearly nine years , he was back in Britain and reunited with Sarra Fotheringham , the mother he adores , and who once risked her own freedom for the right to bring up her eldest son .
‘ No amount of money could make up for my lack of freedom , ’ says Tariq , speaking exclusively to The Mail on Sunday .
‘ I love being back home and I do n’t care if I never see my father again . ’
A shy , slightly awkward teenager , he turns frequently to his mother for moral support as he talks .
For Sarra , Tariq ’s return is the happy conclusion to a long and bitter custodial battle that made national headlines , hit the High Court and even involved the British Consulate in the Middle East .
The 41 - year - old is unable to keep the smile from her face and protective arms from her son .
‘ I ’m just so thrilled , ’ she says from the family home in Camberley , Surrey .
‘ The last time I was able to mother Tariq properly he was eight .
Now he ’s 17 .
It ’s strange adapting , but he ’s doing brilliantly . ’
Her fractured relationship with Tariq ’s father has been well documented .
She met billionaire Rashid , who has played polo with Prince Charles and counts Prince Michael of Kent and Omar Sharif among his friends , in 1990 .
Sarra , then an air hostess for Emirates Airlines , rode at the stables in Dubai where Rashid kept his ponies .
They embarked on a whirlwind affair .
But when she announced she was pregnant , she says , he demanded she have a termination and said he wanted nothing more to do with her .
Distraught , she moved back home to Camberley to bring up Tariq .
In 1994 , she married Neil Fotheringham , a local policeman , with whom she had three more children – Cameron , 13 , Annabel , ten , and Charlie , eight .
Neil legally adopted Tariq and she heard no more from Rashid , now 42 , until 1999 when , knowing her son would soon start asking questions , she wrote asking if he wanted any contact .
This time Rashid , whose family owns a string of hotel , construction and leisure businesses , including the Rolls - Royce franchise in Dubai , came to London to visit the family , and made them an offer they felt they could n’t refuse .
If the Fotheringhams moved to Dubai and granted Rashid occasional access to Tariq , Neil would be given a teaching job in the school the family owned , they would be given a mansion to live in and their own children would be provided with an expensive education .
Yet when they arrived , the Al Habtoors , who have close links to Dubai ’s ruling Makhtoum family , demanded to see Tariq every weekend and launched a court action to make him legally theirs .
Sarra and Neil were unable to move back to Britain because Neil had handed his passport over to Rashid when he started working for him .
In an admittedly foolish move , Sarra signed an agreement to relinquish parental responsibility of Tariq so they could fly back to Britain where , she was sure , they would regain custody through our own legal system .
Custody : Rashid Al Habtoor with Tariq in 2002
But the High Court eventually ruled that her son had forfeited his rights to be a British resident by moving to Dubai with his mother and was therefore , under Middle Eastern law , to be left in Rashid ’s care .
Two years later , Sarra returned to Dubai to smuggle her son out .
Arrested trying to board a ferry to Iraq with him , she was thrown into prison before being released on bail .
After that , she was only allowed to visit him twice a year .
Tariq was enrolled at the international school owned by the Al Habtoor family .
His room on his father ’s nine - bedroom estate was undecorated , and any toys were immediately swept away by the fleet of maids who monitored his every move .
He wore a Kandura – a Muslim robe – and was obliged to fast for a month every Ramadan and attend the mosque for prayers every Friday .
He saw his father – who had by then had an arranged marriage and three other children with his new wife – once a day .
They never embraced .
He was n’t allowed to attend after - school activities , and the only sport he was encouraged to pursue was polo .
It was an alien environment for a Western ten - year - old .
‘ I was confused and scared , ’ says Tariq , who found it difficult to sleep without his favourite bedtime story , and only spoke to Sarra by phone once a week .
‘ My father ’s wife did n’t want to know me and even though I got on with my brothers and sister and made friends at school I still missed Ma . ’
Sarra , who separated from Neil three years ago and now works as a customer services manager for her local police force , adds : ‘ I bring my children up with cuddles .
Rashid thinks children should be seen and not heard and imposed the strictest discipline . ’
Perhaps understandably , Tariq rebelled .
At first his mischief - making was minor – an unfinished school assignment or uneaten dinner .
Yet it was met with reproach from Rashid .
‘ He would fly off the handle , ’ says Sarra .
‘ He was never physically violent but he ’d ground him – always saying it was for life .
Tariq would call me to say he ’d been grounded for life ... again .
We started to joke about it .
Of course , I ’d stress the importance of behaving , but he was n’t doing anything worse than any other kid . ’
Meanwhile , Sarra eagerly anticipated her biannual visits , arranged by Rashid ’s servants , normally in the summer and Christmas holidays .
After Rashid gained custody of Tariq , Neil was banned from seeing him , so she took their three children with her .
‘ We went to the local water park , always accompanied by a bodyguard , ’ she says .
‘ Going back home without him was horrendous . ’
Slowly , Tariq ’s behaviour worsened .
It ranged from bizarre incidents such as climbing up drainpipes to more serious offences like getting drunk on vodka and Red Bull , setting fire to some hay in a local festival display and running away to stay with local friends .
‘ I was bored , ’ is Tariq ’s excuse for his trouble - making .
Sarra has a different explanation .
‘ It was an attention bid , ’ she believes .
‘ I tried to warn him he could hurt people , but mainly we kept our conversations light .
He was getting into enough trouble with his father . ’
By the time Tariq was 15 , Rashid , having had no direct contact with Sarra for five years , resorted to calling her for advice – and recriminations .
‘ He ’d gone from denying me access to my son to blaming me for spawning a badly behaved boy , ’ she explains .
‘ He ’d shout “ your son ” this and “ your son ” that .
I told him to send Tariq to live with me , but he would n’t .
In Islamic culture , the son of an estranged relationship lives with his father . ’
She claims : ‘ Tariq was turning into a fantastic polo player and Rashid loved showing him off .
But when Tariq was shy around his friends he would reprimand him , which would make him even more introverted .
‘ He was ashamed of me .
And by the beginning of this year I was miserable , ’ says her son .
‘ I did n’t ask him if I could come back to England .
I knew he ’d say no .
But I began to think more about it . ’
The day before his escape , he called his mother and asked her to book a flight to London for him for the next day .
‘ I was stunned , but overjoyed , ’ says Sarra .
It was the end of term – having passed five GCSEs , he was studying for his International Baccalaureate – and Tariq knew the school day would finish earlier than normal , so he would have two hours before his bodyguards came to collect him .
It was then he fled to the airport and the plane to Heathrow .
Kept apart : Sarra Fotheringham with Neil , whom she married after having Tariq , and their children Cameron and Annabel in a picture from 1998
‘ From the moment I saw him I could n’t stop hugging him , ’ says Sarra .
‘ He begged me not to tell his father where he was , but Rashid found out after Tariq emailed one of his sons .
' A week later , he sent me a text message , saying it was all my fault .
But that was it – he seemed to think their relationship was beyond repair .
And now Tariq is in Britain , Rashid has no legal rights over him . ’
Meanwhile , Tariq settled into a Western lifestyle .
For his 17th birthday , a fortnight after his arrival , Sarra bought him a second - hand Renault Clio so he could practise for his driving licence , and took him out for a steak .
‘ I thought he would n’t eat pork , and warned him I kept hot dogs in the fridge , ’ she says .
‘ He just looked at me and said , “ And ? ” He has abandoned any Muslim beliefs . ’
His behaviour has also improved .
‘ I rebelled because Father was so strict , ’ he claims .
‘ I used to drink alcohol because every time I drank I thought it would be the last time I was able to .
Now Mum lets me have a drink I do n’t bother . ’
While Sarra is at work he earns his pocket money looking after his brothers and sister .
‘ It ’s great not being lonely , ’ he says .
‘ I talk to my brothers in Dubai on MSN , and I miss my friends there , but I have n’t spoken to Rashid once , and that does n’t bother me . ’
Indeed , when Sarra called Rashid last month to tell him Tariq was going to start his A - levels at the local comprehensive in September and hoped to go on to Sandhurst and join the Army , he simply said he would n’t give him a penny , wanted nothing more to do with him and had given his possessions to charity .
And when The Mail on Sunday phoned him to ask if he wanted to comment on Tariq ’s return to England , he said : ‘ There is no story , ’ and hung up .
For her son ’s sake , Sarra has put aside her animosity .
‘ I ’m hurt his attitude is so cut and dry , ’ she says .
‘ But , hopefully , they ’ll be reacquainted one day . ’
She says one of the reasons behind her split with Neil was their struggle for Tariq .
‘ Neil had to shut him out of his heart when he was n’t allowed to see him , ’ says Sarra .
‘ He is trying to be friends with Tariq now , though . ’
There have been other teething problems .
‘ His attitude towards women can be hostile , as he was n’t bought up to see us as equals , ’ says Sarra .
But there are touching moments .
‘ He has just learnt to make his bed for the first time , ’ she smiles .
‘ He called me at work to tell me , he was so proud . ’
As Tariq himself puts it , with his awkward , slightly self - conscious smile : ‘ I ’m enjoying things much more now I get to do them myself . ’
Mexican President Felipe Calderon has proposed sweeping reforms to its state - owned oil company Petroleos Mexicanos ( PEMEX ) .
He denies that his reforms constitute privatization and claims they will serve to make PEMEX stronger .
Many view his proposals as a threat to Mexican sovereignty and nothing more then an energy grab .
It is through NAFTA and the Security and Prosperity Partnership ( SPP ) that the U.S. is further securing access and control to Canadian and Mexican resources .
Former presidential candidate , Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador , who lost to Calderon , is spearheading a movement to stop oil privatization and pushing for a referendum .
Opponents of the reforms were able to force the Mexican Congress to hold a series of debates which ended on July 22 .
There is a swell of national sentiment spreading across the country as the majority of Mexicans wish to retain control of one of their last symbols of sovereignty .
Mexico's oil industry was nationalized in 1938 , and its constitution forbids foreign investment in the oil sector , including private corporate ownership .
Calderon insists that his reforms are necessary for the very survival of the country .
He describes PEMEX as broken and bankrupt , and believes that the only way to further develop any deepwater drilling is by opening it up to foreign investment .
The reforms will allow for key components of PEMEX to be taken over by private companies .
Opponents of the plan have called it backdoor privatization and fear it will lead to the complete takeover of the industry .
If passed , the reforms will allow private companies to build refineries , transport oil , and own pipeline networks .
It will open 37 of PEMEX 's 41 divisions to private subcontractors .
It has been reported that Halliburton already has a contract with PEMEX to drill for new wells and maintain pipelines .
The move to privatize Mexican oil runs contrary to a worldwide trend to further nationalize oil reserves .
There is little doubt that there are many problems associated with PEMEX , but there should be the necessary funds in place to make upgrades and pay for future development .
There have been allegations of corruption , including massive money deviations and other improprieties .
Some of its profits also went to pay down Mexico 's foreign debt .
The point is that there has been very little in the way of accountability of money allocations .
PEMEX also turns over 60 % of its revenue to the government in the form of taxes .
Some of this money is used for social programs and public work projects .
It has been suggested that , by lifting the tax burden imposed on PEMEX , it would be able to reinvest in its own development .
What is at stake is Mexico 's future as a sovereign nation .
There are fears that the privatization of PEMEX will only lead to more social unrest and plunge Mexico into even deeper poverty .
What are needed are reforms that truly strengthen PEMEX and guarantee its oil supply for Mexican demand .
This runs contrary to the SPP and a North American resource pact which ultimately favors the United States .
The SPP is designed to consolidate U.S. control over North American energy supplies by expanding oil production in Canada and Mexico .
This includes gaining more access by further deregulating energy markets .
Under NAFTA , Mexico refused to privatize its state - owned oil industry .
The SPP is being used to bypass the Mexican constitution , and privatization of North American energy resources is at the very core of its agenda .
Stuart Trew of the Council of Canadians said that the North American Competitiveness Council is , " providing input into the SPP through the North American Energy Working Group , and their intentions are clear .
In the case of energy , what they want is a fast - tracked continental integration policy . " -
Laura Carlsen , the director of the Americas Program at the U.S. - based Center for International Policy , has stated that Calderon 's reforms will help in achieving some SPP objectives .
She said , " The first is to increase U.S. energy security by guaranteeing access to extensive deepwater reserves in the Gulf of Mexico , including Mexico 's portion of it . " -
She went on to say that , " The second objective is to open up oil and gas production and market to foreign companies . " -
The SPP is paving the way for a North American Union .
Since Calderon came to power , he has aggressively promoted NAFTA , free trade , the SPP , and the further privatization of Mexican institutions .
All represent steps toward a North American Union .
Last year , former Mexican President Vincente Fox , made some amazing revelations on the Larry King and Daily Show .
He discussed how he had been working with President Bush towards the creation of a single currency for North America .
He also argued in favor of a North American Union , using the EU as its model .
For all the talk of a North American Union being a conspiracy theory , it was an incredible admission by a most senior former government official .
This was not a slip of the tongue , and was meant to test the waters and further condition the population for continental integration .
· Calculations of risk found to be seriously flawed · Most - endangered may be months from extinction
Endangered species could become extinct 100 times faster than previously thought , scientists warned yesterday in a bleak reassessment of the threats to global biodiversity .
They say methods used to predict when species will die out are seriously flawed and dramatically underestimate the speed at which some will disappear .
The findings , presented in the journal Nature , suggest that animals such as the western gorilla , the Sumatran tiger and Malayan sun bear , the smallest of the bear family , may become extinct much sooner than conservationists had feared .
Ecologists Brett Melbourne , at the University of Colorado at Boulder , and Alan Hastings at the University of California , Davis said conservation organisations should use updated extinction models to urgently re-evaluate the risks to wildlife .
" Some species could have months instead of years left , while other species that have n't even been identified as under threat yet should be listed as endangered , " said Melbourne .
The warning has particular implications for the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , which compiles an annual " red list " of endangered species .
Last year the list upgraded western gorillas to critically endangered , after populations of a subspecies were found to have been badly affected by Ebola virus and the commercial trade in bushmeat .
The Yangtze river dolphin was listed as critically endangered , but could possibly be already extinct .
The researchers analysed mathematical models used to predict extinction risks and found that while they included some factors crucial to predicting a species ' survival they overlooked others .
For example , models took into account the fact that some animals died from rare accidents such as falling out of a tree .
They also included chance environmental threats , such as sudden heatwaves or rainstorms that could kill off animals .
But what the extinction models failed to include was the proportion of males compared with females in a population , and the differences in reproductive success between individuals in the group .
When they factored these aspects into risk assessments for particular species they found the danger of extinction rose substantially .
" The older models could be severely overestimating the time to extinction .
Some species could go extinct 100 times sooner than we expect , " Melbourne said .
The researchers showed that the missing factors - the number of males to females , and variations in the number of offspring - were capable of causing unexpected large swings in the size of a population , sometimes causing it to grow but also increasing the risk that a population crashed and became extinct .
To test the new models , Melbourne 's team studied populations of beetles in the laboratory .
" The results showed that the old models misdiagnosed the importance of different types of randomness , much like miscalculating the odds in an unfamiliar game of cards because you did n't know the rules , " he said .
For some endangered species , such as mountain gorillas , conservationists could collect data on individuals and plug the information into models to predict these animals ' chances of survival .
" For many other species , like marine fish , the best biologists can do is measure abundances and population fluctuations , " Melbourne said .
Craig Hilton - Taylor , who manages the IUCN red list in Cambridge , said extinction estimates were often inadequate .
" We are certainly underestimating the number of species that are in danger of becoming extinct because there are around 1.8 m described species and we 've only been able to assess 41,000 of those . "
The latest study could help refine models used to decide which species are put on the red list , he said .
" We are constantly looking at how we evaluate extinction risk , and it may be they have hit on something that can help us . "
More than 16,000 species worldwide are threatened with extinction , according to a 2007 report from the IUCN .
One in four mammal species , one in eight bird species and one in three amphibian species are on the organisation 's red list .
An updated list is due to be published in October .
Next week , the IUCN is expected to highlight the dire state of the world 's corals after surveying the condition of more than 1,000 species around the world .

Radio 4's The Pain Of Emotion
Grief can have physical effects
Love really does hurt , just as poets and song lyric writers claim .
New brain scanning technologies are revealing that the part of the brain that processes physical pain also deals with emotional pain .
And in the same way that in some people injury can cause long - lasting chronic pain , science now reveals why some will never get over such heartbreak .
Emotional pain can take many forms ; a relationship break - up or social exclusion , for example .
But it does not get any more extreme than losing a loved one , as Scottish broadcaster Mark Stephen did .
In July 1995 he was driving a tractor while hay - making and accidentally hit his young daughter .
She died shortly afterwards .
Mark 's grief was overwhelming , he says .
If you listen to people who are damaged emotionally , they will often translate their pain into physical similes
Professor David Alexander , Aberdeen Centre for Trauma Research
" When people talk about a broken heart , that for me was where it was seated , just below your sternum .
" It feels like your heart is leaking and you can't run away from it because you are the source of that pain . "
Thinking he would go mad with grief , he sought help from David Alexander .
Professor Alexander is director of the Aberdeen Centre for Trauma Research .
He led the psychiatric team that first responded to the Piper Alpha oil - rig disaster .
Since then , he has been involved in helping survivors of many disasters including the Asian tsunami , the war in Iraq and , most recently , the earthquake in Pakistan .
He also managed to get Mark Stephen through his darkest days .
' My guts are aching ' Professor Alexander is not surprised about the link between physical and emotional pain : " If you listen to people who are damaged emotionally , they will often translate their pain into physical similes : ' My head is bursting , my guts are aching ' and so on .
The parallel is very strong . "
But medical research has tended to concentrate on physical pain .
Neuroscientist Mary Frances O'Connor at the University of California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) is one of the scientists who have propelled emotional pain up the research agenda .
" We 're at a very new time when we can use technologies to look at the brain and the heart , " she says .
Naomi Eisenberger at UCLA has shown which parts of the brain are active when we feel emotional pain .
She devised an intriguing computer game in which participants were deliberately made to feel left out .
Simultaneous brain scanning revealed that the pain of being socially rejected was processed in much the same way in the brain as physical pain and in the same area , the anterior cingulate cortex .
' Complex grief '
Why should physical and emotional pain be linked in this way ?
Social relationships are crucial to our survival as a species .
In dangerous situations , a lone human is in peril whereas a group may survive .
" The social attachment system is piggy - backed onto the physical pain system to make sure we stay connected to close others , " says Naomi Eisenberger .
" Being wrenched from another or rejected by a group is painful , so we avoid it . "
There is an increased risk of dying in the six months after bereavement
Professor Martin Cowie , Brompton Hospital Physical pain warns us not to do something , walk on a broken ankle for instance .
And emotional pain too can be a warning - " do n't go near that sort of man again " , " avoid women like her " .
But sometimes physical pain can become chronic , long outlasting its original purpose , and emotional pain is the same .
Mary Frances O'Connor calls it " complex grief " and it occurs in about 10 % of people after bereavement .
" They experience a lot of bitterness and anger , that their future is senseless .
They do n't adapt with time as others do . "
There is a very strong suspicion that people who are not adapting to bereavement are also those who experience the greatest levels of physical pain .
But can we die from a broken heart ?
Martin Cowie is professor of cardiology at the Brompton Hospital .
He is very sure of the answer : " Yes , we can .
" There is an increased risk of dying in the six months after bereavement and it's particularly marked amongst men . "
The bereaved are much more likely to be involved in accidents , which is perhaps understandable , but also to die from heart attacks and stroke .
The hormones involved in the stress of bereavement make these events more likely .
This knowledge makes it essential to identify and treat those whose emotional pain is likely to become chronic , causing debilitating depression or even death .
The Pain Of Emotion will be broadcast on Monday , 21 July , 2008 at 2100 BST on BBC Radio 4 , and for seven days on BBC iPlayer .

The Iraq war is many things to different people .
It is called a strategic blunder and a monstrous injustice and sometimes even a patriotic mission , much to the chagrin of rational human beings .
For many big companies , however , the war is something far different : a lucrative cash - cow .
The years - long , ongoing military effort has resurrected fears of the so - called “ military - industrial complex . ”
Media pundits are outraged at private companies scooping up huge , no-questions - asked contracts to manufacture weapons , rebuild infrastructure , or anything else the government deems necessary to win ( or plant its flag in Iraq ) .
No matter what your stance on the war , it pays to know where your tax dollars are being spent .
Following is a detailed rundown of the 25 companies squeezing the most profit from this controversial conflict .
You know what 's the most unbelivavble thing from all this ?
That , after 2 years and 2 months , half the content shown in this new trailer is recycled straight from 2006 's first ( and until now , only ) FFXIII trailer .
un-fucking - belivable .... 2 years after they showed us the only trailer for FFXIII and half is the same content .
Man , development on this title is going a lot slower than I expected .
We 'll be lucky if we get to play it in japanese by 2010
This is the third post in an article series about Python video lectures .
The previous two posts covered learning basics of Python and learning Python design patterns .
This video lecture is given by Google 's " Über Tech Lead " Alex Martelli .
In this video he talks about the most important language changes in each of the Python versions 2.2 , 2.3 , 2.4 and 2.5 .
I am actually using an older version of Python , version 2.3.4 .
This lecture gave me a good insight of what new features to expect when I upgrade to a newer version of Python .
Here it is :
Interesting information from lecture :
[ 01:30 ]
There are many versions of Python - Jython , IronPython , pypy and CPython .
[ 03:02 ] Python 2.2 was a backwards - compatible revolution .
It introduced new - style objects , descriptors , iterators and generators , nested scopes , a lot of new modules in standard library .
[ 04:12 ]
New rule for introducing extra features : 2.N. * has not extra features with respect to 2.N .
[ 04:32 ] Python 2.2 highlights : metaclasses , closures , generators and iterators .
[ 05:35 ] Python 2.3 was a stable version of Python with no changes to the language .
[ 06:05 ]
Python 2.3 had a lot of optimizations , tweaks and fixes , such as import - from - zip , Karatsuba multiplication algorithm , and new stdlib modules - bz2 , csv , datetime , heapq , itertools , logging , optparse , textwrap , timeit , and many others .
[ 08:50 ] Python 2.3 highlights : zip imports , sum builtin , enumerate builtin , extended slices , universal newlines .
[ 09:50 ] Python 2.4 added two new language features - generator expressions and decorators .
New builtins were added - sorted , reversed and set , frozenset .
New modules - collections , cookielib , decimal , subprocess .
[ 13:00 ] Example of generator expressions and decorators
[ 13:37 ] Example of sorted ( ) and reversed ( ) builtins .
[ 16:40 ] Python 2.5 was also evolution of language .
It came with full support for RAII ( with statement ) , introduced two new builtins - any and all , unified exceptions and added a ternary operator .
New modules - ctypes , xml.etree , functools , hashlib , sqlite3 , wsgiref , and others .
[ 18:40 ] Python 2.5 optimizations .
[ 23:25 ] RAII - Resource Allocation is Initialization .
[ 25:30 ] Examples of RAII .
[ 31:05 ] Python RAII is better than C++'s .
Python 's RAII can distinguish exception exits from normal ones .
[ 33:29 ]
Example of writing your own context manager .
[ 36:30 ]
Example of writing a RAII ready type with contextlib .
[ 38:05 ]
Following Python 's Zen , " Flat is better than nested " , use contextlib. nested for multiple resources .
[ 40:40 ]
Generator enhancements - yield can be inside a try clause , yield is now an expression ( almost co-routines ! ) .
[ 44:50 ] Python 2.5 absolute / relative imports .
[ 47:00 ] Joke - " If you exceed 200 dots when using relative imports , you have a serious psychological problem " .
[ 47:45 ] Python 2.5 try / except / else / finally .
[ 48:55 ] Python 2.5 if / else ternary operator .
[ 49:35 ] Python 2.5 exceptions are new style .
[ 51:15 ] Python 2.5 any and all builtins .
[ 54:00 ] collections .
defaultdict subclasses dict and overrides __missing__ .
[ 56:55 ] ctypes is probably the most dangerous addition to Python .
One mistake and you crash .
[ 01:01:30 ] hashlib replaces md5 and sha modules , and adds sha-( 224|256|384|512 ) .
Uses OpenSSL as accelerator ( if available ) .
[ 01:02:29 ]
Lecture got cut here but the presentation still had two slides on sqlite3 and wsgiref !
Here is the timeline of Python versions .
I hope Alex does n't mind that I took it from his presentation . :)
If you do n't know what new - style objects are about , see these two tutorials :
Have fun writing better code in Python !
■ 泥１０ 問 題
IPA イベントにて ： 「 10 年は泥のように働け 」 「無理です」――今年も学生と経営者が討論 - ＠IT
この記事で報道された所謂、『泥１０問題』は、一度大きく盛り上がっただけでは収まらず、深く広く影響が波及しているようだ。私も、5月11日付のエントリー夢ある日本のIT企業として世界と勝負するには - 風観羽 情報空間を羽のように舞い本質を観るで、日本のIT業界の現状についてまとめていたのだが、今回の騒動を見ていると、やはり本当に根深い問題があることを再認識させられる。そして、IT業界に典型的に現れている問題ではあるが、けしてIT業界だけの問題ではなく、日本全体、日本の経営者全般について該当する本質的な問題と言えるだろう。世界の中で、急速に競争力を落としている。下記、２００７年のIMDの国際比較を見ても２４位と中国（１５位）や台湾（１８位）と比較しても低く評価されるような状況である。
ここしばらくの日本経済は、好調な世界需要と資源高等の恩恵を受けた会社を中心に、ミニ・バブルを謳歌したが、すでにそのささやかなバブルも崩壊の兆しが見えてきている。外需を当てにして、経営体質改善を先送りした企業は、これからまたシビアーな場面に引き戻されることは確実だ。
今まだ経営者ではないが、経営者予備軍の人たち、また将来を担う若い優秀な人たちは、今起きていることを十分に分析して、何をここから学ぶ必要があるか、ということに真剣に取り組んで欲しいものだ。今の時代の日本企業の経営というのは、正直なところ大変な仕事だ。『泥10問題』と揶揄はしても、いざ自分が取り組む段になると、あの激務を責任を持って取り組む覚悟のある人がどれだけいるだろう。でも、どうしても取り組まないといけない。そして、実際に経営に関与しない人も、ことの本質を十分に理解して、もっと高い目線を持って、目前の仕事のやり方や、自分のキャリア形成を考えていくことが望まれる。経営者も変わらないといけないが、従業員もクレバーになってこそ、今回のような問題に対する本当の解決策が見えてこようと言うものだ。
経営者の問題については、すでにあまりに多くの提言、指摘が出ているので、それをここで繰り返すつもりはないが、意外と盲点になりがちでありながら、気をつけないと『泥１０経営者』と同じようになってしまいかねない、と私が常々考えているポイントをご紹介したい。是非、自分自身の問題として考えてみて、まず自分の身の回りから改善していって欲しい。
今回は、原価低減／経費カットに関して、実際に企業で起きている事例を紹介して、解説してみたい。
■事例集
原価低減は会社経営をやるからには、どうしても避けて通れない重要な課題なのだが、これほどの罠に満ちた活動もまたない。今の時代、ここに潜む危険をきちんと理解できるかどうかが、かなり決定的な差になっていくと考える。あなたの身近にもきっと同じような事例が見つかるはずだ。
■管理部門を縮小し経費を一律カットする
現代は何よりスピードが勝負を決めてしまうことが多い。Big eats small .
ではなく 、Fast eats slow .
なのだ。組織で仕事を取組むのなら、何よりその組織のスピードを上げるためにこそ管理部門は最大限働く必要がある。よい人材を採用しモラルを上げるために最大限人事が働くこと、原価低減や原価管理の合理的で納得感のある仕組みを作り上げてスピーディーに運用できる経理部門を持つこと、いずれも組織のスピードを上げることに寄与するはずだ。直間比率のような単純な数値だけみて、管理部門を縮小したり、管理業務を慣れない事業部門に持って来て実質的に効率を落としてしまうようなケースは日本の会社にはよくあるが、これほど会社の競争力を毀損することはあるまい。確かに、BPO*1を含むアウトソースの活用は需要課題だが、この本質を知らず、組織の体質改善をせずにに丸投げすると、組織全体が機能不全となりかねない。
考えてみるべきこと： 場合によっては人件費や経費をおしまず業務のスピードを上げる（優先する）
■退職率が上がっている中では、社員教育は無駄になるため、お金を使わない（OJTで安上がりにすまそうとする）
従来日本企業は、教育と言えば、OJTとノミュニケーション（『飲む』と『コミュニケーション』を合わせた造語）に頼って来た。これは右肩上がりの成長が見込め、均質で優秀な大学卒男子を一括で毎年採用し続けることができたときには、有効に機能した。しかしながら、バブル崩壊後は、ほとんどの会社では、毎年の採用数は大きくばらつき、ほとんど採用しないというケースも多く見られた。その結果、年次ごとの人数はバラバラとなり、職場によっては、何年も新人が入ってこないというようなケースも珍しくない。それでは、OJTは成り立たない。年齢や業務の経験年数が離れすぎると、職場での教育というのは難しい。前後に先輩後輩が均等にいるケースでこそ成り立つ。しかも、若年人口自体が減ってくることは既に確定しているのだから、これからは、女性、外国人、中途入社、派遣社員等、大卒一括採用ではない社員を活用しなければならない。このような環境でどうやってOJTができるのか。当然、ノミュニケーションのほうも難しくなる。Diversityが極めて重要になってくる。
確かに日本の労働者の退職率は高くなってきているが、日本よりはるかに退職率が高い米国でも、労働経費全体に占める教育費の割合は日本より圧倒的に高い。というより、日本は先進国比較で見ると、最下位の部類だ。米国でさえ、教育投資に消極的な会社は、忌避される傾向があるため、有能な社員を確保するためにこそ、教育投資をしっかりとやる。GEなどその代表格で、前CEOのジャック・ウェルチは、自分の時間の１５％を社員や経営者候補に対する教育に使うと豪語していた。クロトンビルでの徹底的な教育も有名である。
ちょうど良い資料がなく、米国の数値も入っていないが、教育投資の国際比較につきグラフを添付しておく。
http://www.meti.go.jp/report/tsuhaku2005/2005honbun/html/H3142000.htmlより引用。
考えてみるべきこと： 教育投資は開発投資と同様にある程度の無駄を覚悟の上でコンスタントにしかも現状より規模を大きく行う（外部教育も積極的に取り入れる）
■有能な社員に仕事を集中させ無能な社員はクビにする
経営者が社員にバカにされるような会社では、どのような状況であれ、優秀な人材からいなくなるのが常なので、都合良く優秀な人材だけ残して、無能で不要な社員だけクビにするということは基本的に難しい。かりにこれができて有能な社員だけになったとしても、仕事は付加価値が高いものばかりではないから、本来高付加価値を実現できる有能な社員に、付加価値が低い雑務をさせて、忙しくすることになる。すると、どういうことになるかというと、大方重要ではないが緊急性の高い業務に優秀な社員が忙殺されて、モラルが下がることになるだろう。そして、緊急性が高くないが重要な仕事はどんどん後送りされることになる。早晩この会社は成長できなくなり、優秀な社員は雑務に疲れ、モラルダウンしてやめていくことになるだろう。もしかしたら、優秀な社員の定義を間違っているのかもしれない。優秀な社員とは利益率の高い仕事を創りだして実現する者のことを言う。そんな存在に雑事をまわす会社がどうやって生きのびて行けるだろう。優秀な社員は一見暇なくらいにしておくことが重要だ。
考えてみるべきこと：有能な社員は次代の有望な事業の構想や有力顧客開拓を行う余裕を与え、付加価値の低い仕事は給与の安い能力の多少劣る社員にやってもらう
■不動産経費が高いから本社を安いところに引っ越す
特にこれから優秀な人材に残って働いてもらいたいのであれば、会社の場所を賢明に選ぶことは極めて重要だ。クリエイティブな仕事ができる人材は、仕事をする場所を選ぶ傾向がある。『クリエイティブ・クラス』*2でも指摘されているように、特に今後は一層そういう傾向が出てくると考えられる。シリコンバレーの実例に見られるように、近接する場所の有能な人材どうしが交流することで、それぞれの会社の事業自体が活性化し、新しい事業が生まれてくるような、そういう時代がやってこようとしている。IT技術により場所と時間を超えることができるのは一面の事実だが、反面、リアルの交流のもたらす効果が無視できないどころか、活性化の鍵を握っていることも確かだ。最近の事例で言えば、はてなの近藤社長が海外に渡り、最終的には帰国してしかも本社を京都にもどした一連の動向がある。会社の場所は、経費の高低だけで決めてよいものではない。もちろん、見栄をはって分不相応の場所を選ぶことは逆の意味で会社を崩壊に導くことは忘れるべきではない。
考えてみるべきこと： 人材が最も生かされて成長できる場所を本社に選ぶ
まだ、時間を書ければ沢山思い出しそうだが、今日のところはここまでにしておこう。このエントリーを読まれた皆さんも、同様な事例があれば是非ご連絡いただきたい。
Why is it So Hard to Wake Up in the Morning ?
Our FYI experts tackle your burning questions . . . with the power of science !
Written on 6/19/2008 by Jim who writes about money & personal finance at Blueprint for Financial Prosperity
If you are a new graduate , congratulations !
Everything you ’ve worked for during your college career has come to fruition .
If you thought college was fun , this next chapter has the potential to be way more fun .
You can stop doing homework , at least for a little while , and actually relax at night and on weekends ( and be able to pay for it ! ) .
I graduated college several years ago and , in looking back , wished I knew then what I know now about personal finances and money .
I ’ve distilled these ideas into the seven tips you see below .
None of them are difficult to do , they ’re just difficult to remember .
If you can do all of these tips you ’ll be ahead of the curve .
Set It and Forget It Retirement
When you start your new job , the last thing on your mind is what you ’ll be doing when you retire in forty years .
However , what you do now will pay big dividends in forty years so be sure to take advantage of the retirement options you have .
Contribute to a 401 ( k ) or 403 ( b ) retirement plan if you can , especially if your employer offers to match a percentage of your contribution .
Contribute to a Roth IRA to the maximum every year you can because , hopefully , eventually you will earn too much to contribute and you ’ll want to take advantage of tax - free growth while you can .
Need proof of this :
If you contribute only $ 100 a month and it appreciates at 10 % a year for forty years , you ’ll end up with over $ 632,000 .
Set it and forget it .
Seek Mentors
Find people who know more about the world than you do and learn as much as you can .
One of the greatest lessons you can know as a young person is that you do n’t know a damn thing .
All the greats always credit the ones who came before them , the giants ’ whose shoulders they stood on – find your giants .
Continue Learning
You may have just graduated college but do n’t stop learning .
If your new employer offers education reimbursement , use it and use it as quickly as you can .
Education reimbursement is like getting a raise in your salary .
And , when you ’ve completed yet another degree , you ’ll be able to command more in the marketplace for your skills and knowledge .
All that costs you is time and effort .
Always Be Networking
Networking is really the fancy term for making new friends .
Find opportunities to meet new people by participating in as many things as you can .
Join local groups interested in what you like , attend work functions ( especially if they ’re geared towards new employees ) , and actively participate in local charities or philanthropic groups .
Friends give life richness , make as many as you can .
Pay Off Debts
If you have any credit card debts from your freewheeling college years , begin paying those off in earnest .
Credit card debt is a weight that will hold you back from your dreams as long as you let it .
Your dream is n’t to sell your future so you can have fancy new clothes or glittery new electronics , your dream is to make a good life for yourself and the ones you care for .
Credit card debt , and other debts , are holding you back so get rid of those 20 % a year interest rate behemoths as soon as possible .
Keep Rent Low
When you move to a new place , do n’t immediately go for the swanky new apartment .
You just spent the last four years living in college dorms or off - campus housing , hardly Ritz - Carltons , so do n’t go locking yourself into high rents for the next year .
If you keep your rent low , you can save more and spend more on other , more important , things ( like paying off debts ) .
Enjoy Life , Have Fun !
I went to an engineering school where a lot of people spent a lot of their time hitting the books .
I had my fair share of fun but there comes a time when you need to start enjoying life and not focus 100 % on work .
Remember work - life balance .
You can burn the candle at both ends in college because it was only four years , you may be working for forty … your candle is n’t as long as you think .
Work hard , but remember to play as well or you ’ll end up miserable .
Congratulations once again and go celebrate !

Charter Communications , one of the nation 's largest ISPs , plans to begin eavesdropping on customers ' web surfing activity , to help web advertisers deliver targeted ads .
In letters being sent to some of its 2.7 million high - speed internet customers , Charter is billing its new web - tracking program as an " enhancement " for customers ' web surfing experience .
The letters were first reported by a BroadbandReports.com user on Sunday .
The pilot program is set to begin next month .
" Browsing the web can become more like flipping through your favorite magazine , where you see ads that are appealing to you and enhance your enjoyment and the utility of the experience , " the company 's letters read .
Charter 's system appears to be similar to a targeted advertising system in the U.K. developed by Phorm , a London company with alleged spyware roots .
Phorm is trying to strike deals with several large British ISPs to install a targeted advertising system to track the web - surfing patterns of broadband customers .
Using modified browser cookies , Phorm 's system would use surfing patterns to deliver closely targeted ads , and , the company claims , protect against online scams like phishing .
However , Phorm 's proposal has set off a storm of consumer protest after it was revealed that British Telecom ran secret trials on thousands of broadband customers .
Phorm 's opponents include the inventor of the world wide web , Sir Tim Berners Lee , and several prospective advertisers .
The U.K. government has said the system would likely be illegal unless explicitly opt-in .
Charter plans to test its program in four markets : Ft. Worth , Texas ; San Luis Obispo , California ; Oxford , Massachusetts ; and Newtown , Connecticut , according to Charter Vice President Ted Schremp .
He described the system as capable of noticing when a user visits Honda.com or Toyota 's website , for example , so when the user visits unrelated sites , he or she will be treated to automotive - related ads .
The company is aware of the privacy and transparency concerns , according to Schremp , but believes the program will benefit its customers and its own bottom line .
" The fact that we sent customer notification letters is indicative of the approach we are taking overall , " Schremp said .
" This is just another example of leveraging the latest technology . "
Charter is partnering with a company called NebuAD to build profiles of its users .
NebuAD will share the behavioral tracking results with third - party advertising networks like DoubleClick .
Users can opt out of the system , but have to give their full name and address to get an opt - out cookie .
The process would have to be repeated for every browser on every computer in a home to block the service , and would have to be reset if cookies are ever deleted .
Charter is entering tricky territory with the program , which effectively turns the ISP into the ultimate third - party tracking network .
Conventional ad delivery networks like DoubleClick use a third - party cookie to build profiles of users across different websites , but can only track visits to sites that serve the company 's ads .
In contrast , Charter will know every URL its customers visit .
Charter 's move comes at a sensitive political moment for ISPs , as Congress and the Federal Communications Commission revisit net neutrality – the idea that ISPs should treat all content fairly and without interference .
The move also highlights the increasing determination of ISPs to carve out new revenue streams , as they discovered that the traffic - delivery business –- simply being a dumb pipe –- is n't as lucrative as being a content provider .
ISPs like Earthlink and Verizon are now redirecting requests for nonexistent domains to pages with ads , while others are talking about ways to charge companies like YouTube higher fees to put their content on the fast lane to subscribers .
But Schremp says Charter is n't affecting other companies ' websites or inserting their own ads , and is instead benefiting the ad networks by helping them target customers better .
" We do n't see it as related to net neutrality , " Schremp said .
Charter says it will not be tracking personal information , such as medical websites .
Schremp said he did not know how long surfing histories were stored by NebuAD , but said it was long enough that the company 's profile of customers can learn and evolve over time .
\—
Correction :
The original version of the article inaccurately described some aspects of Charters ' plans , based on a misreading of the company 's descriptions of the program .
Threat Level regrets the error .

Dick Cheney & Vigilant Shield : Will a Missing Nuke from the B - 52 Incident be used in a Simulated Terrorist Attack ?
By Michael Salla
From October 15 to 19 , 2007 , a set of military and civil exercises will be held in Oregon , Arizona and Guam .
The exercises , TOPOFF 4 and Vigilant Shield 08 , are designed to test official responses to the detonation of radiological dispersal devices on U.S. territory .
The exercises will be overseen by Vice President Dick Cheney who will travel specifically to Portland to coordinate all Federal departments and agencies responses to the simulated attacks .
This has led to a number of civilian groups expressing alarm that TOPOFF and Vigilant Shield might be used as a cover for False Flag operations that replicate what occurred during the 911 attacks .
On September 11 , 2001 , Dick Cheney was overseeing a series of simulated terrorist attacks involving hijacked airplanes hitting buildings that was called “ Vigilant Guardian ” .
Vigilant Guardian was run simultaneously with NORAD training exercises called Vigilant Warrior and Northern Vigilance that altogether involved as many as eleven hijacked airplanes .
This created much confusion and led to stand down orders for the US Air Force that was unsure if the 911 attacks were part of the simulated exercises or real attacks .
This confusion accounted for the long delays between initial reports of hijacked planes being used in ‘ terrorist ’ attacks , and Air Force intercept missions being launched using the few planes not involved in the Northern Vigilance exercise .
What makes TOPOFF 4 and Vigilant Shield especially concerning is that they follow upon an incident involving five ( later revised up to six ) nuclear cruise missiles found on a B - 52 sitting on a tarmac at Barksdale Air Force Base on August 30 .
The Air Force has launched an official inquiry and so far has announced to the public that the B - 52 incident was nothing more than an unusually high number of errors .
A Washington Post article on September 23 summarized the main arguments for this explanation which has effectively put to an end any further investigations by mainstream media sources .
In contrast , a number of researchers have argued that the B - 52 incident could not have occurred without very senior officials giving orders , and others refusing to comply with such orders .
According to Wayne Madsen a number of Air Force personnel refused to allow the nuclear armed B - 52 to fly in a covert mission to Iran outside the normal chain of military command .
Madsen describes the nature of the internal conflict over the B - 52 incident : “ Command and control breakdowns involving U.S. nuclear weapons are unprecedented , except for that fact that the U.S. military is now waging an internal war against neo-cons who are embedded in the U.S. government and military chain of command who are intent on using nuclear weapons in a pre-emptive war with Iran . ”
Madsen is alluding here to the most plausible explanation for the source of orders leading to the B - 52 incident .
The orders emanated from the office of the Vice President , and in particular Dick Cheney himself .
Cheney ’s orders were opposed all the way up the Department of Defense hierarchy including Admiral William Fallon , Commander of Central Command , and Secretary of Defense , Robert Gates .
This is supported by a recent report in the Telegraph newspaper that Gates has become the chief opponent to Dick Cheney ’s plans to commit the U.S. to another war against Iran and is encouraging military officers to be more candid in their assessments of a new conflict .
What makes the B - 52 incident even more disturbing is that six nuclear cruise missiles left Minot Air Force Base , and the initial Military Times report on September 5 reported that five nuclear warheads were discovered at Barksdale Air Force Base .
This was subsequently revised by the Military Times to six in an updated story five days later on September 10 .
How could the Air Force mix up how many nuclear weapons were initially involved in the incident ?
The most plausible explanation is that there had been a discrepancy in the number of nuclear weapons that had left Minot and what had been later discovered at Barksdale ?
The nuclear armed B - 52 had been sitting on the tarmac in an unsecured military environment for up to 10 hours before its nuclear payload was discovered .
This offered plenty of time for the removal of one of the nuclear weapons .
Such an event had to be covered up for national security purposes which is why the Military Times revised its initial report .
The possibility of a missing nuclear weapon is augmented by an unprecedented official standown by the Air Force on September 14 where all planes were grounded allegedly to review Standard Operating Procedures .
Was the Air Force really conducting an emergency inventory to locate any missing nuclear weapons ?
This raises the disturbing possibility that not only was the B - 52 ordered to participate in a covert mission to attack Iran outside the regular chain of military command , but that one of its nuclear weapons was secretly siphoned off for another covert mission .
If Dick Cheney did give the order for the nuclear weapons to be loaded on to the B - 52 , it is highly likely that he is aware of the location and potential use of the missing nuclear missile .
A number of serious questions therefore need to be asked about the appropriateness of Cheney being in charge of TOPOFF 4 and Vigilant Shield .
This is even more urgent if there is a missing nuclear warhead that was taken from the B - 52 for a yet undisclosed mission .
Could this mission be related to the TOPOFF and Vigilant Shield exercises ?

After blocking any serious investigation or impeachment hearings on crimes committed by President Bush , Speaker Nancy Pelosi finally addressed the allegations of presidential crimes on that forum of deep intellectual and legal thought : the television show The View .
She agreed to answer a question from Joy Behar , who will have to suffice as a substitute for Peter Rodino .
In a perfectly bizarre moment , Pelosi stated that there is simply no evidence of any crime committed by the President despite the findings of the International Red Cross , various international groups , and a legion of constitutional experts .
It seems that America has now had its impeachment hearing before the august body of Whoopi Goldberg , Barbara Walters , Joy Bahar , and Elisabeth Hasselbeck .
If you feared that our democracy is de-evolving into a caricature of itself , just watch this video .
Here is what will suffice as the impeachment hearing of George Bush as the Speaker of the House of Representative is questioned by a comedian :
JOY BEHAR : You ’ve ruled against impeaching George Bush and Dick Cheney , and now Kucinich is trying to pass that .
Why do you insist on not impeaching these people , so that the world and America can really see the crimes that they ’ve committed ?
REP .
NANCY PELOSI : Well , I think that it — I think it was important , when I became Speaker — and it ’s , by the way , a very important position — President , Vice President , Speaker of the House — I saw it as my responsibility to try to bring a much divided country together to the extent that we could .
I thought that impeachment would be divisive for the country .
In terms of what we wanted — set out to do , we wanted to raise the minimum wage , give the biggest increase in veterans benefits to veterans in the seventy - seven - year history , then pass research for stem cell research , all of that .
This week , we ’re going to pass equal pay for equal work .
It has been a long time in coming — pay equity .
We ’re going to pass legislations for product safety , for toys that children put in their — there ’s an agenda that you have to get done .
You have to try to do it in a bipartisan way .
The President has to sign it .
If somebody had a crime that the President had committed , that would be a different story .
BEHAR : Can they still do it after he is out ?
BARBARA WALTERS : When , when we first - when I interviewed you last year , you had just begun , and you were going to clean up the mess , remember ?
PELOSI : We did .
WALTERS : You , you look around this country , 75 percent of the country , forget George Bush , thinks that Congress is doing a lousy job .
HASSELBECK : I think it ’s 91 percent now .
PELOSI : Well , I do n’t disagree with that because largely it ’s predicated on ending the war in Iraq .
That ’s the main question , and we were not successful .
In our House of Representatives , I ’m very proud of our members because they voted overwhelmingly over and over again to bring the war to an end , to bring the troops home safely and soon , send it to the Senate , and it hits a dead end .
But in terms of that particular standard , I would say I disapprove as well .
But we do , we passed some of the things I just mentioned , the energy bill .
We worked in a bipartisan way , and ovation , agenda , we have to create jobs , expand health care , protect the American people , and educate our children .
And you ca n’t do that if you ’re trying to impeach the president at the same time , unless you have the goods that this president committed these crimes .
BEHAR : They did it to Clinton .
PELOSI : But they did n’t have the goods and it was wrong , and it was wrong , and it was wrong when they did that .
Not that I - I have total disagreement with president on the war , the reason why we went in , which was based on a false premise .
But that ’s a different story than saying “ can we try to get something accomplished for people , ” have concerns about the economy and the rest .
For the video , click here and here .
Ironically , even this statement only came about because Pelosi was trying to sell her new book , “ Know Your Power : A Message to America ’s Daughters . ”
It appears that the message is that you should not let principle get in the way of politics when it comes to such issues as presidential crimes .
It is obviously a very frustrating and insulting moment for many .
The International Red Cross warned the president in 2002 that his administration was committing a war crime for which prosecution was possible , click here .
A federal judge ( before Pelosi and the Democratic Congress barred further judicial review ) declared that the domestic surveillance program was clearly illegal , click here .
The Judiciary Committee has voted to hold Bush officials in criminal contempt and referred the matter for prosecution .
Dozens of constitutional experts ( including myself ) have detailed impeachable offenses over the years .
Yet , Speaker Pelosi insists that there is no evidence of crime while refusing to investigate that allegations .
What is particularly troubling is that the Speaker is now on the record as suggesting that torture and illegal surveillance are simply not crimes .
That will be a useful fact when future president decides to engage in the same unlawful conduct .
Obviously , the Speaker is fully aware that respected organizations and experts have detailed crimes ordered by this President .
Indeed , it took repeated interventions by Congress to keep courts from continuing to rule on such illegality — destroying any notion of plausible deniability that Democrats have no knowledge of alleged crimes .
The Constitution foresees that , once credible allegations have been made ( as here ) , the House would investigate ( which Pelosi has blocked ) .
Instead of the proceedings envisioned by the Framers , Speaker Pelosi has reduced the matter to a fun exchange with a comedian on a gossip and gripe show .
In next week ’s episode , Elisabeth Hasselbeck will work out the details of the Iraq appropriations budget with Pelosi .
The Speaker had to compete on the home page for the View with pictures of male strippers and a segment “ Sheri Ca n’t Cook ! , ” click here .
Now , that is a perfect forum for discussing one of the most important constitutional questions of our time .

Plug - in hybrids generate buzz in San Jose Plug - in hybrids generate buzz at San Jose conference
The plug - in hybrid car is ready for its close - up .
Once known only to a small group of devotees , the ultra - high - mileage cars have generated enough buzz to draw about 650 people to a plug - in conference in San Jose Tuesday .
Major auto companies discussed their plans to mass market plug-ins , which operate like regular hybrids but can recharge off a wall socket , greatly extending their mileage .
San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed announced that a local startup will install charging stations around the city , for plug - in owners who live in apartments or want to recharge at work .
And Andy Grove , former CEO of computer chipmaker Intel Corp. , suggested a government program to retrofit existing trucks and SUVs with plug - in technology .
The conference was a sign that plug-ins may soon hit the mainstream .
No big car company currently mass produces them .
Until now , the only way to get one was to buy a regular hybrid and pay someone to convert it - or try to do the work yourself .
But General Motors is now developing a type of plug - in car called the Volt , which the company plans to start selling in 2010 .
GM also plans a plug - in version of the Saturn Vue sport utility vehicle .
Ford has its own plug - in program , as do Toyota and Daimler .
For the automakers , plug-ins are a way to address global warming and record gasoline prices at the same time .
During a hybrid car convention called Plug - in 2008 at the McEnerny Convention Center , Tim Kent with AFS Trinity shows off an extension cord that charges an electrically converted Saturn VUE on Tuesday July 22 , 2008 in San Jose , Calif .

" We increasingly believe that the ultimate solution involves the electrification of the auto as quickly as possible , " said Jon Lauckner , vice president of global program management for General Motors .
The company announced Tuesday that it will collaborate with 34 electrical utilities in the United States and Canada to study how plug-ins will affect the electrical grid , hoping to iron out any problems before the first wave of mass - market plug-ins arrives .
The Electric Power Research Institute of Palo Alto , one of the organizers of Tuesday 's conference , will also participate in GM 's study group .
" Utilities are about to become the gas stations for these vehicles , and they have to get it right , " said Mark Duvall , the institute 's manager for electric transportation studies .
Longtime fans of the plug - in view the car companies ' interest with a dose of skepticism .
They point out that GM gave birth to the first mass - market , all - electric car - the EV1 - only to abandon the project .
Saying the cars could pose a legal liability , GM literally took back the cars , which were leased to customers , and crushed the vehicles with a trash compactor .
" I know there 's a group of people in GM who are 100 percent committed to the Volt , but they 're not in charge , " said Sherry Boschert , author of the book " Plug - in Hybrids : The Cars that Will Recharge America . "
" Until I can buy the car , it 's still vaporware . "
But Boschert and others believe that public interest in plug-ins will ensure that the cars reach the mainstream .
Backers say the cars can get the equivalent of 100 miles per gallon or better .
" Change is absolutely afoot , " said Linda Nicholes , president of the Plug In America activist group .
" I do n't think there 's any way to put the electric genie back in the bottle . "
Because plug-ins will need a place to recharge in public , the city of San Jose announced a partnership with Coulomb Technologies of Campbell to install charging stations on light poles .
The stations , which look like triangular canisters , will draw their power from the poles .
Car owners will need to sign up for the service and will receive a small electronic card that will activate the charging stations .
Coulomb will install three to five stations in San Jose next year , even though the cars are n't yet widely available .
" It 's kind of a chicken - and - egg thing , " said Chief Executive Officer Richard Lowenthal .
" We need to be there first . "

▲ 「シンセで音を作ることは、おもしろい。楽器が弾けなくてもシンセは楽しめるんです。もっとたくさんの人に知ってもらいたい」という松武秀樹さんの思いから、プロジェクトはスタートした。
「いっしょにシンセの本を作りませんか」“４人目のＹＭＯ
”こと松武秀樹さんからそう誘われたのが、昨年の９月。ちょうど、テルミンの号で松武さんの取材を終えた直後のことでした。テルミンで電子楽器のおもしろさにどっぷり浸かっていた大人の科学マガジン編集部です。迷わず「やります」と答えていました。
「シンセサイザーで音を作るおもしろさを多くの人に知ってもらいたい」そんな思いがたっぷり詰まった単行本のプロジェクトとしてスタートしました。モーグ博士に始まるシンセサイザーの歴史、ＹＭＯを代表とするテクノ・ミュージックの誕生、そして、最先端シンセ紹介など、シンセサイザーの歴史や原理などをわかりやすく紹介しながら、シンセサイザーが近い存在になる、そんな大人の科学らしさを持った本にするべく企画会議を重ねました。プロジェクトメンバーには、松武さんに加えて、シンセシストの氏家克典さん、テクノ・ユニットELEKTELのPolymoogさんを中心に、編集者やライターも加わりました。
何度か会議を重ねるうちに「やっぱり、何かオマケをつけたいよね」と、松武さんからの提案。 最初は「じゃあ、ビンテージ・シンセのフィギュアなんか、どうだろう」といった本当にオマケ的なものから考え始めましたが、さすがにこのメンバーです。「デジタルのチップなら安いんだから、シンセ作っちゃおうよ」「簡単なシーケンサーもつけられるんじゃない」などなど、話はどんどん本格的な方向に。
そりゃあ本物のシンセがふろくにつくなら、それに越したことはありません。しかし、もしもふろくにシンセをつけるなら…、できるならアナログ・シンセにしたい、というのが編集部の思いでした。バーチャルではなく、つまみをいじって音色を作る楽しさを体験してもらいたい…。“よりプリミティブなものを通してモノの原理に触れる”というのが、大人の科学のコンセプトのひとつですから。しかし、アナログ・シンセがふろくのレベルで作れるとは思えない…。
そんな中出てきたのが、「パーカッション・シンセのようなものなら、アナログでできるのでは」というPolymoog案でした。
When Harmonix split from Activision to create Rock Band and the publisher handed the Guitar Hero reigns over to Neversoft , there was a lot of consternation .
Could these developers , best known for the Tony Hawk games , really take the world ’s leading rhythm franchise and keep it relevant now that the masterminds behind it had moved on ?
As the gaming world watched , Neversoft presented Guitar Hero 3 , which was quickly deemed a worthy offering to the series .
While it was n’t perfect , the game was quite good for a first outing , and the team promised to only get better as time went on .
Now , we prepare to welcome Guitar Hero : World Tour into the world , and it looks like the developers are ready to deliver on their lofty promises .
Obviously , the biggest difference between this game and previous entrants is that it ’s no longer just about the guitar .
Activision and Neversoft saw how wildly successful Rock Band became with the introduction of drums and a microphone , so the Guitar Hero franchise will be jumping on the bandwagon as well .
To that end , World Tour will introduce a sweet new drum set that attempts to make the experience a little more “ real . ”
Do n’t think Activision is resting on their laurels when it comes to the guitar though , as the latest version packs the most innovation since the introduction of five colored buttons and a strum bar .
In fact , the guitar is a good place to start , since it ’s seen some major overhauls in the past year .
First off , it ’s no longer a Gibson model ( due to an ongoing lawsuit with the guitar manufacturer ) , but rather a more general and generic axe .
It still has a nice aesthetic to it though , so do n’t worry about getting some homely , unshapely guitar just because it does n’t have the Gibson name on it .
As for functionality , the team has introduced a new Star Power button near the strum bar , as well as a touch - sensitive neck which will allow for sick slides , wild finger - tapping solos , and a ton of creative freedom in the music creation mode ( more on that in a bit ) .
The new neck is really the standout feature , allowing for more complex ( and ultimately rewarding ) solos and note runs , making the series ’ already notoriously difficult songs all the more taxing on Expert difficulty .
While the guitar is much - improved , the drums are brand new territory altogether , and Activision is looking to get it right the first time around when it comes to these babies .
Featuring three super - quiet , velocity - sensitive silicon rubber pads as well as two adjustable cymbals and a kick pedal , the kit is looking to distinguish itself from the competition right off the bat .
Also included in the back of the set are a number of ports , one for a high hat attachment , another to support a second bass pedal ( so you can double kick your way through those really tough tracks ) , as well as a MIDI jack that will allow you to plug in an actual electronic drum set and rock out with a professional kit if you are so inclined .
The set offers both form and functionality in one set , and even if you already own another drum kit , it ’s going to be real hard to pass up this set of plastic and rubber .
As for the music , Activision is promising 85 original master recordings to comprise the new set list for World Tour , featuring greats such as The Doors , The Eagles , and Van Halen .
While they were n’t ready to reveal the full track listing yet , we can confirm the existence of Van Halen ’s “ Hot for Teacher ” because we saw it being performed live at the press conference .
And after watching the Neversoft team tackle it on Expert , we can safely say that those who were hoping this game would be easier than the teeth - gnashingly difficult Guitar Hero 3 should go ahead and schedule an appointment with their dentists , as this one is probably even harder .
Remember the wall of notes from Guitar Hero 2 ’s “ Jordan ? ”
Yeah , this is just about as bad .
Regardless of difficulty , though , the fact remains that the Guitar Hero franchise will once again be delivering a top - notch set list full of acts you ’ve been dying to emulate in your living room .
If you ’re the type who ’s tired of playing everyone else ’s songs and would rather make music of your own , World Tour introduces what can best be described as a breathlessly comprehensive music creation studio which will basically allow you to take all your wildest visions and make them come true .
We watched as the design team picked out notes , scales , and rhythms and laid down tracks to serve as the building blocks of a song .
It ’s safe to say that this mode is extensive enough that you can replicate just about any actual song already out there in Guitar Hero format , as well as let your own visions take root to create brand new masterpieces .
Also , for anyone who wants to dabble with this mode without going into full - blown creation , the game features tons of guitar and drum samples that you can control simply by tapping a spot on the guitar neck or hitting a drumhead .
We mentioned above how the touch neck on the guitar will serve a major role in music creation , and its implementation allows you to really create unique works .
Holding the guitar level and touching the neck will give you various notes and chords , while tilting it up or down will change the octaves .
You can also jump into the studio menus and give your guitar , bass or drums a number of different effects and styles , allowing you to absolutely nail the exact sound you were going for .
In a way , it would be easy to get upset at Activision and Neversoft for creating a game featuring what is essentially a whole new suite of instruments and asking me to fork over another $ 200 to play , but that ’s not the point .
We constantly knock game franchises for refusing to innovate and trying to cash in on the same ideas over and over again ( see any sports series published by EA ) , and then demand we get something different .
That is exactly what World Tour has to offer .
With a new and improved guitar and a drum set that rivals anything else out there , the team has not only stepped up to Rock Band ’s precedent , but possibly even nudged the bar a bit higher still .
While it ’s still much too soon to pass judgment on which franchise is going to win this round , Guitar Hero wants everyone to remember that it was the first to bring rhythm gaming to the mainstream and it remains the current top - seller , and it surely wo n’t go down without a fight .

I ’ve just pushed a just about usable ( but horribly untested ) port of Vassili Bykov ’s very lovely Smalltalk Announcements framework onto github .
It ’s a very raw port at the moment ( the interface is n’t what you ’d call idiomatic ruby yet ) , but I shall be working on that soon .
Documentation ( beyond a synopsis in the readme file ) is nonexistent , but I reckon that there ’s the core of something useful there ( I ’ve got plans for using it in Typo as the basis of a Wordpressesque plugin architecture and I need it for my Sooper Sekrit Project too… ) .
Expect some more details on the whats and whys in this blog soon , but if you want to have a play , you ’ll find it at http://github.com/pdcawley/announcements.

Culture Minister Rhodri Glyn
Thomas initially announced the wrong winner before correctly naming Dannie Abse 's The Presence Wales Book of the Year .
At first , the photo application revealed only a smoky room and an empty chair , Mr. Jackson said , but then a man sat down .
Ms. Duplaga , again using remote technology , typed in the command to snap a photo .
“ When you take a picture with that computer , it shows a countdown , and when it does , this guy figures out what ’s going on , ” Mr. Jackson said .
“ It all clicks for him , and he puts his hand up to cover the lens , but it was too late .
She had already taken the picture . ”
Had the suspect been a complete stranger , the photographic evidence would have been a “ great lead , ” but not the decisive clue , Mr. Jackson said .
He said that when Ms. Duplaga described the tattooed subject of the picture to one of her roommates , the roommate replied : “ Oh , I know exactly who that is  it ’s Ian , ” referring to Mr. Frias .
Mr. Frias and Mr. Shahikian , it turns out , had been among the guests at a party at the apartment weeks before , and were friends of friends of the victims , as Mr. Jackson put it .
Ms. Duplaga was able to retrieve a photograph of Mr. Shahikian from the laptop as well , but Mr. Jackson was not aware of the circumstances .
Mr. Jackson said that Mr. Frias and Mr. Shahikian were arrested last year on a felony marijuana possession charge , but are not career criminals .
The disposition of their cases was not known .
Mr. Jackson said that Ms. Duplaga did not wish to be interviewed .
On Friday , no one answered the door at the beige colonial - style house on Ridgeview Avenue where she rents an apartment diagonally opposite a church .
The neighborhood is on the edge of the city ’s downtown ; in recent years , many of the prewar homes have been renovated .
An Apple spokesman declined to comment on the case or on the phenomenon of tracking criminals through computer software .
“ Back to My Mac ” is part of an online service that costs $ 99 per year and allows users to gain access to their personal computer from any connected Macintosh computer with the operating system Leopard .
The software that Ms. Duplaga used to take a picture of the thief , called PhotoBooth , is standard on all newer Apple laptop models , perhaps an unintended new frontier in crime - fighting .
“ It ’s certainly a great use of what was probably meant as a business product , ” Mr. Jackson said .
“ But if she had taken the picture and did n’t know who he was , we would n’t be in the same place as far as the investigation goes . ”
In the first human trial of its kind , a vaccine grown in genetically engineered tobacco plants has proved to be safe , paving the way to one day use it to help combat a potentially fatal form of non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .
Researchers report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA that the experimental vaccine triggered the immune systems of 11 of 16 volunteers ( with so - called follicular B - cell lymphoma ) to attack their tumors without any apparent dangerous side effects .
Some 18,000 Americans , typically between the ages of 60 and 65 , are diagnosed annually with this incurable , slow - growing type of cancer .
Study coauthor Ronald Levy , an oncologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine , says that physicians generally take their cues from the disease , waiting to see how fast it is moving — and treating it with toxic chemotherapy ( sometimes with radiation ) only if it becomes aggressive .
He says that if future trials are successful , the experimental vaccine , which can be made relatively quickly and cheaply , could become a short - term therapy administered immediately after diagnosis to try to keep tumors in check .
" This may not be a replacement for chemotherapies , but a supplement for them , " Levy says .
" A technology that is fast , like this one , is more amenable to a watchful waiting approach than a technology that is slow to produce . "
This and other anti-cancer vaccines work by pumping a patient full of the same protein or antigen that is on the surface of tumor cells .
Researchers believe that if the body contains enough of the protein , the immune system will recognize it as a potential danger and send out armies of disease - killing cells to seek and destroy tumors harboring it .
To make the vaccine , researchers took a sample of a patient 's tumors , which in this trial were made up of B cells ( white blood cells that help the body battle disease and infection ) .
They then extracted the gene from the cells that coded for the antigen they needed ( to help the immune system recognize the tumors as threats ) .
The key , researchers say , was to make enough of the protein quickly to prompt an immune response .
In this case , the scientists achieved this by inserting the gene into a plant microbe known a tobacco mosaic virus ( TMV ) .
Plants are infected with TMV simply by scratching their leaves and depositing the virus into the tears .
Researchers discovered that the virus spreads throughout tobacco plants within a week , in the process cranking out a surfeit of the coveted proteins .
The scientists ground the leaves and separated out the antigen , which they then injected into volunteers .
They found that the immune systems of 70 percent of participants perked up when blasted with antigens specific to their cancers .
The researchers report mild side effects , such as swelling around the injection site and mild to moderate flu symptoms in some participants within a week of getting the vaccine .
Of the original group of 16 — who ranged in age from 30 to 64 — three died ( from the disease , not the vaccine ) , but 13 are still alive and their diseases are in remission up to eight years since being given the vaccine .
All of the patients also received chemotherapy , so researchers cannot be certain what role , if any , the vaccines played .
Levy says more work is being done to assess the vaccine 's effectiveness .
Charles Arntzen , a plant biologist at the Arizona State University Biodesign Institute , says a major plus is how fast the vaccine can be whipped up .
" I think without the speed , " he says , " it would be hard to convince a cancer patient to wait for a vaccine to be developed , rather than going on some other therapy . "
Levy is trying to find a new biotech company to begin efficacy trials on humans as soon as possible .
He says that a vaccine like this one could be on the market as soon as it proved effective and safe .
( CNN ) -- A New Zealand judge has made a 9 - year - old girl a ward of the court so that her name can be changed from Talula Does the Hula From Hawaii , the country 's national news agency reported Thursday .
Family Court Judge Rob Murfitt listed a series of unusual names that New Zealand parents had given their children , and said he was concerned that such strange monikers would create hurdles for them as they grew up .
" It makes a fool of the child and sets her up with a social disability and handicap , " the New Zealand Press Association quoted the judge as saying .
Among the names Murfitt cited : twins named Benson and Hedges -- after a brand of cigarettes ; Violence ; and Number 16 Bus Shelter .
Some parents had named children after six - cylinder Ford cars , the news agency reported .
iReport.com :
Do you have a unique name ?
The Registrar General of Births , Deaths and Marriages said in a statement that it had rejected names including Fish and Chips , Yeah Detroit , Stallion , Twisty Poi -- a staple food in Polynesian cuisine -- and Sex Fruit .
A lawyer for Talula Does the Hula From Hawaii said the girl is so embarrassed by her name that friends know her as " K . "
Last month , a judge in the U.S. state of Illinois allowed a school bus driver to legally change his first name to " In God " and his last name to " We Trust . "
But an appeals court in the state of New Mexico ruled against a man -- named Variable -- who wanted to change his name to a two - word phrase that contains a four - letter expletive and expresses opposition to censorship .

Oh , I ’m sorry .
Did I break your concentration ?
I did n’t mean to do that .
Please , continue !
You were saying something about “ best intentions ” ?
What ’s the matter ?
Oh , you were finished ?
Well , allow me to retort !
The way I parsed my prior arguments for an energy related die - off probably threw some people into a bit of tailspin , especially if you ’ve read a lot of my other stuff and ca n’t quite figure out how to reconcile that material with the idea of a loss of a sizable section of the human population .
Let me say again , in case it was n’t obvious enough : I do not claim to have any special knowledge , and I do not claim to have the only answer .
That is why it was so upsetting for me to solicit some alternate interpretations of what I was looking at and find nothing but shallow grasp of the facts and good intentions .
The ‘ good intentions ’ aspect of this is probably the most troubling .
I can deal with people who do n’t have time to do research and do n’t have the figures at their disposal , who have n’t got time to listen to hundreds of hours of lectures and commentary , and hear all the arguments and counter arguments .
That ’s cool .
What ’s frustrating for me is when people want to open this up into the occult dimension , and even worse so , when they want to parrot my own work back to me as if that exposes some contradiction in my thinking , or some fundamental inauthenticity in my work .
Because , after all , do n’t I go on and on about the psychoplastic nature of reality , about not getting snared in negative reality tunnels , or malignant conspiracies to control your views ?
And it ’s true ; I absolutely have .
But here ’s the thing : when people get turned onto this stuff for the first time , it ’s like a lot of profound experiences in life ; because the world and the people around you never talked about it , and show little evidence of understanding any of it , you almost feel like you ’re the first person to ever see the world that way .
You could almost feel like you got there first , and everyone is just going to have to catch up with you .
With things like magick , or whatever brand of new age ‘ new paradigm ’ piffle they ’re shilling these days , the natural instinct for people like this is to imagine that we can transfigure the whole world with magick and positive intentions , that all you have to do is jack off over sigils scribbled in the margins of the dancing wu li masters and that quantum physics and probability waves will make it all better .
But here ’s the false bottom in that little fantasy world , and the key to the naive arrogance in that thinking :
You want to change the world as it appears to be , into the product of a magickal act ?
Well guess what :
The world as it currently appears is already the product of magickal acts .
Long before you got up this morning and tried to change reality with your happy thoughts , long before you were even born , there were adepts doing that very thing , and doing it better than you ever will .
Except their thoughts might not always qualify as ‘ happy ’ in your books .
Tell me , what ’s the difference between Eckhart Toole fulminating about ‘ a new earth ’ to squadrons of gape - mouthed well wishers who read the law of attraction , and George H.W. Bush professing a New World Order to the planet ?
Here ’s a hint : old eckhart did n’t have the CIA , the drug cartels , the IMF and the united states military working for his vision .
It is , alas , as the late Robert Anton Wilson used to say ; “ The border between the Real and the Unreal is not fixed , but just marks the last place where rival gangs of shamans fought each other to a standstill ” .
And I ’m sorry guys , but if you really think you ’re running with the toughest gang of shamans , I ’m flattered , but you need to give your fucking head a shake .
A lot of what I ’ve done here is precisely to bring up the quality of ‘ our ’ ( whatever ‘ our ’ means … ) gang of shamans , and while in some ways the result has been encouraging , in other ways , not so much .
As I ’ve said at least a couple times now , peak oil was one of the formative influences on my work here , starting in 2005 , and I had been researching it for a couple years before that .
Part of the reason I am even here is that I saw a window , a slice of time where things were still plastic enough to be changed , when the magickal zeitgeist was still being formed , when the gang fight could go in either direction .
What I ’m trying to say here , at least in regards to certain aspects of the peak oil question , is that that window has clearly begun to close , if not closed entirely .
The front line of the war has rolled over us , and pretending that it has n’t is just foolish .
If you did n’t have the chops to prevent it , you certainly do n’t have the chops to reverse it , or mitigate it to any significant degree .
Your ‘ probability waves ’ , or sigils , or reality tunnel shifting , or good intentions are not going to change what has cemented into a consensus reality by now .
You will not be changing the amount of oil in the ground , you will not be changing the energy infrastructure by snapping your fingers .
You will not be making food out of thin air .
The best you can do is to command your own private sphere and work to redraw your part of the playing field in some useful way .
But do n’t kid yourself that you ’re going to out - magick the reality priesthood .
Not about this .
You needed to get up a lot earlier in the morning for that .
An awful lot of really holy , really spiritual , really positive people have suffered gruesome fates over the centuries , and a lot of them understood this stuff much better than you or I ever will .
The reason you do n’t hear all their stories , is because they ’re dead .
Just because a few optimists lived to write theirs , does n’t change the truth of that .
You do n’t get to wish away the physical world and it ’s momentum just because you had a couple interesting insights .
You do n’t get to ignore hard facts by thinking happy thoughts .
If you keep thinking that , the wave will crash right down on your head , and you ’ll be another optimist who does n’t get to write an uplifting biography .
This shit is chess , not checkers .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) � --
In what seems to be a perverse reaction to high gas prices , some cities are cutting back on public transit - at a time when their citizens need it most .
Due to skyrocketing fuel costs local governments are being forced to trim all sorts of services - not only busses - but police departments and road repair crews too .
The Montana Highway Patrol , after failing to find enough police recruits , is using $ 300,000 that had been set aside for more officers to pay the gas bill instead .
Sheriff 's departments in Maryland and Florida have also reportedly cut patrol routes or officers .
" They 're not going to fill positions because they do n't have the dough , " said Ronald Reucker , president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police .
" It 'll mean more speeding , more drunk drivers , and more fatal crashes . "
In a recent gas price survey by the National Association of Counties , 81 % of counties responding said public safety was the area most impacted by high gas prices .
Nearly half said reducing the number of vehicles in the county fleet are among steps being considered .
In the public safety area , Reucker said police departments with lots of miles to cover - like highway patrols or sheriff departments - would most likely feel the pinch .
Since voters are highly protective of public safety , he 's only heard of a handful of departments that have actually reduced services , he said .
Less lucky are city bus departments .
That may seem like tough love in a time when high prices are causing more and more people to take public transit .
But in Cleveland and other cities across the country , that 's exactly what 's happening .
" We 're planning on laying off some staff and cutting some routes that are poor performers , " said Jerry Masek , a spokesman for the Greater Cleveland Regions Transit Authority .
" People will still have service , but not as much . "
The cuts are necessary because Cleveland has seen its bus fuel bill go from $ 5 million a year in 2003 to a projected $ 21 million in 2008 .
Out of a total budget of $ 230 million , that 's a lot of cash .
" You just can't absorb that without doing something , " said Masek .
He did n't know how many bus lines would be cut , and said a combination of fare hikes could spare some neighborhoods .
" [ Riders ] would rather pay more than lose service , " he said .
" No matter how much we raise fares , it 's still cheaper than driving . "
And undoubtedly easier on your car , especially if the road repair crew is in a situation like New Jersey's .
It 's not the cost of driving those big dump trucks that 's straining the budget at the New Jersey Department of Transportation .
It 's the price of paving .
What many people do n't know is that asphalt is made largely from oil .
It 's the heavy oil at the bottom of a barrel that can't be refined into gasoline , diesel , jet fuel or other lighter products .
And it 's risen in price right along with gasoline .
The price for the main component in asphalt has jumped nearly 90 percent since last year , according to Erin Phalon , a spokeswoman for the transportation department .
" This puts us in a bind , " she said .
" It could mean future projects are scrapped or downsized . "
Translation : More bumps , more potholes , and more time at the mechanic .
TOKYO --
This story begins with a crime .
Under normal circumstances , there is no reason anyone would want to steal my bike .
It 's a basic get - around - town model that cost $ 150 .
It was the biggest bicycle a Japanese department store carried and it 's still too small for me .
The chain grinds on every rotation , although that may have to do with the fact that I leave it out in the rain and the bike is now covered in rust .
It has a bell but no night light as required by Japanese law — which , as you 'll see , is a misdemeanor that the Japanese police choose to enforce .
But the guy who stole my bike from outside a Tokyo train station one recent Saturday night was n't looking for anything flashy .
He was drunk — it was payday and he had over - celebrated .
He had slept well past his stop and was kicked off the last train of the night at the last station on the line .
It was a crime of necessity : Steal the wheels or walk .
My bicycle was available because I never lock it .
Not even when I 'm leaving it outside a busy train station overnight .
This is Japan .
Nobody steals your stuff here .
Safest place in the developed world .
You can look it up in the guidebooks .
It 's a silly stereotype , of course .
Tokyo's crime rate may be much lower than that of Los Angeles , but that does n't mean it 's free of petty thieves ( or robbers , killers and gangsters ) .
But live here awhile and enough anecdotal experience piles up to feed complacency .
I 've been chased by people who want to return a dropped coin .
I 've left my cellphone in a park , come back the next morning , and found it on the bench where I 'd set it down .
Having moved to Tokyo from London , where your cellphone was n't safe in your pocket , I found this amazing .
After a short time in a low - crime society , old habits changed .
I would leave my briefcase unattended on a train , for example .
And I stopped locking my bike .
I left it unclamped outside stores and restaurants , the lock wrapped uselessly around the bar under my seat .
I 'd leave it out all night in the driveway , unchained .
One summer vacation , I left all four family bikes sitting unlocked in the driveway for three weeks .
So I was more embarrassed than angry when I went back to get my bike that Sunday morning and found it gone .
No kidding , I hear you saying .
But I was so surprised I thought the ever - efficient Tokyo bicycle attendants might have impounded it for not being parked in a designated bicycle rack .
Tokyo is awash in bikes , and despite long rows of parking stands at every station , there are never enough spaces .
I was still contemplating a visit to the impounded bike lot a day later when an officer from a neighboring ward office of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police called me at home .
Officer Shinya Yoshioka had recovered my bike and captured the thief .
OFFICER Yoshioka works out of a tiny , two - room outpost called a koban , a staple of community policing in Japan .
These substations are scattered across Japanese neighborhoods , a way for the police to keep an eye on the comings and goings and , in theory at least , quickly respond to a crime or accident .
In my experience , kobans appeared to be little more than glorified information booths where people stop in to ask for directions .
The most common sight at a koban is a uniformed officer hunched over his desk map , tracing a route with his finger for a confused citizen .
But it was from his koban in Suginami Ward about three miles from my home that Yoshioka had spotted the bike thief .
It was after midnight , and the cops were on the lookout for suspicious behavior .
Suginami is a high break - and - enter neighborhood , Yoshioka tells me later ( another blow to the stereotype ) , one of the worst in Tokyo .
The guy on my bike was obviously very drunk , a crime in itself , Yoshioka explains .
The big knapsack on his back also attracted attention :
It could have held tools for breaking into homes .
And the bike had no night light .
So Yoshioka ordered him to stop .
Incredibly , the thief did .
This speaks volumes about the Japanese respect for authority .
The cops were on foot .
The thief was on a bike .
Japanese cops carry small guns , hidden from view .
Put an Angeleno bike thief in the same situation and he keeps biking .
Picks up his pace .
Maybe allows himself a laugh .
After determining he was n't carrying anything to jimmy open a window or door , the cops turned their attention to the bike .
Where did he get it ?
The crook opted to take his chances on talking his way out of trouble .
" I bought it , " he told the cops .
" For $ 30 . " Mistake .
Too much detail .
Nobody sells a bike for $ 30 , the cops told him .
They took him in for questioning and 40 minutes later had a confession .
Nice work , I tell Yoshioka when he recounts the story .
But what would you have done if he had n't stopped ?
" We would have chased him on our official bikes , " he says .
He points to a battered bike with a basket on the back .
" Is it fast enough ? " I ask him .
"
Oh , it ca n't compete with yours , " he says .
" But we would have done our best .
" YOSHIOKA knew the bike was stolen as soon as he checked the registration number on the little yellow sticker that is slapped on every bike frame sold in Japan .
One call to the computer center and Yoshioka knew that I was the bike 's owner , knew where I lived , and , for some reason , knew how old I am .
He called me at home .
When could I pick it up ?
Yoshioka wanted to return the bike personally .
I would have to provide some details , such as pointing out on a map the precise spot from which the bike was taken ( to make sure it matched the thief 's version ) .
Finding a time that worked for both of us took a little work , all negotiated over several phone calls through Hisako Ueno , a Times reporter and interpreter .
When it began raining on the morning of the appointed day , Yoshioka called to suggest postponing until the weather was better .
This one stolen bike seemed to be taking up a lot of police time , I said to Hisako .
Is n't this a bit unusual ?
Not at all , Hisako said .
She told me about the time she reported her bike stolen to the police .
When she called them a few days later to say she had found it abandoned near a busy train station , they excitedly told her to leave it right there .
The thief might come back for it , they said .
Two detectives staked out her bike for six hours .
The thief never showed .
When I finally get to the police station , Yoshioka is n't there .
He 's on duty at the koban , so I 'm introduced instead to Nobuo Taguchi , the regional station chief who will do the paperwork necessary to free my bike .
Taguchi ushers Hisako and me into a small , windowless room .
He plunks a file folder with the case paperwork onto the table .
He slides two Polaroid pictures across the desk at me .
They show the thief standing sheepishly in front of the train station .
In both shots , he is pointing to a chain link fence .
It is a feature of Japanese police work that suspects are taken to the scene of their crime to confess their misdeeds .
" This is where he took the bike , " Taguchi says .
I recognize the spot .
Not quite where I had parked it .
Close enough , I tell Taguchi .
He was pretty drunk , Taguchi says .
The cops had fingerprinted the thief and taken a mug shot .
But because I had never reported the bike stolen , the police decided to let him off with a warning .
Not that I would have wanted to see a 23 - year - old father of two go to jail .
" He was a good father , " Taguchi says .
" The envelope with his weekly pay had not been opened .
He was bringing it home to hand over to his wife .
" I sign a document asserting that the bike was being returned " without major damage " and acknowledging that the thief " was feeling sorry about what he had done . "
I look at the paper .
It 's in Japanese but I can see that the police have valued the stolen property at less than $ 50 .
For a moment , I 'm insulted .
But Taguchi seems pleased I 've come to claim the bike .
He wheels my humble two - wheeler out of storage and hands it off to me like a proud father to a son at Christmas .
I point out the lock wrapped under the seat and we share a laugh .
Taguchi bows as I walk it out .
I still want to thank Officer Yoshioka for catching the thief and for all his phone calls to arrange the bike 's return .
So Hisako and I walk my bike over to his koban about a mile away .
I praise him for his good work .
Repeat the self - deprecating line about being too lazy to take three seconds to loop my lock around the wheel .
The policeman cracks only the faintest of smiles .
I 'll lock it from now on , I quickly promise him .
" Please , " he says .
We say goodbye and I hop on my bike for the ride home .
I sink much lower than usual .
The guy was n't too drunk to adjust my seat , I grumble .
I raise it back as high as it will go and start to pedal off .
I hear the familiar groan of the rusty chain .
I pick up the pace .
It 's getting dark .
And I do n't have a light .

It 's argued that deforestation has made climate change worse
The town of Cherrapunjee , in the north - eastern Indian state of Meghalaya , is reputed to be the wettest place in the world .
But there are signs that its weather patterns may be being hit by global climate change .
" Not without reason has Cherrapunjee achieved fame as being the place with the heaviest rainfall on earth , " wrote German missionary Christopher Becker more than 100 years ago .
" One must experience it to have an idea of the immense quantity of rain which comes down from the skies , at times day and night without a stop .
It is enough to go a few steps from the house to be drenched from head to foot .
An umbrella serves no purpose . "
Late monsoon
But according to Cherrapunjee 's most renowned weather - watcher , Denis Rayen , the climate of the town is changing fast .
" In the days of the Raj , the British used to come here to the the Khasi hills to escape the heat - we are 4,823ft ( 1,484 m ) above sea level , " he says .
" But today I am not sure they would be able to do that , because it is getting a lot hotter here and the monsoon is arriving later . "
Official figures compiled by the Indian Meteorological Office in the nearby city of Guwahati back up Mr Rayen 's arguments that north - east India as a whole is getting hotter .
" The average temperature for Guwahati at this time of the year should be around 32C - but this year the temperature has been as high as 38 C , " said weather expert Harendas Das .

" It 's too early yet to say precisely what is happening , but the evidence suggests that higher temperatures mean the whole area is experiencing less rainfall . "
Figures compiled by Mr Rayen show that Cherrapunjee may struggle to maintain its position as the world 's wettest place .
Rainfall figures for 2005 and 2006 were below average .
" The average rainfall at Cherrapunjee during the last 35 years has been 11,952 mm ( 470ins ) and there were several years when it was substantially more than this , " he says .
In 1974 it rained 24,555 mm ( 967ins ) - which Mr Rayen says is " the highest recorded rainfall in any one place in any one year " .
On 16 June , 1995 , it rained a record - breaking 1,563 mm ( 61.53ins ) over a 24 hour period .
" But in 2005 and 2006 our yearly rainfall was well below the average .
We could well be witnessing a severe change in our climatic conditions because of global warming . "
In the monsoon , Cherrapunjee 's waterfalls become raging torrents
While the annual rainfall for 2007 was back to normal , Mr Rayen argues that the " pattern of delivery " of Cherrapunjee 's rainfall is changing .
In previous years , 98 % of the area 's rainfall was between March to October .
This year the rains did not arrive until June , and the reason for that he says could be man-made .
" During the last few years , I have seen the forests vanish in front of my eyes , " said Mr Rayen .
" A combination of global warming and intensive deforestation is taking a heavy toll in this , one of the most beautiful areas of India .
" Because it now rains heavily over a shorter time period , crops are destroyed and there is intensive soil erosion .
The lack of woodland means that the water flows faster from Meghalaya into the Bangladesh delta , only 400 km ( 249 miles ) away . "
Mr Das says that parts of Meghalaya are " at risk from desertification " because of a combination of increasing urbanisation and industrialisation on the one hand and deforestation and shortages of ground water on the other .
" Because the capacity of the soil to hold water is lost , there is a real possibility that the wettest place in the earth may soon be facing water shortages , " he says .

John McCain ’s ‘ Obama Love ’ fund - raising video was a hit on the web this week , so it ’s a surprise to find that it ’s been zapped from the campaign ’s YouTube channel .
According to Unruly Media ’s viral video tracking service , the McCain campaign ’s ‘ Obama Love ’ video was the hottest presidential candidate viral video on the web this week .
Nevertheless , the video has been removed from YouTube .
The fund - raising videos also appear to have also been removed from the campaign ’s web site .
Unruly Media reports that the video has been viewed almost 260,000 times since its release Tuesday .
That makes it one of the McCain campaign ’s most successful viral videos to date .
It ’s not clear why the video was deleted , but there ’s a good chance that the campaign ’s use of Frankie Valli ’s hit tune Ca n’t Take My Eyes Off Of You had something to do with it .
Licensing such hits is expensive , and the tune is frequently used in television commercials .
There were two versions of the video , and both appear to have been taken down .
Viewers voting for their preferences for the two videos generally preferred the one accompanied by the Valli tune .
The McCain campaign did not return a call or an e-mail for an explanation .
If the video were taken down due to a copyright violation , it would n’t be the first time that the campaign has run into a wall with its online fund - raising mash - ups .
In October , Fox News went after McCain for using a clip from a debate appearance on its network in a web ad called " Tied Up . "
The ad used a clip of McCain criticizing Hillary Clinton for an earmark .
Fox ’s lawyers argued at the time that the clip ’s use did n’t constitute fair - use because the campaign was using it to raise money — therefore it was a commercial use of the footage .
Update : The Warner Music Group asserted its copyright claim against YouTube , which is the reason for the take - down .
McCain ’s campaign has re-posted the video , sans Warner ’s intellectual property .
It ’s ironic that a United States senator , who has been part of a body that has so repudiated the idea of fair - use , is feeling the repeated stings resulting from its own legislative history .
( To be fair though , McCain ’s been on the side of individuals in many a legislative fight . )
Here ’s the original ( 1 :)
Here ’s the new version ( 2 :)

Firefox Add-ons Manager has finally got extended to feature complete integration with Mozilla Add-ons ( AMO ) site through a new page added to the Add- ons Manager .
The Get Add - ons page features a search box , a browse all add - ons link that takes you to Mozilla Add-ons , and a list of recommended extensions and themes by default .
Enter a search term , press the search button and a list of matching themes and extensions compatible with your Firefox version is returned with the add - on name , its icon , a brief description and current rating .
Click on an add - on for a more detailed description , a thumbnail , and a button to install the add - on without leaving Firefox .
My only suggestion would be to add some visual cue that the add - on is either an extension or a theme before having to select it .
The theme installation processed has also been simplified .
In the past , when you installed a new theme , you were prompted to restart only to find that the new theme was not displayed .
You had to activate it from the Themes page and restart Firefox yet again .
Now , installed themes are automatically activated !
Also , the restart button has been moved to the information bar to drive more attention .
And do n’t forget a couple of features introduced in the past .
First , a new Plugins page was added to make plugins enabling and disabling a dead simple task .
Second , add - ons updates are much more secure since they require either to happen over an encrypted connection ( to block malicious sites purporting the update site ) or the add - on developer to sign it with a digital signature so updates can be verified to be from the same source .
There ’s also good news in the add - ons compatibility front as Blog of Metrics reported last week that 40 % of the add-ons that represent 95 % of Mozilla Add - ons usage are already compatible with Firefox 3 Beta 2 , the latest development release .
And the picture should get even better as developer documentation gets updated and events like today ’s Add- ons Hygiene and the announced Extend Firefox 3 contest take place .
That ’s for yet another almighty feature for Firefox 3 .
Hopefully the search plugins manager will make its way to the Add - ons Manager on time for the final release .
PITTSFIELD - A man who gave a loaded gun to his suicidal friend to " snap her out of it " and then watched in shock as she killed herself has been sentenced to up to five years in prison for his role in her death .
Christopher Burda , 46 , was ordered Friday to serve between four and five years in prison after being convicted Tuesday of involuntary manslaughter for the November 2005 suicide of Nancy Choquette of Stamford , Vt .
Burda , a lighting company owner with no previous criminal record , wiped away tears throughout his sentencing , then apologized to Choquette 's family and his own .
" My deepest condolences and most heartfelt apologies , " he said haltingly , often trailing off to regain his composure .
" I had a much better speech , apology , if you want , but that 's really all I can get through at this point . "
Burda told police that Choquette , his former employee , was visiting his North Adams home on the night of her 51st birthday when she became despondent over marriage problems , her father 's death , and other difficulties .
When she threatened suicide , he said he tried " calling her bluff " by retrieving and loading a 9 mm Beretta he had purchased from her late father .
Choquette lifted it to her head and killed herself just a few feet from him .
He told police her last words were , " I 'm going to do it , and you 're going to watch . "
Prosecutors said throughout the trial that Burda should have known Choquette was too distraught and intoxicated to be trusted with a loaded weapon , especially one with such emotional significance .
Berkshire Second District Attorney Joan McMenemy said Burda added to his culpability by reloading the gun with three fresh bullets when it failed to fire on Choquette 's first try .
McMenemy said that decision defied logic when he could instead have called 911 or sought other help .
" A loaded handgun in her hand at that time virtually guaranteed she would succeed , " McMenemy said Friday .
Superior Court Judge John Agostini 's sentence was lower than the 10 to 15 years sought by prosecutors .
Agostini said he weighed Burda 's lack of criminal history , the fact that alcohol and other factors were involved , and the knowledge that nothing would comfort Choquette 's and Burda 's families .

Wittgenstein's Lectures on Religious Belief ( 2001 )
In 1938 Wittgenstein gave a series of three lectures on religious belief at Cambridge .
We do not have his own lecture notes but we do have twenty pages of notes taken down by one or more of his students .
[ 1 ]
Wittgenstein did not check their accuracy and they may not in fact be accurate in every detail .
[ 2 ]
Nevertheless , they are the most complete account we have of his views on the subject .
[ 3 ]
Many of the major themes contained in these lectures that are elusive and subject to various interpretations I will avoid as much as possible here .
In this paper I will concentrate instead on three ideas in the lectures -- the nature of religious beliefs , the incommensurability of religious and nonreligious beliefs , and the unreasonableness of religious beliefs -- that seem relatively clear , [ 4 ] although even here Wittgenstein can be interpreted in different ways Wittgenstein 's views can be briefly stated as follows : religious belief is an unshakable commitment that guides one 's entire life and is not based on evidence or arguments ; it is incommensurable with atheistic thought in the sense that the assertions of believers and nonbelievers do not contradict one another ; and although religious belief is not reasonable , it is not unreasonable .
A number of important questions can be raised about these positions .
Can all religious belief be characterized in the way Wittgenstein suggests ?
What does he mean by saying that the atheist and the believer do not contradict one another ?
Whatever he means , is there any reason to suppose that what he says is true ?
What is the distinction that Wittgenstein makes between being not reasonable and being unreasonable ?
Is it really true that religious beliefs are not unreasonable ?
If they are unreasonable , what is wrong with this ?
In what follows I will consider these questions .
Wittgenstein on the Nature of a Religion Beliefs
A reader of Wittgenstein 's lectures might well be puzzled about how they should be understood .
On the one hand , they seem to present a general view of the nature of religious belief .
Wittgenstein never says or implies that he intends his comments to apply only to religious beliefs in a certain context , e.g. Protestant Christianity .
On the other hand , he does not say explicitly that he intends them to apply to religions generally .
If one does interpret him to be putting forth a general view of the nature of religious belief then , as I will show , his thesis can be easily refuted .
Should it be so interpreted ?
One reason for rejecting his thesis as a general view is provided by the principle of tolerance in textual interpretation which dictates that one avoid interpretations that can be easily refuted .
This principle is especially applicable to Wittgenstein who one assumes had a subtle understanding of religious belief .
Others reasons might also be offered for supposing that Wittgenstein would not attempt to provide a general account of religious belief .
First , such an attempt seems out of keeping with spirit of his later philosophy ; especially , with his comment concerning games in The Philosophical Investigations : [ 5 ]
Consider for example the proceedings that we call " games " .
I mean board - games , card - games , ball - games , Olympic games , and so on .
What is common to them all ?
Do n't say : " There must be something common , or they would not be called ' games ' - but look and see whether there is anything common to all .
-
For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all , but similarities , relationships , and a whole series of them at that .
( Sec. 66 )
Just as there is no essential property common to all games it might seem reasonable to suppose that Wittgenstein would have argued that there is no essential property common to all the religious beliefs manifested in the various religions .
In addition , it is well known that people in the same religion can hold beliefs in different ways .
Consider Catholicism .
Some Catholics are marginally members of the Church , going to services only on Christmas and Easter , believing only some of the Church 's doctrines and these with a low degree of intensity and conviction ; others are devout followers of all the dictates of the Church , believing them with great intensity and without question .
Further , it takes only an elementary understanding of comparative religions to know that there is a great variety of religions in the world .
Given this variety - from Catholicism to Calvinism , Humanism to Hinduism , Buddhism to Bahaism - why should we expect to be able to talk about religious belief in general terms ?
On the other hand , there are some considerations that suggest that Wittgenstein , despite the reasons given above , might have supposed he was specifying the general characteristics of religious beliefs .
First , since he gave his lectures the transition period between the Tractatus and The Philosophical Investigations , it is conceivable that he was to some extent still under the influence of the Tractatus even though his lectures are closer in spirit to the The Philosophical Investigations .
Second , even if he had broken away from its influence to a large extent , it is possible that he had not yet developed the notion of language games or , at the very least , that he had not applied it to religion .
Granted , it might be considered surprising that Wittgenstein overlooked this application since , as George Pitchard has brought to our attention , William James in The Varieties of Religious Experience had made the very point about " religion " that Wittgenstein later made about " game " and Wittgenstein had read James ' work . [ 6 ]
However , it is not clear when Wittgenstein read James .
Third , despite Wittgenstein 's brilliance , he may not have been well widely read in certain crucial areas .
For example , it is possible that he was simply ignorant of certain basic facts of comparative religion that would cast doubts on his general claims .
Is an interpretation available that does not assume that Wittgenstein is making general claims about the nature of religion ?
There are a number but the more obvious ones are either dubious or not very interesting .
For example , it might be suggested that some religious beliefs have the properties that he specifies .
But few people would deny this .
One might also suggest that all Protestant religious beliefs have the characteristics that he identifies .
But it is doubtful that this is true .
Liberal Protestant thought , for example , does not seem to have all the characteristics that he sets forth .
In particular , liberal theologians have attempted to make Christianity compatible with the findings of science .
One might suggest that some Protestant religious beliefs have the properties that he characterizes .
But who would deny that this is true given the wide variety of different approaches that can be incorporated under the rubric of Protestantism ?
Is there any interpretation that makes Wittgenstein 's view neither noncontroversial nor clearly wrong ?
Let us consider the problem in more detail .
Wittgenstein begins the first lecture by saying :
An Austrian general said to someone : ' I shall think of you after my death , if that should be possible ' .
We can imagine one group who would find this ludicrous , another who would n't ....
Suppose that someone believed in the Last Judgement , and I do n't , does this mean that I believe the opposite of him , just that there wo n't be such a thing ?
I would say : " not at all , or not always " .
Suppose I say that the body will rot , and another says " No . Particles will rejoin in a thousand years , and there will be a Resurrection of you " .
If someone said : " Wittgenstein , do you believe in this ? "
I 'd say : " No . " " Do you contradict the man ? " I 'd say : " No " ....
Suppose someone were a believer and said : " I believe in a Last Judgement , " and I said ; " Well , I 'm not so sure .
Possibly " .
You would say that there is an enormous gulf between us .
If he said " There is a German aeroplane overhead " , and I said " Possibly I 'm not so sure " you 'd say we were fairly near .
It is n't a question of my being near him , but on an entirely different plane , which you can express by saying : " You mean something altogether different , Wittgenstein " .
The difference might not show up at all in any explanation of meaning . [ 7 ]
Since nearly all the examples of religious belief Wittgenstein gives involve life after death and the Last Judgement , the problem posed above immediately comes to the fore .
Are we to suppose that he thinks that belief in life after death and in the last Judgement are typical of religious belief ?
If so , in what way ?
Not all religious people believe in life after death in the sense assumed in Wittgenstein 's lectures ; that is , in terms of personal survival .
And not even all forms of Protestantism believe in the Last Judgement .
One would certainly suppose that Wittgenstein knew this .
Is another interpretation possible ?
Perhaps the point that Wittgenstein was trying to make is that belief in the Last Judgement and life after death are typical of religious belief in the sense that people who hold such beliefs characteristically talk past nonreligious people .
What is typical , then , is not the content of the beliefs in his examples but their incommensurability with nonreligious belief .
Is this interpretation plausible ?
Although it might be true that some theists and atheists talk past one another , is it really true that all or even most of them do ?
Perhaps only rather sophisticated theists and unsophisticated atheists talk past one another .
When an ordinary unsophisticated Christian says that Jesus rose from the dead and an atheist denies this , why should we doubt that they are contradicting each other ?
Of course , if a sophisticated Christian who has been schooled in the teaching of Rudolf Bultman [ 8 ] says that Jesus arose from the dead and Madelyn Murray O'Hair denies this , one might begin to doubt that they are talking about the same thing .
But this situation is not as common as Wittgenstein seems to suppose .
Who would want to deny the thesis that some religious believers and nonbelievers talk past one another ?
In addition to the incommensurability of religious belief Wittgenstein seems to suppose that it is unshakable and that it regulates one 's entire life .
Speaking again of the Last Judgement he says :
Whenever he does anything , this is before his mind .
In a way , how are we to know whether to say he believes this will happen or not ?
Asking him is not enough .
He will probably say he has proof .
But he has what you might call an unshakeable belief .
It will show , not by reasoning or by appeal to ordinary grounds for belief , but rather by regulating for in all his life . [ 9 ]
He also holds religious beliefs are not based on evidence .
He maintains , " we do n't talk about hypothesis , or about high probability .
Nor about knowing " with respect to religious belief .
Christianity " does n't rest on an historical basis " and beliefs concerning it " are not treated as historical , empirical propositions " .
[ 10 ]
Wittgenstein wants true religious belief to be distinguished from superstition .
Commenting on Father O'Hara 's attempt to offer scientific arguments he remarks , " if this is religious belief , then it is superstition " , and he then says of O'Hara , " here is a man who is cheating himself " . [ 11 ]
How are these last passages to be understood ?
Is Wittgenstein suggesting that if religious belief is based on evidence it is an inferior type ; perhaps not really religious belief at all but superstition ?
We are not told how many religious people have superstitious belief in this sense but my guess is that the number would be very large .
Many Christian fundamentalists both past and present rely on what they take to be evidence for their beliefs -- for example , Biblical miracles -- and many sophisticated believers from 17th and 18th Century Deists to the contemporary philosopher of religion Richard Swinburne , [ 12 ] have based or do base their religious views on evidential considerations .
To dismiss all of these views as superstition is surely not to be very sensitive to the varieties of religious belief .
One can , of course , stipulate that religious belief based on evidence is superstition , but I would not think that this is how " superstition " is normally used nor that it is terribly helpful in understanding religious belief .
Moreover , since the third Session of the First Vatican Council of 1870 , it has been one dogma of the Catholic Church that God 's existence can be proven by the natural light of reason and another that the Christian religion can be proven by the evidence of miracles . [ 13 ]
Would this view also be characterized by Wittgenstein as superstition ?
If so , then , according to him , the religion of approximately 950 million people is based on superstition .
Perhaps it is .
However , one would suppose that in order to show this one would need to examine the arguments given for the existence of God and the alleged miracles that are used by the Church to support its claims .
It is surely not enough simply to point out that the Church appeals to evidence and arguments to show that Catholicism is based on superstition .
On the other hand , if Wittgenstein 's point is simply that some religious belief based on evidence is inferior and amounts to superstition , then who would deny it ?
Problems arise also with Wittgenstein 's claim that religious belief is unshakable and regulates all of one 's life .
If it is a general claim , it is false for although this may be true of some religious belief , it does not characterize all or even most of it .
Sociologists of religion have pointed out that many modern religious believers compartmentalize their religious beliefs in such a way that they have little effect on the rest of their lives .
Further , it is unclear just how unshakable many people 's religious beliefs are .
Studies show that to a certain extent religious conviction is a function of education .
The more education people have , the less they tend to have strong religious convictions . [ 14 ]
This suggests that the religious beliefs of a person can often be shaken simply by education .
In my own experience as a teacher , I have seen rather sophisticated people give up their belief in Christianity when exposed to evidence of which they were not previously aware .
On the other hand , who would deny that for some people religious belief regulates their life , and is unshakable .
Wittgenstein 's characterization of religious belief is certainly an adequate description of a relatively small subclass of religious beliefs , one that can be roughly characterized as fideism . [ 15 ]
In modern times this view has been associated with the kind of sophisticated Protestant thought that has been influenced by existentialism .
Indeed , commentators have noted Wittgenstein 's debt to Kierkegaard . [ 16 ]
But this subclass is hardly representative of religious believers in general .
If Wittgenstein's is merely talking about this kind of religious belief , then what he says is true but not very interesting .
Now it may be suggested in defense of Wittgenstein that he was not approaching religious belief as a sociologist but rather was providing a normative account of religious belief .
Perhaps .
But he does not say that he is prescribing rather than describing .
Furthermore , if he is giving a normative account , he gives no arguments in his lectures why one should accept his norms .
Moreover , a normative interpretation of what he is doing conflicts with the whole spirit of his later philosophy which involved describing how language operates , not prescribing its use .
Although it is true that these 1938 lectures occur in a period when Wittgenstein 's later philosophy was still developing , in general they are closer in spirit to The Philosophical Investigations where the object of philosophy was to describe common usage and not to construct an ideal language than to the Tractatus .
Religious Belief and Incommensurability
Wittgenstein maintains in several places in his lectures that the religious and the nonreligious person do not contradict one another , appearances notwithstanding .
As we saw in the passage quoted above , he says that the person who believes in the Last Judgement and the person who does not do not believe the opposite of one another ; and that the person who believes that the body will rot after death and the person who believes in a resurrection of the body do not contradict one another .
Rather , the religious and the nonreligious person are said to be on " entirely different planes " .
In other places in his lectures he says something similar :
If you ask me whether or not I believe in a Judgement Day , in the sense in which religious people have belief in it , I would n't say : " No .
I do n't believe there will be such a thing . "
It would seem to me utterly crazy to say this .
And then I give an explanation : " I do n't believe in .... " , but then the religious person never believes what I describe .
I can't say .
I can't contradict that person .
In one sense , I understand all he says - the English words " God " , " separate " , etc . I understand .
I could say : " I do n't believe in this " and this would be true , meaning I have n't got these thoughts or anything that hangs together with them .
But not that I could contradict the thing . [ 17 ]
It is not clear exactly clear what Wittgenstein is getting at here .
On one possible interpretation he can be understood to be suggesting that religious and nonreligious language is incommensurable in the sense that the same terms have different meaning in religious and nonreligious discourse .
Consequently , when the religious person says that X is P and the nonreligious person says that X is not P , they are not contradicting each other since " is P " is used in different senses .
On this view his thesis is similar to Thomas Kuhn 's thesis about the incommensurability of scientific theories . [ 18 ]
Unfortunately , it is far from certain that this is what Wittgenstein means .
Although he says that you might express the fact that the religious believer and the nonbeliever are on different planes by saying that they mean something altogether different , he also says " The difference might not show up at all in any explanation of meaning " .
Some commentators use this statement to argue that Wittgenstein does not completely accept in this lecture the meaning - as - use theme of his later philosophy . [ 19 ]
But the passage can instead be read as support for the meaning - as - use idea .
He can be taken as saying here that the difference of meaning would show up in how two people use the language but not in any verbal explanation of meaning .
In other places in his lectures Wittgenstein can be interpreted as being skeptical of appealing to meaning to explain why the believer and the nonbeliever do not completely understand one .
Consider :
If Mr. Lewy [ 20 ] is religious and says he believes in a Judgement day , I wo n't even know whether to say I understand him or not .
I read the same things as he 's read .
In a most important sense , I know what he means .
If an atheist says : " There wo n't be a Judgement Day , and another person says there will be " , do they mean the same ? -
Not clear what criterion of meaning the same is .
They might describe the same things .
You might say , this already shows that they mean the the same thing . [ 21 ]
He seems to be saying here that it is not clear what criterion one can use to judge whether the meaning is the same or different . [ 22 ]
However , this passage can be understood in another way as well .
Perhaps Wittgenstein is groping here for the meaning - as - use theme .
Perhaps he should be interpreted as saying that it is not clear what criterion of meaning the same thing is if one thinks of meaning in the traditional way .
But if one thinks of it as meaning - as - use , then the believer and nonbeliever do mean the same thing , at least they do in part since they use the Last Judgement language in the same way : that is , to describe the same thing .
However , they might also in part use it in different ways .
The religious believer might use it to convert people while the nonbeliever would not .
But even if one interprets Wittgenstein as not being skeptical of an appeal to meaning as a way of explicating incommensurability , this would not end the matter .
Just as two scientific theories can contradict each other even if they share no predicates with the same sense or reference , [ 23 ] there is no a priori reason why the religious expressions of the believer and the nonbeliever could not contradict one another even if they mean something different .
Meaning variance does not entail incommensurability .
Another possible interpretation of what Wittgenstein means by saying that the believer and nonbeliever do not contradict one another is that religious language is noncognitive in that it expresses an attitude but does not state anything true or false . [ 24 ]
Consequently , if the religious person says that X is P and the nonbeliever says that X is not P , there is no contradiction : since neither one has asserted anything , the religious believer and the nonbeliever have express different attitudes .
But some Wittgenstein 's remarks in his lectures might be interpreted as blocking this interpretation : [ 25 ]
Suppose someone , before going to China , when he might never see me again , said to me , " We might see another after death " -- Would I necessarily say that I do n't understand him ?
I might say [ want to say ] simply , " Yes , I understand him entirely " .
Lewy " In this case , you might only mean that he expressed a certain attitude " I would say " No , it is n't like the same thing as saying ' I 'm very fond of you ' " -- and it may not be the same as saying anything else .
It says what it says .
Why should you be able to substitute anything else ? [ 26 ]
Now it seems evident that in this passage Wittgenstein is rejecting the suggestion that the sentence " We might see another after death " can be replaced by a sentence that explicitly states an attitude such as " I 'm very fond of you " .
But it does not follow from this that he would reject all noncognitive interpretations of religious language .
After all , one might argue that religious language expresses an attitude but this expressive function cannot be replaced by substituting another expression that explicitly states this same attitude .
Does the sentence " I am happy " have the same expressive function as the sentence " Hurray ! " ?
It is conceivable that in many cases there is no substitute sentence that expresses exactly the same thing as the original sentence by stating what the original expresses .
Indeed , it is doubtful that some of the most sophisticated noncognitive accounts of religious language would maintain that any such substitution was possible . [ 27 ]
Wittgenstein might be saying , however , that religious language is noncognitive in the sense that it does not refer , and that it does not refer since there are no empirical entities for religious terms to refer to .
Of course , this interpretation might be rejected on the grounds that Wittgenstein would be skeptical of any general account of reference that such an interpretation might presuppose , e.g. , the causal theory .
He would remind us that we use number words to refer to numbers despite the fact that there can be no causal relation between numbers considered as abstract entities and our practice of referring .
Just as he would maintain that there is no property common to all games , he might argue that there is no property common to all the techniques of referring .
It makes no sense to ask whether religious language really refers , Wittgenstein would say .
The use of referring expressions in religion is similar in some respects but different in others from other uses of such expressions in other language games .
Thus , religious language can still refer despite the fact that the technique of referring that belong to this language game is different from that of others games . [ 28 ]
Although this interpretation of Wittgenstein is interesting , it is not clear how it helps us to understand why the religious believer and nonbeliever do not contradict one another but nevertheless end up talking past one another .
If religious language refers , then presumably religious statements are either true or false .
Why then does not the nonbeliever who says that there will not be life after death contradict the believer who says that there will be life ?
The only reason I can think of is that it is assumed that the nonbeliever and believer are referring to different things .
However , Wittgenstein provides no evidence for this assumption and , in any case , as I have already noted , in scientific contexts two people can still contradict each other by the sentences they use even if they refer to different things . [ 29 ]
I see no reason why the same thing could not be true in religious ones .
If we reject the above interpretations of what Wittgenstein might mean by saying that the religious believer and nonbeliever do not contradict one another , we seem to be left with the thesis that religious belief and nonbelief are incommensurable in some unspecified sense .
I have already expressed my reservations about the truth of incommensurability in the sweeping way that Wittgenstein might intend it .
But the thesis might be true in some more limited sense ; that is , for a certain subclass of religious beliefs .
Before we accept even this limited thesis , however , let us note that Wittgenstein cites no evidence for this limited claim in his lectures .
He just asserts that the believer and the skeptic do not contradict each other in certain hypothetical cases , that they are talking past one another and are on different planes .
Furthermore , he says that this difference would not show up at all in any explanation of meaning .
One wonders , then , how the incommensurability would show up and how anyone can know that there is no contradiction between the believer and nonbeliever even in the cases considered by Wittgenstein .
Perhaps it could be argued that one good reason for supposing that the religious person and the atheist are talking past one another is that the religious person is not willing to accept any evidence as counting against a belief while the atheist is .
However , whether a religious person would or would not allow any evidence to count against his or her views is hard to determine .
Supposing we could determine that the religious person would not , why would this show that the two are on " a different plane " or mean something different by their words ?
Why would it not simply show that the religious person is being irrational or is talking nonsense ?
Putting it in the way Wittgenstein puts it seems implicitly to legitimate this practice but it is not at all clear that it should be legitimated .
So it seems to me that without further explication and argument the incommensurability thesis is unproven even for a limited class of cases .
Furthermore , the incommensurability thesis has unfortunate implications .
If the atheist and the religious believer talk past one another concerning the Last Judgement and other religious matters , could it not be argued that different religious believers do so too ?
Surely , there are as great differences between some religious believers as between some religious believers and nonbelievers .
Thus , it is difficult to see why incommensurability can be argued in the one case only .
Consider a Christian who says that Jesus is the Son of God and a Moslem who denies it .
On Wittgenstein 's view one could be led to say that they do not contradict one another .
But if we go this far , why not go farther ?
Perhaps people in different denominations and sects do not contradict each other when they assert their denominational and sectarian differences .
Consider a Catholic who says that the Pope is infallible and a Baptists who says that he is not .
Or consider the 17th Century controversy between sects of Baptist .
General Baptists maintained that Christ died for all men and Particular Baptists said that Christ died for the elect . [ 30 ]
Why not say that they were not contradicting each other ?
It is difficult to see where to stop if we start on the incommensurability road .
This is especially true when we have no idea what the claim amounts to and what evidence would be relevant to its evaluation .
I conclude that Wittgenstein does not show in what sense religious beliefs are incommensurable and what evidence would be relevant to evaluating the claim that they are .
Indeed , he provides no reason for supposing that the claim is true in some nontrivial way for even some limited class of religious beliefs .
Furthermore , he provides no reason why the thesis of incommensurability cannot be pushed to its logical limits by maintaining , for example , that one sect of Baptists is talking past a rival sect .
Yet this seems to me a very implausible view and in fact verges on a reductio ad absurdum of the position .
Not Being Reasonable and Being Unreasonable
One of the interesting and puzzling themes in Wittgenstein 's lectures is the question of whether religious belief is unreasonable .
Wittgenstein maintains that although religious believers are not reasonable they are not unreasonable .
He says :
They base things on evidence which taken in one way would be exceedingly flimsy .
They base enormous things on this evidence .
Am I to say they are unreasonable ?
I would n't call them unreasonable .
I would say , they are certainly not reasonable , that 's obvious .
' Unreasonable ' implies , with everyone , rebuke .
I want to say : they do n't treat this as a matter of reasonability .
Anyone who reads the Epistles will find it said : not only that it is not reasonable , but that it is folly .
Not only is it not reasonable , but it does n't pretend to be . [ 31 ]
It is not clear from these brief remarks what exactly Wittgenstein understands the difference to be between not being reasonable and being unreasonable except that being " unreasonable " is a term of rebuke and being " not reasonable " is not .
One might suppose that he is drawing the kind of distinction that is sometimes made by the terms " not rational " and " irrational " ; that is , between believing something that the evidence does not support and believing something that the evidence tells against .
But this interpretation becomes less plausible given his remarks on the Epistles .
Although this passage is capable of being interpreted in several ways , it is plausible to suppose that Wittgenstein is ( rather carelessly ) referring not to ' the Epistles ' in general but to 1 Corinthians Ch. 1 where Paul says that " the word of the cross is folly " to some people .
This indicates that Wittgenstein thinks the Christian message is foolish or absurd to some people .
But this suggests that to some people the evidence is not just flimsy but weighs against it truth .
However , he does not seem to suppose that believing the word of the cross is unreasonable .
So perhaps by " unreasonable " Wittgenstein does not mean " irrational " .
In any case , it is not clear why believing religious claims which by Wittgenstein 's own admission are supported only by flimsy evidence is something that should not call for rebuke .
There is surely a prima facie case to made for the epistemological principle that we should believe only what we have good evidence to believe and that we are being epistemologically irresponsible if we do otherwise . [ 32 ]
But let us waive this point and concentrate on something far less controversial .
Some religious beliefs are not just not well supported by the evidence .
They are improbable in the light of the evidence .
Thus , belief in them is irrational in the sense just introduced .
Wittgenstein does not explicitly consider these sorts of beliefs except by implication in his reference to the folly of the Epistles , that is , the folly of the word of the cross to some people .
But consider the thesis that the earth is only several thousand years old which is believed by millions of fundamentalist Christians .
Would Wittgenstein say that this belief is not unreasonable and should not call for rebuke since it does not pretend to be reasonable ?
Or consider the belief that Jesus was a real human being who lived in the First Century , A.D. Obviously , this belief is held not only by fundamentalists but by almost all Christians .
Let us suppose that an examination of the historical evidence indicates that not only is the evidence for the historicity of Jesus flimsy but that his existence is improbable in the light of this evidence .
Would Wittgenstein say that belief in the historicity of Jesus was not unreasonable for Christians and should not call for rebuke since it does not pretend to be reasonable ?
I do not know .
But his admiration of Kierkegaard and his reference to the folly of the Epistles , that is , to the folly of the message of the cross to some people , suggests that he might hold this view .
As I read Kierkegaard , he maintains that one should believe in Christianity despite the absurdity of its doctrines . [ 33 ]
If this is an implication of Wittgenstein 's views on religious belief it is not only wrong but dangerous .
There are good historical reasons for not being irrational in this way .
Believing and acting on beliefs despite the evidence against them has been a hallmark of fanaticism , one of the great evils of history . [ 34 ]
Historically speaking , fanaticism has caused untold suffering and death when it has been associated with either political or religious belief .
If it is permissible to believe the fundamental doctrines of religion despite the evidence , why would it not be permissible to believe despite the evidence that God wants us to start a holy war or that God wants to rid the world of people who worship differently from us ?
Why would it not be permissible despite the evidence to believe in Aryan racial supremacy ?
Once we allow belief despite the evidence to gain prominence in one area there is no reason why this irrationalism would not spread to other areas .
Thus , irrationalism has potentially dangerous consequences .
In addition , I think that if one believes something despite the evidence , one is being epistemologically irresponsible . [ 35 ]
Part of what it means to say that one is epistemologically responsible is that one does not believe something that goes against the evidence .
Epistemic responsibility is an important intellectual virtue that has often been overlooked but is closely related to virtues such as honesty and impartiality .
It seems to me that the intellectual virtues are important and worthwhile for a civilized society in general and for the life of the mind in particular .
Conclusion
I have argued first that the scope of Wittgenstein 's claims concerning the nature of religious belief is unclear .
As a general claim about the nature of all religious belief it is false .
As a claim about the nature of some religious belief it is uninteresting .
Second , I have argued that he provides no clear case for the incommensurability of the language of believers and nonbelievers and that , if pressed , the thesis of incommensurability absurdly shows that religious believers of rival sects are talking past one another .
Third , I have argued that Wittgenstein gives no good reason to suppose that religious belief based on flimsy evidence should not be subject to rebuke .
In relation to this point I have contended that what he would say about belief that is opposed to the evidence is not completely clear but , insofar as his views are influenced by Kierkegaard , he would perhaps say that this kind of belief is not subject to rebuke either .
I have tried to show that in this he would be mistaken .
Notes
[ 1 ] L. Wittgenstein , " Lectures on Religious Beliefs " , in Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics , Psychology and Religious Belief as compiled from notes taken by Yorick Smythies , Rush Rhees , and James Taylor and edited by Cyril Barrett , ( Oxford : Basil Blackwell , 1966 ) , pp. 53 - 72 .
In the preface the editor , Cyril Barrett , says that " Besides the notes of the conversations on Freud , those of the fourth lecture on aesthetics are by Rush Rhees ; the rest are by Smythies " .
This has suggested to some commentators that the notes on the " Lectures on Religious Belief " were all taken by Smythies but it is not completely clear that this is correct .
In any case , Kai Nielsen in An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion , ( New York : St. Martin's Press , 1982 ) , p. 44 says that the notes were taken by Smythies whereas Putnam in his unpublished paper " Wittgenstein on Religious Belief " says that the notes were taken by Wittgenstein 's students .

Yesterday 's Independent featured a story by Harriet Walker about skyscraper heels .
Prompted , of course , by Victoria Beckham making an appearance in spindly 5 inch stilettos .
Writes Walker : " Just when you thought heels could n't get any higher , guess what : they have . "
This season , Prada , Louboutin and Dior all have towering heels .
And the Giambattista Valli shoes for fall ( pictured ) have a retro feel , but with platforms and heels so high they almost seem designed for toppling over .
The Daily Mail points out that high heels have been around since 3500BC , when Ancient Egyptian noble women picked their way through the pyramids .
Hundreds of years , billions of aching feet , twisted ankles , throbbing bunions and crusty corns .
Why do we do it ?

Are heels this season so high because the economy is so low ?
There 's power in height , in the instant and literal lift one gets from heels .
Some say they feel sexier , and there 's no doubt that wearing heels changes the posture of a woman — pushing out the chest , tensing the calf muscle , elongating ( actually hyperextending ) the leg and putting stress on the lower back , causing hips to work harder and therefore " sway . "
But where is the true power when you can't really walk ?
Where is the power when most of the popular shoes were designed by men who do n't wear them ?
Ever notice how ladies who wear sneakers all the time have smooth and un-callused feet , and women with a " sexy " heel habit have stressed out and jacked up feet ?
Why , after thousands of years and a sexual revolution , do we continue to do this to ourselves ?
Is it because there 's a thrill in being a woman , in claiming all of the chicks - only , " feminine " accoutrements that go with being decidedly female ?
While you ponder these questions , I 'm going to see if I can find a price for those black Giambattista Valli numbers on the lower left .
What ?
Just curious !

Zogby poll : Obama leads Clinton by 14 % nationally Reuters
Published : Wednesday February 20 , 2008
|
Print This Email This MILWAUKEE ( Reuters ) - Barack Obama has surged past Hillary Clinton to open a big national lead in the Democratic presidential race , according to a Reuters / Zogby poll released on Wednesday .
Obama also leads Republican front - runner John McCain in a potential November election match - up while Clinton trails McCain , enhancing Obama 's argument he is the Democrat with the best shot at capturing the White House .
Among Republicans , McCain has a substantial national lead over his last major challenger , former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee , as he takes his final steps toward clinching the nomination .
Heading into crucial March 4 nominating contests in Ohio and Texas , Obama has gained the upper hand in a close and fierce Democratic duel with Clinton .
McCain broke open the Republican race and has driven out most of his leading rivals .
The poll showed Obama with a 14 - point edge over Clinton , 52 percent to 38 percent , after being in a statistical tie with the New York senator last month .
Obama 's new lead follows a string of 10 wins in February for the Illinois senator , who has moved ahead in the battle for pledged delegates who vote on the party 's nominee at the August convention .
" Obama has the hot hand and you can clearly see his momentum in the national numbers , " pollster John Zogby said .
" This is what happens when you win a bunch of primaries in a row -- or maybe this is why you win a bunch of primaries in a row . "
The poll was taken last Wednesday through Saturday , before a weekend controversy over Obama 's uncredited recycling of speech lines from a friend , and before Obama captured two more wins in Wisconsin and Hawaii on Tuesday to extend his winning streak .
In the poll , Obama led Clinton among Democrats and independents , in all age groups except seniors and in all income groups except those making under $ 25,000 a year .
He led narrowly among whites and more widely among men .
He was tied among women with Clinton , who would be the first woman U.S. president .
Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , was the choice of 4 of 5 black voters .
Clinton attracted two - thirds of Hispanic voters , who comprise a big bloc in Texas .
" It can all turn on a dime and it already has turned on a dime .
This has been a roller coaster of a race , " Zogby said .
OBAMA BEATS MCCAIN
In a head - to - head matchup , Obama beat McCain 47 percent to 40 percent .
He led McCain among independents , in all age groups except those above 70 , and in all regions but the South .
McCain beat Clinton 50 percent to 38 percent in a head - to - head matchup .
The Arizona senator led Clinton in all regions of the country , among independents and in all age groups .
" At least for now , these numbers suggest Obama has the potential to build a stronger general election coalition than Clinton , " Zogby said .
" They also suggest Clinton has a lot of catching up to do . "
McCain picked up 18 percent of the black vote in a match - up with Clinton but only 3 percent against Obama , a possible sign at least some black voters would not put aside their allegiance to Obama if Clinton won the nomination .
" There could be potentially disaffected Obama supporters who will vote for Obama but not Clinton , " Zogby said .
In the Republican race , McCain led Huckabee by 47 percent to 32 percent , gaining 19 points in a month marked by a series of primary wins that gave him a commanding delegate lead in the race for the nomination .
Huckabee says he will stay in the Republican race until McCain wins the 1,191 delegates needed to clinch the nomination .
His presence is a reminder of McCain 's trouble with conservatives , who are unhappy with his stances on immigration and other issues .
Huckabee , an ordained Baptist minister whose rise has been fueled by support from religious conservatives , led 51 percent to 29 percent among those who described themselves as very conservative .
The other remaining Republican candidate , Texas Rep. Ron Paul , drew 7 percent , with 8 percent unsure of their support .
The poll surveyed 494 likely Democratic primary voters and 434 likely Republican primary voters , with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points for Democrats and 4.8 percentage points for Republicans .
It was a great pleasure to meet Jason Beghe and his family a couple of weeks ago at their home in Malibu .
Jason has a long list of acting credits in film and TV and has done extensive voice - over work through the years .
His talents were also used in countless Scientology PR and training videos , including a recruitment video for Scientology ’s Sea Org .
He is the first celebrity to leave Scientology and publicly discuss his involvement and then disillusionment with the group .
He made it to OT V on Scientology ’s “ Bridge to Total Freedom ” and discovered the best way to get free was to get up and walk out the door .
I think you ’ll greatly enjoy this interview .

Lawrence Roberts is just another guy with the title : " Inventor of the Internet " in news articles .
According to Wikipedia , he 's the father of networking through data packets .
And he 's turned his attention to everyone 's favorite data packet topic : Peer - to - Peer filesharing .
He 's established a company called Anagran , and says their devices can sort out which file transfers on the tubes are P2P , and -- you guessed it -- can throttle them in favor of other , more " high - priority " traffic .
At Structure 08 , he laid out the problem : 5 percent of the Net 's users are running P2P transfers taking up 80 percent of its capacity , which is dramatically limiting the available bandwidth available to everyone else .
Roberts ' company , Anagran , is able to detect which " flows " are P2P traffic , and reduce the bandwidth available to these communications when other users ' systems want it .
Roberts says that Anagran 's technology even functions when P2P transfers are encrypted .
ANAGRAN's FR - 1000
One of the products currently offered by ANAGRAN , the FR - 1000 Intelligent Flow Manager has a feature set geared specifically toward shaping network traffic .

According to Roberts , 80 percent of Internet traffic is generated by 5 percent of users , and that 80 percent is used for P2P filesharing .
I have a feeling Mr. Roberts will finally make some money off that Internet he invented if the device works , as ISPs would love to have a way to shuffle Bittorrents of Deuce Bigalow : Male Gigolo to the back of the queue .
I also predict he will become an object of more intense detestation than anyone outside an RIAA office on the Internet he invented , if his device works and is put into general use .
There sure are a lot of people who are referred to as " Inventor of the Internet . "
Of course we could tell the old joke about Al Gore inventing the Internet , but of course we know he invented weather , not the Internet .
Barack Obama is really good at fundraising .
His monthly kitty is usually in the 40 - plus millions .
Unfortunately he 's burning through the cash just as quickly .
What you think the 200,000 Berliners just stood there for free ?
Since the normal campaign appeals are only raising him a few dozen million , this week the campaign has upped the ante .
" How can we add to Barack 's rockstar , Bono - like image while maintaining the idea that he's the 2nd coming of Kennedy , Clinton and Reagan , " they wondered .
The answer : Back stage passes .
( Take that Billy Joel ! )
Give to the Obama camp before July 31st and you are entered to win a chance to chill with The Obama 's backstage before the big acceptance speech .
Ten supporters who make a donation in any amount by midnight this Thursday , July 31st , will be selected to fly to Denver , spend a couple of nights in a hotel , participate in the convention , and go Backstage with Barack .
Each supporter who is selected will also get to bring a guest along to share the experience .

I fell in love with the grid ( gs ) back when I signed up and up to the last minute .
It was easy for me to ignore the issues with loading times , downtime and other problems as I was one happy customer .
Mediatemple is family , but you just ca n’t stay at home for the rest of your life .
Before this article was written , Archon Digital took eons to fully load which I find to be really frustrating a lot of times .
It has been on a Mediatemple Grid Server ever since the domain was bought in January 2007 and moving away from their lovely control panel was like moving away from home for the first time .
Evolution by Choice
As far as I can tell , I ’ve already outgrown the Grid .
I ’ve outgrown not the capability and limitations of the system , but more on what else I can do and learn from it .
I craved for root access and the freedom of being able to fully configure my own server .
The next step was definitely going to be a VPS for me and back then I was choosing between Mediatemple ‘s DV hosting and Slicehost VPS .
The decision was made early last week , where I concluded that learning how to setup my own box from scratchwould be more beneficial to me in the long run .
I enjoyed using Mediatemple ’s Grid Server ( gs ) hosting and have had good experience with their tech support and all their friendly staff as well .
While there were indeed numerous outages , I still consider Mediatemple a great hosting company and their upcoming Cluster Server ( cs ) will most probably a better successor to the Grid .
Other problems I encountered with the Grid were related to certain TXT DNS entries which I badly need for domainkeys and others to work .
Those who regularly visit my site can probably tell the difference on how much the loading time has improved .
From a previous 1.0 to 8.0 seconds to a speedy 0.56 seconds
Why Not Shared ?
You really ca n’t make me go back to shared hosting .
I have nothing against it as it works real well for a lot of people , but I really feel more like I ’ve outgrown it long ago .
Even tried reseller hosting for a few sites last year but to me it ’s still just shared hosting with a few added perks .
I also run a few other sites that require more resources and you would probably hate to be my neighbor in a shared hosting box .
What Next ?
So that ’s about it .
I just need to transfer a few sites off to another hosting account and will then officially close my grid server account .
I have documented how I set up my NGINX setup and compiled most of the information on a new article which will be posted here soon .
I got the following unexpected response when trying to retrieve < http://www.spacedin.co.uk/radiator%20cabinets%20v1_6.htm>:

Once you ’ve seen the progression that software goes through from birth as a hacker ’s one - night - stand , to 3 - man garage - startup ’s baby , to Small Corp ’s stubborn adolescent , to The - Next - Microsoft ’s bloated 1000 - developer software - engineering nightmare … you simply can’t ignore it and the programming language feature it seems to demand .
Hardening
In the beginning when you have an idea , you want a flexible medium for experimenting with .
You really do n’t know where you ’re going to end up , so you want your medium to just get out of the way and let your creative juices flow .
It ’s the same in every industry really , whether it be software engineering , architecture , painting , or writing .
But once you have a product , and hundreds of other people besides you care about the outcome of every little detail , everything from which shade of gray its background is to what happens when you press the Tab key when the last textbox of the final dialog of your Import Wizard has the focus , you have to worry about things like quality assurance .
Software , like concrete , hardens over time becoming a rigid unmovable mass .
This happens as the original developers move on or simply forget about code they wrote and have n’t touched for a while .
Code gets pushed down into layers of abstraction , becoming black boxes that no one ever looks into unless something goes wrong .
This is the natural progression as new building blocks get created by combining the functionality of older building blocks .
The fringes of development churn like mad , but over time , newer modules start depending on them , weighing them down by discouraging change .
On top of that , shear code size prevents change .
Once you have a massive software system built from thousands upon thousands of man-hours , you simply can’t throw it away and start from scratch .
Maybe in an ideal world where you did n’t have to worry about paying rent … but if you intend to make a living off of software , it simply is n’t an option .
Once a software system has been grown so large , you ’re stuck with it .
Steve Yegge talked about this in a blog post , but I think most people who read skimmed it just voted it up on their favorite news site and moved on to the next article .
This is so fundamental — size !
Not some theoretical cyclomatic metric .
Size !
And part of the reason size is so important is because once you have a sufficiently large code - base , re-writing it is no longer an option .
Which means , changing it is no longer an option .
The code literally solidifies !
The Knob
Concrete naturally hardens over time .
But what if your concrete were rigid even when you wanted to constantly mold it .
Or what if it never completely hardened , even after you found the perfect form .
That is what programming languages are like today .
You have to choose the static language that ’s too rigid to prototype with or the dynamic language that never completely hardens even in production .
HTML and PHP are good examples of languages that never completely harden .
They were great at first ; it was so easy to dive right in , and they blew up in popularity as a result .
But years later we are stuck with large websites and code - bases which are living nightmares to maintain .
Although this is partially the responsibility of the developers , as good developers can write good code in any language , the language itself should support this transition , not hinder it .
On the opposite side , we have languages like ML and Haskell whose type - systems are so strict that most people give up on them before writing a single useful program .
They are not flexible enough for constant molding .
I , of all people , understand the benefits of static type - systems .
But I ’m beginning to realize that when you ’re prototyping , it ’s okay to have some runtime errors .
In fact , it ’s desirable , because prototypes are by - nature underspecified .
Any error that is caught statically must necessarily be determined by analyzing the source code alone , not its execution , which means that I must write more code to single - out those error cases .
Like the None branch in a case expression that “ should n’t happen ” , it is literally error - handling code that is required by the compiler .
Writing error - handling code is — by definition — code that deals with uncommon special - cases .
It ’s common knowledge that most code paths do n’t get exercised until perhaps years after being out in the wild .
Why then should I care about catching them all statically in my prototype ?
Even in the first released version .
It ’s naive to think I even can catch them all .
And the problem with writing all this extra code is not that it takes longer to write the first time , but that it takes longer to change each time that you do , which is many many times when you are still in the prototyping phase and the code is constantly churning .
So the code - base starts out rigid and gets even more rigid faster .
What we need is a dial — a knob — that can be tuned in the direction we are in : either flexibility for a prototype or rigidity for a production app .
Breaking Things
The problem stems from the fact that when you modify code you did n’t write , you ca n’t see the big picture .
You only have a local view of the code you ’re modifying , so you do n’t completely understand the ramifications of your changes .
People fail to respect the great differences between writing new code and {modifying or maintaining} code they did n’t write .
Sure , both require knowledge of programming , but they ’re completely different activities .
In the film industry , the corresponding activities are called completely different things : directing and editing .
Both require knowledge of film making , and experience doing one can help improve skills in the other , but they are fundamentally different tasks .
When I am writing code from scratch , I start with a blank editor and combine language constructs that I am already intimately familiar with .
When I am modifying code that I am not familiar with , my biggest concern is will this change break anything ?
And most of the time , that ’s a difficult question to answer because I only have a local view of the code .
I do n’t completely understand the entire system and ca n’t see the big picture of what the change will affect .
So I usually end up being extremely conservative , inevitably creating cruft that is otherwise unnesessary .
Done over and over again , this can be extremely harmful to a code - base .
Basically , if you ’re modifying someone else ’s code , it ’s because that code can not , for one reason or another , be re-written .
That code is more rigid , closer to the production end of the spectrum .
Now … a lot of effort ( and resources ) goes into making sure that production code works .
So when you ’re adding to or modifying code written by someone else , you do n’t want to change anything that already works and undo all that effort , nullifying the resources already spent on it .
Today ’s PLs
It would be nice if our language allowed us to keep our code nimble as long as possible , and then , when we were ready to push code into an abstraction or let someone else maintain it , solidify the code on cue .
Perl ’s use strict allows you to adjust the amount of static checking done on a program .
However , no sane programmer that I know of ever turns this switch off for a program more than a few lines long .
This seems to say that without the strict option enabled , the language is too flexible even for prototyping .
Paul Graham even experimented with implicit variable declarations in Arc , a language designed specifically for prototyping , but decided against it .
The closest feature I know of that resembles what I ’m thinking of is optional type declarations .
Languages which allow programmers to omit types and optionally insert type - constraints when and where they please are a step in this direction .
It allows for flexibility during the prototyping phase and a little more compiler - checked guarantees when inserted .
Additionally , it documents the code and allows the compiler to take advantage of type - directed performance optimizations , two things more valuable towards the production side of the spectrum .
When an app is a prototype , performance usually is n’t as important as getting feedback on working features , and documentation is a waste because the code is more likely than not to change , rendering any documentation obsolete ( and even misleading ) .
Besides , you can always ask the developer who owns the code , as he ’s still working on it and it ’s fresh in his mind .
Lispers , I ’m waiting for you to chime in right about now stating how Lisp has had this feature all along .
And that ’s great .
But if people do n’t understand why it ’s so great , they wo n’t use or support it .
So how else can we tune a programming language from flexible to rigid ?
From dynamic to static ?
Feature Flip - Flopping
I suppose that any feature that separates flexible languages from rigid ones is a candidate for being a knob in this regard .
But I ’m pretty sure this is fallow territory with lots of room for improvement .
For one thing , I think it would be useful to restrict which kinds of decisions are delayed until runtime .
The more that is delayed until runtime , the more possibilities there are for errors that are uncatchable until the last moment , driving the cost of the errors up .
If you can catch an error as early as compile - time , or even at edit - time with a little red squiggly underline directly in the editor , the cost is only a few moments of a developer ’s time to fix it .
But if that error is not caught until it ’s being run by a client — heaven forbid , on a client ’s 7 - year - old desktop 273.1 miles away running Windows ME — not only is it extraordinarily difficult to reproduce and track down the error , but one of your paying customers is unhappy , and just might blog about how terrible your software is for all his friends to hear about it .
What kinds of decisions am I talking about ?
Ones that prevent reasoning about the code without executing it , like modifying the symbol table based on runtime values , calling eval , using reflection , or using dynamic dispatching .
These things throw most , if not all , of your reasoning out the window .
In general , it ’s not possible to determine what the effect of a call to eval will be , so any guarantees are shot .
With dynamic dispatching , it ’s never quite clear at compile - time what code will be executed as a result of a function call , so again , just about anything could happen .
All bets are off .
Again , these features are great for prototyping .
They reduce the amount of code you have to write , reducing the amount of time you have to spend changing it while the code is still churning .
Additionally , you are probably the one who wrote all the code , so there ’s no issue of not being able to see the big picture to understand it .
However , at the same time , these features are bad for the maintainability of production code .
It ’s true that less code is easier to maintain than more code , as it is simply less that maintainers have to try to understand .
But dynamic features actually make code more difficult to grok because they are more abstract .
…
Calculating offsets of fields .
Generating code .
Modifying code .
Data - flow analysis .
Code - transforming optimizations .
All of these things are normal programming concepts .
But if you add to the end of each phrase “ in bed ” …
Sorry , I mean , if you add to the end of each phrase “ at runtime ” , they suddenly become horrors !
In the same way that pointers are simply more abstract , so too is eval and dynamic features like it .
Am I suggesting that people should write code with eval and dynamic dispatching , and then when the code becomes stable , turn off those features and re-write the code without them ?
It does seem like the logical conclusion from the above observations .
This does n’t sit right with me though .
For one , it would mean re-writing code just when you wanted to solidify it , undoing all the testing effort that went into it .
The first thing that comes to my mind is : is there a way we can compile these features away when they ’re switched off ?
perhaps by collecting data about runtime values and then generating static code which is functionally equivalent for the observed scenarios , explicitly triggering a runtime error otherwise ?
I honestly do n’t know what the right thing to do should be , but I hope I ’ve raised some interesting questions for others to consider .
In this short , two - minute clip from his press conference today on the sad state of the American economy , President Bush managed to embarrass himself ( and thus the country ) on at least three occasions .
First he smirks and gives a smart ass answer when asked about $ 5 gasoline -- not very funny considering he " had n't heard " of $ 4 gas back in February .
Second , he repeats the McCain campaign talking point " gaffe " about our economic woes being merely " psychological . "
Then , finally , he tops if off with what he calls his " brilliant statement " about " magic wands . "

I think it was in the Rose Garden where I issued this brilliant statement :
If I had a magic wand -- but the President does n't have a magic wand .
You just can't say , low gas .
It took us a while to get here and we need to have a good strategy to get out of it .
Can this guy seriously be any more out of touch ?
Watching him chuckle his way through questions about how badly he has destroyed our economy as millions of Americans are losing their homes and being forced to change the way they live tells you all you need to know .
Full transcript below the fold :
Q Mr. President , in February you were asked about Americans facing the prospect of $ 4 a gallon gasoline and you said you had n't heard of that at the time .
Gas prices --
THE PRESIDENT : Aware of it now .
Q Gas prices are now approaching $ 5 a gallon in some parts of the country .
Offshore oil exploration is obviously a long - term approach .
What is the short - term advice for Americans ?
What can you do now to help them ?
THE PRESIDENT : First of all , there is a psychology in the oil market that basically says , supplies are going to stay stagnant while demand rises .
And that 's reflected somewhat in the price of crude oil .
Gasoline prices are reflected -- the amount of a gasoline price at the pump is reflected in the price of crude oil .
And therefore , it seems like it makes sense to me to say to the world that we 're going to use new technologies to explore for oil and gas in the United States -- offshore oil , ANWR , oil shale projects -- to help change the psychology , to send a clear message that the supplies of oil will increase .
Secondly , obviously good conservation measures matter .
I 've been reading a lot about how the automobile companies are beginning to adjust -- people -- consumers are beginning to say , wait a minute , I do n't want a gas guzzler anymore , I want a smaller car .
So the two need to go hand in hand .
There is no immediate fix .
This took us a while to get in this problem ; there is no short - term solution .
I think it was in the Rose Garden where I issued this brilliant statement :
If I had a magic wand -- but the President does n't have a magic wand .
You just can't say , low gas .
It took us a while to get here and we need to have a good strategy to get out of it .
Q But you do have the Strategic Oil Petroleum Reserve .
What about opening that ?
THE PRESIDENT : The Strategic Oil Petroleum Reserve is for , you know , emergencies .
But that does n't address the fundamental issue .
And we need to address the fundamental issue , which I , frankly , have been talking about since I first became President -- which is a combination of using technology to have alternative sources of energy , but at the same time finding oil and gas here at home .
And now is the time to get it done .
I heard somebody say , well , it 's going to take seven years .
Well , if we'd have done it seven years ago we'd be having a different conversation today .
I 'm not suggesting it would have completely created -- you know , changed the dynamics in the world , but it certainly would have been -- we'd have been using more of our own oil and sending less money overseas .
JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - OPEC should not consider cutting production after oil ’s steep two - week decline as markets are now balanced , OPEC President Chakib Khelil said on Tuesday , adding that prices could yet fall another $ 50 a barrel .
OPEC President Chakib Khelil ( R ) chats with Indonesia 's Energy Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro during a news conference after they held a meeting with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in Jakarta July 29 , 2008 .

Khelil , who is also Algeria ’s oil minister , said oil prices could fall to $ 70 to $ 80 in the long - term , if the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen and geopolitical anxieties eased .
“ The price today is abnormal at $ 123 a barrel , ” said Khelil , speaking to reporters on a visit to Jakarta to meet Indonesia ’s energy minister .
He did not elaborate , but OPEC ministers have said repeatedly that they believe the surge in oil prices is not being driven by a shortage of supply .
Asked if OPEC members should cut supply if oil prices continue to decline , he said : “ No , I do n’t think so , why should they cut production ?
They always want to make sure there is good supply and demand and to satisfy the demand . ”
U.S. oil prices have fallen by $ 22 from a record high above $ 147 a barrel earlier this month amid growing concerns that high prices and slowing economic growth are causing a decline in demand , but prices are still up 30 percent on the year .
“ We are not worried about any price , because we do n’t decide the price .
We just meet the demand , ” he said .

Khelil said he did not see any signs of demand destruction from high prices .
“ I think there is a good supply , there is a balance in the market . ”
Asked if there was an option to cut production at OPEC ’s September meeting , he said : “ It is up to the conference in light of the market at that time .
The market changes so much . ”
Khelil said later on Tuesday after giving a lecture to energy officials that recent price moves did not reflect supply issues .
“ And I think it is obvious to you that in the last week for example , you could not expect the price to come down by $ 25 because of a lack of supply or oversupply in one day , ” he said .
Khelil also said that biofuel mandates in Europe and the United States had aided the run-up in prices .
“ I strongly believe bioethanol , because it ’s very expensive , it had an effect on the price per barrel of products , ” he said .
Indonesia is Asia - Pacific ’s only OPEC member but it has seen oil production slump since the 1990s and said in May that it planned to quit the cartel because it was unhappy with high oil prices after becoming a net importer .
Energy Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro said that Indonesia had not yet officially submitted documents to withdraw from OPEC , but said the country ’s interests were no longer in line with the cartel .
“ President ( Yudhoyono ) has explained that we are a net oil importer .
That means there is a difference in objectives from OPEC as producer countries , ” said Yusgiantoro .
Sang Run , his hair stiff with sea salt , chugs out into the Gulf of Kompong Som in his weather - beaten turquoise boat , looking for blackling .
He scours the shallow , blue water , waiting for a shoal to appear , before skimming his net across the water .
He does the same every day , taking his catch to auction on Independence Beach in Cambodia 's southern port city of Sihanoukville .
It looks like a scene Sang Run was born into .
But 20 years ago the beach was deserted , and he was a schoolteacher in Mondulkiri , a forested province hundreds of miles away in the east of the country .
Back then , he could talk all day about palm sugar and betel nuts .
He was something of an amateur botanist , but had never seen the sea - nor had any of the group who today gather around his silvery haul flapping in the sand on Independence Beach .
Former nurse Srey Pov , who runs a Khmer restaurant along the beach , also came from a province many miles away .
She still cannot swim , she says , shrugging .
Heads nod around her .
Cambodia is a nation that would drown if their boat tipped over ; it is also a country whose citizens mostly do not belong to the places where they have ended up .
The Khmer Rouge saw to that , eviscerating the kingdom after coming to power .
It was a movement that drew inspiration from Mao's Cultural Revolution , collectivising all the land ; but it grew to love terror more than ideology .
The ferocity of the regime sent more than 300,000 rushing into exile .
At least two million urban Cambodians were route - marched into the paddy fields to near certain death .
Worst hit was the Eastern Zone , bordering Vietnam , where Sang Run came from .
Its people were derided as " duck 's arses with chicken 's heads " as the Khmer Rouge grew to mistrust the Vietnamese and accused Mondulkiri people of being disloyal - too sympathetic to their neighbours across the border .
Their names were added to those who were to be purged ; the catalogue of " crimes " became so long , so general , that anyone could stand accused .
The wave of random violence and retribution that scythed through the countryside for three years , eight months and 21 days killed one in five of the population .
Sang Run 's family all vanished , but he survived , hiding in the forests , living off what he could pluck and hunt .
When the Vietnamese invaded in 1978 - overthrowing the Khmer Rouge a year later - Sang Run found his way , like thousands of others , to Cambodia 's 300 - mile long shoreline .
Stretching between Thailand and Vietnam , the region had been a Khmer Rouge stronghold , controlled by Pol Pot 's notorious commander , Ta Mok , who was known as The Butcher .
In the 80s , when the fishing shacks and noodle stores went up along the Sihanoukville coast , there was no development plan .
There had never been a tradition of thriving fishing communities along the coast - few Cambodians lived there except in the old French colonial towns .
The shoreline had been empty - miles of palm - fringed beach front interspersed with the few port towns , including Kep , Sihanoukville and Ream .
Survivors began to build new lives there , learning to love the sea .
Some took boats to a nearby archipelago of 22 coral - fringed , uninhabited islands , building up clusters of villages on atolls with names such as Rabbit , Snake and Turtle .
Within 10 years , the whole coastline had been patchily settled by newcomers , among them a former farmer , Soch Tith , a stocky man with corncob hands , who was sick every time he got in a boat , but still found his way to faraway Koh Rong , the largest of the islands - 7,800 hectares of jungle .
There he cleared small patches to grow fruit .
By 2006 , these communities had schools , political representation , and many householders even had papers , stamped by the Sihanoukville governor , Say Hak , which guaranteed them the permanent right to stay under the 2001 Cambodian Land Law .
The central government in Phnom Penh had in the 90s designated the entire coast and its islands as State Public Land that could not be bartered or developed .
Then , during the past couple of years , a disturbing wave of rumours swept the coastal communities .
Sang Run says that in September 2006 he heard that Snake Island , half a mile out to sea , had been secretly sold to Russians .
He did not check .
Cambodians ask little from their government ; a wariness of authority is a legacy of years of blood - letting under Pol Pot .
In any case , it was a familiar story .
Shortly after Hun Sen , Cambodia 's prime minister , came to power in 1985 , frenzied landgrabbing began : influential political allies and wealthy business associates raced to claim land that the Khmer Rouge had seized , gobbling up such large chunks of the cities , forests and paddy fields that Cambodians used to say the rich were eating the country .
By 2006 , the World Bank estimated that 40,000 had been made homeless in Phnom Penh alone .
But , until now , no one had bothered with the coast .
Sang Run paid no particular attention to the Snake Island rumour .
He should have - it signalled a radical new course for the Cambodian government .
Three months later , Sang Run was out in his boat at 7 am when disaster struck his village .
He arrived back at 11 am to find bulldozers had flattened his home and those of the 229 families who lived beside him .
He heard from neighbours that it had happened in an instant .
Uniformed men , sent in by governor Say Hak , used electric batons to chase terrified residents from the burning ruins ; three of Sang Run 's neighbours were knocked unconscious .
Village Number
One - a mundane name that failed to capture the beauty of its uninterrupted sea views and vegetable gardens that ran to the beach - had been erased .
Sang
Run heard that a hotel was planned , although no information was given to the people evicted from their homes for a further 18 months .
Nurse - turned - restaurateur Srey Pov tells us that , by early 2007 , rumours were buzzing around Sihanoukville 's covered market that virtually every island in the region was up for sale .
Over the following months , Koh Russei and Koh Ta Kiev , Koh Bong and Koh Ouen , Koh Preus , Koh Krabei and Koh Tres were all snapped up by foreigners , who then started negotiating for mainland sites , too , among them public beaches with names such as Serendipity , Occheuteal and Otres .
In February , 47 - year - old Srey Pov was evicted , too , her Independence Beach restaurant shut down to make way for another rumoured hotel .
" All I 've got left is the chairs and tables , " she says - they 're stacked up in the cramped living room of her Sihanoukville home .
Former farmer Soch Tith , on Koh Rong , was the last to hear that last month his island had been sold , too , to a British developer .
What none of these people knew was that the troubled kingdom of Cambodia , a precarious debtor - nation underpinned by more than £ 500 m of hand - outs from the international community , had suddenly found itself a refuge for cash and speculators fleeing paralysed western financial markets .
As London and New York , overcome by the US sub - prime crisis , began grinding to a halt last year , many in the City had moved on , transferring liquid assets to the east .
Foreign fund managers had started pitching up in Phnom Penh wearing linen shirts and khaki drip - dry jungle wear , alerted by the country 's unexpected boom in tourism that in 2006 had seen one - and - a - half million visitors overcome the west 's collective memories of Cambodia 's recent past to travel to the temples of Angkor Wat .
Enticed also by indicators that suggested the feeble economy was turning a corner , super - rich , predominately British , French and Swiss speculators , fuelled by a high - risk machismo , came hunting for profits of 30 % or more .
Their interest was land speculation : buying up large sites in developing countries that they would then sit on in the hope that , with the influx of tourists , land values would soar .
Hun Sen and his ruling Cambodian People 's Party ( CPP ) have , in effect , put the country up for sale .
Crucially , they permit investors to form 100 % foreign - owned companies in Cambodia that can buy land and real estate outright - or at least on 99 - year plus 99 - year leases .
No other country in the world countenances such a deal .
Even in Thailand and Vietnam , where similar land speculation and profiteering are under way , foreigners can be only minority shareholders .
There were other inducements .
Many foreign funds - hedge funds , property funds , private equity funds - operating on the outer margins of the financial world thrive on complexity , risk and maximising profit .
In Phnom Penh , they found an ideal partner in the prime minister , who has created a unique business environment .
Since the mid-90s , Hun Sen and the CPP have declined to enforce money - laundering legislation and have concerned themselves little with the probity of investors .
Foreign businessmen were offered nine - year tax holidays , and were allowed to hold their cash in US dollars in banks outside the country .
" Only recently , no one would touch us , " Brett Sciaroni , a Phnom Penh - based US lawyer who acts for many new western investors , tells us .
" We were dirt .
And suddenly we were gold . "
John Brinsden , a British banker , now vice chairman of Cambodia 's national Acleda Bank , agrees : " In 2001 , only 200 people came to the government 's investment conference .
At our most recent , we ran out of chairs . "
In July 2007 , Hun Sen , gambling on his people 's tenuous connection with the land , changed the designation of the southern islands so they could be sold .
The forests , lakes , beaches and reefs - and the lives of the thousands of residents - were quietly transferred into the hands of private western developers .
Arguing that Cambodia could become a tourist magnet to challenge Thailand , the prime minister began a fire sale of mainland beaches .
By March this year , virtually all Cambodia 's accessible and sandy coast was in private hands , either Cambodian or foreign .
Those who lived or worked there were turfed out - some jailed , others beaten , virtually all denied meaningful compensation .
The deals went unannounced ; no tenders or plans were ever officially published .
All that was known was that more than £ 1,000 m in foreign finance found its way into the country in 2007 , a 1,500 % increase over the previous four years .
It was as if Alistair Darling , the British chancellor , had decided to raise some extra cash by trading the Isles of Wight , Man and the Hebrides , throwing in Formby Sands , the entire Cornish coastline and Brighton seafront - before trousering the proceeds .
It was abundantly clear to observers , including the World Bank and Amnesty International , that by making these private deals , Hun Sen was denying prosperity to most of his people , causing the country 's social fabric to unwind like thread from a bobbin .
Today , more than 150,000 people are threatened with eviction .
Forty - five per cent of the country 's entire landmass has been sold off - from the land ringing Angkor Wat to the colonial buildings of Phnom Penh to the south - western islands .
Professor Yash Ghai , the UN human rights emissary to Cambodia , warned , " One does not need expertise in human rights to recognise that many policies of the government have ... deprived people of their economic resources and means of livelihood , and denied them their dignity . "
He added , " I believe that the deliberate rejection of the concept of a state governed by the rule of law has been central to the ruling party 's hold on power . "
It was Hun Sen who , as early as 1989 , realised the power of land .
Rhodri Williams , a researcher for the Geneva - based Centre on Housing Rights and Evictions , points out that , as Hun Sen privatised the land , " he simultaneously cut off the rights of 360,000 exiled Cambodians , awarding prime slices to political allies and friends . "
The exiles were Cambodians who had fled the Khmer Rouge into Thailand and beyond in 1975 ; they had titles to the land , but this counted for nothing when they returned to claim it .
Hun Sen said Cambodia should start again .
Although he bathes his speeches in socialist values , even his closest aides told us that Hun Sen was more often than not a pragmatist .
He joined the Communist party in the 60s and enlisted in the Khmer Rouge in the 70s , before defecting to the Vietnamese - backed government in the 80s .
In the 90s , he embraced the free market .
Tourism was not a promising prospect in the early days - the remnants of Khmer Rouge , violently hostile to outsiders , were too much of a risk .
When western travellers did begin to explore , they were taking their lives in their hands .
In 1994 , Briton Mark Slater , Frenchman Jean - Michel Braquet and Australian David Wilson were kidnapped while riding a train through Sihanoukville , and all of them executed .
Two years later , Christopher Howes , a British de-mining expert , together with a Cambodian colleague , were murdered as they worked 10 miles north of Angkor Wat .
By 2006 , the country seemed safer , and was finally becoming a tourist destination .
That September , the CPP received its first foreign offer in the coastal area : a Russian investor living in Phnom Penh wanted to buy an island .
This deal would become the template for every developer to come .
Alexander Trofimov created a Cambodian shell company to buy Koh Puos , or Snake Island .
With cash apparently no object , he proposed to stunned government officials that he would link the island to a mainland beach - known as Hawaii - with a 900 - metre suspension bridge .
" He also asked to buy Hawaii beach , " the official who oversaw that meeting told us .
" And we gave it to him . "
No figures were published .
The official claimed he did n't know them .
Locals who used the beach and island were kept in the dark .
No one quizzed Trofimov .
He produced a book of cut - and - paste designs that he said would encompass a £ 150 m resort consisting of 900 tightly packed villas , a dolphin aquarium , two hotels , a shopping centre and a marina - all crammed into an egg cup - sized island .
It was enticing stuff for the CPP , although the project faltered when Trofimov was accused of having sex with underage girls , and jailed this year .
However , two more Russian businessmen seamlessly emerged to take up the reins , representing a Cypriot - holding company that , it later transpired , had owned the Koh Puos project from the off .
Arnaud Darc was quick off the mark , too .
A quietly spoken and likeable French businessman , Darc had arrived in Cambodia in the 90s , building a hotel and restaurant business in Phnom Penh .
In 2006 , after hearing from a French colleague working at Sihanoukville 's provincial airport that the runway was likely to be extended , he identified two massive beach - front sites totalling more than 220 hectares that he liked the look of .
He brought in Jean - Louis Charon , a Parisian real estate tycoon , whose Nexity company is the largest in France , and whose name brought in " 40 French high - net worths " , as Darc described them ; they raised £ 12.5 m to be held by City Star , a foreign - owned investment company .
" The maths was easy , and the returns potentially fantastic , " Darc said .
City Star 's land values quadrupled as soon as the Cambodian government confirmed the airport rumours , a spokesman for the Sihanoukville governor 's office told us .
The investors could have sold up and come away rich .
But this was development with a difference .
City Star investors wanted more , but did not want to go to the trouble of constructing anything .
They were speculating on the future value of the land , believing that by adding only modest infrastructure , perhaps attaching big - name hoteliers , they would reap vast profits in seven to 10 years .
Darc 's group continued buying , snapping up 333 hectares on Koh Russei and Koh Ta Kiev , two islands off Ream .
Such was the appetite for easy money that City Star raised a further £ 30 m in a matter of days from a second group of French high rollers last July , this time to buy in Phnom Penh .
Darc 's model appealed to British investors behind LimeTree Capital , a Hong Kong - based private equity group that in 2007 bought up chunks of beach front near Ream ; sites it planned to leave idle for many years until prices peaked .
This spring , a third entrepreneur , Frenchman Alain Dupuis , through his Cambodian company LBL International , bought Koh Sramaoch .
Soon after , Koh Tonsay , or Rabbit Island , was auctioned off to Chinese investors ; 14 fishing families were evicted to make way for a casino and a golf course .
On the mainland , Sang Run returned to the beach to find his village in Sihanoukville destroyed to make way , supposedly , for a hotel .
A few hotels have been built , but generally the sites remain empty .
The Cambodian economy has grown by more than 24 % over 18 months and land values have in some cases risen by more than 100 % , so there are fortunes to be made from doing nothing but wait .
Australians Rory and Mel Hunter were the only investors who made an attempt to incorporate into their plans the people whose land they were buying .
An advertising executive , Rory had come to Cambodia to work for an agency in Phnom Penh .
During a week - long vacation in 2006 , he and his wife , Mel , had set out on a diving trip around the Koh Rong archipelago and fell in love with the twin islands of Koh Bong and Koh Ouen , attached to one another by a coral reef and cupped in a shallow strait - they were known collectively as the Sweethearts .
" We dreamed of a beautiful resort where people could immerse themselves in a new part of Asia , " Mel said .
They began negotiations with two village men to buy their houses and those owned by 60 other families .
" They thought we were nuts , " Rory said .
" The two head guys wanted £ 7,500 each .
We agreed and signed the contract in a boat out in the strait .
We helped take down their tin shacks , and slowly relocated all the families and their homes to Koh Rong , across the strait . "
They worked for weeks to clear 20 years of debris , while beginning negotiations with the government to buy the islands themselves .
The Hunters drummed up backing from a handful of British speculators , including a currency broker who ( preferring we did n't use his name ) tells us why he leapt at the opportunity .
" I loved the deal from the start .
Let 's be honest , who wants 6 % ?
I wanted a deal that would wake me up in the night , sweating .
We could make good money , " he says over drinks in Phnom Penh , his City suit exchanged for shorts and a T - shirt .
" There was a buzz about Cambodia you do n't get elsewhere .
It 's Cambodia , the killing fields and all that stuff .
Something different to show your mates back home .
I show them the visa in my passport .
I have something they do n't . "
But the Hunters ' enterprise would soon be challenged by a cascade of deals involving neighbouring islands .
While they worked on retraining local fishermen on neighbouring Koh Rong , British property developer Marty Kaye bought the ground from under their feet .
Kaye , who had spent much of his career working on construction in Hong Kong , had spotted the island while planning an £ 800 m luxury tourist development on a nearby Vietnamese island , Phu Quoc .
He told us : " I was walking down the beach on Phu Quoc , seeing where we were going to put the golf course , and I spotted another island .
No one knew what it was .
We looked on Google Earth and it seemed to be Koh Rong , in adjacent Cambodia .
I said , ' Let 's see if we can get anywhere on Koh Rong , too . ' "
Kaye , who runs Millennium property fund , began negotiating .
" Here was a chance to buy an undeveloped island almost as long as Hong Kong , " he said .
" Nowhere else in the world could you create your own kingdom from scratch - unlike the car - crash planning of Thai islands like Koh Samui . "
The Cambodian government gave him 18 months to produce more details , and he worked on an outline plan whose initial development would cost £ 100 m .
When the government signed the deal , it made no mention of the census it had just carried out recording how many thousands of people ( the government wo n't reveal the figures ) live on the 7,800 - hectare island .
Kaye is not worried : " Two guys and a lawyer will see everyone .
But what most of them do n't understand is that even if they have papers , they are not worth anything .
All of them are registered only locally , not in Phnom Penh , so they will have absolutely no case .
Others are just squatters with no papers at all . "
It helped that Kaye 's Cambodian partner was tycoon Kith Meng , a multi-millionaire with interests in banking , mobile phones and real estate - and a close friend of the prime minister , Hun Sen .
" Kith Meng wants everything done yesterday , " Kaye said .
" We are going to move as fast as we can .
It 's fantastically exciting , the opportunity to zone the whole island , to see where the luxury exclusive villa plots will be , for the Brad Pitts , etc . "
It is an investment that gives the present residents of Koh Rong just over a year to make a solid case for keeping their homes or finding new ones .
If they are evicted , places in the area to make a new home are becoming scarce .
With all the big islands sold , even smaller outcrops have gone , too , including a clump of rocks known as Nail Island , bought by Ukrainian entrepreneur Nickolai Doroshenko , who has transformed it into a James Bond - style lair , complete with a giant fibre - glass shark that soars over the fortress - like construction .
He already owns Victory Beach , in Sihanoukville , a restaurant stuffed with live snakes and a bar that advertises " swimming girls " .
The sale of the century continued with the mainland beaches .
At the end of January , the Sokha Hotel Group , run by Sok Kong , a Cambodian oligarch and Hun Sen ally , was confirmed as the new owner of the lion 's share of Occheuteal Beach , the largest and most popular public dune in the region , which was closed off to make way for a 1,000 - room hotel and golf course .
The deal was originally negotiated in June 2006 when , local fisherman told us , bulldozers and 10 trucks of armed men demolished 71 homes and 40 local restaurants .
Not wanting to be left out , Say Hak , Sihanoukville 's governor , acquired a small island for himself , on which he built a villa and jetty ; while Sbaung Sarath , the wife of his deputy , bought half of Sihanoukville 's public Independence Beach in February 2008 , evicting scores of families in the process .
Among them was Srey Pov .
She travelled to Phnom Penh with 27 other families to protest , but returned with nothing .
" The developer issued a warning , " she says .
" They threatened to pay the city authorities to get rid of us .
We knew what that meant . "
Independence Beach now languishes behind high fencing , as Srey Pov feared , waiting for the five - star tourists who will enjoy exclusive access to the powder - white sand .
Days later , Sbaung Sarath struck again , securing part of Sihanoukville 's Otres Beach , one of the last public dunes , where Queenco , a London - listed casino company , also announced in February that it had bought 56 hectares .
Queenco declined to comment on its Sihanoukville project , but it has already had consequences - 100 fishing families have been evicted .
They have built a row of makeshift bamboo shacks , held together with plastic sheeting and whatever rubbish they could recycle , along a 200 - yard stretch of a nearby main road .
On the day we visited , they were drying out from an overnight storm that had filled their ramshackle homes with rainwater .
Aom Heat , 63 , used to have a wonderful view over Otres beach and the gulf beyond .
She was forced off her land last April .
Now all she can see are the hubcaps and exhaust pipes of lorries that tear by .
She and many of her neighbours had arrived on Otres Beach after fleeing the Khmer Rouge in the early 80s , building a fishing village they christened Spean Ches , or Burning Bridge .
" When the eviction notices were served on us in September 2006 , we were determined to fight , " she says .
She could not bear to lose everything again .
" We lodged a complaint with the Senate Committee on Human Rights that ruled it was a matter for the courts . "
But the Sihanoukville governor 's men did not wait for a court order .
They turned up at the seaside village in April last year , Aom Heat says , and , " they burned down 26 houses and bulldozed 86 more , destroying all the pots and pans , clothes and food supplies .
We were in a blind panic . "
Thirteen injured men were arrested and jailed , including one of Aom Heat 's sons .
Although made homeless , they were charged with " wrongful damage of property " , and nine of them found guilty without witnesses or evidence produced .
Despite having served their time while waiting for the case to be heard , the men were thrown back into jail pending an appeal from the prosecution , who complained they had been dealt with too leniently .
No one can agree what impact the foreign land sales will have on the Cambodian economy because so little information is made public .
Although Cambodia is nominally a democracy that has held three general elections to date , and has a nominal opposition party , the CPP parliamentarians and cabinet are remote and dismissive of their people .
They are not required to report on their interests or assets , making it impossible to deduce how much Hun Sen and his cabinet have personally benefited - although the World Bank reported last year that corruption , coupled with a lack of transparency , was " choking economic growth " .
Since the land sell - offs , members of the government and its allies have been splashing huge sums around .
A Korean developer told us that when he marketed Phnom Penh 's first skyscraper , the 42 - storey Gold Tower project in February , all two dozen £ 750,000 penthouse suites were bought within 24 hours by " an honour roll of the CPP and its friends in the military " .
There are other telltale signs , such as the canary yellow Hummers and hi-spec Range Rovers with blacked - out windows that rumble around Phnom Penh , in a country where the average annual income is less than £ 150 .
Simon Taylor , the director of Global Witness , an international NGO that was forced to leave the country last year , having accused the CPP of running a logging racket , paints a depressing picture : " A shadow state has grown up , a government that misappropriates public assets , extorts from businesses and manages an extensive illicit economy .
It is administered by senior ministers who are fluent in the jargon of good governance and sustainable development . "
One of Hun Sen 's closest advisers , who requested anonymity , disagrees , telling us : " Hun Sen believes that liberal democracy is unsuited to a country whose skills have been drained and demographics wildly skewed by the Khmer Rouge . "
Everything comes down to how much money you have in your pocket , according to Doug Clayton , from Leopard Asia , a fund of Swiss and British bankers that is about to invest £ 25 m in Cambodia .
" This kind of money opens any door , " he says .
How does Clayton pitch the Hun Sen brand back home ?
" Candidly ?
In investment circles , no one knows anything about this place .
It 's off the radar .
In our pitch I talk up the new economic figures .
I talk up stability . "
Clayton adds : " When the dust settles , the government here will probably end up looking something like the one in Singapore . "
There , Lee Kuan Yew served as prime minister from 1959 to 1990 .
Cambodian pollsters , looking to the general election that will run this July , predict a clear CPP victory , putting Hun Sen at the helm for many more years , too .
What will this mean for people such as Sang Run , who is now surviving in a makeshift home behind Independence Beach ?
Has the legacy of the Khmer Rouge been purged ?
Naly Pilorge , director of Licadho , a local human rights NGO , thinks not : " Everyone claims Cambodia has come through the period of barbarism , but the sadism is still bubbling beneath the surface .
Extreme violence , greed and disregard for the most basic human rights - of giving people a place to live - are still with us daily .
The methods of the past are being used to dictate our future . "
I ’m working on a new project that will be open sourced if I can ever get it to be generically useful .
It ’s called “ sarviz ” , and it ’s a visualization tool for output from the “ sar ” UNIX system reporting utility .
I know tools like this exist , but please read on , as I ’m looking to do something a bit different from what I ’ve seen .
A quick , simple explanation of sar
System administrators typically run sar as a cron job , and each day sar will generate a report that lists the values of various system counters for a specified time interval throughout the day .
So you end up with a text file that lists , for example , the cpu iowait value every 10 minutes throughout the day .
There are maybe a dozen different categories of counters enabled by default , and more that are n’t ( like disk - related counters ) .
Anyway , you wind up with a text file that looks something like this :
23:30:01Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â CPUÂ Â Â Â %userÂ Â Â Â %niceÂ Â %systemÂ Â %iowaitÂ Â Â % stealÂ Â Â Â %idle
23:40:02Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â allÂ Â Â Â Â 0.32Â Â Â Â Â 0.00Â Â Â Â Â 0.32Â Â Â Â Â 6.57Â Â Â Â Â 0.49Â Â Â Â 92.29
23:40:02Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 0Â Â Â Â Â 0.32Â Â Â Â Â 0.00Â Â Â Â Â 0.32Â Â Â Â Â 6.57Â Â Â Â Â 0.49Â Â Â Â 92.29
23:50:01Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â allÂ Â Â Â Â 0.74Â Â Â Â Â 0.00Â Â Â Â Â 0.82Â Â Â Â Â 7.14Â Â Â Â Â 0.55Â Â Â Â 90.76
23:50:01Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 0Â Â Â Â Â 0.74Â Â Â Â Â 0.00Â Â Â Â Â 0.82Â Â Â Â Â 7.14Â Â Â Â Â 0.55Â Â Â Â 90.76
Average : Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â allÂ Â Â Â Â 0.82Â Â Â Â Â 0.00Â Â Â Â Â 0.72Â Â Â Â 13.54Â Â Â Â Â 0.78Â Â Â Â 84.14
Average : Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 0Â Â Â Â Â 0.82Â Â Â Â Â 0.00Â Â Â Â Â 0.72Â Â Â Â 13.54Â Â Â Â Â 0.78Â Â Â Â 84.14
This is just a small part of one section of the file ( this box has only one cpu , which is why the ‘ all ’ and ‘ 0 ’ numbers are the same , btw ) .
The whole file on one server , running with default configurations , is 4000 lines long .
There ’s a ton of great information in here , but … it all looks like the above .
There ’s no graphical output to be had .
This is bad , because it would be nice to use this ( historical ) monitoring output for things like capacity planning , problem tracking , etc .
You would , of course , want to couple this type of monitoring with something else that ’ll do real - time monitoring , alerts , dependencies , escalation , etc .
So I want to write an application that ’ll generate graphs of all of this stuff .
Furthermore , I thought it would be cool to do something like what planetplanet does , which is to say that I want sarviz to run as a cron job , parse all of this stuff , and generate static html files , with an index.html that ’ll make it really easy to browse this information either by host , by date , by resource … whatever .
Later on I can add features to actually do even more useful stuff like longer - term trending of resource usage ( by aggregating across various ‘ sar ’ output files ) , and more .
Sar is not alone
Sar comes with some friends , and it turns out they can be extremely useful .
The best one for my purposes here is called ‘ sadf ’ , and it is used to basically format the sar output to make it more useful for programmatic processing .
It can output the information in CSV format , or make it ready for insertion into a relational database , but what I ’m currently using for sarviz ( and it ’s early , so this could change ) is the XML output capability .
With XML output , I wo n’t have to deal with parsing out column headers , scanning an entire file for information from a single sar run , dealing with the blank lines sar uses by default to make it easier to read on a console , etc .
So with sadf I can get output that looks like this :
< timestamp date = ” 2008-06 - 15 ″ time = ” 07:10:01 ″ interval = ” 600 ″ >
< processes per=” second ” proc= ” 0.93 ″ />
< context - switch per=” second ” cswch= ” 221.50 ″ />
< cpu-load >
< cpu number = ” all ” user = ” 1.77 ″ nice = ” 0.00 ″ system = ” 0.56 ″ iowait = ” 0.04 ″ steal = ” 0.08 ″ idle = ” 97.55 ″ />
< cpu number= ” 0 ″ user = ” 1.77 ″ nice = ” 0.00 ″ system = ” 0.56 ″ iowait = ” 0.04 ″ steal = ” 0.08 ″ idle = ” 97.55 ″ />
</cpu-load > ….
This is a bit nicer to deal with , and I was excited to use Python ’s ( now built - in ) Element
Tree module to do something from scratch after having dealt with it being somewhat abstracted in the Python tools for the GData API ( which I used to write a command line client for Google Spreadsheets , for example ) .
Doing Simple
Things with ElementTree
Well , as it turns out , I had kind of a hard time getting started doing what I thought were simple things with ElementTree , so I want to post a few examples of how I did them so that I and others have something to refer to online .
The first thing to know about ElementTree is that there are Element objects , and ElementTree objects .
ElementTree objects are made up of a hierarchical collection of Element objects , and Element objects are the things you can actually get attributes from that you ’re likely to want .
For whatever reason , I was a little confused starting out , because I wanted to get an ElementTree object and then ask that object to “ scan the tree and give me all of the “ time ” attributes of the “ timestamp ” elements in the tree .
You might be able to do this with a one - liner , but I never found a document that said how .
So here ’s how to load in an XML file , parse it , and return all of the timestamp elements in that tree ( or , rather , this is how I did it , which seems reasonable ) :
strudel : sa jonesy $ python
Python 2.5.1 ( r251:54863 , Jan 17 2008 , 19:35:17 )

Type " help " , " copyright " , " credits " or " license " for more information .
>>> from xml.etree import ElementTree as ET
>>> tree = ET. parse ( " sa15.xml " )

...Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print isotime

….
So , I imported the ElementTree module , fed my xml file to a method called “ parse ( ) ” , and that gives me an ElementTree object .
In that tree , I then ask for the timestamp elements which are under the root element at “ host/statistics /timestamp ” .
You can then see that I create an ISO8601 - formatted timestamp by asking for the “ date ” and “ time ” attributes of the timestamp element , and put a “ T ” between them .
I would ’ve used something like “ T ” . join , but there are other attributes in that element , and I only needed two , so I took the easy way out here instead of creating a list first and then doing the join on the list .
Of course , my real interest in the timestamps is n’t to print them , but to get the statistics for each sar run ( represented by a timestamp , since sar records statistics for regular time intervals ) .
So now let ’s grab the 1- , 5 - , and 15 - minute load averages according to sar .
I want all of this printed on one line along with the timestamp , because this output is going to be graphed using Timeplot , and that ’s how Timeplot wants the data .
Here goes :
>>> for ts in tree.findall ( " host/statistics/timestamp " ) :
...Â Â Â Â Â Â Â isotime = ts.attrib [ " date " ] + " T " + ts.attrib [ " time " ]
...Â Â Â Â Â Â Â for q in ts.findall ( " queue " ) :
...Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â qstat = [ isotime , q.attrib [ " ldavg - 1 " ] , q.attrib [ " ldavg - 5 " ] , q.attrib [ " ldavg - 15 " ] ]
...Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â print " , " .join ( qstat )

The thing to note here , in case it escaped your eyeball , is that the second call to ‘ findall ’ feeds an argument relative to the ‘ ts ’ object rather than the ‘ tree ’ object .
This data is ready for Timeplot , and now it ’s just a matter of somehow generating the files with the appropriate HTML and JavaScript in them to present the information .
I have absolutely no clue how to easily use dynamic variables from Python to easily generate static HTML and JavaScript , so what I have in that area of my code is not something I want to share , out of sheer embarrasment .
If someone has done that , let me know .
PlanetPlanet does not output JavaScript , best I can tell , but it does output HTML , so I ’ll be checking that part of the code out ( probably uses BeautifulSoup I guess ? ) .
Input on that is hereby solicited !
A teenager who thought movement in her underwear was caused by her vibrating mobile phone found a bat curled up asleep in her bra .
Abbie Hawkins , 19 , of Norwich , had been wearing the bra for five hours when she plucked up the courage to investigate .
When she did , she found a baby bat in padding in her 34 FF bra .
The hotel receptionist said she was shocked but felt bad for removing the " cuddly " bat .
" It looked cosy and comfortable and I was sorry for disturbing it , " she said .
She was sitting at her desk at work when she decided to investigate the strange movements in her underwear .
" I put my hand down my bra and pulled out a cuddly little bat .
Perhaps I should have left it there and given it a good home
Abbie Hawkins
" That shocked me very much at the time , but it scuttled off under the desk into the dark .
I was shaking from head to toe .
" It looked quite cosy and comfortable in there so it was quite rude of me to take it out .
" When I realised it was a bat the first thing that occurred to me was how did it get in there .
" I felt quite sorry for it .
Perhaps I should have left it there and given it a good home .
" I did not notice anything as I put my bra on .
The night before I had had one or two drinks and I was getting ready quickly .
" The bra was in my drawer but it had been on the washing line the day before .
" When I was driving to work , I felt a slight vibration but I thought it was just my mobile phone in my jacket pocket . "
The bat was captured by one of her colleagues and released .

What are these ?
Eric Walsh examines water damaged U.S. currency at the Mutilated Currency Division of the Treasury Department in Washington , on July 17 .
For the past few years , authorities say , Franz Felhaber and his family have popped in and out of U.S. banks , looking to trade - in about $ 20 million in bills like these for clean cash .
WASHINGTON 
The businessman arrived at the Treasury Department carrying a suitcase stuffed with about $ 5.2 million .
The bills were decomposing , nearly unrecognizable , and he asked to swap them for a cashier 's check .
He said the money came from Mexico .
Money like this normally arrives in an armored truck or insured shipping container after a bank burns or a vault floods .
It does n't just show up at the visitor 's entrance on a Tuesday morning .
But the banking habits of Franz Felhaber had stopped making sense to the government long ago .
For the past few years , authorities say , he and his family have popped in and out of U.S. banks , looking to change about $ 20 million in buried treasure for clean cash .
The money is always the same — decaying $ 100 bills from the 1970s and 1980s .
It 's the story that keeps changing : • It was an inheritance .
•
Somebody dug up a tree and there it was .
•
It was found in a suitcase buried in an alfalfa field .
• A relative found a treasure map .
No matter where it came from or who found it , that buried treasure stands to make someone rich .
It could also send someone to jail .
Raising suspicion Felhaber is a customs broker , a middleman .
His company , F.C. Felhaber & Co. , is just minutes away from the bridge between El Paso , and Ciudad Juarez , Mexico .
Tens of billions of dollars of Mexican goods cross that bridge each year , aided by people such as Felhaber who navigate the customs bureaucracy .
PHOTOS : Recovering mutilated money Customs brokers do n't own the stuff that comes into the United States .
They just make sure it gets here .
So it is with the $ 20 million .
Felhaber says the money is not his .
A Mexican relative , Francisco Javier Ramos Saenz - Pardo , merely sought help exchanging money that had been buried for decades , Felhaber says .
" To be very clear on this matter :
In the beginning , I was not told what it was , " Felhaber said in one of several telephone interviews with the Associated Press .
Money petrifies after sitting underground that long and Felhaber said it looked like a brick of adobe .
The Treasury will exchange even badly damaged money , but Felhaber said Saenz - Pardo did not want to handle the process himself .
" Imagine a Mexican family bringing money that is damaged and the government calling it a drug deal , " Felhaber said .
If the goal were to avoid unwarranted attention , he went about it all wrong .
Rather than making a simple — albeit large — exchange at the Treasury , Felhaber allegedly began trying to exchange smaller amounts at El Paso - area banks , raising suspicion every time .
The first stop was the Federal Reserve Bank in El Paso , where authorities say Felhaber appeared with an uncle , Jose , and an aunt , Esther .
In her purse , Esther carried $ 120,000 .
She told bank officials there were millions more , discovered while digging to expand a building in Juarez , according to U.S. court records filed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement .
Banks normally refer such requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing , an arm of the Treasury .
But employees worried that with so much cash , the three might be robbed on their way home .
So , the bank accepted the money and wired $ 120,000 to an account in his uncle 's name , Jose Carrillo - Valles , according to a government affidavit .
Felhaber was back at it again weeks later , this time at a Bank of America branch .
Customs officials say he unsuccessfully tried to persuade a bank vice president to dispatch an armored truck to the Mexican border to pick up millions of dollars .
Felhaber denies that conversation took place .
But he is tough to pin down on details .
At times he seems specific on a point ( " There is a $ 20 million inheritance , " ) only to contradict himself minutes later , saying the amount is " nowhere near that " and he has no idea where the money came from .
Soon after the Bank of America visit , a man bearing a striking resemblance to Felhaber walked into a Bank of the West branch .
This time , however , authorities say the customer identified himself as Ken Motley and said he discovered millions while excavating a tree in Chihuahua , Mexico .
Bank employees refused to exchange any money , despite two follow - up phone calls — once with a Spanish accent , once without — to try to set up an exchange .
The mysterious Ken Motley also appeared at the First National Bank , telling employees that a friend had discovered $ 20 million buried in an alfalfa field , investigators say .
Felhaber says he is not Ken Motley .
Customs investigators say a Bank of the West employee identified Felhaber 's picture as that of Ken Motley .
" That 's an absolute lie , " Felhaber said .
" That would be a horrendous miscarriage of justice . "
It 's unclear which transaction caught investigators ' attention .
Most of the tens of thousands of exchanges of mutilated money each year are routine .
Natural disasters create a lot of inquiries .
Children of the Depression have kept money out of banks , only to see it eaten by rodents in their attics or destroyed in fires .
A surprising number of people accidentally shred greeting cards with money inside .
But authorities say there are warning signs that trigger investigations .
Making a series of small exchanges is one .
Bringing mutilated money from abroad is another .
" That is one of the things we are extra concerned about :
This process being used to launder money from illegal activities , " said Leonard R. Olijar , the chief financial officer of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing .
" That 's one of our factors that we use to make a case suspicious . "
Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents questioned Felhaber in October 2005 .
According to a government summary of that interview , Felhaber said he believed the money was the result of a 1970s Mexican land deal .
The money was buried in a coffin , he said , until Saenz - Pardo — the relative who brought him the money in the first place — discovered a map leading him to the buried treasure .
Felhaber said he did n't want to do anything illegal and was merely getting a cut of whatever he exchanged .
He now says he was mistaken in his interviews with investigators .
" I told them , ' I suspect this is where it 's from but I did n't know , " ' he said .
" They take you to your word like you 're supposed to remember every single thing every single time . "
Sorting out the stories Maybe it was the visit from investigators or maybe someone realized the bank visits were n't working , but Felhaber apparently changed strategies .
In January 2006 , the Bureau of Engraving and Printing received a package containing about $ 136,000 from Jose Carrillo - Valles , Felhaber 's uncle .
Felhaber 's business was listed as the return address .
The letter explained the money had been stored in a basement for 22 years .
Though customs officials were suspicious by then , there was no clear evidence of a crime , just a lot of unanswered questions .
So , two months later , the Treasury mailed a check , which was deposited into Carrillo - Valles ' account .
Following the money , investigators interviewed Carrillo - Valles and his wife .
Each denied ever sending or receiving the money , according to a government affidavit .
As for the $ 120,000 wired to Jose 's account from the Federal Reserve a year earlier , they allegedly said it was an inheritance .
Esther said Jose 's mother had recently died .
Authorities do n't believe the inheritance story .
For starters , they say Jose 's mother was still alive when the $ 120,000 was exchanged .
They also traced a wire transfer from Jose 's account to someone named Saenz - Pardo shortly after it was deposited .
Customs investigators now believed Carrillo - Valles was acting as an intermediary , taking a cut of the money and sending the rest to Saenz - Pardo or someone else in Mexico .
Twice , reporters called Carrillo - Valles on his cellphone to ask about the arrangement and confirm his discussions with investigators .
First , he said he did not speak English .
When a Spanish - speaking reporter called back , he said he could not hear her , and hung up .
In April 2007 , the case moved from being suspicious to becoming a criminal investigation .
Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials called the Justice Department , saying Felhaber had just arrived in person at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing with about $ 1.2 million .
It 's not illegal to find money .
Depending on where it 's found , there might be a bureaucratic process to follow or taxes to be paid , but the discovery itself is not a crime .
There are strict rules , however , about bringing money into the United States .
Import documents identified the $ 1.2 million as belonging to Jose Carrillo - Valles .
Based on their investigation so far , authorities believe that was a lie — a violation that carries up to five years in prison .
But Washington federal prosecutor William Cowden decided to wait .
Maybe Felhaber would return with even more .
It paid off .
This April , Felhaber was back at the Treasury , this time with a suitcase containing $ 5.2 million .
Investigators say they have found no import documents filed for this deal , a violation of cash smuggling laws that also carries up to five years in prison .
Prosecutors moved in .
Felhaber 's two Treasury visits gave them probable cause to seize the money — both the $ 1.2 million and the $ 5.2 million .
They told a federal magistrate in June that they suspected it was all drug money that had been buried or hidden inside a wall for decades .
" Given that the money is coming north from Mexico , that both conflicting and cockamamie stories have been told about its origins , and that all the stories of how it got to be found are fantastical , I strongly suspect that the Felhaber currency is the proceeds of illegal bulk narcotics sales , " ICE investigator Stephen A. Schneider told the magistrate .
'' The truth will come out '
Felhaber says he 's still not sure what all the fuss is about .
At times he says he has no idea where the money came from , but he is always certain it has nothing to do with drugs .
None of the documents filed in federal court accuses Felhaber or his relatives of being involved in drugs .
They leave open the possibility that somebody merely came across a cache of drug money , forgotten or abandoned in the Mexican desert .
In the coming weeks , the Justice Department plans to seek forfeiture of the seized $ 6.4 million .
That means Felhaber and his family will have the opportunity to come to Washington to ask for their money back .
If they do , they 'll have to explain where it came from .
And they 'll have to sort through some of the inconsistent stories for a federal judge .
Felhaber bristles at the suggestion there have been inconsistencies .
" The story has never changed , " he said .
" I do n't know how it 's changed . "
Reached by telephone Monday , he said he was aware of the looming forefeiture action but could not discuss whether his family planned to challenge it .
But he said " the truth will come out " about the money eventually .
Cowden , the federal prosecutor , said he does n't know what to expect .
" Some of these cases , nobody ever comes forward , " he said .
If so , the buried treasure will become government property .
Or at least some of it .
Perhaps there is another $ 14 million out there , muddy and waiting to be exchanged .
Does Felhaber know if there 's any money left ?
On that , it 's hard to get a straight answer .

There are billboards up and down busy Orange Blossom Trail , but this at John Young Parkway ( see map ) one sticks out .
" Just looking at it , I 'm not thinking about Democrat or Republican , I 'm thinking about the twin towers and all the people killed , " resident Mary Anderson told Eyewitness News .
The ad went up last week and is causing quite a reaction .
" Why use the twin towers for that purpose ? "
Anderson questioned .
The man behind the billboard is Mike Meehan , a St. Cloud businessman and musician .
His website advertises a CD and music video titled " The Republican Song , " with the chorus , " Do n't vote for a Democrat . "
He 's selling CDs for $ 5 .
" This is a blatant exploitation of that terrible tragedy for political and , perhaps even worse , personal gain , " said Bill Robinson , Orange County Democratic Party Chair .

The Singularity is a conceit of modern science fiction : a place inside vast computers where whole universes are simulated whose reality is every bit as sharp and instantaneous as the physical world we inhabit .
Books like Charlie Stross 's Singularity Sky and the Matrix movie trilogy have done a great job of representing such alternative , computer - calculated realities .
Science fiction writer Rudy Rucker , however , has taken issue with the whole idea , arguing that the universe is already " calculating " reality far better than any software could manage .
After all , he says , the rock that you just dropped on your foot did a brilliant job of solving the physics of its velocity and direction , taking into account every conceivable variable from wind shear to the minute irregularities in its surface .
Your nerve endings calculated , in flawless real - time , the screech of pain that was sent up your nerves into your brain , which in turn calculated precisely how much it all hurt and which cuss words flew involuntarily from your lips .
Most problems do n't require such accurate solutions , so we can usefully approximate answers with computers – whether it 's predicting the weather or angling the flaps on the wings of a jumbo jet to bring it in for a landing .
But the tiny approximations and fudge factors in those calculations add up .
While we 're pretty good at predicting the weather a day or two ahead , we are hopeless at predicting the weather a year from now .
In order to get an accurate forecast , we 'd need a whole solar system 's worth of minute measurements and the computer with which to crunch them .
Total accuracy
In fact , argues Rucker , we have one such computer – the solar system itself – and it predicts the weather at the rate of one second per second , with total and complete accuracy .
Storing representations of the solar system is inherently less efficient than the real thing , he says .
To get a solar system 's worth of accuracy out of a computer , your best bet is to just leave the solar system as it is and wait until the outcome you 're curious about has arrived .
This conclusion flies in the face of the traditional approach to problem - solving : collect data , compute , collect more data , compute .
But that approach gets you nowhere .
At a certain point , data gathered to predict the weather overwhelms your capacity to add it to your calculations efficiently , resulting in ever - longer runtimes that give less accurate predictions .
It 's better to crunch the data needed to calculate tomorrow 's weather in 10 minutes ( and refine your guess twice an hour ) than to shovel so much data into the hopper that you do n't get tomorrow 's forecast until next week .
The sweet spot lies somewhere between gathering too much information and gathering too little – and the secret to hitting that spot is intelligent , discriminating data - acquisition .
Take London : cover every square inch of the city with CCTVs and you 'll get so much information that you 'll never make any sense of it .
Scotland Yard says that CCTVs help solve fewer than 3 % of all crimes , while a study in San Francisco found that at best , criminals simply move out of camera range , while at worst they assume no one is watching .
Similarly , if you take fingerprints from every person who applies for a visa – or worse still , from every person in Britain who has to carry one of the proposed new biometric cards – you will fill the databases with chaff that slows down searches , generates endless false matches , and threatens everyone in the database with the worst kind of identity theft .
Needles in a haystack
The problem of sifting through vast amounts of data was highlighted by the US 9/11 Commission , which concluded that the American intelligence community knew in advance that the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon were in the offing , they just did n't know they knew it .
The pieces were all there for anyone who knew to look for them , needles buried in a haystack of irrelevancies .
The answer in both America and Britain has been to collect more haystacks : useless , indiscriminately acquired information on
people who 've done nothing to arouse suspicion .
We even inveigle our citizens to become amateur curtain - twitchers and pecksniffs , demanding that they report " suspicious " activity to the authorities .
Between DNA databases , mandatory fingerprinting for visa seekers , CCTV carpet - bombing , and Oyster card data , we 've never collected more " security " information than we do today .
But does this really make us secure ?
Is it possible to know too much ?
Outside of dramatically failed experiments like the Soviet Union and East Germany , policing has never been a business of gathering data on every single person and arresting the guilty ones .
This does n't catch guilty people , it ensnares the innocent and acts as a kind of monetary black hole , absorbing all the cash we can toss into it , growing larger and more voracious by the day .
Too much data ruins the investigation , every time .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - NASA has began unofficial negotiations with Japan ’s space agency on purchasing units of an unmanned cargo transfer spacecraft as the successor to its space shuttles , the Yomiuri newspaper said on Sunday .
Such a deal would be the biggest in Japan ’s 50 - year space development history , the paper added .
The H - 2 Transfer Vehicle ( HTV ) , which costs about 14 billion yen ( $ 131 million ) each , is being developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency ( JAXA ) and domestic companies including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd and Mitsubishi Electric Corp , the Yomiuri said .
Behind the move is NASA ’s concern that the retirement of its space shuttles in 2010 will make it difficult for the U.S. to fulfill its responsibilities to deliver water , food and materials for scientific experiments to the International Space Station , the paper said .
In April , NASA started a project to assist U.S. companies ’ development of a spacecraft to succeed the space shuttle , but it is uncertain whether the successor could be developed in the two years left before the retirement , and that prompted NASA to discuss buying foreign spacecraft , the paper said .
Japan ’s HTV , which is capable of carrying a maximum of six tonnes of cargo , will be introduced next autumn , and the spacecraft will be launched at the rate of one per year , the paper said .
No one at JAXA could be reached for comment , but the Yomiuri quoted the space agency as saying it has been unofficially discussing the matter with NASA since February .
Yesterday , on Hardball ( transcript when it becomes available ) , Tom DeLay was , for whatever reason , poisoning the airwaves rather than facing trial somewhere , and in the course of his appearance noted that we need to immediately erect a blockade around Iran , and that it had to be done soon , by this administration , or we may lose our chance because a President Obama would not .
Expect to see the cries for a blockade of Iran increase over the next few weeks and months as the usual suspects , unhappy with our current two wars , will agitate for a third ( for those of you so inclined , Pat Lang has some thoughts here that are relevant ) .
As such , it is worthwhile to note where some of this stuff is coming from , and one source is House Concurrent Resolution 362 , which Rep .
Wexler , a co-sponsor of the bill , discusses here at the HuffPo :
In the coming weeks , the House Committee on Foreign Affairs , of which I am a member , may vote on House Concurrent Resolution 362 .
Given my growing concerns regarding this resolution , including its failure to advocate for direct American engagement with Tehran and open language that could lead to a US blockade of Iran , I will lead an effort to make changes to this resolution before it comes to the Foreign Affairs committee for a vote .
Despite being a cosponsor of this resolution — these changes will ultimately determine whether or not I will continue to support H. Con. Res. 362 .
My rationale for originally supporting H. Con. Res. 362 , which currently has 230 cosponsors , was to urge the Bush administration to pursue a policy to place additional economic , political and diplomatic pressure on Iran as part of an international endeavor to prevent Tehran from moving forward on its nuclear program .
Given my intense distrust of President Bush and his administration ’s disastrous foreign policy record , I also sponsored legislation ( H. R. 3119 ) , which if passed into law would prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran unless authorized by Congress and prevents the president from unilaterally going to war .
Good thinking Rep. Wexler , as no one could have predicted the GOP would latch on to one bill and ignore the other .
It is simply unpossible for anyone to have known that would happen .
At any rate , the actual text of the bill can be found here , and here is the portion that is perceived to be a green light for the blockade :
Whereas nothing in this resolution shall be construed as an authorization of the use of force against Iran : Now , therefore , be it Resolved by the House of Representatives ( the Senate concurring ) , That Congress– *** ( 3 ) demands that the President initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic , political , and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities by , inter alia , prohibiting the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products ; imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains , and cargo entering or departing Iran ; and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of Iran ’s nuclear program ;
If the House passes this , they a step closer to the signing statement greenlighting the next Middle East fiasco .
And only a fool would think the Bush administration would n’t jump at the opportunity .
Great work , guys .
As eyewitnesses watched in horror , a 27 - year - old Turlock man punched and stomped a toddler to death on a darkened country road Saturday night in Stanislaus County before a police officer shot and killed the attacker .
Eyewitnesses tried to stop the man , who swung and slammed the child into the asphalt behind his parked four - door Toyota pickup .
Investigators spent Father ’s Day trying to understand and cope with the savage attack on Bradbury Road , 10 miles west of Turlock near cow pastures and dairy farms .
The boy ’s beating left police and rescue workers badly shaken , said Deputy Royjindar Singh .
“ Why would somebody do this ? ” Singh said .
“ In the shadows and light it looked like he had hit an animal , ” said Dan Robinson , chief of the Crows Landing Volunteer Fire Department , who came upon the chaos driving home from a late dinner in Turlock , in an interview with the Modesto Bee .
“ As we backed up again , I could see that he had blood on his arms .
I could see that it was a small child . ”
Robinson jumped from his vehicle and confronted the man , who lunged at him .
Robinson said the man was n’t screaming and was n’t loud , but was forceful , saying “ demons ” were in the boy .
“ Give me the knife .
Give me the knife , ” the man said as he grabbed for a pen in the fireman ’s front pocket .
“ There was a total hollowness in his eyes , ” Robinson said , “ like I could see right through to the back of his head . ”
An elderly couple was first on the scene , calling 911 about 10:15 p.m. to describe the terror unfolding before their eyes .
The man ripped the child out of a car seat in the back of a pickup truck , threw him to the ground and kicked and stomped him against the pavement , witnesses told deputies .
At least three people yelled at the man and attempted to pull him off the boy , but were brushed back by the attacker .
Coroner ’s deputies believe they know the boy ’s name , but “ due to the severity of his injuries making a visual identification is nearly impossible , ” Singh said .
Seeking a connection
They were also trying to establish the connection between the attacker and the boy .
Authorities were attempting to contact family members on Sunday , but Singh said many live out of the area .
A Stanislaus County sheriff ’s helicopter flying in the area on another matter arrived about six minutes after the initial 911 call .
Officers in the helicopter could see the man beating a child on the road .
Because patrol deputies were still several minutes away , they decided to land in a field near the man ’s vehicle , Singh said .
The helicopter ’s tactical flight officer , a Modesto police officer , ran toward the suspect with his gun drawn , but he was unable to reach the roadway because of an electric and barbed wire fence , Singh said .
“ When the flight officer first contacted the suspect and tried to get him to stop , the infant was on the ground and the suspect was kicking and stomping the child , ” Singh said .
“ The officer demanded that the man stop , but he just continued his assault . ”
The officer , who has not been identified , then shot the man , who was pronounced dead at the scene .
The toddler was taken to Emanuel Medical Center in Turlock , where he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival .
“ Some of the key questions we ’re trying to answer is why this happened ? ” Singh said .
“ What was going on before the suspect left ?
Where was he going ?
Where had he been ?
What was going on in his life that day ? ”
Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson sent department employees an e-mail Sunday offering assistance to any staff member affected by the incident , Singh said .
“ It does hit home , especially for the deputies with children and those officers in the helicopter that attempted to save the boy ’s life , ” he said .
“ This is one of the more violent scenes they ’ve ever seen .
It involves a victim who is defenseless and helpless .
And it ’s Father ’s Day . ”
Nurse shaken
Nurse Isabelle Thomas , who lives a few hundred yards from the scene , was working at Emanuel Medical Center when her son called her with word something bad had happened .
Soon she heard of the little boy who died 500 yards from her front door .
“ I could n’t go to sleep , ” she said .
“ I could n’t rest without seeing it and all that blood .
I could n’t believe all that blood . ”
The most extraordinary genius in mathematics turned 80 in March , but no parties were held .
His grateful students did n’t give speeches about him .
Mathematicians did n’t convene at a grand conference in his honor .
No one even lit a candle on his birthday cake .
For more than 15 years , Alexandre Grothendieck has lived in self - imposed isolation in a tiny village in the Pyrenees .
His rages have discouraged even his most determined visitors .
Nevertheless , he continues to be one of the most revered figures in mathematics .
Grothendieck ’s work has transformed math the way the Internet has transformed communication :
Once you ’re used to it , you ca n’t imagine what life was like before it .
“ He was a master of the power of generalization , ” says Luc Illusie of Paris - Sud University in France , one of Grothendieck ’s students .
Much of Grothendieck ’s work was a kind of mathematics of mathematics called “ category theory . ”
He divined the essential properties common to many different mathematical objects , laying bare the architecture that underlay the mathematics .
The relationships between objects , he argued , were the key to the structure .
His abstractions brought concrete results .
For example , Grothendieck , together with his student Pierre Deligne and others , proved the Weil conjectures , profound theorems in algebraic geometry .
The conjectures are a much more sophisticated version of the startling observation René Descartes made in the 1600s that founded algebraic geometry .
Descartes realized that numbers , abstractions from piles of pebbles , are n’t so different from circles or ellipses , abstractions from drawings in the sand .
Equations could form a link between them , using numbers to describe curves with perfect precision .
The Weil conjectures provide a vastly more complex version of that same link .
“ He had an extraordinary sensitivity to the harmony of things , ” Illusie says .
“ It ’s not just that he introduced new techniques and proved big theorems .
He changed the very way we think about many branches of mathematics . ”
Rather than attacking a problem directly , as if pounding on a chisel to crack a nut , Grothendieck built an entire architecture of theory around the problem , so that the solution gradually became easy and natural .
He likens his approach to softening the nut in water .
“ From time to time you rub so the liquid penetrates better , and otherwise you let time pass , ” he wrote in his autobiography .
“ The shell becomes more ? exible through weeks and months — when the time is ripe , hand pressure is enough , the shell opens like a perfectly ripened avocado ! "
Grothendieck was legendary for working on mathematics almost every waking moment .
But he did have one interest besides mathematics : politics .
His pacifism grew out of his childhood experiences during World War II .
His father , Alexander Shapiro , was an anarchist who had rebelled against czarist Russia and spent about 10 years in jail .
One story says Shapiro lost an arm in a suicide attempt while trying to avoid capture .
When Hitler came to power , Grothendieck ’s parents fled from Germany and left him with foster parents .
Six years later , he joined his parent in France , but soon the entire family was arrested as “ undesirable . ”
Grothendieck and his mother were sent to an internment camp , and Grothendieck ’s father died in Auschwitz .
Grothendieck ’s dormant interest in politics rumbled to life in the late ’60s .
He was disgusted that the institute where he taught accepted money from the military .
Hoping to lead an insurrection of the researchers , he resigned over the matter , but none of his fellow mathematicians joined him .
When invited to give math talks , he often spoke about politics instead .
He visited Hanoi , Vietnam , and gave a math lecture in support of Vietnamese mathematicians .
A few years later , he left his wife and tried unsuccessfully to start a commune .
He began to have occasional rages , followed by sullen withdrawal .
He rejoined the mathematics community at a lesser university in France , without the intense collegiality he was used to , and he became disappointed with the competitiveness of his fellow mathematicians .
As his direct influence faded , many mathematicians embraced concrete mathematical questions rather than the intensely abstract approach Grothendieck had favored .
Grothendieck felt betrayed and mourned the “ burial ” of his work .
When he and a student of his won the Crafoord Prize , he refused it , citing his disappointment with standards of ethics in the math community .
After he retired , he wrote a letter to 250 people declaring them part of a group chosen by God to prepare for a “ New Age , ” which he predicted would begin on October 14 , 1996 .
Three months later , he sent a second letter , admitting with pain that he was no longer certain of that revelation .
In 1990 , he gave away or destroyed all his papers and disappeared into the Pyrenees Mountains .
For some years , no mathematicians knew where he was .
Pierre Lochak and Leila Schneps , two French algebraic geometers , heard from a former neighbor of Grothendieck that the “ crazy mathematician ” had been spotted in a nearby town .
They tracked him down and found him living alone , doing organic farming .
They maintained contact with him for several years , but now , Schneps says , “ he ’s not in a state to be visited .
It ’s not possible to not quarrel with him – or rather , for him not to quarrel with you . ”
She hesitates to call him crazy , though she admits that in a technical sense , that might be true .
“ His mental state is very , very special . ”
Grothendieck ’s neighbors keep an eye on him , thwarting his occasional urges to eat nothing but dandelion soup , for example , and keeping Schneps and Lochak informed about his welfare .
Despite this isolation , Grothendieck continues to be a powerful presence through his mathematics .
Without his advances , “ it would have been impossible to attack any of the great problems in number theory and algebraic geometry that have been solved during the last 30 years , ” Illusie says .
Among those are Fermat ’s last theorem and the Mordell conjecture .
“ He had this whole thing about being buried , but it ’s so utterly false , ” says David Mumford of Brown University .
“ We would so much like to see him and tell him how much he ’s still remembered . ”

May 10 , 2008
I ’ve posted in the past about the insanity of extending the reach of drunk driving laws in MADD ’s attempted return to the glory days of Prohibition .
See , for example , Felony Bicycle DUI , DUI on a Scooter , DUI on a Foot - High Toy Bike , DUI in a Wheelchair ? and DUI on a Horse ?.
Where are we going with all of this ?
Take a look at a fascinating semi-documentary on YouTube created by a gentleman who was arrested for drunk driving in Columbus , Ohio …for walking his bicycle .
That ’s right .
Jeff Brown was walking his bicycle — across his own front yard — when he was stopped by a police officer .
The cop began to cite him for not having a headlight on the bike , then said , “ I smell the presence of alcohol on your breath ” .
Jeff was stunned — and refused to take a breath test .
Result : convicted of drunk driving — with four days in jail , a 6 - month driver ’s license suspension and a criminal record .
So Jeff decided to appeal … and started looking into why the Ohio Legislature in 2004 had changed the drunk driving laws from driving motor vehicles to include operating such “ vehicles ” as golf carts , lawn mowers , farm tractors and bicycles – and from driving on public roads to include driving on your own private property .
He found the reasons for the new laws were based on supposed fatality figures from MADD and the federal government …. figures which are , to say the least , deceptive .
Jeff ’s film does an exceptional job of analyzing the fraudulent manipulation of these “ statistics ” .
For further information concerning the continued use of fraudulent statistics to justify the unfair DUI laws , Draconian penalties and constitutional violations , see my earlier posts : A Closer Look at DUI Fatality Statistics , Are DUI Roadblocks Effective ? and Lies , Damned Lies and MADD Statistics .

Blueprints for a sophisticated and compact nuclear warhead have been found in the computers of the world 's most notorious nuclear - smuggling racket , according to a leading US researcher .
The digital designs , found in heavily encrypted computer files in Switzerland , are believed to be in the possession of the US authorities and of the International Atomic Energy Agency , in Vienna , but investigators fear they could have been extensively copied and sold to " rogue " states via the nuclear black market .
David Albright , a physicist , former UN weapons inspector and authority on the nuclear smuggling ring run by the Pakistani metallurgist Abdul Qadeer Khan , said the " construction plans " included previously undisclosed designs for a compact warhead that could fit on Iran 's medium - range ballistic missiles .
" These advanced nuclear weapons designs may have long ago been sold off to some of the most treacherous regimes in the world , " wrote Albright .
The Khan network was exposed in 2003 , having been found to have supplied clandestine nuclear projects in Iran , North Korea , and Libya .
Albright has been investigating the network ever since .
The racketeers are known to have provided Libya with an older , cruder , bomb design .
Albright said the network might have supplied Tehran or Pyongyang with the more advanced and much more useful bomb blueprints that have now surfaced .
" They both faced struggles in building a nuclear warhead small enough to fit atop their ballistic missiles , and these designs were for a warhead that would fit , " he stated in a report to be published this week and which was leaked to the Washington Post .
" These would have been ideal for two of Khan 's other major customers , Iran and North Korea . "
The disclosures about the new weapons design arose from a Swiss investigation into engineers awaiting trial for alleged involvement in the Khan network .
The Guardian reported in May that nuclear investigators and experts were alarmed that extremely sensitive information from the Swiss computers - including warhead designs and details on making weapons - grade uranium - were circulating on the nuclear black market .
In recent months the Swiss government has secretly destroyed 30,000 files and documents from the computers of Urs Tinner , a Swiss engineer said to be heavily involved with the Khan operations and also alleged to have spied for the CIA .
Tinner has been in custody for four years awaiting trial .
His brother Marco is also in custody , while his father , Friedrich , whose relationship with Khan goes back almost 30 years , has been arrested and released .
" This was very proliferation - sensitive stuff , " said a western diplomat .
The Swiss president , Pascal Couchepin , announcing the destruction of the files last month , said : " There were detailed construction plans for nuclear weapons , for gas ultracentrifuges to enrich weapons - grade uranium as well as for guided missile delivery systems . "
Albright found the blueprints included designs for a compact warhead that could fit on Pyongyang 's medium - range Nodong rockets as well as on the Iranian Shahab - III missile .
Five years ago a boatload of uranium - enrichment equipment destined for Libya was intercepted by US and British intelligence , and Libya 's leader , Colonel Muammar Qadafy abandoned his illicit nuclear project .
That development led to the exposure of the Khan network : when CIA and MI6 agents examined the Libyan material they found designs , supplied by the Khan network , for an older , larger , and simpler nuclear bomb of Chinese vintage .
The designs were put under IAEA seal and taken to the US .
The new designs , running to hundreds of pages , were found in 2006 when the Swiss managed to break the codes on the Tinner computers .
Also that year , a German court heard testimony claiming Tinner had told investigators he had nuclear bomb construction plans at his office in eastern Switzerland .
The designs were in digital form and believed to have been copied on to the network 's computers in Dubai , which served as the hub for the Khan operations .
The testimony surfaced at the trial in Germany of Gotthard Lerch , a German engineer also alleged to have played a central role in the Khan network .
The trial was quickly halted because of procedural irregularities , but Lerch was put back on trial last week in Stuttgart and evidence from the Tinner investigation is likely to be used in the case .
The Swiss told the IAEA and the Americans about their find in 2006 .
Officials from the Vienna agency and Washington supervised the recent destruction of the Swiss files .
But an expert on the nuclear network , Mark Fitzpatrick , of the International Institute for Strategic Studies , said he was certain copies of the blueprint had been made and that no one knew where they were .
According to Albright , the advanced weapons design is similar to a Pakistani bomb design .
Khan has been under house arrest in Islamabad since " confessing " in 2004 , though there are moves to get him released .
The scientist is seen as a national hero in Pakistan .
In his first interview with the western media last month , Khan told the Guardian his confession was not genuine ; he specifically mentioned the Swiss case to emphasise how easy it would be for any country to satisfy its nuclear bomb ambitions .
International interrogation of Khan might clarify the provenance and whereabouts of the new bomb blueprint , but the Pakistanis have refused the US and the IAEA investigators access to Khan .
Reuters is moving this , sounds like it 's sourced to McCain 's travelling press secretary , Brooke Buchanan .
The campaign has yet to put anything out .
More information when it becomes available :
BAKERSFIELD , California ( Reuters ) - Republican presidential candidate John McCain , who has suffered from skin cancer in the past , had a spot removed from his face on Monday during a routine checkup by a doctor in Phoenix , an aide said .
" At this point it was just a precautionary removal , " the aide told reporters on McCain 's campaign plane .
She said the spot was covered by a bandage and was visible on his face .
McCain has had four malignant melanomas -- a potentially lethal type of skin cancer -- surgically removed since 1993 .
Three of them were limited to the top layers of the skin and were not invasive .
The fourth melanoma was invasive and was removed from his left temple in 2000 .

About a month ago the new Ubuntu 8.04 was released and I wanted a clean install .
I downloaded an image and burned it to a CD .
Just before installing , I tried “ check CD for defects ” and found a few .
Turns out ( * ) this was because of bad memory – and memtest confirmed it .
So I went to the shop , replaced the bad memory , and also bought two new sticks .
I went home to install the new Ubuntu , and after the installation , Firefox crashed .
After rebooting back to memtest , I saw this :
Back at the computer shop , they asked me to reproduce the errors .
Just firing up the computer and booting directly into memtest did n’t seem to do the trick , so I suspected that I had to overwork my computer a bit to reproduce this .
Since I was at the lab , I did n’t want to muck around too much .
So I thought , “ what ’s the quickest way to give your CPU a run around the block ? ”
That ’s right – a tight loop :
while True : pass while True : pass
However , this snippet does n’t really play with the memory .
The next simplest thing to do , that also jiggles some ram is the following ( and one of my favorites ) :
In [ 1 ] : x = 4 ** ( 4 ** 4 ) In [ 2 ] : y = 4 **x In [ 1 ] : x = 4**( 4** 4 ) In [ 2 ] : y = 4**x
I will talk about this peculiar piece of code at a later post .
In any case , this snippet also did n’t reproduce the error .
It is also quite unwieldy , as it raises a Memory Error after some time .
Later at home I tried two more scripts .
The first is a variation on the one above :
x = 4 ** ( 4 ** 4 ) while True : try : y = 4 **x except MemoryError : pass x = 4**( 4** 4 ) while True : try : y = 4 **x except MemoryError : pass
I ran a few of those in parallel .
However , my Ubuntu machine actually killed the processes running this one by one .
The second is smarter .
It allocates some memory and then just copies it around :
import sys import copy megabytes = int ( sys . argv [ 1 ] ) x1 = [ [ " a " * 1000 + str ( i ) for i in range ( 1000 ) ] for j in range ( megabytes ) ] while True : x2 = copy .
deepcopy ( x1 ) import sys import copy megabytes = int( sys.argv [ 1 ] ) x1 = [ [ " a " * 1000 + str( i ) for i in range ( 1000 ) ] for j in range ( megabytes ) ] while True : x2 = copy.deepcopy( x1 )
After both of these scripts did n’t reproduce the problem and it still persisted arbitrarily , I returned the computer to the lab .
Turns out that the two replacement sticks and the two new sticks were n’t exactly identical , and that was the cause of the problem .
So now my memory is well again .
As for the scripts above , I once wrote a similar script at work .
I was asked to help with testing some software in some stress testing .
The goal was to simulate a heavily used computer .
A few lines of Python later and the testing environment was ready .
Footnotes :
(*) – Finding out that it was a memory issue was n’t as easy as it sounds .
I did n’t think of running memtest .
I checked the image on my HD with md5 , and the hash did n’t match .
I downloaded a second image , and again the hash did n’t match .
I checked twice .
At this point I was really surprised : not only the second check did n’t match the published md5 , it also did n’t match the first check .
Some hours and plenty of voodoo later , a friend suggested running memtest , and the culprit was found .
Hey — we've moved .

Audiophile Deathmatch : Monster Cables vs. a Coat Hanger
Whether or not Monster Cables are worth it is a war that has raged since home theatre immemorial .
A poster at Audioholics was put in a room with five fellow audiophiles , and a Martin Logan SL - 3 speaker set at 75 Db at 1000 KHz playing a mix of “ smooth , trio , easy listening jazz ” that no one had heard before .
In one corner , Monster 1000 speaker cables .
In the other , four coat hangers twisted and soldered into a speaker cable .
Seven songs were played while the group was blindfolded and the cables swapped back and forth .
Not only “ after 5 tests , none could determine which was the Monster 1000 cable or the coat hanger wire , ” but no one knew a coat hanger was used in the first place .
Further , when music was played through the coat hanger wire , we were asked if what we heard sounded good to us .
All agreed that what was heard sounded excellent , however , when A - B tests occured , it was impossible to determine which sounded best the majority of the time and which wire was in use .
It ’s possible these guys were n’t super - hardcore audiophiles that might not be able to tell the difference , but it largely goes with what we ’ve found in our own tests of Monster Cable :
The lower end can perform just as well , though we do n’t really recommend re-wiring your home theatre after a firesale on wire hangers .

It ’s become fashionable for GOP surrogates to smear and try to irk Mrs. Obama , but with all the effort going in to finding mud to fling at her it ’s stunning that FOX would support such an overt , transparent lie so close on the heels of the terrorist fist jab fiasco .
Make no mistake , the network supported it as part of their ongoing hunt for ratings , which in turn determines how much you charge your advertisers .
But will SNUGGLE and other advertisers want to be affiliated with bashing married moms ?
Is that consistent with Snuggle 's cuddly - bear image : funding slanderous attack ads ?
Tell SNUGGLE what you think ; let them know you 're going to use other products if they continue to advertise on a mean network that pretends to present fair and balanced news .
Newton , Mass .
THE latest news from the Palace , that Leona Helmsley left instructions that her charitable bequest of as much as $ 8 billion be used for the care and welfare of dogs , rubs our noses in the tax deduction for charitable gifts and its common vehicle , the perpetual private foundation .
Together these provide a mechanism by which American taxpayers subsidize the whims of the rich and fulfill their fantasies of immortality .
The charitable deduction enables people to donate as much of their assets as they like for charitable purposes without paying a tax .
While some choose to contribute to broad public goals , the law does not require it .
In recent years , charitable status has been recognized for organizations with purposes as idiosyncratic as promoting excellence in quilting and educating the public about Huey military aircraft .
Indeed , Mrs. Helmsley might have limited her beneficence to the Maltese breed of dogs she favored , and that , too , would have been allowed as a “ charitable ” purpose .
If this were only a matter of Leona Helmsley wasting her own money , no one would need to care .
But she is wasting ours too .
The charitable deduction constitutes a subsidy from the federal government .
The government , in effect , makes itself a partner in every charitable bequest .
In Mrs. Helmsley ’s case , given that her fortune warranted an estate tax rate of 45 percent , her $ 8 billion donation for dogs is really a gift of $ 4.4 billion from her and $ 3.6 billion from you and me .
Two professors and a student at the University of Washington released a study today explaining " Why My Printer Received a DMCA Takedown Notice " [ PDF ] .
They argue that DMCA takedown notices , used as the principle mechanism for enforcing copyright on the Internet , should be viewed skeptically .
We could n’t agree more !
The researchers examined BitTorrent file - sharing networks using specially designed BitTorrent clients to monitor the traffic on these networks .
Even though their clients did not upload or download any files , the researchers received over 400 takedown requests accusing them of copyright infringement .
Every one of those notices was a false positive .
Their results show that " potentially any Internet user is at risk for receiving DMCA takedown notices today . ”
In fact , as the New York Times put it , " an inanimate object could also get the blame . "
Three laserjet printers used in the study were accused in takedown letters by the MPAA of downloading copies of " Iron Man ” and the latest Indiana Jones film .
Colleges and universities should pay close attention to the findings , given that students often face harsh penalties from their institutions if they are hit with a DMCA notice .
The RIAA has admitted that it bases its DMCA notices to universities and colleges solely on identifying files as " available ” for sharing even though two courts , D. Mass . [ PDF ] and D. Ariz . [ PDF ] , have confirmed that making files available , in and of itself , does not violate copyright law , and even making files available can cause no conceivable financial harm .
( The RIAA does insist that their investigators actually download files before sending prelitigation letters and filing lawsuits . )
METHANOL is nasty stuff .
Careless distillation in many a backwoods still has caused it to blind the imbibers of “ alternative ” alcoholic drinks .
Yet it has its uses , and one of them may be to restore fuel cells to their oft - vaunted role as the power packs of the future — but with a twist .
The main role that has been discussed for fuel cells over the past few decades is as replacements for the internal - combustion engine .
Their actual use may turn out to be to provide power for portable electronic devices .
A fuel cell is a device that combines hydrogen with oxygen to generate electricity .
The traditional approach has been to use the gas itself in the cell — and that is the approach taken by the world 's carmakers in their so - far not very successful attempts to make a commercial fuel - cell - driven car .
Since gaseous hydrogen is hard to store and handle , an alternative that some people have considered is to lock the hydrogen up in methanol , a liquid whose molecules are made of a carbon atom , an oxygen atom and four hydrogen atoms .
Methanol will react with water in the form of steam to make hydrogen and carbon dioxide — a process known as steam reformation .
Put a steam reformer in a car along with the fuel cell and you can fill the tank with methanol instead of hydrogen .
That idea has not gone very far , either .
But it has provoked another thought .
What if it were possible to decompose the methanol without steam , and within the fuel cell itself ?
And that has , indeed , turned out to be possible .
The resulting cells are nowhere near powerful enough to run cars , but they are plenty powerful enough to stand in for small batteries .
What is more , they last far longer than batteries and when they do need recharging , it is the work of a moment .
Proton power
In a direct - methanol fuel cell ( DMFC ) the methanol is oxidised at the anode in the presence of liquid water .
The reaction , which requires a catalyst , turns the methanol and water into protons and electrons ( in other words , dissociated hydrogen atoms ) and carbon dioxide .
While the electrons pass along an external circuit as an electric current , the protons diffuse through a membrane to the cathode , where they recombine with the incoming electrons to form hydrogen atoms that react instantly with oxygen to make water .
With pleasing symmetry the water is then channelled back to mix with the incoming methanol .
Even though DMFCs produce carbon dioxide , the amount is small enough for the cells to count as a much greener technology than batteries .
Some companies also think the new cells could be safer than batteries , which can burst into flame if short - circuited .
The efficiency of a DMFC is determined by its membrane .
One of the most commonly used sorts is made of Nafion , a polymer developed by DuPont from a variation of Teflon .
Nafion , however , can be expensive and it allows some methanol to seep through , which wastes fuel .
Researchers are therefore trying to come up with more efficient membranes — and one group , led by Paula Hammond of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) , appears to have done so .
Dr Hammond and her colleagues used a newish thin - film fabrication technique known as “ layer - by - layer ” .
This repeatedly dips a material into a solution , to build it up one layer at a time , while the properties of the liquid are gradually changed .
That enables the structure of the resulting film to be fine tuned .
When Dr Hammond coated a Nafion membrane in this way it became less permeable to methanol but kept its ability to transport protons .
The effect , which the group reported in a recent issue of Advanced Materials , was to boost the cell 's electrical output by more than 50 % .
The next stage , which the team has now embarked on , is to build complete membranes rather than mere coatings .
The researchers think these may be able to work as proton - exchange membranes in their own right .
Squeeze me , please me
Toshiba , a large Japanese electronics firm , reckons that DMFCs can be used to produce mobile devices that have no need for batteries at all .
In its latest investment plan , it says it will begin making such cells within a year for mobile phones and laptops .
Sharp , one of its rivals , recently said that it had developed new microfabrication techniques to build DMFCs with the highest power densities yet achieved .
Sharp reckons this will enable it to produce cells that are the same size as the lithium - ion batteries used in mobile devices , but which can run those devices for much longer .
Some in the industry talk of mobile phones capable of operating continuously for several weeks before their fuel cells need topping up .
The most likely way that topping up will be done is with a cartridge of methanol that is inserted into the device and replaced when it is running low .
As portable devices become more sophisticated , with added functions and large colour screens , they are draining batteries faster .
MTI Micro , an American company , has put its version of a DMFC into satellite - navigation devices , which are often used for long periods .
The company says it can run even a power - hungry model for up to 60 hours before the gadget needs refuelling .
Longer life is a big appeal ; some people would like to run their laptops continuously on a 12 - hour flight .
Hence , new rules are being drawn up for aircraft .
America 's Department of Transportation is planning a rule change from October 1st to allow passengers and crew to bring fuel - cell - powered electronic devices and one or two fuel cartridges on board in their carry - on baggage .
To qualify , the devices will have to meet certain safety standards .
It is proposed that each passenger would be limited to about 200 ml of fuel .
Successful work like that at MIT will help to make DMFCs cheaper and more efficient , which will , in turn , make them even more attractive as power sources for portable devices .
Already , some companies are predicting that sales of refuelling cartridges could run into the billions within a few years of them coming into the market .
Forget , then , the familiar cry : “ Has anyone got a charger I can borrow ? ”
It will be replaced by : “ Can you spare me a squirt of methanol ? ” — and that wo n't mean in your hooch .
Fresh off what many feel to be a major success with its first - ever show on July 19 dubbed , " Banned , " Affliction MMA will go for an encore in the backyard of the promotion that " banned " it in the first place .
Indeed , Affliction has its sights set on Las Vegas , Nevada , on October 11 for its next show , according to Yahoo !Sports.com .
And anyone who 's anyone knows that " Sin City " is UFC turf -- the organization that forbid its fighters to don the clothing company 's apparel at its events .
But who really cares about that because the same report confirms that former UFC champion Andrei Arlovski will challenge the last man to hold the Pride FC heavyweight strap , Fedor Emelianenko , likely for the Russian 's newly - won heavyweight WAMMA title in the main event of the evening .
It 's a dream match that most fans have fantasized about for years .
And perhaps the only thing that can top that news is what ace the UFC pulls from its sleeve to once again counter this latest bold move .
Perhaps it once again includes UFC Middleweight Champion , Anderson Silva .
This is getting good .
Real good .

Should Links Open In New Windows ?

No , they should n’t .
At first glance the decision to open links in new windows or not depends on the given site and the preferences of its visitors .
Visitors to the sites with heavy linking are more willing to have links opened in new windows then open dozens of links in new windows manually .
Visitors of less - heavy - linkage - sites are more likely to open some particular link in new window to remain on the site and continue to browse through it afterward .
However , this is not true .
Users also do n’t like to deal with dozens of opened tabs and some visitors tend to become quickly angry with the disabled back button .
Furthermore , some visitors may not even realize that a new window was opened and hit the back - button mercilessly — without any result .
That ’s not user - friendly , and that ’s not a good user experience we , web designers , strive for .
Place users in control
From the usability point of view the decision to enforce opening links in new windows violates one of the fundamental principles of the user interface design : users should always be in control of the interface they are interacting with .
Leading user interface and usability researchers such as
Ben Shneiderman ( 8 Golden Rules of Interface Design ) ,
Theo Mandel ( User Interface Design Principles )
Bruce Tognazzini ( First Principles of Interaction Design )
claim that a user - friendly and effective user interface places users in control of the application they are using .
Users need to be able to rely on consistency of the user interface and know that they wo n’t be distracted or disrupted during the interaction .
Users must know , understand and anticipate what is going on and what will happen once user interface elements are used .
Any deviations from this convention result in a more design - oriented and less user - oriented design .
As Shneiderman claims , experienced users strongly desire the sense that they are in charge of the system and that the system responds to their actions .
As designers , it is our duty to design the system to make users the initiators of actions rather than the responders .
Designers are tempted to enforce users to actually use the interface or browse through the site they have created .
Although the rationale behind stems from some clear commercial objectives and therefore often preferred by project managers , it is the designer ’s duty to make clear to managers that users do not care .
In fact , developers often tend to forget a simple , almost elementary fact : if users want to close the application or leave a site , they will — does n’t matter which obstacles are placed on their path to the exit - button .
The more obstacles there are the more negative the user experience will be .
As designers , it is our decision to provide users with a clear , unambiguous choice , but we have no right to decide for users which choice they make .
Since users need to be placed in control of the interface they are interacting with , it is wrong to make decisions for them as designer ’s decisions do n’t necessarily match users ’ decisions .
The main problem with enforcing links to open in new windows is that this decision overrules user ’s decision to control the view in their browser .
Since large websites ( Google , Amazon , AOL , Yahoo & Co. ) open links in the same window ( unless it is explicitly stated that links are opened in new windows ) , users tend to assume that the link on an unknown page will be opened in the same window .
So users expect the link to be opened in the same window .
Let us now consider the following two situations where a user does n’t know upfront if the site opens links in new windows or the same window :
user wants to open link in a new window , but the site opens links in the same window , user wants to open link in the same window , but the site opens links in new windows .
In the first situation users can choose to open a link in the new window using context - menu or shortcuts described in the next sections of this article .
In this situation , users are the initiators of actions as they decide how the linked page should be displayed .
Here site ’s behavior meets user ’s expectations resulting in a good user experience .
In the second situation users would simply click on the link and suddenly find out that the link is opened in a new window .
In this situation users are the responders of actions as they need to react in the way how the linked page is displayed — for instance close the windows that was opened automatically .
Furthermore , here site ’s behavior does n’t meet user ’s expectations resulting in a bad user experience .
Users find it annoying when the site does something without asking them to do so .
If users want to open new windows let them do so and do n’t indulge their intelligence by making the decision for them otherwise .
Do n’t force a new window upon users unless there ’s a excellent reason to do so .
Every rule has an exception
Of course , there are exceptions : in some situations it is right to open links in new windows and wrong to open links in the same windows .
Jakob Nielsen suggests to use new windows in case the linked document is not a .html - document .
In this case , he recommends using a pop-up windows without browser control toolbar .
In such case it is reasonable to let the user know upfront how the links will be opened .
A small warning icon usually suffices .
However , you need to make sure that the link is unlikely to be misunderstood .
After all , it is a common practice to use icons to inform the visitors that links lead to external websites .
An additional or similar icon may produce irritation .
Small usability tests may be helpful and necessary in this situation .
Telepolis lets its visitors know that a link leads to the external page .
However , the icon used may be misunderstood as it can also symbolize opening links in new windows .
It is appropriate to enforce opening links in a new window in case
the link provides assistance or help .
If you are on a shopping cart page , and users click on a “ help ” link .
In that case , users do n’t want to navigate away from the cart page , so a new window is acceptable .
In such cases dynamic tooltips are usually better than pop-ups that are again better than opening new windows .
or help .

In such cases dynamic tooltips are usually better than pop-ups that are again better than opening new windows .
the link may interrupt an ongoing process .
For instance , if users are filling a web - form and the form provides the link to terms of service or privacy policy below the form it is reasonable to enforce this link to open in a new window to not interrupt the ongoing process .
This is important in sign - up forms and crucial in checkout - forms .
Otherwise , users may lose the information they ’ve already typed in and close the browser window in response .

Warn users in advance that a new window will appear .
When using PC - native file formats such as PDF or spreadsheets , users feel like they ’re interacting with a PC application .
Because users are no longer browsing a website , they should n’t be given a browser UI .
Best of all , prevent the browser from opening the document in the first place .

the link leads to a large image which takes time to load .
Opening this image in a new window allows user to focus on your content while the image is being loaded in the background .
Forgive them , for they do n’t know what they do
Unfortunately , we were n’t able to find any recent research findings that would provide us with a better understanding of how users open links if they want to open them in new tabs or windows .
However , it is likely to assume that most users do n’t know shortcuts and prefer more intuitive straight solutions .
More experienced users are more likely to use shortcuts that are described below as well .
There are three reasonable ways for opening links in new windows .
Most users use the first option — not because it is the most efficient one , but because it is the most obvious one .
These options are implemented in all modern browsers ; older browsers may have problems with the second and third options , though .
visitors use the context - menu : users click with the right mouse on the link and select the option “ Open link in a new tab / window ” .
If the link is opened in a new tab , the active window remains the same as it was before the click .
If the link is opened in a new window , new window appears , and the new window becomes the active window .
visitors use the Ctrl+click - shortcut : users press the Ctrl+key and click with the left mouse button on the link .
The link is automatically opened in a new tab .
The active window remains the same as it was before the click .
This shortcut can vary depending on the operating system and the browser implementation .
visitors use the middle - click : users point the mouse pointer to the link and press the middle - click of the mouse .
The link is automatically opened in a new tab .
The active window remains the same as it was before the click .
The first option is definitely the most ineffective yet most popular one .
It requires more clicks and more concentration , therefore more time and more cognitive load on the user .
The third one is the quickest one as users do n’t need to permanently switch between the context - menu and the page itself .
Most users seem to use the context - menu to open links in new tabs or windows .
Image source .
The main irritation from the users ’ side comes from the fact that most users know only the first option .
Consequently , if they want to open links in new windows they need to use the context - menu , with multiple clicks , switching the view back and forth again and again .
That ’s stressful and unpleasant .
Still , opening links in the same window ( by default ) is the lesser of two evils .
And if users do n’t know how to do it quickly , tell them explicitly — they will be grateful for your help .
But I can force visitors to stay on my site , right ?
No .
Even if you enforce the external links to open in new windows users will find their way around to open the link on the same page if they want to :
users can copy the link , paste it in the address bar and hit the return button ; the link will be opened in the same window .
users can drag the link to the address bar ; the link will be opened in the same window .
Unfortunately , not every single browser allows users to do that .
However , modern browsers have this functionality implemented since years .
If users do n’t want a link to open in a new window , they ’ll try to find the way to circumvent designer ’s decision .
Firefox enables its users to decide how the links designer has chosen to open in new windows should be opened .
Therefore , from the designer ’s perspective , it is better to provide users with a clear and clean way to do so respecting their interests and not neglecting their time .
If you want your visitors to come back , assist them , guide them , help them , but never impose on their patience and willingness to browse on your site .
Optimal solution
In our opinion the most effective and user - friendly solution is to allow users to select how the links should be opened .
However , they do n’t have to do that via their browser .
Designers can provide users with a small check - box that “ decides ” how the links should be opened .
You need to make sure that the checkbox is visible and users understand what it is good for .
This can be done via JavaScript .
Once the box is checked all links will be opened in a new tab / window .
Just check the box yourself and try it out :
Open external links in a new tab ?
Source code for the check - box :
< form > < input type=" checkbox " onclick =" linkopener ( this.checked ) " id =" linksnewwin " >
Open external links in a new tab ? </ form >
Source code for the JavaScript ( you ’ll need to replace domain.com with your web - site ’s URL ; thus the browser will be able to distinguish between internal and external links ) :
< script language= " javascript " > function linkopener ( a ) { var b = a ?
" _blank " : " _self " ; var c = document .
links ; for ( var i=0 ; i < c.length ; i++) { if ( c[i].href.search ( " domain.com " ) == - 1 ) c[i ] .
target = b ; } } </script >
This JavaScript does n’t use cookies so if users browse from one side to another their preference wo n’t be stored .
If you ’d like the checkbox to work throughout your site you ’ll have to consider using cookies to store users ’ preferences .
Bottom line
It is important that users are placed in control of the user interface they are using .
Since users expect the link to be opened in the same window , set your links to open in the same window .
Do n’t force a new window upon users unless there ’s a very good reason to do so .
For the latter purpose , consider opening links in new windows if the link provides assistance or help , if it may interrupt an ongoing process or it leads to a non - html - document .
Allow users to select how the links should be opened on a given web - site .
Opening links in the same windows the lesser of two evils .
And if users do n’t know how to do it quickly , tell them explicitly — they will be grateful for your help .

Barack Obama made a fairly routine appearance on ABC ’s Nightline last night .
All the usual issues were addressed except that Obama directly addressed Clinton lackey James Carville ’s remark in the latest issue of Newsweek that , “ If she ( Clinton ) gave him one of her cojones , they ’d both have two . ”
On Nightline Obama fired back , “ Well , you know , James Carville is well - known for spouting off his mouth without always knowing what he ’s talking about , and I intend to stay focused on fighting for the American people because what they do n’t need is 20 more years of performance art on television .
And that ’s what James Carville and a lot of those folks are expert at … a lot of talk and not getting things done for the American people . ”
He ’s right Carville is a believer in the philosophy that perception is action .
In other words , as long as it looks like a politician is doing something that is good enough .
These questions about Obama ’s toughness another way of labeling him as a weak liberal , this is exactly what the GOP plans on doing this fall .

Many have complained that Clinton is taking plays straight from the Republican playbook , but in many ways , she is doing Obama a huge favor .
By dealing with these tactics now , Obama will be ready for the same attacks when McCain and the Republicans bring them in the fall .
This whole question of toughness is a silly distraction anyway .
No candidate can be a serious contender for the presidency without being tough .
The real question is n’t toughness , but how a candidate responds to adversity .
When Clinton faced adversity , her campaign completely imploded .
McCain won the Republican nomination by default this year , but if we look back to 2000 , when McCain was challenging George W. Bush , when things got tough , he wilted and faded away .
Obama keeps impressing by the way he bounces back , I think this , not toughness , is the true measure of presidential timber .

Mr Berlusconi says he is the target of a politically motivated judiciary Italy 's lower house of parliament has voted to pass a controversial immunity bill put forward by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi 's government .
The amendment protects top public officials , including the prime minister and president , from prosecution .
The bill is expected to be passed by the upper house , where Mr Berlusconi enjoys a solid majority , in September .
Critics have labelled the change a made - to - measure piece of legislation to protect the 71 - year - old billionaire .
Mr Berlusconi - who was not present in parliament when the bill was passed - currently faces a corruption case involving one of his lawyers , David Mills , the former husband of a British cabinet minister .
' Rough and ready '
He also faces prosecution in Rome for alleged collusion between his Mediaset network and state broadcaster , Rai .
Opposition leader Walter Veltroni said the law was : " Objectively speaking , a law for a single person " .
Mr Berlusconi has long claimed that the country 's judiciary is politically motivated and is running a campaign against him .
He claims that he has attended 2,500 court hearings , had 587 police visits and spent some 174m euros ( £ 135 m ; $ 271 m ) in legal fees since entering the political scene 14 years ago .
Former prime minister and opposition lawmaker Massimo D'Alema urged the prime minister to " hold his head high and face these judgements " .
" This law is a rough and ready measure to block the corruption trial which the president is involved in and perhaps prevent another , " he added , according to Italy 's Corriere della Sera newspaper .
Strike threat But Italy 's Justice Minister Angelino Alfano defended the bill , which was passed by 309 votes to 236 , with 30 abstentions .
" Having brilliantly won the elections , Silvio Berlusconi deserves to be able to calmly govern this government .
And this country needs to be governed , " he said , according to the paper .
Another bill reforming the justice system , which would freeze all trials for alleged crimes committed before 2002 , is currently making its way through parliament .
Mr Berlusconi's government say it is a necessary step to speeding up the country 's notoriously sluggish legal system but his critics have branded it yet another tailor - made law .
Judges have condemned his various changes to the legal system and have threatened to go on strike .

So Why Is Bush Sending in 30,000 Replacement Troops ?
Jon Ponder Byon 7/7/2008 , 2:06 pm PT
Guest blogged by Jon Ponder , Pensito Review .
Last week , Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki declared that his government has defeated terrorism in Iraq .
" They were intending to besiege Baghdad and control it .
But , thanks to the will of the tribes , security forces , army and all Iraqis , we defeated them , " al - Maliki declared , referring to recent government operations against Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias .
Violence in Iraq is said to be at its lowest level in four years , a factor that is attributed to the surge of U.S. forces into the country .
So if the surge has been so successful , can we bring U.S. troops out of Iraq and leave internal security to al - Maliki and the Iraqi military ?
Of course not .
We 're sending more troops to Iraq .
Late in June , the Pentagon was reported to be preparing to send 30,000 replacement troops into Iraq in about six months in order to maintain 15 brigades in country .
What this means is that the surge is a success only in the sense that flooding the zone with security has tamped down violence and --- here is the real point --- neutralized Iraq as a domestic political issue in the presidential campaign .
Underlying the " success , " however , the morass of internecine religious conflicts , intrigue and power struggles is far from resolved and will undoubtedly raise its ugly head again when U.S. troops come out , if they ever do .
Bruce Schneier and the King of the Crabs
ORAL HISTORY INTERVIEW WITH SAMUEL BRONKOWSKI AT HIS HOME IN TUCSON RESERVATION , BY GALEN PARR 5.1 , DATED JUNE 17 , 2078
SB : This one 's called , " Bruce Schneier and the King of the Crabs . "
It mostly must have really happened , too - it 's how we lost Barbados , or Bermuda , or some island down there anyway .
GP : I do n't believe we have that one on file .
But it would probably be Barbados , because that 's still a restricted zone .
I do n't know why .
I thought it was nuclear , though .
SB : Well , may well be I can shed some light on that .
I personally do n't think this actually happened to Bruce Schneier , but that 's the way it was told to me , and it 's still worth telling .
Story goes , ol ' Bruce Schneier was vacationing on Barbados with his dog once .
And they'd go out walking on the beach , as men and dogs often do .
Well , that dog was some digging kind of a dog , a terrier maybe , and so it had a great old time , running up and down the beach , and digging up the crabs , and old Bruce Schneier would just laugh and laugh , ' cause the dog had so much fun with it and he loved his dog .
So this happened the same way every day for a couple of days , and some days the dog'd find a crab , and some days it would n't .
But every time it dug one up , it 'd bark and jump and carry on , because that crab would just scuttle back and forth all prickly , and the dog had never seen live seafood before , being a northern dog .
And Bruce Schneier , he'd just laugh and plot out how the crab could come up with a better security regimen to prevent the dog from finding its way to the crab in the first place .
So everybody was happy , ' cept the crabs .
But one day , instead of barking and having fun after it found a crab , the dog yelped and cringed back .
Bruce was kind of surprised , because that crab looked just like all the others , and they had n't managed to hurt the dog .
So naturally , being the inquisitive kind of guy he was , he took a closer look .
That crab was holding a sharpened stick in its claw , and it had jabbed his dog in the nose !
Amazed , he whipped his cell phone out , to take a picture , but those crabs are quick , and lickety - split , it had dropped its stick , and was gone into the surf , never to be seen again .
Old Bruce stepped over to the hole , and picked up the stick , and he had to be amazed again -- because it was n't a stick , it was a sword , and its hilt was formed to the crab 's claw !
Sticking that sword into his pocket , Bruce Schneier walked back to his beachfront hotel , and deep in thought , sat down to a fine midday meal to ponder about the matter .
Now , any normal man would simply have said , " Huh , a crab with a sword , how about that ? " and maybe used it to win a bar bet .
But not ol ' Bruce Schneier .
No , he realized that tool use in a new species was a security threat to human dominance of the planet , and he was bound and determined to find out how serious that threat was .
Reasoning that metalworking must imply an industrial capability , and knowing that fire would be impossible underwater , but figuring that beach crabs can't travel far from salt water due to their breathing through gills , he deduced that there must be at least one very small forge somewhere along the coastal strip of the island .
He considered the possibility that the land crabs were working metal , and simply trading with the coastal crabs , but discounted this theory initially , on the grounds that two species ascending at the same time would be improbable .
So his task was obvious .
He simply had to find a crab hole along the coast with smoke coming out of it .
But an initial survey after lunch quickly showed him that an exhaustive search would be impractical ; even a small island like Barbados has miles of coastline , and crab holes are very small .
Any normal mortal would have to admit defeat in a situation like that -- but this was Bruce Schneier .
He just transformed the problem into a one - way cipher , and decrypted it on his wristwatch !
And as luck would have it , the exact location of the closest smoker was not too far off , so he ran up the beach to the street , hailed a cab , and was there in minutes .
Sure enough , as he walked down towards the beach , he could see a good - sized hole in the bank , maybe four inches across , and above it was a little chimney made of pebbles and beach glass , smoking away like you never saw .
Looking around , he saw they were well out of town , so it was quite possible that nobody'd even noticed this very small column of smoke yet .
Well , I can tell you !
Bruce and his dog were thoroughly on their guard now , so they took things good and slow , but as anybody who 's ever been to a beach knows , you just can't sneak up on crabs .
And so as softly as the two crept up on that hole , they heard a metallic scrape behind them -- and turning around , they saw that the way back had been blocked by a swarm of armed crabs !
Undaunted , the two mammals continued to approach the hole , and just as they got there , this colossal crab comes out of the hole , and starts chittering away at Bruce 's dog .
Well , of course , this being a communication difficulty , it was no great problem for Bruce Schneier .
Of course , it was beyond even his ability to decrypt the king crab 's language on his wristwatch , but fortunately , he was also carrying his phone .
And so it was n't long before he could chat away with the king of the crabs !
Well , the king was mighty surprised to hear that it was the man who was the smart one .
The crabs had always assumed that as four - legged animals -- that is , half a crab -- dogs must be smarter than humans -- who , with only two legs , were only a quarter of a crab .
Bruce , nonplussed at the king 's use of the word " always " , even though clearly it was not the case that the crabs of Barbados had always had the knack of working metal , asked that king right out , just how long their history had extended .
Turns out the answer was eight days !
Eight days before , the crabs had gained intelligence , and they were already working metal !
Bruce knew that this did n't bode well for good old Homo sap .
All he could figure is that these crabs had been infected by some kind of intelligence - improvement nano or something , although he surely did n't know exactly how that might have happened .
He tried to draw the king out a little on that matter , but his royal highness was having nothing of it -- he said he was sorry to be so rude , but there were preparations for war to be made , as their territory was under attack by the monkey nation up the coast , and as he himself was the kingdom 's first and best blacksmith , his time was desperately needed elsewhere .
" Ah , " said Bruce , before he rightly thought it through .
" Seems some firearms would be more useful than these little swords of yours . "
The king , who was already turning away , froze in his tracks .
He did n't have to turn back , because the eyes of crabs already look in all directions , but Bruce could tell -- he had gotten the renewed and full attention of his royal highness .
And he winced mightily , because that was the one and only time in his life that Bruce Schneier had made a security - related mistake .
In his defense , of course , withholding the knowledge of firearms from the crabs would simply have been security through obscurity .
But it was too late for philosophy .
The cat was out of the bag .
Thinking quickly , Bruce turned on his heel and ran for it , his dog following .
Crabs are fast , but they do n't naturally go away from the surf , and so it took the crab army a little while to realize which direction their quarry was escaping in , and with eight legs , when crabs mill around in confusion , there 's a whole lot of milling involved .
Fortunately , that delay was enough , and Bruce made it to safety , and a short cab ride later , he was back in town , and wondering what to do next .
He thought about calling Chuck Norris , but realized it would take even Chuck a day or two to get to Barbados , and if the crabs had only taken eight days to learn metalworking , a day or two was probably too long .
So that was out .
So he sat down to a fine supper to ponder this new development , and come up with a suitable plan .
But while he was still pondering , he heard the unmistakeable rattle of small - arms fire from the street .
Cautiously , he examined the situation outside , and it was then that he realized it was simply too late , because there was house - to - house fighting between monkeys and crabs right there in town .
A single slip of the lips had precipitated an arms race of inhuman rapidity in the ascended species .
As he watched , both sides were retooling their weapons for greater efficiency and killing power on the fly , responding , no doubt , to distributed command networks .
It was clear that both sides were bootstrapping up towards the Singularity right then and there , and there was nothing anybody could do about it .
Well , Bruce Schneier knows a threat when he sees one , and so he and his dog organized the evacuation of the island 's human population , because that was the only real solution .
I 've been told that Bruce himself was the last man off the island , and he himself was rescued by Cory Doctorow in a hot - air balloon , but I do n't believe a word of that .
Everybody knows hot - air balloons can't be steered .
Aboriginal men from across Australia have made a collective apology to women for past violence and abuse .
Male leaders from Central Australia were joined by others from the Top End , Cape York , New South Wales and Western Australia .
They have spent the last three days at a camp site near Alice Springs discussing ways to be better male role models .
The conference was called in response to the federal intervention , which the men say has painted them as rapists , child abusers and wife beaters .
But while their main catch - cry was " All men are not bastards " , the men also say they need to take responsibility for the violence towards women and children .
The men gave politicians and those in charge of the intervention a list of recommendations to improve male health and welfare in communities .
Justice report faults illegal use of politics in hiring federal prosecutors , judges RAW STORY
Published : Monday July 28 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : Conyers mulling perjury charges A new Justice Department report concludes that politics illegally influenced the hiring of career prosecutors and immigration judges , and largely lays the blame on top aides to former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales .
Monday 's report singles out the department 's former White House liaison , Monica Goodling , for violating federal law and Justice Department policy by discriminating against job applicants who were n't Republican or conservative loyalists .
The full 146 - page Justice Department report is available here ( .pdf )
It is not improper to consider political or ideological affiliations in making hiring decisions for political positions .
However , both Department policy and federal law prohibit discrimination in hiring for career positions on the basis of political affiliations .
Our investigation found that Goodling improperly subjected candidates for certain career positions to the same politically based evaluation she used on candidates for political positions , in violation of federal law and Department policy .
The report does not indicate whether Goodling or former Gonzales chief of staff Kyle Sampson could face any charges .
None of those involved in the discriminatory hiring still work at Justice , meaning they will avoid any department penalties .
House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers said he is debating whether to file perjury charges against the reports ' implicated officials , who may have lied to Congress during investigations of the Justice Department 's politicization .
" Today 's report describes systematic violations of federal law by several former leaders of the Department of Justice , " Conyers said in a news release .
" Apparently , the political screening was so pervasive that even qualified Republican applicants were rejected from Department positions because they were not Republican enough for Monica Goodling and others .
The report also makes clear that the cost to our nation of these apparent crimes was severe , as qualified individuals were rejected for key positions in the fight against terrorism and other critical Department jobs for no reason other than political whim .
The Report also indicates that Monica Goodling , Kyle Sampson , and Alberto Gonzales may have lied to the Congress about these matters .
I have directed my staff to closely review this matter and to consider whether a criminal referral for perjury is needed . "
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy used the report to slam the White House .
" Rather than strengthening our national security , the Department of Justice appears to have bent to the political will of the administration , " the Vermont Democrat said in a release sent to reporters Monday morning .
" Further , the report reveals that the principal source for politically vetted candidates considered for important positions as immigration judges was the White House a clear indication of the untoward political influence of the Bush administration on traditionally non-political appointments . "
Justice investigators said that Goodling , at least , may lose her license to practice law as a result of the findings .
The report said Gonzales was largely unaware of the hiring decisions by two of his most trusted aides .
It also said his aides ' decisions weeded out Democrats and that Goodling also rejected at least one job applicant who was a lesbian .
Leahy accused the political influence of stretching higher into the administration and he suggested top officials were simply trying to pin the blame on underlings .
" Like some in the administration who would place blame for the actions at Abu Ghraib solely onto the shoulders of a few bad apples , the Attorney General has tried to dismiss the Inspector Generals first report on politicization issued last month as documenting the actions of just a few bad apples , " Leahy said .
" But it was obvious from that first report , and becomes more so with this second joint IG / OPR report , that the problems of politicization at the Department are rooted deeper than that .
In this report , we once again see that the Bush administration has allowed politics to affect and infect the nations chief law enforcement agencys priorities . "
The report marks the culmination of a yearlong investigation by Justice 's Office of Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility into whether Republican politics were driving hiring polices at the nation 's premier law enforcement agency that is expected to be above partisan politics .
The department 's inspector general is scheduled to testify to the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday .
The investigation is one of several that examine accusations of White House political meddling within the Justice Department .
Those accusations were initially driven by the firings of nine U.S. attorneys in late 2006 and culminated with Gonzales ' resignation under fire as attorney general last September .
The man who replaced Gonzales , Attorney General Michael Mukasey , said he is " of course disturbed " by the findings .
" I have said many times , both to members of the public and to department employees , it is neither permissible nor acceptable to consider political affiliations in the hiring of career department employees , " Mukasey said in a statement shortly after the report was released Monday morning .
" And I have acted , and will continue to act , to ensure that my words are translated into reality so that the conduct described in this report does not occur again at the department . "
With wire reports
PHILADELPHIA , July 28 ( Reuters ) -
One in four U.S. bridges needs to be repaired or replaced but funding is inadequate to meet the steadily rising price tag , state highway officials said on Monday .
Nearly a year after a bridge collapse in Minneapolis killed 13 people and renewed fears about the safety of U.S. roadways , the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials released a report saying at least $ 140 billion was needed to shore up 152,000 of the nation ’s 590,000 bridges .
“ Usually built to last 50 years , the average bridge in this country today is 43 years old and nearing the need for replacement , ” the group said at its meeting in Philadelphia .
“ Almost one in four bridges , while safe to travel , is either structurally deficient , in need of repair , or functionally obsolete , which means they are too narrow for today ’s traffic volumes , ” said the report , “ Bridging the Gap . ”
Costs for asphalt , steel , concrete and other materials have soared by some 50 percent the past few years , forcing many states to postpone bridge projects .
The report suggested increasing gas taxes and enacting new taxes on alternative fuels , turning free highways into toll roads and increasing private investment .
So far , regular inspections appear to have staved off most unexpected bridge collapses , the report said .
The National Transportation Safety Board has attributed 47 deaths over the past 20 years to bridge failures .

After a close examination it does say percent of congested links ( out of several thousand ) but the critical threshold would probably be around 10 % .
Taking the highest percent before DPI which is 6.6 % , that 's still not high and if it's that bad it would not have been that expensive to upgrade those links .

From what I read Bell basically shows that their current capacity is nearly 5X the current demand and they are expanding their capacity .
I understand peak vs off times , but I am not buying their arguments .

All of the percentages are lower !
I 'd hate to see what they would claim if the percentages actually went up slightly !
Now we need a class action lawsuit against Bell for their illegal practices .
Then institute a regulatory committee to oversee the industry to ensure these kinds of things do n't happen again .
Then the CRTC should split Bell into two separate companies , one for the hardware , and one for the services , that way the " last mile " is out of their hands , since they 've proven they can't be trusted with it .
Failing that , all of the small ISPs should band together and get a large backer to bring fibre lines to Canada and watch Bell and Rogers play catch up .
We 've been shafted for far too long by this duopoly !

I thought I read that the newer models can handle as much as 750 Mbps but Bell has also installed several in each city .

here are the utilization limits for congested as per Bell Canada :
DS - 3 61 % , OC - 3 84 % , OC - 12 and OC - 48 90 % .
so , for one of those links to be considered " congested " and added to that low % graph the following has to occur ( using DS - 3 links as an example ) .
Over a 14 day period , utilization measurements are taken every 15 minutes .
( snap shot of usage at that time ) .
the limit of 61 % must be exceeded atleast ONCE on 5 seperate days over that 14 day period .
what that means is that for the total UP TIME of a link over that 14 days ( in minutes ) is 20,160 minutes ( 24hrs x 60 min x 14 days ) .
The link must only be above 61 % for a TOTAL 75 of those minutes to be considered " congested " , or 0.37 % of it 's available time .
Lets also not forget that there could be a sudden spike of usage right at that 15 minute mark and then die down , but i'll assume the entire 15 minute interval is at that level for simplicity , lol .
UHMM ... OK .
not to mention the CRITERIA for getting ito that count of " congested links " .

Member I love the last graph that shows " cell loss " !
That 's not caused by congestion , it 's their DPI boxes that are dropping packets !

Just realised ...
How can they put a " total " to those values ...
They do n't relate ...
They all have different thresholds and mechanisms to deal with packet - loss or load .
They 'd need to talk on a case by case , not on a global ...
Some of this is on a customer to customer issue other portions are on a more aggregated level ....

Just what do they mean by the Backbone percentages ?
Are they referring to the internet backbone uplinks ?
If so these would n't even apply to wholesaler AGAS .

They 're referring to the links in their backbone aggregation network .
( i.e. the network where the BAS links terminate and connects to ISPs )
European researchers are developing a software that will give robots the power to learn when a person is sad , happy or angry .
The Feelix Growing project is putting together simple robots that can detect different parameters - facial expressions , voice and proximity - to determine emotional states .
The aim of the project is to develop a robot that can serve humans with special needs , such as the ill and the elderly .
Using adaptable neural networks , the robot can learn the correct way to respond to people 's emotions from experience .
Advertisement
For instance , if someone shows fear , the robot can learn to change its behavior to appear less threatening .
If someone seems happy , the robot can make a mental ( or , I guess , digital ) note of what brought on that response .
And if someone seems upset and lonely , the robot can give her a pat on the back , offer her a stiff drink and say " Elaine , you deserved someone better than that dickwad anyhow . "
I , for one , welcome our new emotionally adept overlords .

Weeks ago , I was working on my open source project AjTalk , an Smalltalk - like interpreter , written in .NET ( using C# ) , and now , I want to present the status of that work .
For years , I was interested in Smalltalk development , altought only in my free time , never as a professional developer .
It ’s not the first time I wrote such kind of interpreter ( my first one was written in the eighties , and it was very simple : no garbage collector , only text commands ) , but this time I feel it could become a very complete implementation .
Current version is minimal , but it is taken form .
The idea is to have dynamic objects , like in Smalltalk , and , at some point , add prototypes a la Self .
The objects and the interpreter would access full .
NET framework and other libraries , as I did in my AjBasic interpreter ( included as part of AjGenesis code generation project ) .
The very initial version is now published at Google Code :
http://code.google.com/p/ajtalk/
The solution
I ’m using Professional VS 2005 .
There are four projects in the solution .
AjTalk is the main project , a class library containing the core of the system .
AjTalk .
Test01 and AjTalk .
Test02 are console applications , only for manual tests .
AjTalk .
Tests contains the unit tests , written using NUnit framework 2.2.8 .
Most of the core system consists of interfaces , defining the base behaviors , and classes , implementing such interfaces .
The object
The base is to have an interface to represent any object :
using System ; namespace AjTalk { public interface IObject { IClass Class { get ; } object this [ int n ] { get ; set ;} object SendMessage ( string msgname , object [ ] args ) ; } }
I could make a message an object ( of type Message ) , but for now , the message is only a name , and an array of arguments .
The index this [int n ] access the intance variables .
Each value in AjTalk can point to any .NET object , not only the ones that implements IObject .
In this way , I can manage int , long , String , DataSet , from other IObject objects .
The class
I ’m implementing a simple IClass interface , without distinguing between class , behaviours , and other classes , as in the classic Smalltalk .
I ’ll separate these classes in a future version .
For now , I ’m managing only a interface :
using System ; using System .
Collections ; using System .
Collections .
Generic ; namespace AjTalk { public interface IClass : IObject { IClass SuperClass { get ; } string Name { get ; } void DefineClassMethod ( IMethod method ) ; void DefineInstanceMethod ( IMethod method ) ; void DefineClassVariable ( string varname ) ; void DefineInstanceVariable ( string varname ) ; IObject NewObject ( ) ; IMethod GetClassMethod ( string mthname ) ; IMethod GetInstanceMethod ( string mthname ) ; int GetClassVariableOffset ( string varname ) ; int GetInstanceVariableOffset ( string varname ) ; } }
There is a dictionary of class and instance methods , and lists of class and instance variable names .
It does n’t have support for indexed variables , yet .
IClass interface is now implemented in a BaseClass class .
The method
There is an interface implemented in Method class :
using System ; namespace AjTalk { public interface IMethod { string Name { get ; } IClass Class { get ; } object Execute ( IObject receiver , object [ ] args ) ; } }
The concrete Method class , has an Execute method :
public object Execute ( IObject receiver , object [ ] args ) { return ( new Execution Block ( receiver , receiver , this , args ) ) .
Execute ( ) ; }
Execution blocks have local variables and arguments .
The Execute of an execution block takes the instructions ( bytecodes ) from “ compiled ” methods , and then it executes them .
Here , I took a departure from Smalltalk ideas : the execution block is not an AjTalk object .
In this way , I could run this interpreter without implementing a lot of base classes .
I have to research the advantages and problems that this decision could have in the overall design and implementation .
The bytecodes
I must think about using a tree of objects ( as in Interpreter pattern ) instead of bytecodes .
But in this version , bytecodes are used .
These are the basic instruction that my “ virtual machine ” understands and executes step by step .
There is a bytecode list ( an enumeration )
namespace AjTalk { public enum ByteCode : byte { Nop = 0 , GetVariable = 1 , SetVariable = 2 , GetArgument = 3 , SetArgument = 4 , GetConstant = 5 , GetLocal = 6 , SetLocal = 7 , GetClassVariable = 8 , SetClassVariable = 9 , GetSelf = 20 , GetClass = 21 , GetSuperClass = 22 , NewObject = 23 , Pop = 24 , ReturnSub = 25 , ReturnPop = 26 , Add = 40 , Substract = 41 , Multiply = 42 , Divide = 43 , Send = 50 } }
The bytecodes contained in a method , are interpreted and executed by the execution block .
An excerpt of that code :
while ( ip < method .
ByteCodes.Length ) { ByteCode bc = ( ByteCode ) method .
ByteCodes[ip ] ; Byte arg ; switch ( bc ) { case ByteCode.ReturnSub : return null ; case ByteCode.ReturnPop : return Top ; case ByteCode .
GetConstant : ip ++ ; arg = method .
ByteCodes[ip ] ; Push ( method. GetConstant( arg ) ) ; break ; case ByteCode .
GetArgument : ip ++ ; arg = method .
ByteCodes[ip ] ; Push ( arguments [ arg ] ) ; break ; ….
Test everywhere
The initial code was written in VB .
NET .
Last year I began to rewrote the original source code to C# .
Then , this year I switched to “ TDD mind ” , so , late but sure , I added NUnit tests :
Bootstraping
I plan to use a text file , with an ad - hoc format , to inject the definitions of the initial classes and objects .
Now , in the AjTest .
Test02 , there is an example of such format in Definitions .
txt file :
class Point
variables x y method
x ^x. method
y ^y. class Rectangle
variables point1 point2
class Square Rectangle
Next steps
There is a lot of work to do :
– Complete the hierarchy of base classes ( Behaviour , Class , ….)
– More byte codes
– Support of local variables in methods
– Standard file text format
– Access to native .NET objects
– Use from .NET applications
– Define the classes and methods for a minimal implementation
– Serialization / deserialization of memory image
– Support for adding variables to a class with created instances ( this is a tough problem )
– Support for become :
– And much more ….
But I ’m confident on the shape the project is taken .
I ’m applying “ baby steps ” , to improve the base code and functionality .

ST . LOUIS ( Reuters ) - Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said on Saturday his plan to end the Iraq war was unchanged and he was puzzled by the sharp reaction to his statement this week that he might “ refine ” his timetable for withdrawing U.S. combat troops .
“ For me to say that I ’m going to refine my policies I do n’t think in any way is inconsistent with prior statements and does n’t change my strategic view that this war has to end and that I ’m going to end it as president , ” Obama told reporters on his campaign plane .
Obama , who based his drive to capture the Democratic nomination on his early and ardent opposition to the war , said earlier this week he might alter his plan to bring combat troops home within 16 months of taking office if conditions on the ground changed .
The comment drew heavy coverage and sharp criticism from some on the left and the right , with Republicans saying it showed he was vacillating on Iraq .
“ I was a little puzzled by the frenzy that I set off with what I thought was a pretty innocuous statement , ” he said on a flight from Montana to St. Louis .
“ I am absolutely committed to ending the war .
I will call my joint chiefs of staff in and give them a new assignment and that is to end the war . ”
Obama will face Republican John McCain , a staunch advocate of the war , in a November presidential race that is certain to focus heavily on the future of U.S. troops in Iraq .
“ What ’s really puzzling is that Barack Obama still does n’t understand that his words matter , ” said McCain spokesman Tucker Bounds .
Obama said he did not make a mistake with his earlier choice of words in describing his Iraq position -- even though he called a second news conference a few hours after his initial comments to clarify his stance .
He laid the blame with reporters .
Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama ( D - IL ) addresses a news conference after meeting with his foreign policy advisory panel of former Democratic U.S. government officials at a hotel in Washington June 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jim Bourg
“ I ’m surprised at how finely calibrated every single word was measured .
I was n’t saying anything I had n’t said before , that I did n’t say a year ago or when I was a United States senator , ” said Obama , who is still a senator from Illinois .
‘ VERY CONSISTENT ’
“ If you look at our position , it ’s been very consistent , ” he said .
“ I am unwavering in the belief that this has been a strategic mistake and that this war has to end .
It would be a further strategic mistake for us to continue with an open - ended occupation of the sort that John McCain has promised . ”
Obama said his willingness to consider changing conditions on the ground and the potential ramifications of the pull - out plan was a strength -- and a sharp contrast to Republican President George W. Bush ’s stay - the - course strategy in Iraq .
“ The tactics of how we ensure our troops are safe as we pull out , how we execute the withdrawal -- those are things that are all based on facts and conditions , ” he said .
“ I ’m not somebody who , like George Bush , is willing to ignore facts on the basis of my preconceived notions .
I want to pay attention to what is happening on the ground . ”
Under heavy pressure from McCain , who criticized his failure to visit Iraq since 2006 , Obama plans to travel to Iraq and Afghanistan .
The dates have not been announced for security reasons but the trip is expected within the next month .
While Obama would not admit a mistake in describing his views on Iraq , he said he had plenty of room for improvement as a presidential candidate .
“ One of the things I ’ve always tried to do is learn from mistakes and try to get better , ” he said .
“ There is a learning curve and growth being a presidential candidate .
I think I ’m a much better candidate now than I was six months ago or 12 months ago .
I think I ’ll be a better communicator and even more effective six months from now . ”

President Ahmadinejad says Iran has the right to process uranium for fuel Iran will not " retreat one iota " in its nuclear activities , its president says , in his first reaction to a new call for Tehran to end uranium enrichment .
Envoys from the US , EU and UN asked Iran to give an answer within two weeks or face possible new sanctions .
The meeting in Geneva on Saturday was the first time US and Iranian officials have held face - to - face talks about Iran 's controversial nuclear programme .
" The Iranian people are steadfast , " President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said .
They " will not retreat one iota in the face of oppressing powers , " he said in the televised speech made to thousands of supporters in the southern town of Yasouj .
He also praised US participation in the Geneva talks , describing it as a " positive step forward " towards recognising Iran 's right to acquire nuclear technology .
Iran says its nuclear programme is for entirely peaceful purposes , while the US and its allies believe it could be used to develop a nuclear weapon .
Interest The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says the speech contains the familiar language of defiance from President Ahmadinejad , but it the first time he has spoken out this strongly since the latest round of diplomacy gave some hope of a peaceful end to the crisis .
The revival of this tough language makes any sign of progress in the talks extremely unlikely , he adds .
Diplomats have been hoping that Iran would respond to a so - called " freeze - for - freeze " offer , under which a freeze of Iran 's uranium enrichment programme at its current levels would be matched by a Western pledge not to strengthen sanctions on Tehran .
Have Your Say
We simply cannot allow a country whose leaders say the things that Iran 's do to have such a destructive weapon Nicolas , London Our correspondent said Iran was interested in such an offer but it was unclear whether there were divisions in the leadership or whether the Iranians are playing for time .
Tehran 's continued nuclear activity is defying UN Security Council demands to halt enrichment .

Behind the Freddie and Fannie Fallout ; Congressional Coalition to Take Action on Energy ; Israelis Get Bad Deal in Prisoner Exchange
Aired July 16 , 2008 - 19:00:00 ET
THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT .
THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED .
( BEGIN VIDEOTAPE )
GLENN BECK , HOST ( voice - over ) : Tonight , the senseless , never - ending finger - pointing continues in our nation`s capital over the Fannie and Freddie fiasco .
Tonight , I`ll give you shocking details about Fannie`s past creative accounting .
Can you say Enron ?
But there is hope .
A group of congressmen on both sides are sick of the arguing , and they have crossed partisan lines to create solutions .
We`ll hear their side of the story .
And author Andrew Klavan talks to me about being a conservative in Hollywood and his latest thriller .
All this and more , tonight .
( END VIDEOTAPE )
BECK : Well , hello , America .
You know what ?
Our problems that are facing us in this country are complicated , but I don`t think that means that they`re too hard to understand .
When I watch television , I don`t know if you`re like me .
But when I watch television or I read the newspaper and see the news coming out of Washington , I think to myself , these are what these people think are the important issues ?
I mean , I don`t know about you , but I care about three things these days .
I care about gas and oil prices , how the money is doing .
Am I going to have a job in the next couple weeks ?
And what about our national security ?
That`s it .
I can`t be the only one that wonders where those stories are , and when they cover those stories , why aren`t they covering them the right way ?
Feels like nobody is even making any sense on television anymore .
Well , fortunately for me , the first 30 years of my life , I spoke nothing but fluent bull crap , and Washington`s political speak is a dialect of bull crap .
So tonight , let me try to decode and translate the latest on the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bull crap , as I understand it .
Here it is .
" The Point " tonight : I am sick and tired of the blame game .
All that really matters to me are solutions .
But we are doomed to relive the worst of our history unless we first learn from our mistakes and make sure those who are responsible are held accountable .
And here`s how I got there .
When we concentrate on , you know , blaming other people for a screw - up , we distract ourselves from fixing the problem .
It`s a game for children and politicians .
But the grown - up world is supposed to be ruled by responsibility and accountability .
I mean , that`s how my job works .
I`m pretty sure yours does , too , but Washington wants to play by different rules .
For instance , politicians want credit for realizing that giving people money through the stimulus package helps grow the economy , helps speed the economy , but they refuse to take the blame when they raise taxes , which starves the economy .
They want more oil , but they don`t -- they want to prevent domestic oil drilling .
Ethanol .
They want to make ethanol .
It costs $ 1.25 to make $ 1 worth of energy .
And then it also burns up our food supply .
Now , with our new banking crisis , Congress is taking their hypocrisy , oh , to new heights .
This past week , everybody on television has been talking about Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
But nobody is telling you the actual story until now .
Freddie and Fannie are government - run mortgage companies .
Their near failure is the government`s fault .
But wait , wait , wait .
It gets much , much worse .
Tonight , America , here is what you need to know .
This has been going on forever .
Do you remember the Enron scandal ?
You know , the televised hearings ?
Congress burned these guys at the stake for cooking their books , which they should have .
They were cooking their books to the tune of $ 567 million , right ?
That`s Enron .
Here`s a news flash .
At the same time , Fannie Mae was doing the same thing , except with them , we`re talking about $ 6.3 billion .
Where were the hearings ?
That means a government institution screwed us 12 times as bad as the evil Enron .
Only Fannie`s executives aren`t in jail or dead like Ken Lay .
Oh , no , no , there were no congressional hearings .
These guys kept their jobs .
Currently , the head of Fannie gets over $ 11 million a year .
And they the head of Freddie gets $ 18 million a year .
And the guy who was at the head of Fannie while all this stuff was going down , he`s resting comfortably on his retirement of $ 110,000 -- a month .
A month .
And Congress is outraged at the oil executive salaries .
Come on .
I guess crime doesn`t pay , unless your office is in the nation`s capital .
Jim Leach is the director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard University , former chairman of the House Banking Committee .
Jim , this has been going on forever .
When is it ever going to stop ?
JIM LEACH , DIRECTOR , INSTITUTE OF POLITICS , HARVARD UNIVERSITY :
Well , Congress has a unique opportunity , literally , this week to do something very serious .
The executive is right that we have very little choice but to act strongly and quickly .
Congress is right to think that we ought to have a little bit of a second look .
Neither , to date , have come up with the approach that I think should self - evidently be on the table .
BECK : Which is ?
LEACH : Which is exactly as you began your show , with accountability .
And the accountability here has to first go to the shareholders of these two institutions .
My own sense is that we ought to allow a very substantial line of credit to the treasury of these two privately owned , publicly empowered institutions , but in return , give the treasury -- and the treasury implies here the American public -- warrants to purchase Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock over a ten - year period of time if they recover and warrants that it would be a purchase of stock that would be immediately sold back to the public .
BECK : I`ve got another idea , Jim .
How about we close the place down and let the private market actually provide this service ?
Since when is this government`s responsibility ?
LEACH : Well -- well , first of all , these are private institutions .
BECK : No , no , no , they`re government - backed .
The treasury is backing them .
LEACH : Well , they have government privileges .
The trouble with this approach at this point in time is that you would have a fiasco in the international financial markets , which would be a disaster for the American homeowner .
So what you have to do is work with the system as it currently exists and change it .
And you change it by putting Fannie and Freddie under the same kinds of rigorous regulation that commercial banks are under today .
BECK : OK .
Jim , I got to run .
Thank you very much .
We`ve got to go to Ron Paul now , Republican congressman from Texas , former presidential candidate .
You , sir , are looking more and more right every day .
You -- you have been ringing this bell for quite some time .
And -- what do we do ?
REP .
RON PAUL ( R ) , TEXAS :
Well , you know , what you do politically is you bail everybody out .
If you want to do good economics , you let people who made mistakes fail and cleanse the system and go back to work again .
But in this town of Washington , it`s always bail out .
And ...
BECK : OK , but you don`t agree with that ?
PAUL : No , no , I think it`s the wrong thing to do .
It just prolongs the agony .
I tried to warn them a few years ago and eliminate the line of credit to the treasury in predicting that this bubble is being built and blown up , and that this would come .
But no , it should be allowed to be liquidated .
You know , the bad investments should be disposed of , and the debt should be eliminated .
And it would have to be rough for about a year , but after that , everything would be OK again .
BECK : Do -- do you feel like -- I mean , honestly , it`s like if somebody has a brain tumor and they go to the doctor and they give them an aspirin , and then that stops working , they give them a Percocet .
After that stops working , they give them some morphine .
The patient is going to die .
The more Band - Aids we put on this system , the worse it becomes in the long run , right ?
PAUL : You`re absolutely right , because the patient here is the dollar .
And every time we bail out , whether it`s the Fed creating new credit or the Congress appropriating more money , it`s putting pressure on the dollar .
And it`s the weakness of the dollar that is the real crisis .
So yes , it`s temporary , what they`re going to do , but ultimately , the patient can die , and that is the dollar .
That is dangerous .
BECK : Do you think we`ll see that ?
Do you think there`s a chance , if we don`t change our ways , we`ll see that ?
PAUL : It`s so hard for me to , you know , accept the idea that we`re that stupid .
But then ...
BECK : Let me ask you this , because I feel the same way .
I believe in America , and I believe that Americans are smart .
And I think Americans feel this in their gut .
They know .
But how long do we have to wake up our politicians before it just -- how close are we ?
PAUL : Well , the time is running out .
And nobody can predict the exact time .
Nobody knew exactly -- see , I was worried about it five , six , seven years ago , and it took a long time .
And they said , " Oh , you were worried about nothing . "
So right now , I`m more worried than ever .
But conceivably , if we do the wrong things and there`s an emergency crisis overseas or there`s a foreign policy crisis , this would end quickly .
I mean , the world could dump dollar , and that is something that we are not prepared for .
BECK : How much do you think --
I hate to be a conspiracy guy , but I read enough history to know , you know , the turn of the century , and I don`t trust the Fed probably almost as much , if not as much as you -- you don`t trust the Fed .
How much of this is a power grab by the Fed ?
PAUL : Well , I think it is .
And it`s -- it`s shared by the Congress , you know .
Congress is going along with it , passing all new regulations and new appropriations .
But , yes , there are individuals who are both sincere in believing that they`re supposed to manage the economy , and there`s others who like to control natural resources in the financial industry , and they always bail out their friends .
So it`s a little bit of each .
BECK : Let me -- let me ask you a question that maybe you wouldn`t want to answer .
Are you -- let me rephrase this .
How do you -- how do you do it ?
You have been run through the mill .
I don`t agree with you on everything , but on finances , I do agree on .
And you`ve been right on finances .
And America is just catching up to you .
How -- how do you do it ?
Are you -- do you ever get so frustrated that you`re just like , I can`t -- I can`t ring this bell anymore ?
PAUL : You know , I never use the word " frustration . "
I tell people I just have low expectations , and all of my job is -- is to try to point out the truth as I understand it .
You know , according to our Constitution and according to sound economic policy .
And I`ve been a student of Austrian economics .
And I believe they`re right , and I`m convinced they are .
And I believe that you shouldn`t have paper currencies , and I just argue from that case with the full conviction it`s the right issue .
You know , I don`t worry about tomorrow and the next day and where the people are going to believe .
I`m , as a matter of fact , pretty pleased and surprised in the last year so that so many people have begun to listen .
So I`m pleased about that .
BECK : More and more , and you give it -- you give it another couple of years , and it`s going to be outrageous .
Congressman Paul , thank you very much .
Coming up , it turns -- it turns out I`m not the only one watching the leaders in Washington spinning their wheels and screaming at the television while we watch it .
A group of rank and file Congress people have decided to buck their leadership and reach across party lines to get some real solutions on our energy crisis .
We`ll talk to two of them next .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BECK : Coming up , President Bush says our economy is growing .
Really ?
I don`t know .
Maybe it`s just -- just me ?
Somebody with a lot more credibility than I have will tell us about the numbers we should be looking at .
The lying liars that they are , coming up in tonight`s " Real Story . "
First , I don`t know about you , but honestly , the one thing that scares me more than the Democrats and the Republicans fighting all the time is when they get along .
Because you know , I have kids .
It`s like when there`s a slumber party , you know , and it`s too quiet downstairs .
That`s when you should worry .
The latest news out of the capital , I`m actually keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for the best .
This morning I read about a bipartisan coalition whose goal it is to uncover the real and immediate solution to the skyrocketing gas prices .
OK .
That sounds like -- but here`s what worries me .
It involves a coalition of politicians .
When I hear that , I see a bunch of guys in suits getting together to have meetings , which is a Washington specialty , so they can talk and not take action on the energy crisis that they not only created but ignored and then blamed on other people .
But I`m so desperate to hope for change that I`m going to give this new coalition the benefit of the doubt .
Want to go with me ?
Let`s meet the guy .
Anytime someone in Washington manages to grow a set and ignore special interests and get around the do - nothing leadership , a little -- a little ember of optimism starts to grow in my jaded black heart .
Here they are .
Congressman Neil Abercrombie .
He is a Democrat from Hawaii .
And Congressman John Peterson is a Republican from Pennsylvania .
Look at the two of you .
Both guys are wearing red ties .
All right .
Guys , first of all ...
REP .
NEIL ABERCROMBIE ( D ) , HAWAII : We`re looking for a little aloha .
BECK : Aloha .
Here`s the thing .
I appreciate two people that say , " You know what ?
Our leadership is not getting anything done .
It`s time to work together . "
Thank you on behalf of the American people .
Now tell me your idea .
What are you guys working on ?
REP .
JOHN PETERSON ( R ) , PENNSYLVANIA :
Well , we want to come up with a bipartisan plan .
Neil and I have been working together for a number of years , five or six , on offshore production of energy in this country , and we believe we can build a package around this .
We can open up the Outer Continental Shelf , use the revenues to fund renewables , to fund coal to liquids , to do conservation , help Americans use less energy with more efficient means , and help them pay for it with tax credit .
But we need a broad , balanced plan that includes production offshore , coal to liquids , coal to gas , renewables of all kinds , and to put some money on the table to do it .
Not just talk , money on the table .
BECK : Wait , wait ...
ABERCROMBIE : Our basic -- our basic operation is to have energy independence for the United States and to stop exporting our wealth in order to import our energy .
BECK : I don`t know what to do .
I agree with both of you .
What do you do in cable news at this point ?
OK , so what is -- you guys are actually -- you`re putting a bill together , and you expect it to be voted on -- this is crazy , next week , before Congress goes on vacation ?
ABERCROMBIE :
Well , we`ve got a couple of weeks .
PETERSON : We`ve got a couple weeks .
We`ve got ...
ABERCROMBIE : There`s always time to do the right time .
And there`s - - there`s a whole lot of people getting together .
We`re synthesizing our proposals .
Yes , maybe there`s been lack of action , Glenn , like you said at the beginning .
The lack of action in the sense that ...
BECK : Maybe .
ABERCROMBIE :
In the sense that there`s been a mutual accusation society going on between the parties .
We`re trying to bust through the ideological barriers , get through the -- the verbal conflicts , and get down to a lot of the good ideas that especially a lot of members in the House have .
BECK : OK .
ABERCROMBIE :
Put it together and get it in front of the House for a vote .
BECK : Guys , I have to tell you , I appreciate it .
I know Americans are saying , " Yes , thank God . "
Somebody is doing what`s right for the American people , and not the special interest groups on both sides .
And not just the environmental or , you know , big oil or whatever .
I mean the special interest groups that have become the Republican and Democrat Party .
Thank you for that .
Now what is your biggest road block ?
Or what is it that we can -- what is it that people can do ?
PETERSON : We need -- we need you to inform the public .
We need to get the public educated .
But when we come out with this proposal , you can be assured there`s no lobbyists , there`s no interest groups one either side of this issue , and there`s no leadership , Republican or Democratic , at the table .
And their leadership styles , that wanted to come .
We`ve not been allowed them to come .
This is member driven .
This is members who have been around Congress for a while .
We know the issues .
We`re going to draft a bill that`s understandable , that does a multitude of things , built around the offshore production of energy in this country , which has been locked up for 14 Congresses and three presidents .
And fortunately , the president lifted it , thank God , finally .
But we`re going to -- we`re going to build on that , and this is going to be produced .
We believe that there will be an instant embracement by the American public .
BECK : How do you get -- how do you get Nancy Pelosi and the people who are on both sides that are controlled by special interests ?
How do you get this even to come to the floor ?
ABERCROMBIE :
The speaker has a record of having a position herself on an issue .
And knowing that she does not have the votes for that , but putting it on the floor anyway and then casting her vote .
We`re confident that both Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House and John Boehner as the minority leader of the House will recognize that this is a member - driven series of proposals and that this is , in fact , the people`s house and that the public is demanding that -- that we take action .
And we believe if we put together a series of proposals that that will lead us to energy independence .
And to keep us from shifting our wealth out of the country and invest it in the infrastructure that we need in this country , that`s something that we can accomplish .
BECK : Guys , let me tell you something .
I give you my word .
If you are as straight up as you sound , if this really isn`t any -- driven by anybody else , you have my support , anything that you guys need .
And I know there`s a lot of people out , you know , that are watching the program and listen to me on the radio that will say the exact same thing .
If you`re on the straight - up , thank you , thank you , thank you .
ABERCROMBIE :
When I say us , it`s not just the two of us .
BECK : I know that .
No , no , no .
I know that .
I feel that .
And believe me , I will make sure that a list of all the names go on television and on national radio .
ABERCROMBIE :
We`d like to have -- we`re very appreciative of the fact that you`re zeroing in on this .
And we`re going to put those proposals out .
We want the public to take a look at it and stopping the wealth from leaving the country .
BECK : Guys , you will be on again .
Thank you very much .
Coming up , Israel and Hezbollah conduct a prisoner exchange .
Hezbollah gets five very much alive terrorists , and Israel gets two dead soldiers .
Who negotiated this deal ?
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BECK : Can I ask you a question ?
Whatever happened to the Chicago way ?
You know , the strategy from " The Untouchables . "
I love the scene where Sean Connery says , " They pull a knife on you , you pull a gun .
He sends one of yours to the hospital , you send one of his to the morgue . "
I love that scene , and I`ve been thinking about it all day , especially when I saw the great , super , super prisoner exchange between Israel and Hezbollah .
Today , Israel exchanged five very much alive Lebanese prisoners for two Israeli soldiers in coffins .
I don`t want to tell the Israelis how to run their country or anything , but I don`t think that`s a very good deal .
Personally , you send me back two dead prisoners , I send you back two dead prisoners .
And Natan Sharansky is the former Soviet dissident , conservative Israeli politician and best - selling author .
How are you , sir ?
NATAN SHARANSKY , AUTHOR : Good morning .
Thank you .
BECK : Natan , tell me -- tell me how this deal came about .
I mean , I`m sure that the families wanted the prisoners` bodies back , but this is a horrible , horrible deal that`s sending the wrong message to Hezbollah .
SHARANSKY : Well , unfortunately , I can`t agree with you , but I can explain that Israel is a society is strong when it`s in solidarity , the support of every citizen , of every soldier , yes , of every dead body .
And that`s why it`s very difficult for every Israeli prime minister to stand against this type of pressure .
On the other hand , we have the struggle , death and life struggle with the terrorists .
And today , unfortunately , today is a serious encouragement for terrorists to continue to kill , to kidnap , to hijack .
And that`s why I , when I was a minister , I wrote against this kind of deal .
BECK : OK .
May I ask you a question , and no offense to Israel ?
I`m a huge supporter of Israel , but Israel is turning into us , and we turned into France .
Somebody has to remain true to kicking someone`s ass that only understands a good ass - kicking .
Is Israel getting too soft ?
SHARANSKY : Well , I would say Israel as a society is not getting too soft , but our government at this moment is rather weak because of different reasons .
And I think it makes decisions from positional weakness .
And I hope the vibrant democracy in democratic ways will correct it .
Because really , we cannot afford such big decisions as these so - called exchange .
BECK : I mean , put the video back on with the red carpet .
They were welcoming back , if I`m not mistaken -- they`re welcoming back a guy who crushed the head of a 4 - year - old .
Correct ?
SHARANSKY : Well , yes .
I want everyone to remember who you`re dealing with when you decide to accuse Hezbollah or not .
For these people , it`s awful terrorists .
It`s a big hero .
For them , those who are killing children are heroes .
For us , our soldiers are heroes .
That`s why we are celebrating life and that why we are fighting .
Even for every dead body of our soldiers .
But again , I say all this doesn`t exclude the fact that our government made the mistake .
You should not have this deal .
BECK : OK , thank you very much .
I appreciate it , sir .
Good to talk to you again .
Coming up , President Bush says our economy is growing .
Yes .
Stick around .
I`ll give you " The Real Story " in a second .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BECK : Coming up , I can`t imagine what it would be like to be one of the few lone conservatives swimming around in that cesspool we like to call Hollywood .
But tonight , I`m going to introduce you to such a man .
He says it`s time we start celebrating America in the movie theaters instead of beating it to death .
And that`s coming up in just a bit .
But first , welcome to the " Real Story . "
If you listen to any of the so - called experts on TV , they`ll likely tell you we`re in this financial crisis because of a -- basically , a whole bunch of acronyms that nobody really understands .
You know , the CDOs Bill -- no , I disagree -- it`s the SIVs or the NBSs or the GSEs .
What are those things ?
In case you need a reminder , I believe most experts are almost always wrong .
The " Real Story " is you can understand what we`re facing by thinking about our economy and what`s going on .
It`s a simple Ponzi scheme , that`s where some guy with no money opens up a credit card account to buy a flat screen TV .
And then to pay off the credit bill , he borrows from his uncle .
And then to pay his uncle , he knocks over a bank and it goes on and on and on until finally there`s nobody left to rob .
And then the whole scheme collapses and the guy is exposed as a bankrupt fraud .
Well , unfortunately , I hate to say it , but I think America is quickly becoming that bankrupt fraud .
Right now , we`re somewhere in between borrowing from our uncle and holding up a bank .
Either way , we`re quickly being exposed for what we`re really becoming ; a nation that has gone from manufacturing things to just buying them .
A nation that`s gone from living on what we make to living on whatever we can borrow .
And you want proof ?
How about this way is a simple way to understand what`s going on .
Financial services , you know loaning people money and all that stuff now account for twice as much of our entire economy as 30 years ago .
And our manufacturing industries -- worth half as much .
Have you seen the price of a stock of GM ?
Holy cow .
The results of basing our entire way of life on pushing paper from one desk to another is the credit market that is now over three times greater than our GDP .
In other words , if I may translate bull crap to English , we`re borrowing 300 percent more than we`re making .
But the problem is n`t what we have done to our economy .
It`s quite honestly that we`re still lying to ourselves .
Trust me , I`m a recovering alcoholic .
Admitting you have a problem is the first step to recovery and gang , we have a problem .
Earlier today , the government released the latest inflation numbers .
They said that prices only rose 1.1 percent in June .
That`s great .
That`s the fastest monthly rise in 26 years .
The truth is the government has been , you know , tweaking -- I don`t know , manipulating -- no , no , making up the formulas for decades to make sure that everything looks better than it actually is .
You know it and I know it .
If we were still using the old formulas , inflation would be almost double what they say it is today .
And unemployment would be somewhere between 9 percent and 12 percent .
Of course .
Those Americans , they can`t handle the truth .
We`ll just change the formulas .
We`ll lie to each other and we`ll all keep borrowing money from China that we promptly pump into our cars and that goes right back to a Saudi Arabian bank account .
You know it`s happening and I do .
We`re not blind .
Americans are not stupid and we`re not lazy .
We don`t care about the core inflation versus the headline inflation .
I don`t care .
I know prices are up .
I can see it in my bank account , and I think you can , too .
It `s time we just say enough is enough .
We`ve got to end this Ponzi scheme that starts in Washington on our own terms .
We must drill for oil .
We must continue to do everything on energy .
Cut and balance our budget .
Live within our means and free up the markets .
And man , let capitalism heal itself .
Kevin Phillips is the author of " Bad Money . "
Kevin , I want to start with you on George Bush .
He said this the other day .
( BEGIN VIDEO CLIP )
GEORGE W. BUSH , PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES : Despite the challenges we face , our economy has demonstrated remarkable resilience .
While the unemployment rate has risen , it remains at 5.5 percent , which is still low by historical standards .
And the economy continued to grow in the first quarter of this year .
The growth was slower than we liked , but it was growth none the less .
( END VIDEO CLIP )
BECK : Yes , ok , it was growth .
Correct me if I`m wrong .
I see this growth as we`re becoming the country that makes the little bamboo umbrellas for people`s drinks .
KEVIN PHILLIPS , AUTHOR , " BAD MONEY " :
Well , hopefully , not just that , but I agree with the generality of what you`re saying here .
Let`s take his numbers , for example .
He said the economy was growing .
One of the difficulties is if you assume that inflation in this country is 5 percent or 6 percent as opposed to the 2.5 percent core number that they use to subtract from the nominal growth rate , well then , you don`t have the growth rate .
You have a negative rate .
So what the new inflation numbers are telling us is that you have to suspect the government`s numbers that say that this economy is still growing .
Not if we have that kind of inflation .
BECK : Okay , all right .
Please , because you`re like one of the smarter guys out there .
And I have to tell you , sometimes I hear people like you talk and I`m like , " I have no idea what he`s even saying . "
So talk down to me for just a second .
Pretend I`m an idiot .
Just pretend .
I`m an optimist .
I believe in America .
I believe in Americans .
I believe we can do anything we set our mind to .
But nobody is telling us the truth .
What are the things that you scream at on the television when you see these clowns on television ?
What are the things you say , that`s not right ?
PHILLIPS : Well , a lot of different things .
But to pick up on your point about you have to tell the American people what`s going on , I think that`s absolutely central .
You have to tell them that we have a huge problem in terms of oil .
And it can`t be solved by saying that something is going to replace fossil fuels overnight or even within the next five years .
It`s a major threat .
It `s pulling the dollar down .
We have an amount of debt that nobody even imagines .
It`s quadrupled in the last two decades .
There`s so many things wrong .
And the thing that is wrong that underpins so much of the rest of this is that the Republicans can`t really say the Democrats did it and the Democrats can`t say just the Republicans did it .
BECK : Oh , no .
I have to tell you , both sides are lying to us .
Both sides -- you know , it`s almost like they`re either in such denial or they just don`t care anymore .
They`re in bed with special interests that they`re just not the guys to fix this because they won`t admit it .
Explain the one thing , and this is so important .
Explain the relationship between the dollar and oil .
I don`t think people really understand what`s happening here with the way we are borrowing and everything else is devaluing the dollar and driving the price of oil up as well as all of the other factors that are on top of the oil price .
PHILLIPS : Well , 30 , 40 years back , we were the world`s leading oil producer .
And that was a mainstay of the American economy .
And when we went off gold as a backing for our currency indirectly in the early 1970s and the oil price surged , we got a deal from the Saudis and OPEC that they would price oil in dollars .
They would recycle the money they made from their oil and put it into U.S. Treasury bonds or other investments .
And generally speaking that they would support the dollar and the fiscal position of the United States .
Bit by bit , that changed .
But in the last ten years , it`s become absolutely critical .
First , because the invasion of Iraq has played havoc with the views of the Persian Gulf towards the United States and the oil price .
And secondly , because we have to bring in so much oil to this country that with its current price , it costs us $ 500 billion a year .
It`s a huge part of the trade deficit .
So we have seen the politics of oil just go absolutely cock - eyed .
As that has happened , the politics of the dollar has gone haywire .
They won`t make the connection .
It`s hard for the average American to explain what`s happened , but the politicians , I think , are really frightened that`s going to be intuited and that there`s going to be a fierce anger .
BECK : It is .
Yes , there is .
I know it .
I hear it from people all across the country .
I have David Walker on , the former GAO comptroller on tomorrow .
This guy has been ringing this bell for a long time .
The government is spending too much money , everybody is spending too much money , the dollar is devalued , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera .
I talk to people who are warning of really bad things to come .
But most of them don`t have the courage or won`t go on the air and say , " This is what I think is coming . "
What do you think is coming if we don`t -- if we don`t fix our energy problem , if we don`t fix our spending problem , if we don`t fix our manufacturing problem ?
What is coming ?
And how soon ?
Is it just a recession , depression , collapse , what is it ?
PHILLIPS : Well , some people think we`re headed for another version of the 1930s .
Certainly in terms of housing , it is the worst decline in housing prices since the 1930s .
Others say , well , it`s the 1970s .
It `s going to be commodity .
Inflation is going to eat us alive .
BECK : What do you say ?
PHILLIPS : What I`m afraid of is that I think we have an analogy to both of those periods , and that the interplay is likely to create a major loss of purchasing power for the ordinary American , a loss of purchasing power even further for the dollar .
Possibly the currencification -- if I can coin a word -- of both gold and oil .
And the upshot will be that all will pretend to be the old United States , but we won`t have the clout , the importance , or the prosperity of the United States .
And what we thought of as the American dream may , in fact , cease to be something that the average person can dream about here as the power and the economic affluence passes to Asia .
BECK : That was sunshine and lollipops .
Thanks a lot .
I`d like to talk to you again .
Now you have probably seen the video of the prisoner at Guantanamo Bay .
He`s crying while he`s being get this , questioned .
Holy humanity ; this is one of the most amazing stories I have seen .
The " Real Story " is -- you probably don`t realize it , but I`m pretty sure we have seen this guy before .
Didn`t we see this guy just a little while ago , a few months ago , in this video ?
I don`t mind putting him and getting to know him trying some new water boarding techniques or just torturing the bad snot out of him .
But maybe that`s just me .
That`s the " Real Story " tonight .
Coming up , a man from Hollywood that is not a liberal .
He`s the one .
Andrew Klavan , he is the author of " Empire of Lies . " he joins me next .
Stick around .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BECK : I have to tell you , I get a lot of books sent to me on this program , and I read a lot of press notes , but a quote from the next author is something that really caught my eye .
Ready ?
" Any TV show you see , any movie , any news story , the message is always the same .
Christians are bigots .
Patriots are small - minded jingoists , housewives are desperate , corporations are sinister , America is the bad guy . "
It `s like I wrote that .
Not words you hear very often from creative people , and you almost never hear them from someone as firmly entrenched in Hollywood as our guest , Andrew Klavan .
He`s the best selling author of a great new thriller " Empire of Lies . "
I just got to shake your hand , brother .
First of all , let me give everybody an idea of who you are .
You wrote " True Crime , " Clint Eastwood .
" Don`t Say a Word , " the Michael Douglas movie .
Stephen King calls me the mentally - challenged younger brother .
ANDREW KLAVAN , AUTHOR , " EMPIRE OF LIES : I have heard that before .
BECK : He says that you are the most original American novelist in quite some time .
I mean , Hollywood likes you .
And then you get a review like this .
I love this , from the Associated Press .
Ready ?
" Klavan occupies the portion of the political spectrum commonly known as right - wing crack pot .
Through Harrow , he tells us , among other things , that the entire media is a left - wing conspiracy , that taxes steal from the rich to give to the poor .
That America is in a holy war with Islam , that the truth about darn near everything in the United States is obscured by a blizzard of politically correct with lies , and that anyone who disagrees agrees with him is deluded . "
Yes .
KLAVAN : Was there a problem ?
I was reading through about where I got it wrong .
BECK : Is this a good review to them or a bad review ?
KLAVAN : I think that was meant to savage the book .
I don`t know .
I was going to have it printed up .
BECK : You should .
I would have it blown up and made into wallpaper .
That`s the best review I ever read .
KLAVAN : On the other hand , it`s funny on the one side , and I would like a t - shirt that says it , but this is the way .
This is one of the ways that the left controls the arts .
It`s one of the ways they bully artists into submission .
The arts at this point -- the culture at this point -- is a wholly - owned subsidiary of the left , as far as I`m concerned ..
Certainly Hollywood , a lot of publishing .
That`s one of the reasons why .
If you go back and look at some of the movies that have managed to get through the transgressed liberal orthodoxy .
When you go back to " Not Without My Daughter ; " " Tears of the Sun , " an action movie that supported the American military ; " Passion of the Christ , " obviously ; " 300 " last year about the Spartans .
Those pictures , they weren`t -- they didn`t just get bad reviews .
They got savaged , they got personally attacked .
And the artists who made them got personally attacked like that .
They learned to keep their heads down .
They learned to toe the line .
And even if they don`t make left - wing message movies , they learned to keep those assumptions that I was talking about in place .
All corporations are evil , America --
BECK : Let me ask you this , when is it that Hollywood is actually going to wake up and notice that , for instance , this weekend , " Batman " is sold out in all 700 theaters that it is playing in .
For the first day , completely sold out .
It is a story of an American hero , somebody who`s wealthy and yet does the right thing .
And there`s good in evil .
When are they going to get that ?
KLAVAN : One of the untruths about Hollywood is people say Hollywood is all about money .
They only make what sells .
That`s just not true .
Artists want love .
They go where the love is .
The love comes from the elite intellectuals .
The elite intellectuals are all on the left .
So even though they`ll make those movies occasionally to make the bucks , they`re still going to make movie after movie attacking Iraq .
BECK : I have to ask you about this book .
I read the first three or four chapters of this .
I just started it last night or the night before .
I have to tell you , I relate to the character a lot .
It`s like honestly , part of it is like , holy cow , it`s me .
It is written in such a great way .
It is -- I have never read anything that I can hear the voice .
But it is also , you`re going towards a conservative style audience , and yet it is really harsh in its language , why ?
KLAVAN : This is one of the reasons that the left has been able to take over the arts .
And it`s one of the things that is really the fault of conservatives .
As a conservative , I believe in good behavior , I speak with good language .
As an artist , my job is to tell the truth .
My job is to portray the world , not the way I want it to be , but the way that it is .
And so I`m entering into the mind of a man here .
That`s the story .
The story is this a conspiracy he sees or is he going mad ?
He goes into the depth of his mind .
BECK : Andrew has also written a chapter for our serial thriller , " 7 Days . "
It `s going to appear exclusively in my magazine , " Fusion . "
You can read it along with the rest of the story by signing up for " Fusion " right now at glennbeck.com .
This is a real read .
Andrew Klavan , " Empire of Lies , " please pick it up .
And by the way , up next , a preview of a special stage show coming to a theater near you -- yes , Hollywood , look out -- tomorrow .
Stick around .
We`ll show it to you next .
( COMMERCIAL BREAK )
BECK : Well , tomorrow movie theater audiences all around America will be in utter shock as they have to see this fat face in high definition .
Yes , in around 350 movie theaters all across America tomorrow .
My " Beck ` 08 Unelectable Tour " will be carried live in all of its sweaty glory .
You can go to glennbeck .com to get all the information on what theaters in your area are carrying it and you can also get tickets there .
For anybody who hasn`t seen my stage show before , it is definitely a little different than what I do on this show .
You know , here on this show I try figure out how we dig ourselves into these deep , dark nightmares that we talk about every night .
On stage , we laugh about how we dig ourselves into these deep , dark nightmares .
The tour this year is about how ridiculous our political situation has become and how the election process feels more like a parody of itself than a way to figure out who runs the most powerful nation on the planet .
And then I make my pitch to be the worst presidential candidate in history .
Believe me , you watch me make this speech in the second half of the show , and you`ll know why I would be 100 percent unelectable .
Now , if watching my nonexistent political career burst into flames isn`t enough for you to come out to the theater , how about this ?
If you go to one of the hundreds of theaters carrying the broadcast tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m.
Eastern , you buy a ticket and you come into the theater , not only will you get to se my stage show , but I will also be showing the entire new Batman film , " The Dark Knight . "
The movie is getting incredible reviews , and it`s going to make hundreds of millions of dollars .
You will be one of the first people in America to see it .
Some restrictions do apply .
For example , you only have to buy a ticket of the midnight showing of " The Dark Night " separately then hang out for a couple hours after the show and then watching it in another theater entirely .
Some people will say , " Glenn , that`s a little misleading . "
I`m just trying to play the role of a politician in the stage show .
I have complete license to twist the facts for my own benefits .
Again , get the details on how to see the show at glennbeck.com .
That`s tomorrow , theaters nationwide , one night only tomorrow night .
We`ll see you then .
Back here also tomorrow night from New York .
I`m a busy guy .
Good night , America .

NEW YORK – Foreign investment in the United States is on the rise and key U.S. businesses and infrastructures such as roads and airports are being sold to foreign investors .
Now comes word from the U.S. Department of Commerce the Bureau of Economic Affairs will stop publishing a key report tracking those foreign dollars .
WND reported earlier on a decision by the Federal Reserve to quit publishing M3 data , a money - supply measure watched closely by economists .
Last month , econometrician John Williams reported on his subscription website , " Shadow Government Statistics , " that the M3 statistic he compiles from available government data shows the growth of M3 at historically high rates last seen in June 1971 , two months before President Nixon closed the gold window and instituted wage and price controls .
TRENDING : With only days to go until debate , Pelosi gives Biden an out : ' Why bother ? '
Charles McMillion , president and chief economist at MBG Information Services in Washington , D.C. , also has expressed concern over the recent decision by the Department of Commerce to discontinue publishing foreign investment data and warned that may forecast an unprecedented surge in foreign investment anticipated by the Bush administration .
In the announcement , BEA claimed funding limitations necessitated halting future reports .
The most recent report , released Wednesday , showed direct foreign investment in U.S. businesses reached $ 276.8 billion in 2007 , the second largest amount recorded and the highest since 2000 , when new foreign investment outlays peaked at $ 335.6 billion .
Of the direct foreign investments in the U.S. in 2007 , only about 10 percent , approximately $ 21.9 billion , established new U.S. businesses , while foreign investments to acquire existing U.S. businesses totaled $ 255.0 billion .
Nearly 37 percent of the foreign investments in 2007 involved European investors , although the BEA noted investments from Asia and the Middle East rose substantially .
McMillion noted in an e-mail that the BEA decision to discontinue publishing foreign investment data comes at a time when public and congressional concerns have increased over the acquisition of U.S. assets by foreign investors
McMillian referenced the recent attempt by " China 's mysterious but closely state - aligned Huawei " to acquire 3Com , a key supplier of Internet security technologies to the U.S. Department of State , in conjunction with Boston - based Bain Capital , a private equity firm founded by Republican 2008 presidential candidate Mitt Romney .
In March , Bain pulled out of the deal after learning that the secretive Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States , or CFIUS , organized in the U.S. Treasury Department , planned to block the deal .
In May , during a four - day trip to the Middle East that included Saudi Arabia and Dubai , U.S. Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson encouraged foreign investment in the United States , arguing the controversy over Dubai Ports in 2006 did not reflect an adverse U.S. attitude toward foreign investment .
" I have met with many leaders from the Middle East who ask if the United States really continues to welcome investment , " Paulson said in a speech to the U.S. - United Arab Emirates Business Council , according to Bloomberg.com .
" As we seek to open new markets abroad , America will keep our markets open at home to investment from private firms and from sovereign wealth funds . "
WND previously reported that since the beginning of the year , Dubai and Abu Dhabi , two of the largest United Arab Emirate states , have been in discussions with the U.S.
Treasury , offering reassurances that their investments in U.S. banks and security firms would not impose restrictions usually dictated by Islamic law , commonly known as sharia .
WND also has reported sovereign wealth funds in six Persian Gulf countries , including Kuwait , the United Arab Emirates and Qatar , have now amassed $ 1.7 trillion , positioning them for attempts to control major banks and securities firms in the United States .
In September 2007 , Dubai acquired 19.9 percent of Nasdaq , the second largest stock exchange in the United States .
WND also reported last month the top bid to lease the Pennsylvania Turnpike on a long - term public - private - partnership , or PPP lease , for a bid of $ 12.8 billion was submitted by Spanish infrastructure management company Abertis Infraestructuras of Barcelona .

( CNN ) -- Join Roland Martin for his weekly sound - off segment on CNN.com Live at 11:10 a.m. Wednesday .
If you 're passionate about politics , he wants to hear from you .
Roland Martin says voting on Tuesday made sense when the day was set in 1845 , but a change is needed .
Now that the political parties have informally settled on their nominees , the focus turns to November 4 , when the nation will go to the polls to choose a new president .
But why is Election Day on a Tuesday ?
Why in the world do we continue to insist on voting on a weekday when we are supposed to be encouraging as many people to vote as possible ?
Most of the primaries and caucuses during the past four months took place on Tuesdays , but a number went to the polls on Saturdays .
The Puerto Rico vote was on a Sunday .
What 's better than going to church in the morning and then making your way to the voting booth ?
Officially , Election Day is the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November ( depending on the year , it could be November 2 through November 8 ) .
Since 1845 , this has been the standard practice in the United States .
Congress wanted a set date to elect a president and members of Congress , and because we were an agricultural society , this was the best day for farmers in rural America to get to the polls .
That made a ton of sense .
Then .
But a lot has changed in the past 163 years , and it 's time Congress changed this unnecessary law .
The purists are likely to argue that everyone knows that a Tuesday in early November is set aside for Election Day .
So with that in mind , just leave the election in November .
Sure , it would make better sense to go with a month during which it 's warm in nearly all of the USA , but the consistency argument also makes sense .
But why not the first Saturday in November ?
If that date were chosen , the majority of voters would n't have to worry about trying to vote before going to work , hoping and praying the lines are n't too long so they can zip in and zip out .
The same thing happens in the evening .
Folks have to hurry up and finish their work , interrupt meetings , and shut down whatever else they are doing and head to the polls .
They are likely to confront long lines , and that discourages some folks from voting .
( Now , I do n't have much sympathy on this one .
We 'll stand in line for a concert or movie ; and that surely is n't as important as electing a president ! )
Saturday is already a day of leisure , and there is no doubt that more Americans would head to the polls on a traditional day off from work .
Because of the excitement generated by this year 's campaign , you can bet there will be long lines at the polls , and if there are not enough ballots , we can expect all kinds of delays .
Folks will grow frustrated , be afraid to show up to work late , and likely will leave and not come back .

That 's just not good for democracy .
This is one of those simple decisions that does n't require a ton of debate .
I can't imagine there being major opposition to moving the election date .
In 2004 , 71 percent of all eligible voters were registered , according to a story by the Carnegie Reporter , " Election Reform : Lessons From 2004 . "
But of that number , 60.7 percent voted .
Someone is likely to say that with the number of people voting up in 2004 from the number in 2000 , that 's not bad .
But when we see 90 percent of voters in Iraq voting -- and we are trying to instill democracy there !
-- it 's clear that impediments to voting in the United States are n't helpful .
It would be nice to see the presidential nominees weigh in on this and pledge to change the election date .
Let 's see a debate moderator ask this question .
Instead of putting up barriers for people who want to vote , we should be the most open society when it comes to giving our citizens as many options as possible to vote , and moving Election Day from a weekday to a weekend makes a lot of sense .
We can't speak of our cherished democracy around the world if we are n't willing to improve it every chance we get .

WINNIPEG , Manitoba ( Reuters ) - A garbage sorting plant in Edmonton , Alberta will be home to an ethanol facility that will turn 100,000 tonnes of plastic , cardboard and paper into the fuel additive starting in 2010 , an official involved in the project said on Friday .
The C$ 70 - million ( $ 69.3 - million ) plant will produce 36 million liters of ethanol per year , making it the world ’s first industrial scale ethanol plant using waste as a feedstock , said Don Pierce of Greenfield Ethanol .
“ Clearly in any new area , you ’ve got to walk before you run , ” Pierce said , noting the plant ’s production will be small compared with grain - based ethanol facilities .
Privately held Greenfield produces 350 million liters of ethanol at plants in Ontario and Quebec , and is developing other projects in Eastern Canada .
It will start by shipping waste from Edmonton to a 4 - million - liter demonstration plant in Westbury , Quebec , being built by its partner , Enerkem Inc , Pierce said .
The city of Edmonton and the Alberta government are contributing C$ 20 million to the facility , he said .

TIJUANA , Mexico ( Reuters ) - U.S. and Mexican entrepreneurs with an eye for a quick buck are buying subsidized fuel in bulk in Mexico and hauling it across the U.S. border to make big profits , officials say .
A sign at a gas station shows the price of premium gasoline , called magna in Mexico , at 7.53 pesos per liter , equivalent to around $ 2.71 per gallon , while indicating that just across the border in the United States regular gasoline costs 16.00 pesos per liter , or around $ 5.76 per gallon , in the border town of Tijuana , June 19 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Jorge Duenes
With a yawning gap between the cost of Mexico ’s state - subsidized fuel and record U.S. pump prices , tanker truck owners and people doing business on the border are filling up tanks or plastic barrels with Mexican fuel and selling it in the United States .
Gasoline in Mexico is around a third cheaper than in the United States .
For diesel , prices are more than double -- well over $ 4 a gallon in U.S. border states compared to just over $ 2 in Mexican border cities .
“ It is true tanker trucks are coming from the United States to fill up with supplies in Mexico , ” Mario Osuna , the head of Mexico ’s consumer watchdog agency Profeco in Baja California state where Tijuana is the capital , said on Thursday .
“ There is no way of sanctioning foreigners who come to Tijuana and buy gasoline to sell in their country , ” Osuna told Reuters .
“ Mexico does not have regulations relating to that . ”
Border residents who have spotted the price anomaly are jumping on the export bandwagon , taking containers of fuel over the border in pickup trucks to sell .
“ We cannot deny that this type of small - scale contraband is going on , ” said Joaquin Avina , president of the Association of Gas Stations of Tijuana , Tecate and Rosarito .
“ The obligation of the ( gasoline ) companies is to sell its product -- whether it ’s being used to burn down a house or take it and sell it in the United States , ” he added .
Low Mexican prices had already attracted U.S. motorists who are driving over the border to fill up their tanks .
The extra demand has caused shortages at hundreds of Mexico ’s border gas stations , some of which are rationing fuel .
President Felipe Calderon has promised to maintain fuel subsidies that are expected to cost the government close to $ 20 billion this year as world oil prices soar .
GUATEMALANS LUG BARRELS BY RIVER
The cheap prices have also sparked fuel hawking at Mexico ’s southern border with Guatemala , people living in the area say .
Hundreds of people have been lugging fuel across a border river in plastic barrels placed on inflated inner tubes as makeshift boats .
Some swim , dragging the barrels behind them .
Once across the border , the fuel is sold at roadside stalls , with the importers charging around $ 1.50 per gallon more than the price in Mexico , still lower than gas stations on the Guatemalan side of the border , which have mostly closed .
Carmela Mejia , a single mother in the town of Malacatan just over the border from Mexico , now sells gasoline at her fruit stall after seeing her sales would rise .
“ I got a loan to buy gasoline from Mexico and this is how I earn a few cents to maintain my three children , ” she said .
A lack of domestic refining capacity means Mexico has to import 40 percent of its gasoline despite being a major oil producer , but the cost of fuel imports has soared .
Deputy Energy Minister Jordy Herrera said this week the government was working on a plan to stop the Mexican subsidies going to benefit U.S. consumers .
“ We are working hard with the border states and Pemex to come up with some scheme in which only Mexican consumers see the benefit of this administered price , ” Herrera told the daily Milenio , noting fuel demand has jumped in Baja California .
El Semanario online newspaper said Mexican fuel can be sold legally in the United States with government permits .
Energy ministry officials were not available for comment , and the economy ministry did not return calls .

色々あって GC に興味がちょっと出たので色々見てました。とりあえずまとまった日本語資料としては以下の
PDF が一番良いように思いました。 kinaba さんがちょっと前に言及しておられたえんどう豆的でない方の遠藤さんが書いた文章らしい。
http://matsu-www.is.titech.ac.jp/~endo/gc/gc.pdf
これをざーと読んでいくと、すごくためになって、色々わかるのですが、最後の方の 7.2 に、
筆者は、 parallel かつ concurrent な GC を、 Boehm GC を基にして実装している 。
とか書いてあって、そのちょっと前に concurrent GC ってのは要は別スレッドでちょいちょい GC 動かす実装で、 incremental GC の一種と考えられて、要 write barrier 。とか書いてあるわけです。でこれってちょっと考えるとどうやってやるのか不明気味な感が強いんです。なんでかっていうと、
Boehm GC ってターゲットの言語について知らない、 conservative GC って種類の GC で、ポインタっぽいものが見えたら全部ポインタだと考えて mark していくような実装。で mark されなかったものは sweep のフェーズで消しちゃう、と。で、 write barrier ってのは GC が mark してる最中にポインタがつけ変わっちゃったりするとあら大変なので、ポインタの書き換えが起きた時にこれ危ないから mark やりなおしねーというようなフラグを立てとくみたいな手法。でもまぁ普通に考えると
C 言語とかで変数代入が起きるたびになんか mark する、とかいうのはできない。つまり言語処理系は協力してくれないのね。
んでまさかメモリ保護とかちゃうよなーとか話しつつ調べてもらったところによると、
http://matsu-www.is.titech.ac.jp/~endo/papers/endo-ismm2002-gc.ppt
本当にメモリ保護らしい。つまり、
別スレッドでこっそり mark をしょぼしょ ぼ
mark しはじめる page は書き込み保護かけ る
もし write fault 起きて SIGSEGV 飛んだらその page に dirty flag を立ててメモリ保護外しとく。ここで外しとくからそんなに SEGV 地獄にはならんと 。
mark が終わったら final mark とかいうフェーズに突 入
このフェーズで dirty flag が立ってる page を mark しなおし。ちなみに final mark は全スレッドを止めて行うのでオーバヘッドになっちゃ う
あとは sweep 。これも裏でしょぼしょぼ 。
って感じみたい。あとは dirty page が増えてきたら protect しなおしてそこの mark をして final mark が遅くなりすぎないようにするとか、 final mark が timeout したら incremental mark をやりなおすとかそいう工夫があるらしい 。
いやーすごい人がいるもんだなぁと久しぶりに感動しました。なんていうかアイデアも実装もどっちもすごいですよね。なんかベンチ結果とかも異様にいいしなー。
コードとかも公開されているのでちょっと遊んでみたいなぁと思っています。

Caught off guard by recent Iraqi military operations , the United States is using spy satellites that ordinarily are trained on adversaries to monitor the movements of the American - backed Iraqi army , current and former U.S. officials say .
The stepped - up surveillance reflects breakdowns in trust and coordination between the two forces .
Officials said it was part of an expanded intelligence effort launched after American commanders were surprised by the timing of the Iraqi army ’s violent push into Basra three months ago .
The use of the satellites puts the United States in the unusual position of employing some of its most sophisticated espionage technology to track an allied army that American forces helped create , continue to advise , and often fight alongside .
The satellites are “ imaging military installations that the Iraqi army occupies , ” said a former U.S. military official , who said slides from the images had been used in recent closed briefings at U.S. facilities in the Middle East .
“ They ’re imaging training areas that the Iraqi army utilizes .
They ’re imaging roads that Iraqi armored vehicles and large convoys transit . ”

Military officials and experts said the move showed concern by U.S. commanders about whether their Iraqi counterparts would follow U.S. guidance or keep their coalition partners fully informed .
“ It suggests that we do n’t have complete confidence in their chain of command , or in their willingness to tell us what they ’re going to do because they may fear that we may try to get them not to do it , ” said John Pike , director of GlobalSecurity.org , a website about intelligence and military issues .
But the development was also seen as a sign the Iraqi army has reached a level of independence and competence that U.S. military planners had hoped it would achieve .
“ The bad news is we ’re spying on Iraqis , ” said the former military official .
“ The good news is that we have to . ”
Advertisement
The former military official and several other sources described the operation on condition of anonymity because of its sensitivity .
The Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies declined to comment .
However , the expanded satellite surveillance comes as the Iraqi military has embarked on a series of large - scale operations to reassert government control in areas , including Baghdad ’s Sadr City and the northern city of Mosul , that have been havens for hostile militias and insurgents .
The first of the operations , launched in March , was an assault in the southern city of Basra on elements of the Mahdi Army , a militia led by anti-American cleric Muqtada Sadr .
Among the forces Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki deployed were units that had just completed training and did not have a U.S. team assigned to them , which may help explain why American commanders were caught off guard .
Despite its tactical shortcomings , the operation has been portrayed as a major success , a demonstration that the Iraqi army , once viewed as ineffectual , if not incompetent , was emerging as a capable force .
Advertisement
Adm. Michael G. Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said last month : “ They moved a division inside a few days .
And a year ago the Iraqi security forces could never have moved those kinds of forces . ”
Iraq ’s parched terrain has been a focal point of U.S. spy satellites for nearly two decades .
Satellites were used to capture images of suspected chemical and biological weapons sites before the war , although the suspicions were proved unfounded , and continue to be used to track insurgent movements and the suspected influx of arms from Iran .
The satellites are part of a vast intelligence arsenal the U.S. has deployed in Iraq , including the CIA ’s largest overseas station , eavesdropping equipment that monitors much of the communications traffic , as well as Predator drones and other aircraft .
But in recent months , U.S. intelligence agencies have aimed the spacecraft ’s high - resolution lenses at Iraqi military positions and instructed imagery analysts to monitor those units for signs that they are preparing to deploy , officials said .

“ What the satellites can do that Predators ca n’t is they can see the country , ” the former official said .
“ They can detect big movements every day : That the Iraqi 4th infantry division is here .
That Iraqi special forces moved from here .
That there is a set of 12 vehicles congregated south of Samarra . ”
U.S. intelligence officials stressed that the satellites are not being diverted from other high - priority assignments -- including tracking terrorist and insurgent activity -- but are capturing additional images as part of routine sweeps .
Officials also emphasized that the surveillance did not reflect an adversarial relationship .
The two militaries continue to coordinate closely and conduct joint operations , officials said , with U.S. military training teams traveling with Iraqi army units .
The satellites provide U.S. officials with an independent means of tracking those movements .
But their use also reflects a gradual shift as the Iraqi government becomes more independent of its U.S. sponsor , and the two countries ’ interests diverge .
Iraq has recently taken steps , including providing a red- carpet reception in March for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , that demonstrate it does n’t intend to remain a U.S. client .

Even though the United States in effect installed the government of Iraq and helped build its institutions , U.S. spy agencies have been active in the country from the beginning , keeping close tabs on Iraqi politicians and influential groups .
Officials said the satellite surveillance was aimed to a large degree at making sure U.S. commanders know where the Iraqi army is operating so the two forces do n’t collide .
“ You have an independent army for an independent nation conducting independent operations , ” a senior U.S. intelligence official said .
“ To know where that army is so you do n’t have an unintended consequence would seem like a benefit . ”
American spy satellites are operated by the National Reconnaissance Office , a U.S. intelligence agency based in Chantilly , Va. , that is so secretive that its existence was not declassified until 1992 .
Rick Oborn , a spokesman for the NRO , declined to comment .
Advertisement
“ As a matter of policy , we do not discuss our taskings , ” Oborn said .
Officials declined to say where the request to use satellites to monitor the Iraqi army had originated .
Ordinarily , requests from commanders in Iraq are routed through the Pentagon ’s Defense Intelligence Operations Coordination Center before being sent to specific agencies such as the NRO .
Because the satellites are already in routine orbits over Iraq , getting images of Iraqi military positions probably does not require the spacecraft to be rerouted , only to be given new coordinates to photograph .
For decades , U.S. satellites were one of the nation ’s primary ways of tracking the military activities of the former Soviet Union .
But U.S. intelligence officials said the United States also has a long history of monitoring the militaries of even close allies .

“ I can count on one hand those countries -- and they are our closest allies -- where collection is not employed against them , ” said a former high - ranking U.S. intelligence official who had a major role in setting collection priorities .
Experts said the Iraq surveillance probably involved what are known as Keyhole satellites , spacecraft the size of a school bus that orbit about 170 miles above the Earth ’s surface and are equipped with optical and infrared lenses that can capture high - resolution images day or night .
The NRO is believed to operate at least six of these satellites , which travel over Iraq frequently enough to provide updated photos at least four times a day , said Jeffrey T. Richelson , an expert on satellites and senior fellow at the National Security Archive , a research institute at George Washington University .
Pictures from the latest versions of the Keyhole cover about three square miles of surface area , Richelson said , producing images detailed enough to allow analysts to spot a license plate , but probably not read its numbers .

Find cow ?

Food core ?
We all sat round trying to work out what was written next to my name on the office whiteboard , my task for the week .
Wait , I remember : ‘ Find love ’ .
That ’s it .
I have to find love in a videogame .
This actually makes sense .
Not many girls play videogames , which makes them an incredibly efficient social filter : you instantly cut out the majority of girls who have little interest in games and would only get sick of you talking about them all the time .
Finding love is probably a bit strong – really the short term objective is to meet interesting , single people of the appropriate gender and age .
What happens from there is probably too personal to generalise about .
EVE Online
Naturally the first place I thought to look was space .
Space has everything in it .
But EVE
Online might be a challenge – its developers themselves admit “ women do n’t want to be spaceships ” .
I do n’t know about you , but I do n’t think I could love a woman who did n’t , just a little bit , somewhere deep down , want to be a spaceship .
Since my existing EVE characters were all startlingly attractive women , and that might attract the wrong crowd , I decided to create a new one .
I chose a Gallente , since they ’re broadly the most fetching of EVE ’s bloodlines .
An Activist ’s ancestry , for a boost to my Charisma stat , and a Military Spec - Ops profession , to appear manly yet mysterious .
Designing my character ’s look was trickier : EVE ’s character creation tool is sumptuous , but the outfits , backdrops and faces on offer are geared more towards camp , mass - murdering plexiglass fetishists than chisel - jawed studs .
Early on I decided to veto any backdrops involving skulls .
No hairstyles involving translucent plastic restraints over more than 60 % of my face .
No warpaint that resembled the blood or any other fluid of past conquests – military or romantic .
Take that off , put away the goat skulls and get a haircut
Once a female staffer had approved of my neatly trimmed facial hair , suggestively arched eyebrow and wry smile , all I needed was a name .
Something with as many bold and handsome connotations as possible , while still sounding faintly like a space pilot .
Meet Cad Dashing .
A man who could truthfully introduce himself over a space - martini as “ Dashing , Cad . ”
The Extremely Suggestible demographic would be all over me .
He had sensible hair , his implants were n’t showing and he was pictured against a skulless bachelor pad wall – I considered him a success .
I headed straight to the local asteroid belt to pick up chicks .
I ’d decided early on that I would only initiate conversation with female avatars , ask early on whether they were also female in reality , and take their word for it either way .
Research suggests that a little over half the female characters you ’ll meet in a typical MMORPG are women in real life ( Nick Yee , www.nickyee.com/eqt/genderbend.html).
The main reason male gamers do n’t see many female gamers is that so many react so childishly or obnoxiously when they do .
Most girl gamers have learnt not to shout about it .
An intriguingly blue - lipsticked woman was mining Veldspar ore from the asteroids of Duripant I – Belt I . I locked onto Ms Kasteen Hawkeye and set my ship to ‘ Approach ’ .
This is how flirting will work in the future .
As I confidently crossed the asteroid belt to her , I selected ‘ Capture Portrait ’ on her profile , which saves an image of the character .
The best place to meet ladies is your local asteroid belt
But behind the progress bar for that , a dialogue box popped up .
The question it was asking me was obscured , but it sounded like one I ’d want to say yes to : one option was “ Accept the invitation and add Kasteen Hawkeye to my personal address book . ”
Clearly , Cad ’s rakish appearance had intrigued her , but the interface was unresponsive .
This progress bar was blocking everything .
This is how flirting will fail in the future .
Cad Dashing is not the kind of space - rogue to be deterred by such setbacks , particularly with such a forward lady .
I restarted EVE , headed back to the Belt , and found I had an in - game email from Kasteen .
“ Hey ! ^^ ” it read .
I believe the twin circumflex indicates a raising of the eyebrows – a suggestive one , some neo-linguistics scholars posit .
“ Sorry about that . ” I replied .
“ EVE crashed while I was attempting to capture your portrait . ”
I thought about this in Cad Dashing mode for a moment .
“ Clearly you ’re too beautiful , ” I added .
By the time I arrived back at the Belt , I ’d had a reply : “ lol ^^ ” .
This was a space - dame of excellent taste .
I drifted over to her ship , and we sat .
Her mining laser sipped at a classy Scordite , mine the more basic Veldspar .
“ So , ” I started , “ mine here often ? ”
“ Just since last night lol ” .
Quickly we get into a debate about converting in - game currency into real money to pay the subscription fee , which I end with “ And it takes money to make more money , so selling your in - game currency on a regular basis seriously impairs your profitability .
By the way , are you female in real life ? ”
“ Orite ^^ & yea i am Lol : p ” .
Wow , I got an eyebrow raise , a laugh with a capital L and a protruding tongue .
Picturing this salvo of facial responses was confusing , but I think the overall impression is positive .
I ’d assumed this question would be the most problematic , both to ask without seeming sleazy and to get a positive response to , but Kasteen evidently thought little of it .
I think I tacked it onto our finance talk pretty subtly , but I also wanted to suggest that I had a reason for asking .
“ The developers say girls do n’t want to be spaceships .
But I guess you do ? ”
“ I love space & roleplaying games ^ ^ ”
“ Wow , are you single ? ”
“ no ... odd question to ask though ”
This is true .
In retrospect , it ’s a much more sleazy thing to ask than a person ’s real - life gender .
I told the truth , but not the whole truth : “ That ’s just my automatic response when a girl expresses an interest in space and roleplaying games . ”

Every night at dusk in this wealthy California coastal town , Barbara Harvey puts down food for her golden retrievers , Phoebe and Ranger , and watches as they go for their evening walk .
Not long afterwards , the 66 - year - old mother - of - three clambers into the back of her white Honda CR - V , pulls up a blanket , and beds down for the night , snuggling next to her beloved dogs for comfort .
“ For the most part I sleep okay , ” says Harvey .
“ But it is very cramped .
And my dogs are big .
The CR - V was n’t designed for people to sleep in . ”
This was not quite the old age Harvey had been hoping for .
Until recently she rented an apartment that featured a garden bristling with roses and heavy with the scent of jasmine .
But when Harvey ’s job as a 37,000 - dollar - a- year ( 23,600 euros ) notary evaporated in the US sub - prime mortgage crisis , she found herself penniless and destitute in a town where the average price of a home is one million dollars .
Harvey ’s nightly “ home ” now is the quiet carpark of the historic Santa Barbara Mission , one of 12 sites around the town that is part of a safe parking program run by a non-profit outreach group , New Beginnings .
According to Michael Stoops , executive director of the Washington - based National Coalition for the Homeless , Harvey ’s experience is not exceptional .
“ We are receiving reports from different agencies and individuals in the field that it is becoming more common , ” Stoops said .
“ It ’s definitely a trend .

Nine out of ten regular food items aimed specifically at children have a poor nutritional content – because of high levels of sugar , fat or sodium - according to a detailed study of 367 products published in the July issue of the UK - based journal Obesity Reviews .
Just under 70 per cent of the products studied - which specifically excluded confectionery , soft drinks and bakery items - derived a high proportion of calories from sugar .
Approximately one in five ( 23 per cent ) had high fat levels and 17 per cent had high sodium levels .
Despite this , 62 per cent of the foods with poor nutritional quality ( PNQ ) made positive claims about their nutritional value on the front of the packet .
" Children 's foods can now be found in virtually every section of the supermarket and are available for every eating experience " says Professor Charlene Elliott from the University of Calgary , Canada , and a Trustee of the Canadian Council of Food and Nutrition .
" Parents may have questions about which packaged foods are good for their children .
Yet certain nutritional claims may add to the confusion , as they can mislead people into thinking the whole product is nutritious . "
Only 11 per cent of the products Professor Elliott and her colleagues evaluated provided good nutritional value in line with the criteria laid down by the US - based Center for Science in the Public Interest ( CSPI ) , a non-profit agency that received the Food and Drug Administration 's highest honour in 2007 .
The CSPI nutritional standards state that healthy food should not derive more than 35 per cent of its calories from fat ( excluding nuts and seed and nut butters ) and should have no more than 35 per cent added sugar by weight .
They also provide guidance on sodium levels , ranging from 230 mg per portion for snacks through to 770 mg per portion for pre-prepared meals .
CSPI 's standards are adapted from those developed by the National Alliance for Nutrition and Activity , a coalition of some 300 health and nutrition organisations in the USA .
The organisation states that its standards represent a compromise approach .
They allow for the marketing of products that may not be nutritionally ideal , but that provide some positive nutritional benefits that could help children meet the US Government 's Dietary Guidelines for Americans .
The 367 products included in the study were bought from a national supermarket chain stocking 50,000 food and non-food items in December 2005 .
Each had to meet very specific criteria .
" We included food products and packaging that were presented in such a way that children were the clear target audience " explains Professor Elliott , whose research was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .
" They included products that promoted fun and play , had a cartoon image on the front of the box or were linked to children 's films , TV programmes and merchandise . "
Each product was subjected to a 36 - point analysis that included the nutritional content and how the packaging was designed to appeal to children and their parents .
Key findings included :
-- 63 per cent of all the products surveyed made some sort of nutritional claim , including 62 per of the products that could be classed as poorly nutritious , due to high levels of sugar or fat or sodium .
A low percentage ( eight per cent ) carried some kind of nutrition mark or seal .
Other claims included that products were low fat , a source of calcium , contained no artificial flavours or colours or provided a number of essential nutrients .
-- Products with high sugar levels accounted for 70 per cent of the goods with PNQ .
Despite this , 68 per cent included some sort of nutritional claim on the package , such as a source of whole grains , source of iron or low in fat .
Cereals and fruit snacks were particularly likely to make nutritional claims and have high levels of sugar .
-- Just under 23 per cent of the products had PNQ because of their high fat content .
Yet 37 per cent had some sort of nutritional claim on the package .
For example peanut butter mixed with chocolate claimed to be a " source of six essential nutrients " and a pizza product claimed to be a " source of calcium " .
-- High sodium levels meant that 17 per cent of the products analysed were classified as being of PNQ .
Despite this , almost 34 per cent made some sort of nutritional claim on the package .
Crackers and pizza products were among the worst offenders .
-- A fifth of the products featured a cartoon image engaged in some sort of healthy physical activity on the front and a quarter showed these on the back or side of the box .
Activities included skateboarding , basketball and biking .
" Assessing the levels of sugar in the selected food products was a methodological challenge , because milk sugars and fruit sugars occur naturally in foods " says Professor Elliott .
" The Nutrition Facts label only displays total sugars and the quantity of added sugars is not always provided by the manufacturer .
" This means that the percentage of foods categorised as poorly nutritious due to high levels of sugar is higher than it would have been if information on naturally occurring sugars had been available . "
The problem of accurately separating figures for quantities of natural and added sugars in manufactured products has also been encountered by other researchers and acknowledged as an issue by CSPI , so it is not unique to this study .
" Despite this , the findings still give us cause for concern " says Professor Elliott .
" While caregivers are likely to purchase products that they hope their children will like , it clearly can result in a less nutritious diet than they may realise .
Having a healthy diet is especially important given the current rates of childhood obesity . "
Excess body weight affects up to 35 per cent of children across Canada , the United States and Europe and is linked to a range of health problems including type 2 diabetes , high blood pressure , heart disease and some forms of cancer .
Overweight children can also suffer from psychological and social consequences because of their weight .
Professor Elliott believes that policy attention needs to be directed towards the nutritional claims made by products aimed at children and the images they use to sell the products .
" If a parent sees a product that makes specific nutritional claims , they may assume that the whole product is nutritious and our study has shown that that is definitely not true in the vast majority of cases " concludes Professor Elliott .
" Using cartoon characters engaged in sport can also create the illusion of a healthy product . "

Disclosure ( or reminder ) : I am an investment banker for the energy sector .
I do a lot of work with the wind sector , as the posts in my wind power series attest , but not only .
Whether a pipeline or a wind farm , the job of a project financier is to ensure that the projects make sense for all interested parties ( including the regulator ) in the long run , and wind projects have to meet the same hurdles as other power plants or oil fields .
Thus I 'm supposed to remain level - headed when discussing wind projects !
The short answer is : while 100 % is probably unrealistic , it 's not unreasonable to expect to be able to get pretty close to that number ( say , in the 50 - 90 % range ) in that timeframe , and it is very likely that it makes a LOT of sense economically .
Al Gore has made a major speech in Washington this morning , setting out an ambitious goal for the USA to produce all of its electricity from carbon - free sources by 2020 .
I thought I 'd comment on the technical feasibility of the plan , and the underlying economics of such an endeavour .
Today , the USA generates roughly 4,000 TWh of electricity from close to 1,000 GW of installed capacity :
It is important to note right away that MWs of capacity and MWhs of generated electricity are by no means proportional .
There is more gas - fired capacity than coal - fired capacity ( 440 GW vs 330 GW ) , but coal - fired plants generate two and a half times more power ( 2,000 TWh vs 800 TWh ) .
It is useful to note in that respect that the capacity utilisation of non-hydro renewables are pretty close to that of the overall system ( with 100 TWh generated from 26GW of capacity in 2006 ) .
Today , a plan to be in a position to generate between 2,000 and 3,000 TWh of electricity from renewables ( taking into account the 1,000 TWh per year provided by nuclear and hydro , which are expected to remain in place ) will necessarily focus to a large extent on the large - scale development of wind farms , which is the only renewable technology which is already industrially tested and has a levelised generation cost in the same range as today 's conventional power sources , in the single - digit cent - per - kilowatthour range .
Solar is likely to play its part as well : it will keep on growing massively from its current low levels , but more effort is still required to bring its cost down from the current 20 -30c / kWh range , something which is expected to happen in the next decade .
Source : McKinsey Global Institute
For the simplicity of this discussion , I will focus on wind , given that it presents a bigger challenge on the intermittency front ( which the inclusion of solar can only help improve ) , and that it would drive the ecohnomics of such a plan given its larger scale deployment .
The main questions , of course are as follows :
1 ) is it technically feasible to build the requisite capacity within 12 years ?
2 ) what will it cost , and what will it mean for power prices ?
3 ) how can the intermittency issue be dealt with ?
Technical feasibility
To get 2,000 TWh of electricity from wind , roughly 800GW of wind power capacity would be needed , considering that windfarms would get an annual production equivalent to 2,500 full hours ( a pretty conservative estimate , given that the existing wind farms are closer to 3,000 hours today ) .
800 GW is roughly equal to 30 times the currently installed capacity ( which should reach about 23GW at the end of this year ) and 100 times the capacity installed in 2008 ( expected to be close to 8,000 MW , after 5,000 MW were installed in 2007 ) .
To build 800 GW in 12 years would require a significant increase in annual installations - but actually not an unrealistic one .
The Department of Energy recently published a study about bringing wind power to 20 % of total generation , which provides the following timeframe :
This is for a less ambitious plan : 300GW by 2030 , so you 'd roughly have to quadruple that to get to 800GW by 2020 , but one might note that the DoE only expects 4GW to be built in 2008 , ie less than the reality without any big plan to boost things up ...
A realistic target would be to have 80 GW of installations , ie 10 times this year 's level , within 5 years .
That would give the time to ramp up production , by building factories , training workers , and ensuring that the supply chain follows suit .
What would make this possible is for the industry to have the certainty that the investment are required .
What has hampered the development of the industry has been the regulatory uncertainty , in particular in the US with the long saga of the timely renewal ( or not ) of the PTC ( " production tax credit " , the federal 10 - year tax credit equal to 2c / kWh for power from renewable sources ) , which caused demand to crash and then brutally rebound from one year to the other .
This caused installed capacity to collapse several times in the past few years in the US , causing mayhem in the industry worldwide :
Source : AWEA
With predictable , guaranteed demand over the next decade , the industry could step up its investments across the supply chain in order to provide the requisite number of generators .
The technology is understood , it calls upon industries that are much larger than the pure wind sector ( mechanical engineering and civil works , mainly ) and which have a large employment pool .
Access to resources is tight today , as it across all industry , but we 're not talking world - changing volumes either ( for instance , if you count about 50 tons of steel per MW , you 'd need 4 millon tons of steel per year , ie less than a percent of total world production ) .
And again , a strategic plan with predictable production figures and guaranteed demand would allow to lock in supplies early on in the process , providing stability ( and early cahsflows ) to all suppliers down the chain .
In terms of wind resources , the USA has more than enough potential to find enough sites to install such capacity with wind resources providing cost competitive production , as noted in the DoE report ( which alos notes that more than 1,000 GW could be connected to the existing grid at low cost ) :
Altogether , the plan would require boosting investment in wind production capacity to about $ 100 - 150 billion per year , a significant number but hardly one that would require a complete retooling of the US economy .
With a stable regulatory framework ( presumably provided if this were made a national priority ) and guaranteed demand ( which could come via very simple mechanisms , like a feed - in tariffs , ie mandatory purchases by local utilities at regulated rates ) , there is absolutely no reason to doubt that this could be done .
I 'll address the requirement to boost the grid separately below .
the economics of such a plan
Wind power economics are quite simple : most of the levelised production cost per MWh comes from the initial investment .
It is thus naturally sensitive to investment costs , and even more so to financing costs , both of which are determined at the time of construction .
Once a windfarm is built , its production costs are essentially set for the rest of its operating life , ie 20 - 25 years .
The fixed nature of its cost base makes it a difficult bet in a deregulated universe , where prices can swing wildy ( including to low prices that can be insufficient for the windfarm to service its debt burden , thus the requirement for feed - in tariffs or similar mechanisms to guarantee a floor to wind electricity ) .
But such fixed prices make wind a great proposition at times of increasing oil&gas costs : wind power prices will NOT increase even if oil & gas or coal prices continue to go up , as is quite possible .
Thus wind power is a wonderful hedge against future energy prices .
And given that today it already costs less than power from a ges- fired plant ( the plants that typically drive the price of electricity on wholesale markets ) , it is both competitive and likely to remain so in the coming years .
And given the cost structure of wind , a very simple way for government to support wind at very little cost would be to provide funding for the sector at low interest rates .
One big advantage of government is its ability to borrow at lower rates - indeed , government sets the lowest rates that are by the rest of the economy .
By passing on its low cost of funding to wind developments , the final cost of wind power could be lowered significantly , and passed on to consumers ( banks would still be required to hold onto operational and other risks linked to wind production , they would just get cheaper funding for that specific purpose , which the 'd have to fully pass on to projects .
Germany has successfully used such a mechanism for years ) .
Studies in Germany and Denmark show that wind power lowers wholesale prices by 30 to 70 % when wind blows , and that the overall savings for consumers far outstrip the cost of guaranteeing to wind producers a regulated tariff .
Ironically , the more wind power there is in the system , and the lower the wholesale marker price will be most of the time , which means that the regulated tariff remains a necessity to ensure that wind producers are able to pay off the debt linked to their initial investment .
But that regulated tariff is known , is realtively low , and , again , will not need to increase over time , thus ensuring to consumers similarly stable retail prices .
If anything , wind is likely to stabilise prices , or even bring them down whatever the prices of oil , natural gas or coal .
Also , as the DoE report notes , beyond the potential benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions , switching to wind would have massive advantages in terms of lower water use for the power sector .
The DoE study concluded that the cost of strengthening the grid would be around $ 20 billion in today 's dollars .
Given the larger scale of the Gore plan compared to the DoE plan , a cost of $ 100 billion for grid reinforcement seems a reasonable estimate , which would represent less than 5 % of the total investment programme , and thus have a similarly minor impact on ultimate production costs .
Dealing with intermittency
Of course , the big question with such an ambitious plan is how to deal with the intrinsic intermittency of wind power , which may not be available when electricity is actually needed .
Given that power is almost impossible to store ( except where hydro is available on a large scale , and pending potential progress on batteries ) , this is a very real issue .
But there are actually several answers to that :
one is that , provided that the network is able to shift electricity around , you can rely on the fact that the USA has several independent wind regimes , and thus that there will almost always be wind somewhere that can be carried around .
Obviously , this does mean a serious effort to reinforce the network , and to connect the now mostly separate regional grids , but that 's precisely where the federal government could have a decisive say within such a plan , and push a reinforcement and development of the grid on a coordinated national basis .
As a good example coming from a territory which is much smaller than the USA , ( but which also has at least 3 independent wind regions )
I note that the French grid operator , RTE , long extremely wary of wind power and its unreliability , had this to say in its latest annual report ( big PDF , in French , see p.49 ) :
The second point is about wind 's contribution to peak demand : despite wind 's intermittency , wind farms reduce the need in thermal power plants to ensure the requisite level of supply security .
One can speak of substituted capacity .
The capacity substitution rate ( ratio of thermal capacity replaced to installed wind capacity ) is close to the average capacity factor of wind farms in winter ( around 30 % ) for a small proportion of wind in the system ( a few GW ) .
It goes down as that proportion increases , but remains above 20 % with around 15 GW of wind power .
Similarly , the UK network operator put up a report that noted that the expected intermittency of the national wind portfolio would not appear to pose a technical ceiling on the amount of wind generation that may be accommodated and adequately managed .
The DoE , in its own study , hasidentified the improvements that would be require to the network to absorb more wind power and be able to use it around the country :
;
; the second answer is that spare capacity will be needed occasionally , and that this is actually not a big deal .
As noted at the beginning of this post , gas - fired capacity is already used at much lower overall rates than coal - fired plants .
They can be kept in place .
With 440 GW of gas - fired capacity , and taking into account the oil - based , nuclear and hydro capacity , demand can be assured at pretty much any point in the demand curve even without wind .
The important thing to note is that keeping that capacity in place does not mean using it .
MWH substitution does not require MW substitution to the same extent :
from the UK study linked to above Carbon emissions come from using the capacity , not from keeping it available .
Using that capacity every now and then will generate some emissions , but that will only represent a small fraction of today 's emissions , especially supposing that it is coal - fired capacity that is eliminated thanks to the arrival of wind and solar .
And as many gas - fire plants are already geared , to a large extent , to be used only for fractions of the time , their economics will easily tolerate such use .
It should also be noted that the production profile of solar and of offshore wind matches electricity demand a lot better than onshore wind , so their development ( which I ma voluntarily ignoring here ) will further help in that respect ;

It should also be noted that the production profile of solar and of offshore wind matches electricity demand a lot better than onshore wind , so their development ( which I ma voluntarily ignoring here ) will further help in that respect ; the third answer is that there are a number of small changes to electricity consumption patterns that can be used to reduce the requirement for peak capacity .
Industry has long agreed to sign interruptible contracts , benefitting from lower prices for power in exchange for the right by the utilities or the network to cut them off at short notice ; a lot of our power consumption is not time sensitive and could thus also be made to switch off in times of need .
And this is an area where government could easily play a role , by mandating standards for all electricity consuming equipment , making them able to " talk " to the network and indicate their status ( not interruptible , interruptible at identified times , interruptible at will ) .
Overall , network operators with actual wind experience seem confident that a combination of additional investment , smart grid management , and maintaining available ( but not using much ) a large gas - fired capacity can make it possible to cope with large amounts of wind power in the system .
While a goal of 100 % of carbon - free electricity is probably unrealistic , it therefore seems possible to get pretty close to that , especially if nuclear and hydro are included in the mix .
A plan that announced a specific goal of 40 - 50 % of wind - generated electricity by 2020 and 10 - 20 % of solar , with the appropriate feed - in mechanisms , demand guarantees for manufacturers and investment in the grid would therefore be realistic , make economic sense , and fulfill two major strategic goals : reduce carbon emissions , and lower fossil fuel demand .
Why John McCain's " Surge " Success Story Is A Lie
Mr. Palermo is Associate Professor of American History at CSU , Sacramento .
He 's the author of two books on Robert F. Kennedy : In His Own Right ( 2001 ) and RFK ( 2008 ) .
It really makes the Iraq debate easy for John McCain when he throws around words like " win " and " victory " and " prevail " and " success " without really defining what they mean .
A short time ago he was calling for American troops to remain in Iraq forever and that Obama was " naive " for suggesting otherwise .
Now that the Iraqi government has indicated its desire for the American troops to leave Iraq by the end of 2010 , McCain has gone dovish crediting his own insight for the " surge " that " won " the war .
He even hinted today that American troops might be able to come home after all .
But McCain 's stance totally contradicts the substance of the " status of force " agreement the Bush Administration has been trying to ram down the Iraqi government 's throat , which would codify a permanent American military presence in Iraq .
General David Petraeus told Barack Obama during his recent trip to Iraq that he opposes a " timetable " for the withdrawal of American troops because he wants to maintain " flexibility . "
I guess Petraeus did n't get the memo from the George W. Bush - John McCain camp .
The editors of the New York Times opinion page asked McCain to rework his most recent submission .
They demanded that he at least define what he means by " winning " in Iraq and what such a " victory " would look like on the ground .
It is a welcome , if belated , arrival into the " reality - based community " on the part of the Times .
( Of course , they still have David Brooks , Thomas Friedman , and William Kristol ) .
McCain is going to have some major editing work to do .
He must not only declare that the " surge " was a great success , but he has to argue that it was such a magnificent " victory " that an American troop reduction might be in order ( this comes after McCain denounced Obama repeatedly for making this same argument ) .
When McCain is n't talking about non-existent countries like " Czechoslovakia , " or non-existent frontiers , like the " Iraq - Pakistan border , " he 's smugly dressing down Obama on foreign relations .
The Rightwing is whining about the positive press coverage Obama is getting on his trip , but if Obama referred to " Czechoslovakia " or to the " Iraq - Pakistan border " the media would have plunged his campaign into deep doo doo .
It is disingenuous and self - serving for McCain to begin all of his discussions about Iraq with the January 2007 " surge . "
In doing so , he is airbrushing out the inconvenient history of the war .
Let 's review .
In January 2007 , when George W. Bush decided to pour more American soldiers into Iraq and escalate the U.S. troop commitment there he was responding to domestic politics .
The Democrats were about to take over both houses of Congress and the Baker - Hamilton Commission Report had issued an indictment of the administration 's lack of a diplomatic track in ending the conflict .
Defiant , petulant , and immature as ever , Bush launched what his handlers called a " surge " to lock in the policy as the Democrats took their places on Capitol Hill and to show his Uncle Jim and his Daddy that he did n't need or want their advice .
By January 2007 , the occupation in Iraq had long been a strategic and humanitarian disaster .
There was already widespread " low intensity " ethnic cleansing , and with the February 22 , 2006 destruction of the Shia Al - Askari Mosque in Samarra there was unleashed a sectarian bloodbath that transformed the country .
The Shia government , which controlled the Interior Ministry and much of the security apparatus , went on a rampage and shielded freelance death squads and militias that reaped their revenge on Sunni communities throughout the country .
In a short period , the ancient city of Baghdad went from being mostly Sunni to being mostly Shia .
There were 2 million people who fled the country and another 2 million internally displaced people .
It was n't very long ago Iraqis were torturing each other with Black & Decker power drills .
I doubt if the underlying current of hate and the cycle of revenge have dissipated .
But after the dust settled there was relative calm .
It had nothing to do with the " surge . "
Any " success " that McCain or Bush or Kenneth Pollack or Michael O'Hanlon or Michael Gordon or David Petraeus and all the rest of the war - hawks talk about is delusional because it is proclaimed by willfully ignoring the humanitarian costs ; the price in blood and treasure the Iraqis have paid , and to a far lesser extent , the Americans too .
McCain is celebrating a Pyrrhic victory .
The United States destroyed Iraq in order to save it .
Just take a look at Falluja , or Baghdad with its hideous blast walls and check points .
That place will never be the same .
In a just world the United States would pay reparations to Iraq for a hundred years .
( Do n't take my word for it , read Patrick Cockburn 's Muqtada , and Jonathan Steele 's Defeat . )
Let 's review some more .
First , the Senate Intelligence Committee 's " Phase II " investigation of the lead - up to the war confirms that the Bush Administration used deception , lies , and misleading statements to hoodwink the public and the Congress into buying the idea that attacking Iraq served American national security interests .
The Bush Administration lied this nation into war .
Its principal mouthpieces and behind - the - scenes operators should be held accountable for their crimes , which include perjury , obstruction of justice , and abuse of power .
( In addition to the international war crimes of aggressive war and torture . )
It was a disgrace that will forever besmirch the reputation of this nation .
I do n't see any " victory " there .
Second , this war has cost our nation at least $ 750 billion ( and counting ) and the entire financial burden has been thrown on to the national debt .
We 'll be paying this thing back , with interest , to the same Wall Street elites that we are currently bailing out as part of a " remedy " for the mortgage meltdown .
The 30,000 maimed American soldiers must be taken care of , and their health costs will soar with the cost of everything else .
The PTSD cases alone will cost this country dearly in ways that we cannot even anticipate at this time .
No " victory " there .
Third , all this talk of " success " in Iraq masks what the original aim of the war was supposed to be : Disarming the regime of Saddam Hussein of its " weapons of mass destruction . "
There was nothing to " disarm " because the Iraqi government had no weapons of mass destruction .
The United Nations weapons inspectors only cost about $ 50 million per annum and they should have been allowed to do their jobs .
Even if they were still in Iraq hunting for WMD right now it would have cost only about $ 300 million and the U.S. would have partners sharing the financial burden .
The things we could have done with all that money we 've wasted in Iraq .
Bush then changed the objective of the war to an elaborate nation building exercise , an endeavor we still have not accomplished and probably never will .
Democracy does not come out of a barrel of a gun .
I see nothing " victorious " here .
Fourth , about 1,200 private corporations have been shamelessly profiteering off the Iraq war from day one .
Halliburton 's graft crimes are legion , and we wo n't find out the extent of the shoddy services KBR provided our soldiers , or how many Iraqi civilians Blackwater killed , until a new Attorney General is sworn in , and maybe not even then .
" Win ? " I guess you could say the profiteers " won . "
With tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed and maimed in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere ; and with commentators like John Bolton , Benny Morris , and Charles Krauthammer demanding the United States or Israel attack Iran , thereby expanding the killing fields ; and with Pakistan 's Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) working hand - in - glove with resurgent Taliban and Al Qaeda elements in the northwestern border region and in Kashmir ; and with the Bush Administration 's failed saber rattling , warmongering , and unilateralist bluster --
Can we now safely conclude , at this late date , that Bush 's foreign policy has been a catastrophe for the world and the single biggest recruiting tool for international terrorists ?
It does n't smell like " victory " to me .

Reality is of no importance to those who so glibly destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives in this adventure which has ground down the US military and helped accelerate that country 's slide into bankruptcy .
There is no use in repeating what Palermo has written or go on about the dangerous situation the invasion has created for all of Iraq 's neighbors and the invaders themselves .
It has all been said before .
All I can add is that today 's petulant claims of success are as absurd in real time as Bush 's ' mission accomplished ' claim was in real time .
I continue asking myself a question I have asked since December 2000 : Is it possible to underestimate Americans of my generation ?
The answer is still no .
Even after racking up all the losses in blood , money , respect , and influence , a truly sick and utterly discredited ideology still trumps reality for those who claim to be ' the most important people in the world ' .

This violent diatribe by Mr. Palermo is so partisan and ugly there is no room to attempt to educate him .
Rodney Huff - 7/28/2008 John H. Kimbol ,
Bush did lie .
He and other White House officials said that it was a certainty Saddam had WMDs .
Bush and company said that Iraq posed an immediate threat to this country and clearly implied , if not stated explicitly , on several occassions that Saddam was in cahoots with Al Qaeda , thus suggesting falsely that Saddam had something to do with 9/11 .
All of these assertions were lies .
When Bush said there was certainty that Saddam had WMDs , there was actually a great deal of uncertainty in the intelligence community .
But not only did the Bush administration cherry pick the intelligence they would present in support of their policies , Cheney and Rumsfeld , not satisfied with CIA intelligence that contradicted what they wanted to hear , also created their own intelligence office deep in the belly of the Department of Defense .
There , they created their own " facts " and presented them as incontrovertible evidence of Iraqi WMDs .
These lies were intentional and showed a conscious desire on the part of the Bush administration to mislead Americans into an imperialist war of aggression .
Furthermore , the Center for Public Integrity has documented 935 false public statements made by the White House officials in the lead up to the war with Iraq .
http://projects.publicintegrity.org/WarCard/
And even the fraudulent 9/11 Commission said that there was no connection between Saddam and Al Qaeda .
It did n't even make sense to posit such a relationship , since Saddam was a secular dictator whom the religious fundamentalist Bin Laden considered to be one of his enemies .

Then , read Paul thompson 's Terror Timeline and see how the public record contradicts the Commission 's conclusions .
Follow the story of Sibel Edmonds and see how a network of corrrupt government officials and foreign moles can obtain nuclear secrtes from US government facilities and sell them to the likes of Pakistan , North Korea , Libya , and Iran .
See how another 9/11 - like event is likely to happen due to elements of the US government colluding with foreign agents .
Watch 9/11

Rodney Huff - 7/28/2008
The reason why many Americans have trouble questioning the official account of 9/11 - which is itself a conspiracy theory - is because the story we are told leaves intact cherished myths about America and its leadership .
To question the story , to point out the fraud of the 9/11 Commission , is to challenge the basic myth of America 's exceptional status in the world - the idea that certain things can't happen here , because , well , this is America !
This narcissistic attitude , based on a myth , signals a relaxing of one 's guard and a complacency that undermines the eternal vigilance required by genuine freedom from despotism .
It also signals a fear of learning the truth .
I suspect that knowing the truth of 9/11 may impose a burden and responsibility that most people prefer not to take up , because right now they are too busy pursuing their careers or too busy trying to make ends meet or too indifferent to become informed , politically engaged citizens .
The truth , of course , is that we do n't know the truth .
Our government has lied to us .
Any informed citizen who has taken the time to analyze the official 9/11 story knows it is false .
How could 9/11 have been the result of " a failure of imagination " when the White House received numerous warnings about specific threats involving domestic targets , including WTC and the Pentagon , and planes being used as weapons ?
( See Paul Thompson 's " The Terror Timeline " - a true history of what was known and when it was known based on news stories - all open source materials . )
Although we do not know exactly what happened on 9/11 , we can be sure that elements of this government had foreknowledge of the attack and allowed it to happen , and then they conspired to cover up their involvement .
Certainly , those involved are not all equally culpable .
Some probably had more knowledge of the plan than others .
Still , others probably carried out parts of the plan without knowing the true significance of what they were doing ; they may have been just following orders .
Objection :
There ’s no way anyone in this government was complicit in the 9/11 attacks ; too many people would have been involved .
Someone would have leaked .
In the sprawling bureaucratic labyrinth that characterizes many federal agencies , moles can and do establish themselves ( see Sibel Edmonds 's story http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X39zdgXSqs); and certainly many things can be done secretly in the darkest corners of the bureaucratic maze that is the State Department , the Department of Defense , Justice Department , etc .
The cloak of authority adds further insulation from discovery .
The authority to terminate investigations , classify communications , and simply make things happen , using foreign agents and unwitting accomplices , is all that is needed to keep something secret just long enough -- if not forever .
We also cannot underestimate the power of those involved to induce the cooperation of or coerce into silence those who , for whatever reason , would be inclined to come forward and face the firing squad .
In any case , there would be very strong incentives to not to come forward .
And , of course , the perpetrators could rely on a traumatized , unquestioning public to cling to the myth that their government would never do such a thing -- that criminals could never infiltrate the highest circles of power and coordinate a false flag attack to win public support for an imperialist war of agression .
That could never happen here .
This is America !
Rodney Huff - 7/28/2008
The author mentions in passing the ISI and its relationship to the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
This relationship is worth dwelling on because it can lead us to a true understanding of 9/11 , which has been used by this administration to justify massive increases in defense spending and two major wars .
A true understanding of 9/11 involves knowing the ISI 's role in funding this attack .
It also requires one to reject the official story of 9/11 contained in the 9/11 Commission 's Final Report .
A true understanding , then , involves knowing we 've been lied to .
The Commission 's Final Report reinforces a series of myths that function to conceal reality and derail any criticism of the official version of what happened .
A glaring example : The Final Report claims that the source of the funds for 9/11 is neither known nor important - two outrageous lies .
Shortly after 9/11 , the Times of India reported that Indian intelligence discovered that General Mahmoud Ahmad , head of Pakistan 's Inter - Services Inteligence ( ISI ) , ordered Ahmed Omar Sheikh to wire $ 100,000 to the lead 9/11 hijacker , Mahmud Atta , just before the attacks .
The Indian government relayed this information to the US , and the FBI confirmed it .

Furthermore , it IS important we know who paid for 9/11 .
How can this not be important ?
Did we not learn the importance of following the money trail from Watergate ?
James Robles - 7/27/2008
I have been a registered Democrat my entire life , and never , ever have I been so disappointed in my party .
Now , do n't mistake me , I dislike John McCain as much as the rest of you , however , in contrast , I do n't think Sen.
Obama has the integrity or honesty to lead our country .
Not to mention the fact that if he where to enact all of the " promises " he has been touting , we would be sitting on $ 850 Billion in new spending over the course of his first term .
Guess where that money is coming from ?
Not the rich .
Not the poor .
The middle class small business owner 's like myself who employ nearly half of the nation 's workers .
At least Hillary did the math and had a plan that made sense .
Obama is an impressive speaker , but the same could be said of any one of the number of speeches he has plagiarized since he started his campaign .
I am deeply disturbed by my party 's blindness to facts .
It 's unfortunate .
As far as Iraq , yes , we should n't have got in there , but we are there now .
Yes , it 's expensive .
Yes , it costs lives .
But it is our fault .
Democrats and Republicans alike .
We have a moral obligation to fix what we have broken .
Bottom line , Obama and McCain are both self serving politicians .
Comparing apples to apples , McCain is the better candidate for the job on both policy experience and integrity .
So , sadly , for the first time in my adult life , I am voting Republican this November .
God help us all .
James Lee Winningham - 7/27/2008
So because we are in Iraq now , we can completely absolve ourselves of how we got there .
There is one thing you are missing about the United States .
That is we did n't have democracy pushed down our throat .
Democrative movements are natural movements that must happen spontaneous and be VOLUNTARY .
Any kind of democracy anywhere will probably look different than ours and you can't force it down people 's throats .
No serious student can compare the sectarian violence and overall bloodbath in Iraq to the 11 years between the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution .
And with all due respect , if you knew more about your own history you would see that our movement was voluntary and it took a Declaration , a failed Articles of Confederation , a constitution and all problems in between and after to develop our Democracy ( and still developing over 200 years after the fact ) .
How long do you think it will take and how much blood and treasure to force this movement on a country with thousands of years of history we do not understand ?
As I would like our politicians to answer , what is " victory ? "
ex Democrat - 7/27/2008
Further proof that our state colleges have turned into academic wastelands .
This intellectually dishonest piece could be used in the war against tenure ( aka : Socialist 's Employment Act ) .
What an embarrassment .
John H. Kimbol - 7/26/2008 Dnn OH ,
President Bush did not " lie " .
Not everything you disagree with is a lie .
To throw your own question back at you , since you are so committed to our defeat in Iraq , why do n't you sign yourself up for a suicide mission and go out in a blaze of terrorist glory ?
John H. Kimbol - 7/26/2008
If anyone wonders why Americans hold professional academicians in such low regard , you just might find a clue in this dimwitted screed .
Dnn OH - 7/26/2008 David Dennis , I think it 's actually " Palermo " .
And exactly how does the RFK comment pertain to McCain being a total idiot and not knowing what the heck he 's talking about ?
Dnn OH - 7/26/2008 So Sandy Davis , since we 're now in the business of exporting Democracy and nation building , why are we not intervening in Darfur , where there are ongoing atrocities to the majority of the population far worse than the numbers that Saddam tortured ?
There are always , have always been , and always will be tyrants the world over .
Why was Saddam so important that we had to waste billions of dollars and countless lives while letting our own economy go to ruin ?
But then , you must think the economy is going swellingly ... or else it 's somehow the fault of the Democrats ... or the " liberal national media " ...
Bush LIED to get us into Iraq .
THAT is why it 's an issue that we 're over there NOW .
We had no business being over there , and the sooner we can get out the better .
Uninformed myopic people like you are the reason why we 're in the mess we 're in now .
If Iraq is so important , and you believe in this mythical victory so much , why do n't you go over there and see what aid you can render ?
David Dennis - 7/26/2008
You are two books and 30 years late on RFK .
Someone forgot to tell you that you are not important in the grand scheme of things , but , an opinion , we all have one of course .
Sandy Davis - 7/26/2008
I really wish people would stop whining about Iraq and the war we are in over there .
We are there , there is NOTHING you can do to change that and blaming Bush or anyone else for that matter wo n't help anything .
I get sick and tired of folks complaining about how long peace is taking in IRAQ .
Try reading the Summer of 1787 by David Stewart about when our Constitution was written .
Let 's see that is 11 years AFTER the Declaration of Independence was signed and the US was falling apart .
Freedom and democracy takes time , sacrifice and patience .
READ THE BOOK .
The parallels with IRAQ are almost uncanny .
Maybe if we knew more about our OWN history we would be more patient while the Iraqis determine theirs !
THE FACTS
Listerine may have its place in the medicine cabinet , but to some resourceful outdoors types , it has a second life .
Pour a couple of ounces in a spray bottle , the story goes , spritz it in the air at the next barbecue , and  presto !
 you have a cheap and pleasant - smelling mosquito barrier .

A primary ingredient in Listerine and several other commercial mouthwashes is eucalyptol , a natural oil that is also an active ingredient in botanical repellents .
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , oil of lemon eucalyptus is one of the most effective mosquito repellents , along with DEET and picaridin .

LUCERNE , Switzerland --
Double - amputee sprinter Oscar Pistorius fell short of the 400 - meter qualifying time he needed Wednesday to make the Olympics , though the personal best time he ran could still get him to Beijing in the relay .
The 21 - year - old South African shrugged off a pre-race distraction of threatened legal action against the IAAF and finished third in his heat in 46.25 seconds .
Though still outside the Olympic individual qualifying standard of 45.55 , it was 11 hundredths faster than his previous best .
" I am so excited and so happy .
I really enjoyed tonight , " Pistorius said .
" It was always going to be a very difficult task to achieve the individual time but there is still the hope of the relay . "
South Africa selectors will choose their team for the Aug. 8 - 24 Beijing Games by the weekend and can invite him to join the six - man roster for the 1,600 - meter relay .
To do so would defy a public request from the IAAF because the body believes his prosthetic legs are a threat to his own and other athletes ' safety .
" I think it is the IAAF 's last desperate attempt to try to get me not to qualify , " Pistorius said .
In May he won an appeal at the Court of Arbitration for Sport to overturn an IAAF ban which prevented him competing against able - bodied runners .
On Wednesday the New York legal firm of Dewey and Leboeuf , which steered that case , threatened a second legal action against the IAAF .
" We believe the IAAF is obligated to immediately advise the South African Federation and Olympic Committee that it has no objection to Mr. Pistorius competing in the 4x400 m relay at the Beijing Games , " it said in a statement .
It also demanded that the Monaco - based IAAF withdraw a further comment that it was concerned it did not have the resources to check on the legality of Pistorius '
Cheetah blade limbs every time he appeared at a meet .
The CAS ruling cleared him to run only when using the type of blade that was subjected to laboratory testing to prove it gave no competitive advantage .
" That kind of implies that I would cheat at events , " Pistorius said .
" It is very sad that they think that . "
" It is not my problem any more .
I have proved all I need to prove .
My job is to be on the track and enjoy what I do .
" There is nothing more satisfying to me than running times like I did tonight . "
NAIVASHA , Kenya ( AFP ) - Facing soaring electricity demands , Kenya is opting to go full steam ahead with geothermal energy to boost its production while preserving its rich environmental heritage .
The 37 - million - strong nation 's electricity supply capacity is dangerously close to its limit at 1,080 megawatts when peak hour demand almost reaches 1,000 megawatts .
With a fast - growing economy and demography , demand is climbing by eight percent each year and the country 's hydro-electric capacity is peaking and being strained by chronic droughts and the impact of deforestation on rivers .
Aware of the urgent to find more power and the business community 's concerns , President Mwai Kibaki announced in late June a new plan to produce an extra 2,000 megawatts within 10 years , with 85 percent of the surge coming from geothermal plants .
The announcement has set abuzz the country 's main Olkaria plant , near the western town of Naivasha , where engineers and experts are actively discussing prospection and drilling plans .
Beneath the hooves of the giraffes and zebras populating the idyllic sceneries around Lake Naivasha lies the " white gold " that could solve Kenya 's energy problem .
Geothermal technology has come a long way since the Romans used it for bathing and heating : the KenGen plants in the Naivasha area are among the jewels of Kenya 's technical know - how .
The region 's underground is a geothermal hotspot , harbouring hot water sources and steam at 300 degrees Celsius that is piped up the surface from up two kilometres ( 6,500 feet ) below .
When the mix reaches the plant , the water is separated from the steam , which powers a generator turbine thanks to the pressure and heat .
" We have exploited our entire hydro- electric potential .
Because of deforestation and the resulting erosion of the ground , the dams get clogged up with silt .
It 's a serious problem , " says Silas Simiyu , one of the top experts in charge at Olkaria .
" Because geothermal energy is our only indigenous source of energy , we 're going for it .
We can supply Kenya 's entire needs with geothermal alone , " he says .
He estimates that the country has a geothermal potential of at least 3,000 megawatts due to its propicious geographical and geological parametres .
Since geothermal energy production began in Kenya in the 1980s , technology has evolved to help make it a cleaner process .
The steam used to be lost and spewed by giant chimneys but the latest plants now function in closed circuit .
The water and condensation is collected and pumped back down two kilometres under the surface .
The major drawback of geothermal energy is the size of the initial investment , which has tended to scare away governments .
A megawatt of geothermal - produced electricity costs around three million dollars , 30 percent more than what coal - powered plants can offer .
" We 're at a real turning point in Kenya , " said Jean - Pierre Marcelli , who heads the East Africa section of the French Development Agency ( AFP ) .
" It 's a choice between a clean energy policy with low carbon emissions and the path of fossil energy , which may be more simple and require less investments but is infinitely more polluting , " he explained .
The Kenyan authorities are fully aware that opting for geothermal projects at a time when greening the world 's economies and industries is high on the global agenda will earn them foreign backing .
Kenya 's geothermal energy plan is being supported with donations and preferential loans from the AFP , the World Bank and German cooperation .

British security cameras also catch commonplace offenses
It was just before midnight when the first police officer hit Mark Covell , swiping his truncheon down on his left shoulder .
Covell did his best to yell out in Italian that he was a journalist but , within seconds , he was surrounded by riot - squad officers thrashing him with their sticks .
For a while , he managed to stay on his feet but then a baton blow to the knee sent him crashing to the pavement .
Lying on his face in the dark , bruised and scared , he was aware of police all around him , massing to attack the Diaz Pertini school building where 93 young demonstrators were bedding down on the floor for the night .
Covell 's best hope was that they would break through the chain around the front gates without paying him any more attention .
If that happened , he could get up and limp across the street to the safety of the Indymedia centre , where he had spent the past three days filing reports on the G8 summit and on its violent policing .
It was at that moment that a police officer sauntered over to him and kicked him in the chest with such force that the entire lefthand side of his rib cage caved in , breaking half - a- dozen ribs whose splintered ends then shredded the membrane of his left lung .
Covell , who is 5ft 8in and weighs less than eight stone , was lifted off the pavement and sent flying into the street .
He heard the policeman laugh .
The thought formed in Covell 's mind : " I 'm not going to make it . "
The riot squad were still struggling with the gate , so a group of officers occupied the time by strolling over to use Covell as a football .
This bout of kicking broke his left hand and damaged his spine .
From somewhere behind him , Covell heard an officer shout that this was enough - " Basta ! Basta ! " - and he felt his body being dragged back on to the pavement .
Now , an armoured police van broke through the school gates and 150 police officers , most wearing crash helmets and carrying truncheons and shields , poured into the defenceless building .
Two officers stopped to deal with Covell : one cracked him round the head with his baton ; the other kicked him several times in the mouth , knocking out a dozen teeth .
Covell passed out .
There are several good reasons why we should not forget what happened to Covell , then aged 33 , that night in Genoa .
The first is that he was only the beginning .
By midnight on July 21 2001 , those police officers were swarming through all four floors of the Diaz Pertini building , dispensing their special kind of discipline to its occupants , reducing the makeshift dormitories to what one officer later described as " a Mexican butcher 's shop " .
They and their colleagues then illegally incarcerated their victims in a detention centre , which became a place of dark terror .
The second is that , seven years later , Covell and his fellow victims are still waiting for justice .
On Monday , 15 police , prison guards and prison medics finally were convicted for their part in the violence - although it emerged yesterday that none of them would actually serve prison terms .
In Italy , defendants do n't go to jail until they have exhausted the appeals process ; and in this case , the convictions and sentences will be wiped out by a statute of limitations next year .
Meanwhile , the politicians who were responsible for the police , prison guards and prison medics have never had to explain themselves .
Fundamental questions about why this happened remain unanswered - and they hint at the third and most important reason for remembering Genoa .
This is not simply the story of law officers running riot , but of something uglier and more worrying beneath the surface .
The fact that this story can be told at all is testament to seven years of hard work , led by a dedicated and courageous public prosecutor , Emilio Zucca .
Helped by Covell as well as his own staff , Zucca has gathered hundreds of witness statements and analysed 5,000 hours of video as well as thousands of photographs .
Pieced together , they tell an irrefutable tale , which began to unfold as Covell lay bleeding on the ground .
The police poured into the Diaz Pertini school .
Some of them were shouting " Black Bloc !
We 're going to kill you , " but if they genuinely believed they were confronting the notorious Black Bloc of anarchists who had caused violent mayhem in parts of the city during demonstrations earlier in the day , they were mistaken .
The school had been provided by the Genoa city council as a base for demonstrators who had nothing to do with the anarchists : they had even posted guards to make sure that none of them came in .
One of the first to see the riot squad bursting in was Michael Gieser , a 35 - year - old Belgian economist , who subsequently described how he had just changed into his pyjamas and was queuing for the bathroom with his toothbrush in his hand when the raid began .
Gieser believes in the power of dialogue and , at first , he walked towards them saying , " We need to talk . "
He saw the padded jackets , the riot clubs , the helmets and the bandanas concealing the policemen's faces , changed his mind and ran up the stairs to escape .
Others were slower .
They were still in their sleeping bags .
A group of 10 Spanish friends in the middle of the hall woke up to find themselves being battered with truncheons .
They raised their hands in surrender .
More officers piled in to beat their heads , cutting and bruising and breaking limbs , including the arm of a 65 - year - old woman .
At the side of the room , several young people were sitting at computers , sending emails home .
One of them was Melanie Jonasch , a 28 - year - old archaeology student from Berlin , who had volunteered to help out in the building and had not even been on a demonstration .
She still cannot remember what happened .
But numerous other witnesses have described how officers set upon her , beating her head so hard with their sticks that she rapidly lost consciousness .
When she fell to the ground , officers circled her , beating and kicking her limp body , banging her head against a near - by cupboard , leaving her finally in a pool of blood .
Katherina Ottoway , who saw this happen , recalled : " She was trembling all over .
Her eyes were open but upturned .
I thought she was dying , that she could not survive this . "
None of those who stayed on the ground floor escaped injury .
As Zucca later put it in his prosecution report : " In the space of a few minutes , all the occupants on the ground floor had been reduced to complete helplessness , the groans of the wounded mingling with the sound of calls for an ambulance . "
In their fear , some victims lost control of their bowels .
Then the officers of the law moved up the stairs .
In the first - floor corridor they found a small group , including Gieser , still clutching his toothbrush : " Someone suggested lying down , to show there was no resistance .
So I did .
The police arrived and began beating us , one by one .
I protected my head with my hands .
I thought , ' I must survive . '
People were shouting , ' Please stop . '
I said the same thing ...
It made me think of a pork butchery .
We were being treated like animals , like pigs . "
Officers broke down doors to the rooms leading off the corridors .
In one , they found Dan McQuillan and Norman Blair , who had flown in from Stansted to show their support for , as McQuillan put it , " a free and equal society with people living in harmony with each other " .
The two Englishmen and their friend from New Zealand , Sam Buchanan , had heard the police attack on the ground floor and had tried to hide their bags and themselves under some tables in the corner of the dark room .
A dozen officers broke in , caught them in a spotlight and , even as McQuillan stood up with his hands raised saying , " Take it easy , take it easy , " they battered them into submission , inflicting numerous cuts and bruises and breaking McQuillan 's wrist .
Norman Blair recalled : " I could feel the venom and hatred from them . "
Gieser was out in the corridor : " The scene around me was covered in blood , everywhere .
A policeman shouted ' Basta ! ' .
This word was like a window of hope .
I understood it meant ' enough ' .
And yet they did n't stop .
They continued with pleasure .
In the end , they did stop , but it was like taking a toy away from a child , against their will . "
By now , there were police officers on all four floors of the building , kicking and battering .
Several victims describe a sort of system to the violence , with each officer beating each person he came across , then moving on to the next victim while his colleague moved up to continue beating the first .
It seemed important that everybody must be hurt .
Nicola Doherty , 26 , a care worker from London , later described how her partner , Richard Moth , lay across her to protect her : " I could just hear blow after blow on his body .
The police were also leaning over Rich so they could hit the parts of my body which were exposed . "
She tried to cover her head with her arm : they broke her wrist .
In one corridor , they ordered a group of young men and women to kneel , the easier to batter them around the head and shoulders .
This was where Daniel Albrecht , a 21 - year - old cello student from Berlin , had his head beaten so badly that he needed surgery to stop bleeding in his brain .
Around the building , officers flipped their batons around , gripping the far end and using the right - angled handle as a hammer .
And in among this relentless violence , there were moments when the police preferred humiliation : the officer who stood spread - legged in front of a kneeling and injured woman , grabbed his groin and thrust it into her face before turning to do the same to Daniel Albrecht kneeling beside her ; the officer who paused amid the beatings and took a knife to cut off hair from his victims , including Nicola Doherty ; the constant shouting of insults ; the officer who asked a group if they were OK and who reacted to the one who said " No " by handing out an extra beating .
A few escaped , at least for a while .
Karl Boro made it up on to the roof but then made the mistake of coming back into the building , where he was treated to heavy bruising to his arms and legs , a fractured skull , and bleeding in his chest cavity .
Jaraslaw Engel , from Poland , managed to use builders ' scaffolding to get out of the school , but he was caught in the street by some police drivers who smashed him over the head , laid him on the ground and stood over him smoking while his blood ran out across the Tarmac .
Two of the last to be caught were a pair of German students , Lena Zuhlke , 24 , and her partner Niels Martensen .
They had hidden in a cleaners ' cupboard on the top floor .
They heard the police approaching , drumming their batons against the walls of the stairs .
The cupboard door came open , Martensen was dragged out and beaten by a dozen officers standing in a semicircle around him .
Zuhlke ran across the corridor and hid in the loo .
Police officers saw her and followed her and dragged her out by her dreadlocks .
In the corridor , they set about her like dogs on a rabbit .
She was beaten around the head then kicked from all sides on the floor , where she felt her rib cage collapsing .
She was hauled up against the wall where one officer kneed her in the groin while others carried on lashing her with their batons .
She slid down the wall and they hit her more on the ground : " They seemed to be enjoying themselves and , when I cried out in pain , it seemed to give them even more pleasure . "
Police officers found a fire extinguisher and squirted its foam into Martensen 's wounds .
His partner was dragged by her hair and tossed down the stairs head - first .
Eventually , they dragged Zuhlke into the ground - floor hall , where they had gathered dozens of prisoners from all over the building in a mess of blood and excrement .
They threw her on top of two other people .
They were not moving , and Zuhlke drowsily asked them if they were alive .
They did not reply , and she lay there on her back , unable to move her right arm , unable to stop her left arm and her legs twitching , blood seeping out of her head wounds .
A group of police officers walked by , and each one lifted the bandana which concealed his identity , leaned down and spat on her face .
Why would law officers behave with such contempt for the law ?
The simple answer may be the one which was soon being chanted outside the school building by sympathetic demonstrators who chose a word which they knew the police would understand : " Bastardi ! Bastardi ! "
But something else was happening here - something that emerged more clearly over the next few days .
Covell and dozens of other victims of the raid were taken to the San Martino hospital , where police officers walked up and down the corridors , slapping their clubs into the palms of their hands , ordering the injured not to move around or look out of the window , keeping handcuffs on many of them and then , often with injuries still untended , shipping them across the city to join scores of others , from the Diaz school and from the street demonstrations , detained at the detention centre in the city 's Bolzaneto district .
The signs of something uglier here were apparent first in superficial ways .
Some officers had traditional fascist songs as ringtones on their mobile phones and talked enthusiastically about Mussolini and Pinochet .
Repeatedly , they ordered prisoners to say " Viva il duce . "
Sometimes , they used threats to force them to sing fascist songs : " Un , due , tre. Viva Pinochet ! "
The 222 people who were held at Bolzaneto were treated to a regime later described by public prosecutors as torture .
On arrival , they were marked with felt - tip crosses on each cheek , and many were forced to walk between two parallel lines of officers who kicked and beat them .
Most were herded into large cells , holding up to 30 people .
Here , they were forced to stand for long periods , facing the wall with their hands up high and their legs spread .
Those who failed to hold the position were shouted at , slapped and beaten .
Mohammed Tabach has an artificial leg and , unable to hold the stress position , collapsed and was rewarded with two bursts of pepper spray in his face and , later , a particularly savage beating .
Norman Blair later recalled standing like this and a guard asking him " Who is your government ? "
" The person before me had answered ' Polizei ' , so I said the same .
I was afraid of being beaten . "
Stefan Bauer dared to answer back : when a German - speaking guard asked where he was from , he said he was from the European Union and he had the right to go where he wanted .
He was hauled out , beaten , given a face full of pepper spray , stripped naked and put under a cold shower .
His clothes were taken away and he was returned to the freezing cell wearing only a flimsy hospital gown .
Shivering on the cold marble floors of the cells , the detainees were given few or no blankets , kept awake by guards , given little or no food and denied their statutory right to make phone calls and see a lawyer .
They could hear crying and screaming from other cells .
Men and women with dreadlocks had their hair roughly cut off to the scalp .
Marco Bistacchia was taken to an office , stripped naked , made to get down on all fours and told to bark like a dog and to shout " Viva la polizia Italiana ! "
He was sobbing too much to obey .
An unnamed officer told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that he had seen brother officers urinating on prisoners and beating them for refusing to sing Faccetta Nera , a Mussolini - era fascist song .
Ester Percivati , a young Turkish woman , recalled guards calling her a whore as she was marched to the toilet , where a woman officer forced her head down into the bowl and a male jeered " Nice arse !
Would you like a truncheon up it ? "
Several women reported threats of rape , anal and vaginal .
Even the infirmary was dangerous .
Richard Moth , covered in cuts and bruises after lying on top of his partner , was given stitches in his head and legs without anaesthetic - " an extremely painful and disturbing experience .
I had to be held down . "
Prison medical staff were among those convicted of abuse on Monday .
All agree that this was not an attempt to get the detainees to talk , simply an exercise in creating fear .
And it worked .
In statements , prisoners later described their feeling of helplessness , of being cut off from the rest of the world in a place where there was no law and no rules .
Indeed , the police forced their captives to sign statements , waiving all their legal rights .
One man , David Larroquelle , testified that he refused and had three of his ribs broken .
Percivati also refused and her face was slammed into the office wall , breaking her glasses and making her nose bleed .
The outside world was treated to some severely distorted accounts of all this .
Lying in San Martino hospital the day after his beating , Covell came round to find his shoulder being shaken by a woman who , he understood , was from the British embassy .
It was only when the man with her started taking photographs that he realised she was a reporter , from the Daily Mail .
Its front page the next day ran an entirely false report describing him as having helped mastermind the riots .
( Four long years later , the Mail eventually apologised and paid Covell damages for invasion of privacy . )
While his citizens were being beaten and tormented in illegal detention , spokesmen for the then prime minister , Tony Blair , declared : " The Italian police had a difficult job to do .
The prime minister believes that they did that job . "
The Italian police themselves fed the media with a rich diet of falsehood .
Even as the bloody bodies were being carried out of the Diaz Pertini building on stretchers , police were telling reporters that the ambulances lined up in the street were nothing to do with the raid , and / or that the very obviously fresh injuries were old , and that the building had been full of violent extremists who had attacked officers .
The next day , senior officers held a press conference at which they announced that everybody in the building would be charged with aggressive resistance to arrest and conspiracy to cause destruction .
In the event , the Italian courts dismissed every single attempted charge against every single person .
That included Covell .
Police attempts to charge him with a string of very serious offences were described by the public prosecutor , Enrico Zucca , as " grotesque " .
At the same press conference , police displayed an array of what they described as weaponry .
This included crowbars , hammers and nails which they themselves had taken from a builder 's store next to the school ; aluminium rucksack frames , which they presented as offensive weapons ; 17 cameras ; 13 pairs of swimming goggles ; 10 pen-knives ; and a bottle of sun-tan lotion .
They also displayed two Molotov cocktails which , Zucca later concluded , had been found by police earlier in the day in another part of the city and planted in the Diaz Pertini building as the raid ended .
This public dishonesty was part of a wider effort to cover up what had happened .
On the night of the raid , a force of 59 police entered the building opposite the Diaz Pertini , where Covell and others had been running their Indymedia centre and where , crucially , a group of lawyers had been based , gathering evidence about police attacks on the earlier demonstrations .
Officers went into the lawyers ' room , threatened the occupants , smashed their computers and seized hard drives .
They also removed anything containing photographs or video tape .
With the courts refusing to charge the detainees , the police secured an order to deport all of them from the country , banning them from returning for five years .
Thus , the witnesses were removed from the scene .
Like the attempted charges , all the deportation orders were subsequently dismissed as illegal by the courts .
Zucca then fought his way through years of denial and obfuscation .
In his formal report , he recorded that all the senior officers involved were denying playing any part : " Not a single official has confessed to holding a substantial command role in any aspects of the operation . "
One senior officer who was videoed at the scene explained that he was off duty and had just turned up to make sure his men were not being injured .
Police statements were themselves changeable and contradictory , and were overwhelmingly contradicted by the evidence of victims and numerous videos : " Not a single one of the 150 officers reportedly present has provided precise information regarding an individual episode . "
Without Zucca , without the robust stance of the Italian courts , without Covell 's intensive work assembling video records of the Diaz raid , the police might well have evaded responsibility and secured false charges and prison sentences against scores of their victims .
Apart from the Bolzaneto trial which finished on Monday , 28 other officers , some very senior , are on trial for their part in the Diaz raid .
And yet , justice has been compromised .
No Italian politician has been brought to book , in spite of the strong suggestion that the police acted as though somebody had promised them impunity .
One minister visited Bolzaneto while the detainees were being mistreated and apparently saw nothing or , at least , saw nothing he thought he should stop .
Another , Gianfranco Fini , former national secretary of the neo - fascist MSI party and the then deputy prime minister , was - according to media reports at the time - in police headquarters .
He has never been required to explain what orders he gave .
Most of the several hundred law officers involved in Diaz and Bolzaneto have escaped without any discipline or criminal charge .
None has been suspended ; some have been promoted .
None of the officers who were tried over Bolzaneto has been charged with torture - Italian law does not recognise the offence .
Some senior officers who were originally going to be charged over the Diaz raid escaped trial because Zucca was simply unable to prove that a chain of command existed .
Even now , the trial of the 28 officers who have been charged is in jeopardy because the prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , is pushing through legislation to delay all trials dealing with events that occurred before June 2002 .
Nobody has been charged with the violence inflicted on Covell .
And as one of the victims ' lawyers , Massimo Pastore , put it : " Nobody wants to listen to what this story has to say . "
That is about fascism .
There are plenty of rumours that the police and carabinieri and prison staff belonged to fascist groups , but no evidence to support that .
Pastore argues that that misses the bigger point : " It is not just a matter of a few drunken fascists .
This is mass behaviour by the police .
No one said ' No . '
This is a culture of fascism . "
At its heart , this involved what Zucca described in his report as " a situation in which every rule of law appears to have been suspended . "
Fifty - two days after the attack on the Diaz school , 19 men used planes full of passengers as flying bombs and shifted the bedrock of assumptions on which western democracies had based their business .
Since then , politicians who would never describe themselves as fascists have allowed the mass tapping of telephones and monitoring of emails , detention without trial , systematic torture , the calibrated drowning of detainees , unlimited house arrest and the targeted killing of suspects , while the procedure of extradition has been replaced by " extraordinary rendition " .
This is n't fascism with jack - booted dictators with foam on their lips .
It 's the pragmatism of nicely turned - out politicians .
But the result looks very similar .
Genoa tells us that when the state feels threatened , the rule of law can be suspended .
Anywhere .

For our latest mission , we filled a subway car with identical twins , creating a human mirror .
Enjoy the video first and then see below for our report with tons of photos .
Our mailing list has grown so large that we ’ve started brainstorming different ways to narrow it down .
Last summer , we found out how many redheads we could recruit , and this time around we sent out a request for identical twins .
Within a day we heard from over 50 pairs .
Most of the twins could not make the day and time of the mission , but we were delighted to have 8 pairs turn out , nearly all of whom had never participated in one of our missions before .
We actually did this mission a second time a few weeks later .
The first attempt was a total success in terms of how it unfolded live , but our video footage was n’t as good as we knew it could be .
It ’s very difficult to capture audience reaction to a mission like this in the subway while still keeping our cameras hidden .
We invested in some wireless microphones and a new button camera and gave it a second shot .
The second set of twins
Only two of the original sets of twins ( the Vieyra and Port sisters ) could make the second mission .
They were joined by 8 new sets who could n’t make the first date .
It was nice to involve more people .
We even had some high school twins this time around .
The Krueger brothers were n’t present for the group photo above , but did make it on the train .
The Kruger twins , age 16
We had some fun taking posed photos
I instructed the twins via email to do everything they could to look identical .
They did an awesome job dressing exactly alike and matching accessories .
It really was impossible to tell them apart , especially when meeting 8 pairs at the same time .
The Barrett twins both had iPhones
The Drinkwater twins matched several accessories
The Port twins
The Doro twins
The Rosenblum twins
I explained the mission to everyone .
We would get on the 6 train at the start of the line at Brooklyn Bridge and the twins would sit on either side of the car , directly across from their sibling .
Once in place , their job would be to mirror each other as closely as possible .
If one scratches his head , so should the other .
If anyone asked them what was going on , they should claim not to notice anything unusual and not to even be able to see their sibling .
Even before the mission started , we were attracting tons of attention .
People were running up to us and snapping photos of the twins at the meeting point .
Several folks stopped to gawk as we walked to the subway .
The hot dog vendor above could n’t stop laughing .
The start of the first mission was particularly funny to watch because our agents were n’t able to get every seat in a row .
There was a man quietly reading on the bench , and our agents surrounded him .
He sat and read his entire journey and exited not knowing what had gone on around him .
To be fair , there were several people seated on train who did n’t notice at first what was happening .
If you were only looking at one side of the car it seemed perfectly normal .
It was easy to see if you were standing , but those seated had to look to their sides to get what was going on .
A woman quietly smiles
This couple was from Sweden .
They were among the first the notice the mirror , and immediately started laughing and taking photographs .
The woman theorized that there must be some sort of twin conference happening in town .

People coming down the stairs realize an army of twins is passing by
As with most of our missions , we got all sorts of reactions from all sorts of people .
Most folks laughed quietly to themselves .
A few got really excited and started asking others on the train if they knew what it was .
Some were bold enough to try to talk to the twins .
Some pretended not to notice and kept to themselves .
Some genuinely did n’t notice .
Agent Cobalt recalled one particularly good reaction :
One of the best reactions I saw unfortunately was not captured on video to my knowledge - I think it was on the first time around and a tanned middle aged woman with permed hair and a rough makeup job was sitting on the train completely surrounded by twins .
She sat there for quite awhile without noticing .
Then she looked up and must have seen it in the reflection of the window across from her because she did a startled quadruple take to the left and right .
At first she let out an uncomfortable laugh but at that early stage nearly everyone on the train was either a hidden camera person or a twin and no one reacted to her confusion .
This made her noticeably more uncomfortable so she got up and moved to another part of the car and stared at the floor till her stop .
She certainly had the look of someone questioning their sanity - an awkward testament to the stellar job all the twins did in coordinating their outfits , accessories , hair , and actions - the Rosenblum twins had the same song queued on their iPods - thatâ€™s the level of dedication these agents had .
The freaked out woman
The second time around was just as much fun .
This woman and her husband were really excited .
“ I thought it was a mirror , ” she told me .
The both decided to get to the bottom of it and talk to the twins , but our agents stayed in character and acted like they were crazy .
It was fun to watch people like them get on the train and slowly notice the twins .
At first they might just see one or two pairs , but then they ’d look to the other side of the car and see seven more pairs .

This woman saw the mirror as soon as she stepped on the train
You may recognize the Stone twins from their appearances on NBC ’s Last Comic Standing .
They ’re a stand up comedy duo
Of all of the people we encountered , the women pictured above were our favorites .
They could not stop laughing and talking to everyone about what was going on .
The woman on the left did a literal double take when she first saw the mirror ( which you can see in the video . )
I sat across from them with my button camera recording as they tried to figure it all out .
One of the Stone brothers makes the other pick his nose
As we were waiting to board a downtown train after the mission was over , two guys were going crazy across the platform , waving and laughing .
Mission Accomplished

An image showing four different facial expressions ( clockwise from top - left : fear , disgust , sadness , happiness ) .
Overlaid on top of each expression is a set of vectors ( arrows ) indicating how the facial features move from the neutral pose .
Larger movement is conveyed by red - yellow arrows .
For example , the eyebrows raise in fear relative to neutral .
Everyone knows the face of fear .
Upon beholding the chainsaw - wielding ax - murderer in a slasher movie , the damsel in distress usually widens her eyes and flares her nostrils in horror .
It turns out this expression is n't merely for cinematic effect , but actually serves a biological function , scientists have found , by altering the way our senses perceive the world .
" Our hypothesis was that different changes on the face would lead to different amounts of sensory intake , " said Joshua Susskind , a psychology graduate student at the University of Toronto who worked on a study testing the function of facial expressions .
" The idea is that fear is for vigilance .
You 'd expect that changes on the face , such as opening the eyes , would be characteristic of fear , because you 're trying to assess more information in your environment . "
Squinty eyes and pinched nose
To test this hypothesis , Susskind and his advisor , Adam Anderson , and colleagues took images of people 's faces as they posed with expressions associated with fear and disgust .
Using statistical models , the team analyzed the faces and found that the two expressions produced opposite facial effects .
The scientists then tested what function these facial changes served .
They took various measures of sensory perception , such as volume of air intake , width of the visual field and peripheral vision , and speed of visual tracking .
Across the board , the researchers found that when making fearful expressions , subjects breathed in more air , saw a wider field of view , and could visually track targets more quickly .
" We found certain patterns in the ways faces change between fear and disgust , " Susskind told LiveScience .
" Those changes were very consistent with the idea that fear is expanding the sensory surfaces .
Disgust seems to produce the opposite effect , contracting the sensory intake . "
When pinching their noses and squinting their eyes in disgust , people simply saw and smelled less .
" We 're claiming that these emotions oppose in appearance as well as function , " Susskind said .
" One is the need to take in more information , and the other is the need to reject information . "
Darwin's idea
Darwin was the first to suggest that emotional facial expressions might have evolved for a reason .
" He suggested that they 're not just symbolic or arbitrary — they have a purpose , " Susskind said .
" They increase the likelihood that the animal or the species would survive . "
Darwin and others hypothesized that expressions such as happiness ( smiling ) and sadness ( frowning ) may serve a social function , by communicating the internal emotion a person is feeling .
Later scientists , such as Silvan Tompkins and Paul Ekman , discovered that the expression of emotions is strikingly similar across cultures — horror and disgust look pretty much the same on the face of a New Yorker as they do on a Nigerian , and people from different cultures can recognize emotions such as happiness , anger and surprise on others ' faces , even if they do n't share a language .
The fact that emotional expressions seem to be universal led scientists to believe they were n't used only for communication and social purposes , but also served an additional adaptive biological function .
Future studies
The new study may be the first to measure changes in sensory intake that accompany these facial expressions .
" As far as we know , we 're the first to look at the actual consequences on intake of information , " Susskind said .
" It 's only been speculated before . "
The scientists do n't believe their results are confined to the two emotions they tested .
Other emotional face changes may also serve biological functions .
" We 'd like to see how this extends to other expressions , " Susskind said .
" Can you get a measurement of changes in intake with anger ?
Perhaps you find you 're narrowing your intake .
We 're not trying to say this is specific to fear and disgust . "
Susskind and his colleagues would also like to test whether animals express emotions with similar facial changes , and whether these serve the same purposes in other species .
A common signature of tiny , specific pieces of non-coding genetic material known as microRNAs ( miRNAs ) may be directly involved in the spread of cancer to other parts of the body .
Researchers at the Kimmel Cancer Center at Jefferson in Philadelphia and Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus have identified such a signature , made up mostly of overexpressed miRNAs .
The findings , reported at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago , may represent a novel diagnostic tool in characterizing gene targets in metastatic cancer .
MiRNAs play a number of roles in biological regulation , including development and cell differentiation .
When damaged , they can contribute to cancer by either turning on cancer - causing genes or by inhibiting tumor - blocking genes .
The ways that MiRNAs are expressed have been used to profile tumor types in humans .
Because miRNAs are involved in cancer development and progression , scientists led by Raffaele Baffa , M.D. , associate professor of Urology at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University and Anne Rosenberg , M.D. , clinical professor of Surgery at Jefferson Medical College , in collaboration with a research team led by Carlo Croce , M.D. , director of Ohio State University 's human cancer genetics program and professor and chair of the Department of Molecular Virology , Immunology and Medical Genetics , wanted to see if there was a specific gene signature that characterized metastasis .
Using microarray technology to test many genes at once , they compared different organs -- breast , lung , bladder and colon -- to see if miRNAs were either increased or decreased in activity .
They analyzed the miRNAs in both primary and metastatic tumors from 43 patients , including 13 breast cancers , 10 lung cancers , 10 bladder urothelial cell cancers and 10 colon cancers .
They discovered that some miRNAs are organ - specific .
" Some are increased and decreased specifically in certain organs , telling us that these are commonly involved in the metastatic process , " says Dr. Baffa .
Because of the ups and downs in miRNA activity , " many miRNAs that are involved in metastasis are not necessarily specific for one organ , but rather are related to the cell acquiring the ability to spread . "
The researchers also found a direct association between the alterations in some miRNAs and changes in target proteins .
Many of the miRNAs that were overexpressed in primary tumors had previously been reported , he says , confirming that miRNA signatures are useful in classifying tissue origin .
" Now we have to identify which of the miRNAs in the signature are the most important in facilitating metastasis , " Dr. Baffa says .
Some of the nation ’s largest oil companies have agreed to pay about $ 423 million in cash to settle a lawsuit brought by more than a hundred public water providers , claiming water contamination from a popular gasoline additive .
The terms of the settlement were submitted for approval in the federal court for the Southern District of New York .
Under the terms of the deal , the companies also agreed to pay 70 percent of the future cleanup costs over the next 30 years .
The defendants that agreed to the settlement include BP , Royal Dutch Shell , ConocoPhillips , Chevron , Marathon Oil , Valero Energy , Citgo and Sunoco .
Six other companies named in the lawsuit , including Exxon Mobil , did not agree to the deal , said Scott Summy , a lawyer at Baron & Budd and a counsel for the plaintiffs .
In the lawsuit , the plaintiffs , which include 153 public water systems in New York , California and 15 other states , claimed that the additive , a chemical called methyl tertiary butyl ether , or M.T.B.E. , was a defective product that led to widespread contamination of groundwater .
The suit contended that the chemical was used by oil companies , even though they knew of the environmental and health risks that it posed .

Introduction
Dear Reader :
The super rich in America enjoy power and prerogatives un-imaginable to most of us .
Who can conceive of owning a private empire that includes 100 homes , 2,500 servants , untold thousands of luxuries , and untold millions of dollars ?
America has a royal family of finance that has known such riches for generations .
It is , of course , the Rockefellers .
But if the Rockefellers were content with their wealth , if their riches had satisfied their desires , this book would not have been written .
And I would not be urging you to read it .
Money alone is not enough to quench the thirst and lusts of the super - rich .
Instead , many of them use their vast wealth , and the influence such riches give them , to achieve even more power .
Power of a magnitude never dreamed of by the tyrants and despots of earlier ages .
Power on a world wide scale .
Power over people , not just products .
The Rockefeller File is not fiction .
It is a compact , powerful and frightening presentation of what may be the most important story of our lifetime , the drive of the Rockefellers and their allies to create a one - world government , combining super - capitalism and Communism under the same tent , all under their control .
For more than one hundred years , since the days when John D. Rockefeller Sr. used every devious strategy he could devise to create a gigantic oil monopoly , enough books have been written about the Rockefellers to fill a library .
I have read many of them .
And to my knowledge , not one has dared reveal the most vital part of the Rockefeller story : that the Rockefellers and their allies have , for at least fifty years , been carefully following a plan to use their economic power to gain political control of first America , and then the rest of the world .
Do I mean conspiracy ?
Yes , I do .
I am convinced there is such a plot , international in scope , generations old in planning , and incredibly evil in intent .
You will find the truth - often surprising , sometimes unpleasant , always vital - in the pages that follow .
Gary Allen has done a masterful job of combining the hundreds of scattered facts and hidden clues of the Rockefeller puzzle until one unmistakable pattern emerges .
The picture that is revealed when The Rockefeller File is finally opened may shock you .
In this book , you will learn why the Rockefellers follow the policies they do , what their goals are , where they intend to take America ... and why it is essential they be stopped .
I urge you to read The Rockefeller File and to encourage your friends to do the same .

I know Spore 's Creature Creator has been making the rounds for months now , but yesterday was my first chance to get my hands on the thing and go to town on some critters of my own creation for the upcoming competition .

The stand - alone creator is a pretty straight - forward game .
Launching it up brings you to a screen that lets you either create or load your own critters .
Advertisement
Once you drop into the creation mode you 're presented with a floating blob of flesh , elongated at either end with stumpy tail - like or neck - like appendages .
When you hover your cursor over the blob it becomes slightly transparent , exposing the vertebrae buried inside .
An arrow appears over either stump as well .
To shape your creature 's body you tug on the arrows to stretch out the skin along an ever - extending backbone .
You can also tug at the vertebrae to try and curve the spine and shape of the body .
Once you 've shaped your body you can drop on arms , legs , mouths , eyes , noses , ears , hands , feet and other little appendages , like wings .
Each of these can be twisted , stretched and moved about on the fly .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Initially the need for a backbone and the pre-set selection of body parts feels very limiting , but over time I found that I can create lots of things with a little creativity including spiders , snakes , cats , I even tried to create a Fruit Fucker ... and almost succeeded .
The one thing I can't seem to create is a human , I think the biggest issue there is that you can't add a separate head and instead have to rely on planing mouth , eyes , ears and such on the top of a knobby outgrowth of the spinal column .
That 's not a deal break at all though for me .
As you create your creature different icons give you a break down of its special abilities , like attacks and speed .
Another button shows how complicated your critter is .
If it gets too complicated you can't add any more parts .
So no 100 mouthed balls of flesh .

Once completed you can paint the creature by either selecting among three pages of pre-set paint jobs or by painting the creature in three phases , still using pre-set stencils .
The fact that you can choose just about any color and that you can control three different overlays of color makes customization pretty easy , though doing something really specific , like a black band over Fruit Fucker 's eyes , is impossible .
Is it worth $ 10 ?
Maybe , it is tons of fun to play around with , but I 'm not sure if I 'd want to shell out cash to get early hands - on time with something that will come built - in to a game I 'm planning on buying .
Then again it 's only $ 10 and it 's TONS of fun .
Actually a little addictive .

Oh and the rough draft of that organic Fruit Fucker up there , I suspect that 's what FF might look like in meat space .
I also suspect this particular Fruit Fucker would be just as happy to have his way with human chest cavities as the odd orange .
Update : I just checked in with EA on the whole price thing .
Here 's the deal .
You can get a trial version of the Creature Creator , which contains about a quarter of the creature parts , for free .
If you do buy the creator for $ 10 you get a $ 5 rebate toward the full Spore game good at Target and Amazon .

Update 2 : See him in motion !
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The labor market was having enough trouble so far this year .
Now , fears about $ 4 gas and near - record oil prices are likely to throw more fuel on the unemployment fire .
On Friday , the Labor Department will release the May jobs report .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com forecast a net job loss of 60,000 , the fifth straight month of job cuts .
There have already been 260,000 job losses through the first fourt months of 2008 .
The unemployment rate is expected to climb to 5.1 % from 5 % in April .
And the worst for the job market may not be over .
Many economists say job losses could intensify during the rest of the year due to rising energy prices .
In fact , Thursday Continental Airlines ( CAL , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's No. 4 carrier , announced it would ground planes and eliminate about 3,000 jobs as it struggled with high fuel costs .
The move follows the announcement Wednesday by UAL's ( UAUA , Fortune 500 ) United Airlines , the nation 's No. 2 airline , that it would cut flights and layoff up to 1,600 employees .
Other airlines are expected to make similar moves soon .
And there could also be losses from smaller airlines going out of business .
Several have halted operations in the last two months .
" Airlines always go out of business in these periods of oil shocks , " said David Wyss , chief economist for Standard & Poor's .
In addition , No. 1 automaker General Motors ( GM , Fortune 500 ) announced on Tuesday it would close two U.S. assembly plants that produce SUVs , along with truck plants in Canada and Mexico as consumers buy more fuel efficient vehicles .
Ford Motor ( F , Fortune 500 ) has said it 's considering plant closings of its own for the same reason .
More immediate cutbacks in light truck production are also planned .
To be sure , GM and Ford both plan to take advantage of greater demand for smaller cars .
But this shift is likely to benefit Asian automakers more .
That probably will mean further sales declines and losses , not to mention layoffs , for U.S. automakers .
" It seems like the country is just at the beginning of companies coming to terms with what higher oil prices are going to mean , " said John Challenger , CEO of outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
According to a survey by Challenger for May , there were 103,522 total layoffs that month , a level not seen since 2005 .
And nearly a third of those layoffs came from the automotive sector .
Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisors , is forecasting at least several more months of job losses because of high energy prices .
Woes extend beyond airlines and autos
But it 's not just airlines and automakers that could start trimming staffs as they struggle with high energy costs .
Economists say the job losses could be much more widespread .
With consumers needing to shell out more cash on food and gas , they may pull back on other spending , notes Anirvan Banerji , director of research for the Economic Cycle Research Institute .
That could lead to a job cuts for a wide range of retailers as well as manufacturers of flat - screen televisions and other high - priced consumer gadgets .
The continued problems in the credit and real estate markets also remain an issue for employers .
The collapse of Bear Stearns , which was bought at a fire sale price by JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) , is just the most visible example of job losses in the sector .
That sector is likely to continue to lose jobs .
So will construction , now that non-residential building has shown its own sharp downturn in recent months .
For much of last year , construction of offices , malls and other non-residential construction limited job losses among contractors in the face of the home building bust .
For this reason , Keith Hembre , chief economist of First American Funds , said unemployment should keep rising into next year .
He said as long as corporate profits keep getting squeezed by energy costs and weak consumer spending , employers will be reluctant to hire .
And he added that corporate profits show no sign of substantially recovering anytime soon , especially in the beaten down financial sector .
What 's more , it 's highly likely that auto companies and airlines may report losses in the second quarter and beyond , putting even more pressure on them to cut costs .
Well , since the shock of finding out on Friday that Expelled was going to be fouling up my country with its ridiculous nonsense , the weekend numbers on its performance here have come in .
Box office figures for Canada are often lumped in with those of the US so finding good information is hard , but the best number I have states that Expelled pulled in $ 24,374 across Canada for the whole weekend .
Sorry , I just have to take a minute .
Mwa ha ha ha ha ha ha !
I mean , what a shame .
Unfortunately , I can’t find any official numbers which break down the gross per theatre or even how many theatres are showing the damn thing .
So , I did some ball - parking on my own .
Here ’s a haphazard list of major cities in Canada ( the provincial capitals with Vancouver , Calgary , and Ottawa thrown in ) and the number of theatres showing Expelled , culled from online movie listings :
Vancouver : 5
Victoria : 1
Edmonton : 1
Calgary : 2
Regina : 1
Winnipeg : 1
Toronto : 10
Ottawa : 2
Montréal : 1
Québec City : 0
Fredericton : 0
Charlottetown : 0
Halifax : 2
St. John’s : 1
That makes 27 theatres playing the movie ( at least ) in Canada .
There are at least three showings at every theatre ( a couple have only two showings , but the average is well above three so I ’m estimating conservatively here ) .
So for Friday , Saturday , and Sunday , we have 27 * 3 * 3 or 243 showings of the movie .
That would make for just over $ 100 per showing .
Average ticket price is somewhere around $ 10 per ticket , so we have about 10 people per theater per showing .
That ’s pretty pathetic for the “ big opening weekend ” .
And my estimate is undoubtably conservative , since all ten theatres showing the movie in Toronto are showing it at least 4 and sometimes 5 times per day , as are several of the other markets .
Let ’s get this straight : they did n’t just plunk this turd down in one or two theatres up here in the Great White North .
No , they opened in almost every major Canadian city and the resulting numbers show that they failed miserably .
I would pretend to be sympathetic , but I ’m not .
Ben Stein is a lying jackass , and frankly I ’m happy that his movie is tanking .
Again .
Wait !
There ’s more !
Following up , I took a look at the Expelled website .
There ’s a theatre locator which I paged through to get a theatre total .
Something is clearly whacky , because their locator only lists 4 theatres playing the movie in Vancouver where I count 5 ( for some reason they left out Burnaby entirely ) , but putting that aside their total is still higher than mine at 36 .
36 movie theatres , at an average of three showings per day for three days would make for 324 total showings , or no more than $ 24,374 / 324 = $ 75 per theatre , or about 7 - 8 people per showing .
Again , a conservatively high estimate .
This , despite the “ group release ” extravaganzas available from the Expelled distributors !
Wow , I ca n’t imagine why people have n’t been snapping up those opportunities .
You may think that I ’m being snarky here , and you ’d be right .
Ben Stein is an IDiot , and he does n’t deserve any attention that rises above the level of pure mocking .
So I refuse to do more than laugh at this tool who thinks that science makes murders and that evolution caused the Holocaust , while engaging in some wholesome schadenfreude .

These days , ZZ Top are better known for their beards than for the integrity of their music .
But the American rock trio look set to reinvent themselves after agreeing a deal with Rick Rubin 's American Recordings label .
Rubin whose low - schmaltz approach helped to relaunch the careers of both Johnny Cash and Neil Diamond , also looks set to produce the next ZZ Top album as part of any arrangement .
The band 's manager , Carl Stubner , said the forthcoming album would recall the one - chord blues of ZZ Top 's 1973 hit La Grange , rather than the glossy hard - rock the band is now known for .
" We thought this was a great brand that was kind of dusty , " Stubner told Billboard .
" My goal was to polish it and do certain things they had n't done before . "
They recently released their first live DVD , Live From Texas 2007 , and begin a European tour in Portugal tonight .
They have no scheduled dates in Britain .
Come autumn , the three - piece intend " to go do smaller theatres , like 3,000 - seaters for a low - dough ticket price .
Then we 'll go finish the record , " Stubner said .
As far as we 're concerned they can do whatever they like , so long as they keep the haircuts .
Gitmo judge removed from Canadian ’s case

SAN JUAN , Puerto Rico ( AP ) – A U.S. military judge at Guantanamo Bay who once acknowledged facing Pentagon criticism over one of his rulings was dismissed Thursday from the case of a Canadian detainee , a defense lawyer said .
Army Col .
Peter Brownback had presided over the tribunal ’s proceedings against Toronto - born Omar Khadr since last year .
The chief judge for the Guantanamo tribunals , Marine Col .
Ralph Kohlmann , dismissed Brownback and appointed a new judge for Khadr ’s case without explanation , defense lawyer Navy Lt. Cmdr. William Kuebler said .
In November , Brownback said in court that Defense Department officials “ did n’t like ” a ruling that dismissed the charges over a lack of jurisdiction .
That decision was overturned on appeal .
Khadr ’s case has been on track to be one of the first to trial at the U.S. Navy base in southeast Cuba .
Khadr , the son of an alleged al - Qaida financier , was captured in Afghanistan at age 15 and accused of throwing a grenade that killed a U.S. Special Forces soldier .
Military prosecutors have been pressing Brownback to set a trial date , but he has repeatedly directed them first to satisfy defense requests for access to potential evidence .
At a hearing earlier this month , he threatened to suspend the proceedings altogether unless the detention center provided records of Khadr ’s confinement .
Kuebler said he believes the U.S. military is anxious for the trial to start before political pressure leads Canada to demand Khadr ’s repatriation .
A spokesman for the Pentagon office in charge of the tribunals did not immediately respond to a request for comment .

Army Judge Is Replaced for Trial of Detainee
By WILLIAM GLABERSON
May 31 , 2008
Copyright 2008 The New York Times Company
The chief judge at GuantÃ¡namo replaced the military judge in one of the most closely watched war crimes cases on Thursday , creating a new controversy in the military commission system and the potential for new delays .
The decision to replace the judge , Col. Peter E. Brownback III , came without explanation from the chief military judge , Col. Ralph H. Kohlmann .
Judge Brownback has been presiding over pretrial proceedings in the prosecution of Omar Ahmed Khadr , a 21 - year - old Canadian charged with the killing of an American serviceman in Afghanistan .
Pentagon spokesmen said Judge Brownback , a retired Army judge who was recalled to hear GuantÃ¡namo cases in 2004 , would return to retirement as a result of “ a mutual decision ”  between the judge and the Army .
But defense lawyers and critics of GuantÃ¡namo said there had been no warning of the change and suggested that he had been removed because of a recent ruling that was a rebuke to prosecutors .
During a proceeding on May 8 , Judge Brownback expressed irritation that military prosecutors had failed to turn over records of Mr. Khadr ’s incarceration to defense lawyers .
He threatened to stop pretrial proceedings if the records were not supplied by May 22 .
They met that deadline .
At the time , Judge Brownback said he had been “ badgered and beaten and bruised ”  by the chief military prosecutor in the case , Maj. Jeffrey D. Groharing , to move the case toward a trial quickly .
Mr. Khadr ’s military defense lawyer , Lt. Cmdr. William C. Kuebler , on Friday called the replacement of the judge “ very odd . ” 
“ The judge who was frustrating the government ’s forward progress in the Khadr case , ”  Commander Kuebler said , “ is suddenly gone . ” 
A trial had been expected as soon as this summer .
Major Groharing said on Friday that the prosecution had always acted ethically and “ did n’t have anything to do with a new judge being assigned to this case . ” 
Some of Judge Brownback ’s rulings had been setbacks for Mr. Khadr , including a decision in April that rejected a central argument of the defense that Mr. Khadr , who was 15 when he was first detained , should not be prosecuted but granted protection as a child soldier .
Jennifer Daskal , an observer for Human Rights Watch at GuantÃ¡namo , said the change of judges suggested “ political meddling ”  in the process .
In a terse e-mail message to a court clerk , Judge Kohlmann simply appointed a new judge , Col. Patrick Parrish .
There are no listed telephone numbers for the chambers of GuantÃ¡namo judges and a spokesman for the Office of Military Commissions at the Pentagon , Capt .
AndrÃ© Kok , said he could provide no way of reaching Judge Brownback .

Energy in China : ' We call it the Three Gorges of the sky .
The dam there taps water , we tap wind '
In the vast natural wind tunnel that is Dabancheng , the gales that roar between the snow - capped mountain ridges get so strong that trains have been gusted off railway tracks and lorries overturned .
Such is the ferocity of the elements that police sometimes have to stop the traffic that passes through this arid , six - mile - wide plain on what was once part of the Silk Road .
That used to be bad for business in Xinjiang , the most westerly region of China , which formerly depended on the trade route between central Asia and the densely populated cities in the far east .
Today , however , the gales themselves have become big business in Dabancheng .
The area is home to one of Asia 's biggest wind farms and a pioneer in a Chinese industry that is forecast to lead the world by the end of next year .
From the road , 118 giant turbines are visible miles before you reach them .
Tourists stop for pictures , hair blowing as they pose near the whirring towers .
It is a spectacular sight : fields of spinning blades harvesting energy and transforming it into electricity for the nearby city of Urumqi .
A few years ago , this was the only wind farm of such a size in China .
But now , bigger facilities have been built or are under construction in Gansu , Inner Mongolia and Jiangsu .
Since 2005 , the country 's wind generation capacity has increased by more than 100 % a year .
The government 's renewable energy policy aims to procure 15 % of the country 's energy from non-carbon sources by 2020 , twice the proportion of 2005 .
Wind power has taken off faster than the government planned .
This year , policymakers had to double their wind power prediction for 2010 , having reached the old goal of 5 gigawatts three years ahead of schedule .
On current trends , it will almost definitely have to be doubled again .
Turning point
" China is witnessing the start of a golden age of wind power development , and the magnitude of growth has caught even policymakers off guard , " wrote Junfeng Li , secretary general of the China Renewable Energy Industries Association , in a paper last month .
" It is widely believed that wind power will be able to compete with coal generation by as early as 2015 .
That will be the turning point in China , which by then will be the world 's largest energy consumer . "
China 's environmental woes are well documented .
Less understood is how the country is attempting to deal with those problems , particularly through the recent , spectacular growth of the renewable energy market .
Strong state policies , rising coal prices and improved technology have prompted a surge of investment into green energy , particularly wind power .
" China 's wind energy market is unrecognisable from two years ago , It is huge , huge huge .
But it is not realised yet in the outside world , " said Steve Sawyer , secretary general of the Global Wind Energy Council .
He said China might have already overtaken the US as the planet 's biggest turbine manufacturer .
Given the ambitious plans for wind farms , it could also install the most new generating capacity by 2010 .
" A few years ago wind energy was boutique , something to show off to foreigners to prove how green they are but now it is a very serious part of their energy policy , " Sawyer said .
" They can make things happen so quickly in China compared to the west .
When they make up their minds , it is incredible how fast things happen . "
At the end of last year , China had 6 gigawatts of installed wind power generating capacity , covering 202 projects .
Another 445 sites have been targeted for development in the near future - according to data from Azure International , a consultancy in Beijing .
The signs of expansion are everywhere .
At Dabancheng , new towers are being erected .
One of the main operators - Xijiang Tianfang Wind Power - already produces 110,000 kilowatt - hours of electricity and managers say they plan to add 50,000 more by November .
This has already been overtaken by Huitengxile Huadian Wind Farm in Inner Mongolia , which supplies electricity to Beijing .
Cows and camels roam between the towers of what started in 1996 as an experimental site , but has now been ramped up to the biggest wind farm in China .
" We call it the Three Gorges of the sky .
The hydroelectric dam there taps the water , here we tap the wind , " said Li Yanjun , the duty operator " I 've been here since the beginning .
The turbines are like my children .
It took 10 years to reach 64,000 kilowatt / hours because that period was the research phase , but now the government is committed to wind energy so we can grow quickly . "
We went inside one of the taller towers to a small room with computers controlling the direction of the 68 - metre - high turbine .
The sound of the whirring blades vibrated through the enclosed chamber as Li pointed to the readings :
Wind speed 10.4 km per hour ( 6.4 mph ) , power generation 1,000 kilowatts .
" This is the future in China , " said Li . " Everyone is opting for big turbines .
It is more economic to have one 1,500 kw turbine than two 750 kw turbines and the maintenance costs are lower . "
But even this will soon be trumped .
At Jiuquan in Gansu province , the ground has been broken for what could one day be the world 's biggest wind farm .
Even the first phase - to be completed by 2010 - will add 3.8 gigawatts , more than the wind generating capacity of the entire country at the end of 2006 .
When the project is finished , it will be almost three times bigger and linked up to a " wind energy corridor " through Gansu which will be connected to an expanded national grid .
As in India and Brazil , investment in the industry is surging .
These three countries ' share of new wind financing in the world rose from 12 % to 22 % between 2004 and 2007 .
But the growth is from a tiny base .
The industry remains minuscule compared with coal .
China 's wind industry is still dominated by five state - owned power generation utilities and a handful of other energy - related state - owned enterprises .
It was these giant companies that snapped up the first set of " national concession project " government tenders for large wind power generation projects .
Competition is heating up .
The turbine industry used to be dominated by foreign manufacturers , such as Vestas of Denmark , Gamesa of Spain and GE of the US .
But last year for the first time , domestic manufacturers grabbed more than 50 % of the market .
The biggest player by market share is Goldwind , which is based in Urumqi and piloted much of its technology in nearby Dabancheng .
The firm says it has grown by more than 100 % for each of the past eight years .
Now it produces its own big 1.5 megawatts turbines and is developing a model with twice the capacity that it aims to start testing by 2009 .
" There is still a gap between Chinese companies and western companies in terms of research and development because we started later , " said a Goldwind executive , who asked to remain nameless .
" Most of our technology comes from Germany .
But in the first half of this year , we bought the company that taught us how to do things .
That has solved the problem of research and development .
Now we want to start selling overseas . "
Goldwind recently made its first sale of turbines to Cuba and it and other domestic manufacturers have been in talks with potential buyers in Pakistan , the Philippines and South Korea .
The government already promotes coal technology in energy deals with countries in Africa and the Middle East .
" In this context it is reasonable to expect Chinese wind turbines to find receptive export markets in the near term despite the financing and insurance related challenges stemming from limited track - record for many products , " said Sebastian Meyer , director of research and advisory at Azure International .
The biggest growth , however , is likely to be in the domestic market .
In addition to the current 6 gigawatts of generating capacity , Azure estimates that a staggering 130 gigawatts is in the pipeline in China .
Established turbine manufacturers continue to ramp up production even as new entrants try to squeeze their way into the market .
If all of their plans are added together , China 's new production capacity could surge to 11 gigawatts this year - almost three times the amount installed last year .
This supply considerably exceeds current demand , which means the waiting times for turbines should decrease .
" It is probably going to be the most competitive turbine market in the world very quickly .
Elsewhere , it is a seller 's market .
Now in China , we are on the tipping point of it becoming a buyers ' market , " according to Meyer .
" In 2008 it is likely to grow 1.5 times so growth is actually decelerating , but in terms of volume , size and scale this has become a respectable market globally . "
Competition
Rising demand for electricity and tighter safety regulations in mines have driven up the price of domestic coal , which supplies 70 % of China 's energy needs .
Domestic prices are now so high that many power plants in Guangdong and elsewhere in southern China import coal from Australia .
This year , the big five utilities are bleeding money because coal costs have been steadily rising .
They cannot pass costs on to their customers because of government regulation of power prices .
Even so , wind energy produces a kilowatt - hour of electricity at about twice the cost of a Chinese coal - fired power plant .
Even with the recent price rises , coal remains king in China .
To meet the demands of the fast growing economy , power plants and factories burn 2bn tonnes of coal each year , about a third of the world 's total .
This is why China has overtaken the US as the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases and it is unlikely to fall back to second place for decades .
Wind is also far less favoured than hydro- electricity .
Take the dams out of the energy mix and renewables will barely manage 1 % of all power generation by 2010 and only 3 % by 2020 even in regions with well - developed grids .
That is a low proportion compared with the world leader Denmark , which gets about 20 % of its electricity from wind .
Long term , the future of wind power is secured by government commitments to renewable energy .
The authorities are increasingly alarmed by global warming , which is melting glaciers in Tibet and Xinjiang that provide drinking water to tens of millions of people .
Extreme weather conditions have also led some regions to suffer the worst snowstorms and droughts in decades .
Last week , officials in Sichuan province warned that summer flooding was likely to start earlier and be the biggest in a decade because of abnormally high rainfall in May .
On the global stage , China has refused to set binding targets to reduce carbon emissions .
But the official rhetoric has shifted .
At the end of last month , President Hu Jintao called a politburo study session on the subject of climate change , which energy industry insiders described as an unprecedented level of attention to the problem .
" Our task is tough , and our time is limited .
Party organisations and governments at all levels must give priority to emission reduction and bring the idea deep into people 's hearts , " the president was quoted as saying by the state - run Xinhua news agency .
Environmental groups say the country needs to set more ambitious goals for wind power .
With the right government policy , Greenpeace predicts that China 's installed wind power capacity could reach 122 GW by 2020 , equivalent to the capacity of five Three Gorges Dams , or 10 % of the total installed capacity of the country .
In the near future , more and bigger turbines will be spread over a wider area of China .
As well as manufacturing more wind power equipment than any other country , analysts predict that China may soon be the world leader in installation .
" China is catching up fast , " said Meyer .
" The market is ripe for China not replicating what Europe and US did in the past , but doing it better . "
Forecasting Oil Prices :
It ’s Easy to Beat the Experts
Most economists are used to being button - holed at parties and asked about some specific feature of the economy .
And the more distant the topic is from your research , the more likely it is that you will be asked about it .
Right now , I ’m getting plenty of questions about what is happening to oil prices .
I recently dug into the recent oil literature and discovered something amazing :
It is easy to do better than the experts .
At least this is what I learned from a recent working paper , “ What Do We Learn From the Price of Crude Oil Futures ? ” by Michigan economists Ron Alquist and Lutz Kilian .
The authors compare a whole range of different ways of forecasting oil prices : they look up the Consensus Forecast ( from a survey of expert economic forecasters ) , oil futures , the difference between the oil price in futures and spot markets , and also a range of more or less complicated econometric models that take account of recent trends , as well as variables like the interest rate .
And it turns out that they all do worse than one simple forecast : the current oil price .
That ’s right : the most accurate forecast of oil prices over the next month , year , or quarter is the current oil price .
We call this the no-change forecast .
The Alquist - Kilian finding was the subject of my latest commentary for American Public Media ’s Marketplace ( available here ; or here for the audio version ) .
Here ’s the highlight :
Amazingly , this simple rule did better than the average of dozens of professional forecasters !
In fact , the no-change forecast was 34 percent more accurate at predicting oil prices in 3 months time , and 18 percent more accurate at predicting prices in a year ’s time .
While professional prognosticators might argue that this difference is n’t statistically significant , it sure is embarrassing .
It turns out that the so - called experts add too much variance to their forecasts , leading them to do worse than the no-change rule .
I was more surprised by the poor performance of the oil futures prices as forecasts .
My usual response to being asked about the future of oil simply involved looking up the futures market and calling those prices a forecast .
However this is n’t quite right : the spot price embeds in it an option value or “ convenience yield ” that is n’t factored into futures prices .
And if this convenience yield moves about ( and it tends to move up and down with economic uncertainty ) , then this causes the futures price to fluctuate in ways unrelated to the future oil price .
If you are interested in learning more about oil prices , Kilian ’s recent papers are a useful starting point .

Beyond rubbing shoulders with contributors , Mr. McCain could use the chairman ’s perch to score points with important Republican figures  he presented Freedom Awards to President Bush , former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and , in 2003 , the incoming Senate majority leader , Bill Frist .
At least seven board members have been involved in his presidential campaign , along with the institute ’s president , Lorne W. Craner , a former Senate aide whose father was in the same Hanoi prison as Mr. McCain .
Mr. McCain declined to be interviewed for this article .
Brian Rogers , a campaign spokesman , said the senator “ has never requested nor offered to take a position on legislation in exchange for , or because of , contributions to I.R.I . ”
He added that Mr. McCain was “ proud of I.R.I. ’s work in countries from Peru to Serbia to Mongolia . ”
“ In traveling overseas , ” Mr. Rogers said , “ Senator McCain has repeatedly been complimented on I.R.I. ’s work by prime ministers and presidents , U.S. ambassadors and ordinary citizens .
Many have told him that freedom in their country would not have been possible without I.R.I. ’s work . ”
The institute ’s work in some of those countries resonates with important ethnic voting blocs at home .
When Mr. McCain ’s Democratic rival for president , Senator Barack Obama , traveled to Miami in May to address Cuban - Americans , Republicans circulated a memorandum to reporters that quoted an anti-Castro group criticizing Mr. Obama ’s willingness to talk to Cuba ’s communist leaders .
Not mentioned was that the group , the Cuban Democratic Directorate , was financed for years by the International Republican Institute  it got more than $ 8 million during Mr. McCain ’s tenure .
Though the directorate does not endorse candidates , its leaders are effusive in praising Mr. McCain .
“ I want to stress that we are very thankful to Senator McCain for everything he has done through I.R.I. to support our cause , ” said Janisset Rivero , joint national secretary of the directorate .
A Leadership Shift
Shaken by the loss of the White House in 1992 , Republicans scrambled to reinvigorate their party by giving higher profiles to some of its promising prospects .
Mr. McCain , just re-elected by a convincing margin , was given two new positions : head of fund - raising and recruiting for the Senate Republicans and chairman of the International Republican Institute .
At least that ’s what they want to make us believe with this picture posted Wednesday by Sepah News , the media arm of Iran ’s Revolutionary Guard .
Since then , the photo has been published in numerous online and offline publications , including The Los Angeles Times , The Financial Times , MSNBC , Yahoo !
News and countless others .
But it seems that Iranian State Media have a few Photoshop wizards among their ranks because today , the Associated Press released the same picture , but with a slight difference .

KANSAS CITY , Missouri ( Reuters ) - A Missouri car dealer said on Thursday sales have soared at his auto and truck business since launching a promotion this week that promises buyers a free handgun or a $ 250 gas card with every purchase .
Max Motors , a small Butler , Missouri dealership that has as its logo a grimacing cowboy wielding a pistol , has sold more than 30 cars and trucks in the last three days , far more than its normal volume .
And owner Mark Muller credits his decision to start offering buyers their choice of a $ 250 gas card or a $ 250 credit at a gun shop .
“ This thing has taken off .
Sales have quadrupled , ” said Muller .
The store sells both used and new vehicles including General Motors and Ford products .
Every buyer so far “ except one guy from Canada and one old guy ” has elected to take the gun , Muller said .
Muller recommends his customers select a Kel - Tec .380 pistol .
“ It ’s a nice little handgun that fits in your pocket , ” he said .
Muller said the promotion was inspired by Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , who is vying with Hillary Clinton to be the Democratic nominee for the presidential election in November .
“ We did it because of Barack Obama .
He said all those people in the Midwest , you ’ve got to have compassion for them because they ’re clinging to their guns and their Bibles .
I found that quite offensive . ”
“ We all go to church on Sunday and we all carry guns , ” said Muller .
“ I ’ve got a gun in my pocket right now .
I have a rifle in my truck .
We ’ve got to shoot the coyotes out here , they ’re attacking our cows , our chickens .
We ’re not clinging to nothing .
We ’re just damn glad to live in a free country where you can have a gun if you want .
This is the way it ought to be . ”

IT 'S FREE One morning last month , the manager of a Stop & Shop in Methuen , Mass. , noticed a man , along with his young daughter , leave the store without paying for several bags of shrimp .
When police arrived , they found something else on him , too : 20 cans of baby formula .
Call it a sign of the times .
Steadily and alarmingly , shoplifting seems to be rising at many retail chains , and experts are pointing at a prime cause : the sputtering economy .
" Wages are n't keeping up with inflation , especially the price of food and energy , " says Diane Swonk , chief economist at Mesirow Financial .
" It just leaves less money for everything else , and that breeds a lot of temptation . "
Retail and law enforcement experts agree that they 've seen an increase in store theft during the current slowdown — and not only from customers .
" It 's clear that both employee theft and shoplifting are up , " says Richard Hollinger , professor of criminology at the University of Florida who compiles the annual National Retail Security Survey .
" The most recent rise is being driven by the economy .
A lot of people are on the financial edge . "
When 116 retailers were surveyed recently about shoplifting , 74 % said they believed that shoplifting incidents last year had risen from 2006 , according to the National Retail Federation .
And when a smaller group of retailers were asked about shoplifting so far this year , nearly all said it has continued to rise , says Joe LaRocca , vice president of loss prevention at the National Retail Federation .
They also said they felt the economy had been a contributing factor .
All told , retail theft is estimated to cost about $ 40.5 billion a year .
And the rest of us , already squeezed by higher gas and food prices , end up paying for it : Stores pass on much of their losses to customers in the form of higher prices .
" Retailers can't afford to just eat that loss , " Hollinger says .
" Their margins are n't large enough .
So this hits right on the bottom line , and they 're trying to plug up all of these leaks , because the economy is so tight . "
Among the reasons the sluggish economy is thought to be contributing to rising shoplifting by customers and store employees : • Rising prices and growing debt .
" Unfortunately , it 's to be expected that when the economy moves into a slowdown , and families have difficulties meeting week - to - week and month - to - month bills , shoplifting is going to go up , " says Bruce Hutchinson , professor of economics at the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga .
Most police departments do n't collect data on the profiles of shoplifting suspects .
But some who deal directly with the problem say they 've detected a shift .
" In general , the shoplifter of the past was mostly trying to fuel a drug habit , " says Sgt. Alfred Pratt of the Shrewsbury , Mass. , Police Department .
" But we 've seen a change as the economy has declined .
More common , everyday items are being stolen , such as groceries . "
The district attorney 's office in Knoxville , Tenn. , says it 's seen a similar change .
" We get a lot of shoplifters , and I see the trend upward , " says Samyah Jubran , a Knox County assistant district attorney general .
Now , she says , there 's more food theft , and it tends to come from repeat offenders , many of whom seem to be struggling with financial issues .
• Fewer store clerks .
Squeezed by the tightening economy , stores are looking to trim costs .
One easy way is to reduce the number of sales clerks on the floor .
With fewer employees greeting people at the door and watching shoppers walk the aisles , it 's easier for shoplifters to grab and stash merchandise .
In April , when about two dozen retailers were asked about store theft so far this year , LaRocca says , most said they thought that reduced sales and staff cutbacks had been a contributing factor to the rise in theft rates , involving both consumers and employees .
If stores " do n't have a lot of people on duty in the store , particularly in these big - box stores , " Hollinger notes , " it leaves what are called dead zones .
That 's where shoppers can stuff things up their shirts or in their pocketbooks , take off the tags and do all sorts of things . "
With fewer employees promoting merchandise , some retailers have felt the need to unlock and display high - price products , such as jewelry and watches , outside their usual glass cases .
That might help spark more sales .
But it 's also likely to lead to more theft , says Mike Keenan , director of loss prevention at Mervyns department stores .
Job turnover , whether of sales associates or store managers , is a leading predictor of employee theft , Hollinger says .
In 2006 , retailers estimated that employee theft had caused 47 % of their company losses , according to his most recent National Retail Security Survey .
Hollinger 's survey found that employees accounted for nearly half the total cost of retail theft .
Many employees who are caught are dismissed but not prosecuted .
" After dismissal , most are also required to provide civil recovery and pay restitution , " Hollinger says .
" Just because retailers do n't always prosecute does not mean that they do not know where their merchandise and money is going . "
• Rise in organized retail crime .
The economic slowdown has led many shoppers to seek deeply discounted products through the Internet , says Paul Jones of the Retail Industry Leaders Association .
Exploiting the opportunity , criminal teams are zeroing in on retail products and selling them cheaply , authorities say .
" It 's become more lucrative for them , " Jones says .
Gangs of professional thieves account for $ 15 billion to $ 30 billion in retail losses every year , the FBI and the retail federation estimated in 2005 .
This year , 85 % of retailers said they thought they 'd been victims of criminal enterprises in the past 12 months , according to a survey the retail federation released this month .
The Internet has made it much easier for thieves to sell more stolen items , because " they used to have to sell at a garage sale or flea market or through a fence , and those were generally local , " Keenan says .
Now , he notes , it 's easier to use the Internet to unload products across the country and the world .
Many people are willing to grab those deals , even if they suspect they might be buying stolen goods .
" Consumers are looking for a big bang for their buck , " says Swonk , the economist at Mesirow Financial .
" If it 's stolen goods , they 're going to get it at a better price than at the retailer .
It 's creating another market . "
Questionable medicine
Yet , doing so could carry health risks in some cases .
" We 've found that many people buy infant formula through different online auction sites , " Jones says .
" But they do n't know if that merchandise is properly stored , if it has the correct date on it or if it is even the right merchandise . "
Last week , after a two - year investigation with the FBI and IRS , the San Jose , Calif. , Police Department busted a shoplifting ring whose thieves had stolen merchandise from grocery stores and discount retailers .
Products that included Pepcid AC , Claritin and Tylenol were sold on the Internet and at flea markets , police said .
Last year , the FBI joined with the retail industry , which it relies on for shoplifting data , to pool information and help combat organized retail theft .
Only in recent years , though , have a majority of retailers been willing to discuss merchandise theft .
" In 1991 , when we started this process , " Hollinger says , referring to his National Retail Security Survey , " it was like root canal . "
But shoplifting and employee theft have imposed such financial burdens on retailers that more of them are seeking answers .
" It 's the single largest category of property crime in America , bar none , " Hollinger says .
" Bank robberies , car theft — nothing comes close to this . "
As long as the economy remains weak , many experts think the trend will persist .
" When the economy is down , shoplifting and other crime go up , " says Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody's Economy.com .
" People are losing jobs or moving from a full - time to a part - time job .
But they still have the mortgage to pay and the credit cards to pay . "

HOUSTON  Despite pleas from the White House and the State Department , as well as an international court order to review their cases , Texas will execute five Mexicans on death row , a spokeswoman for the governor said Thursday .
The first of the executions  that of José Ernesto Medellín , 33 , convicted in the 1993 rape and murder of two teenage girls here  is scheduled for Aug .
5 .
The decision by Gov. Rick Perry to allow the executions is the latest twist in a long - running battle between Mexico , which has no death penalty , and the United States over the fate of 51 Mexicans facing capital punishment in several states , including 14 in Texas .
On Wednesday , the International Court of Justice at The Hague ordered a review of five of the Texas cases after Mexico complained that the convicts , all men , had not been allowed a chance to talk to a Mexican consul after their arrests , as required under the 1963 Vienna Convention on Consular Relations .
“ Laboratory Corporation of America® Holdings is now offering OvaSure™ , an Ovarian Cancer Screening test to assess the presence of early stage ovarian cancer in high - risk women .
In a recent study of high risk and average risk subjects , this blood test , using six biomarkers and research conducted at Yale University School of Medicine , was shown to discriminate between disease - free women and ovarian cancer patients ( stage I - IV ) with high specificity ( 99.4 % ) and sensitivity ( 95.3 % ) .
Additional studies performed at Yale University School of Medicine demonstrate comparable findings . ”
On March 14 , 2008 , the H*O* P * E*™ weblog reported that a new blood test developed by the Yale University School of Medicine detected early stage ovarian cancer with 99 % accuracy in Phase II clinical trial testing .
To review the March 14 H*O * P * E * ™ weblog post , click here .
In 2006 , Laboratory Corporation of America ( Lab Corp ) obtained licensing rights to the ovarian cancer early detection blood test , known as OvaSure™ , from Yale .
Today , Lab . Corp. announced in a press release that it is making the OvaSure™ blood test immediately available nationwide to women who are at high risk of developing ovarian cancer in the future .
The relevant portion of the Lab Corp. press release dated June 23 , 2007 is set forth below .
“ LabCorp Announces Availability of OvaSure ™
Burlington , NC , June 23 , 2008 – Laboratory Corporation of America® Holdings ( LabCorp® ) ( NYSE : LH ) is now offering OvaSure™ , an Ovarian Cancer Screening test to assess the presence of early stage ovarian cancer in high - risk women .
In a recent study of high risk and average risk subjects , this blood test , using six biomarkers and research conducted at Yale University School of Medicine , was shown to discriminate between disease - free women and ovarian cancer patients ( stage I - IV ) with high specificity ( 99.4 % ) and sensitivity ( 95.3 % ) .
Additional studies performed at Yale University School of Medicine demonstrate comparable findings .
‘ LabCorp is pleased to offer for high - risk women the OvaSure test to enhance the potential of detecting and treating ovarian cancer in its early or localized stage when the likelihood of survival is greatest , ’ said Myla P. Lai-Goldman , M.D. , Executive Vice President , Chief Medical Officer of LabCorp .
‘ OvaSure is a significant addition to LabCorp ’s family of proteomic tests , and a major component of LabCorp ’s strategy to bring the latest in diagnostic technology to women ’s healthcare . ’
It has been estimated that for the year 2008 , 21,650 women will be newly diagnosed with ovarian cancer .
It has been further estimated that 15,520 women will die from the disease in 2008 .
Despite being one - eighth as common as breast cancer , it is three times more lethal .
If ovarian cancer is diagnosed and treated at the localized stage , the 5 - year survival rate is 92 % ; unfortunately , only 19 % of all cases are found at the localized stage .
Most women have their ovarian cancer detected at the regional or distant stage when the 5 - year survival rates are 71 % and 30 % respectively .
‘ I am pleased that this test is available to help physicians detect and treat ovarian cancer in its earliest stages , ’ said Gil Mor , M.D. , associate professor in the Department of Obstetrics , Gynecology & Reproductive Sciences at Yale and a member of Yale Cancer Center .
‘ Our team is proud that our research may help play a role in higher survival rates for women with this disease . ’ ”

Comment **: Although additional Phase III clinical trial testing with a larger patient population is required , the OvaSure™ blood test may represent the “ gold standard ” for early stage ovarian cancer detection in the near future .
The immediate availability of the OvaSure™ blood test for use by women who are at high risk for developing ovarian cancer could save lives by catching ovarian cancer in its earliest stages , thereby making treatment of the disease highly effective .

** As of August 21 , 2008 , the amended OvaSure™ test “ use ” information provides , among other things , that a woman who has had both ovaries removed ( i.e. , a bilateral oophorectomy ) should not use the test .
Accordingly , it appears that the OvaSure™ test cannot be used by a “ high - risk ” woman to screen for an ovarian cancer recurrence , if she had both ovaries removed as part of her first line treatment following initial diagnosis of the disease .
OvaSure™ Information : The OvaSure™ blood test is now available nationwide through LabCorp .

It is our understanding that the OvaSure™ test cost approximately ( U.S. ) $ 225 and test results are available within five business days .
OvaSure™ Use ( updated 8/21/08 ) : “ The OvaSureTM assay may be used as a tool to identify high - risk women who might have ovarian carcinoma .
OvaSureTM is not indicated for a patient who is currently undergoing chemotherapy , who has had both ovaries removed , who is pregnant , or who is lactating .
About 10 % of women with benign ovarian masses ( including cysts ) may have positive results by this test . ”
OvaSure™ Limitations ( updated 8/21/08 ) :
“ Pregnant women or women who are lactating should not be screened by the assay because it may lead to false - positive results .
A Calculated Risk Index of 0.50 or greater indicates a positive reading , which is suggestive of ovarian cancer ( possible presence of disease ) .
In a clinical study ( see Journal Abstract below ) across all disease stages , the six - marker panel composed of leptin , prolactin , osteopontin , insulin - like growth factor II , macrophage inhibitory factor , and CA - 125 demonstrated a sensitivity of 95.3 % and a specificity of 99.4 % in detecting disease .
Greater than 99 % sensitivity ( 119 of 120 ) was shown in late - stage disease ( stage III and stage IV ) .
In early stage disease ( stage I and stage II ) , the assay demonstrated a sensitivity of 91.6 % , providing a significant improvement over CA - 125 alone ( less than 60 % of stage I and stage II combined ) for ovarian cancer detection .
All positive readings should be retested on a new sample drawn at least three weeks after the original sample was collected .
Patients with positive results confirmed by retesting on a second sample should be followed by a women ’s health specialist who may order additional evaluations , such as sensitive imaging .
Components used in this test are labeled as research purposes only .
The performance characteristics of this product have not been established by the assay manufacturer .
Results should not be used as a diagnosis for ovarian cancer without confirmation of the diagnosis by another medically established diagnostic product or procedure . ”

July 2 , 2008 : The Society of Gynecologic Oncologists ( SGO ) issued a statement regarding the Labcorp OvaSure™ test .
The SGO statement , dated July 2 , 2008 , is quoted below in its entirety .
“ July 2 , 2008 Society of Gynecologic Oncologists
Statement Regarding OvaSureTM
The Society of Gynecologic Oncologists ( SGO ) recognizes the need for accurate early detection biomarkers for ovarian cancer .
For this reason , SGO reviewed the literature regarding OvaSure , a serum - based diagnostic test for ovarian cancer .
After reviewing OvaSure ’s materials , it is our opinion that additional research is needed to validate the test ’s effectiveness before offering it to women outside of the context of a research study conducted with appropriate informed consent under the auspices of an institutional review board .
SGO is committed to actively following and contributing to this vitally important research .
As physicians who care only for women with gynecologic cancers , our hope is that these cancers can either be prevented or detected early .
Because no currently available test has been shown to reliably detect ovarian cancer in its earliest and most curable stages , we will await the results of further clinical validation of OvaSure with great interest . ”
The SGO is a national medical specialty organization of physician - surgeons who are trained in the comprehensive management of women with malignancies of the reproductive tract .
The purpose of the SGO is to improve the care of women with gynecologic cancers by encouraging research and disseminating knowledge to raise the standards of practice in the prevention and treatment of gynecologic malignancies , in cooperation with other organizations interested in women ’s health care , oncology and related fields .

“ AM Nick is a Fellow in the Department of Gynecologic Oncology , and AK Sood is the Bettyann Asche - Murray Distinguished Professor in the Department of Gynecologic Oncology and in the Department of Cancer Biology , both at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center , Houston , TX , USA .
In order to overcome the significant mortality associated with ovarian cancer , a highly sensitive and specific screening test is urgently needed .
CA125 is used to assess response to chemotherapy , detect recurrence , and distinguish malignant from benign disease ; however , this marker is elevated in only 50 - 60 % of stage I ovarian cancers , making it inadequate for early detection of malignancy .
In this Practice Point , we discuss Visintin et al . ‘s attempt to validate a novel multiplex assay that uses a panel of six serum biomarkers - leptin , prolactin , osteopontin , insulin - like growth factor II , macrophage inhibitory factor , and CA125 [ medical abstract & full text of Visintin et. al. study provided above ] .
The study included 362 healthy controls and 156 patients with newly diagnosed ovarian cancer .
The final model yielded 95.3 % sensitivity , 99.4 % specificity , a positive predictive value of 99.3 % and a negative predictive value of 99.2 % .
These results indicate potential utility of this assay for early detection of ovarian cancer , although further validation is needed in a sample set representative of the general population . ”
August 21 , 2008 : The Labcorp information with respect to the OvaSure™ test was recently modified .
Despite that fact that the test was made available for “ high - risk ” women , it can not be used by women who have had both ovaries removed .
Consequently , it appears that a woman who had both ovaries removed ( i.e. , bilateral oophorectomy ) after an initial diagnosis of ovarian cancer , cannot use the OvaSure™ test to screen for a potential recurrence of the disease in the future .

With gas prices going through the roof and regulators requiring cars to be ever more miserly , Volkswagen is bringing new meaning to the term " fuel efficiency " with a bullet - shaped microcar that gets a stunning 282 235 mpg .
Volkswagen's had its super - thrifty One - Liter Car concept vehicle – so named because that 's how much fuel it needs to go 100 kilometers – stashed away for six years .
The body 's made of carbon fiber to minimize weight ( the entire car weighs just 660 pounds ) and company execs did n't expect the material to become cheap enough to produce the car until 2012 .
But VW 's decided to build the car two years ahead of schedule .
According to Britain's Car magazine , VW has approved a plan to build a limited number of One - Liters in 2010 .
They 'll probably be built in the company 's prototype shop , which has the capacity to build as many as 1,000 per year .
That 's not a lot , but it 's enough to help VW get a lot of attention while showing how much light weight and an efficient engine can achieve .
VW unveiled the slick two - seater concept six years ago at a stockholder 's meeting in Hamburg .
To prove it was a real car , Chairman Ferdinand Piech personally drove it from Wolfsburg to Hamburg .
At the time , he said the car could see production when the cost of its carbon monocoque dropped from 35,000 Euros ( about $ 55,000 ) to 5,000 Euros ( about $ 8,000 ) – something he figured would happen in 2012 .
With carbon fiber being used in everything from airliners to laptops these days , VW 's apparently decided the cost is competitive enough to build at least a few hundred One - Liters .
VW 's engineers – who spent three years developing the car – made extensive use of magnesium , titanium and aluminum to bring it in at less than one - third the weight of a Toyota Echo .
According to Canadian Driver , the front suspension assembly weighs just 18 pounds .
The six - speed transmission features a magnesium case , titanium bolts and hollow gears ; it weighs a tad more than 50 pounds .
The 16 - inch wheels are carbon fiber .
The magnesium steering wheel weighs a little more than a pound .
How much of the concept car 's exotic hardware makes it to the production model remains to be seen .
Low weight only gets you so far in the quest for ultimate fuel economy ; aerodynamics plays a big role .
The One - Liter is long and low , coming in at 11.4 feet long , 4.1 feet wide and 3.3 feet tall .
It features an aircraft - like canopy , flat wheel covers and a belly pan to smooth the airflow under the car .
The engine cooling vents open only when needed , and video cameras take the place of mirrors .
The passenger sits behind the driver to keep the car narrow .
The car has a coefficient of drag of 0.16 ; the average car comes in around 0.30 and the Honda Insight had a Cd of 0.25 .
As for the engine , the concept had a one - cylinder diesel engine producing 8.5 horsepower and 13.5 foot - pounds of torque .
Car says the production model will use a two - cylinder turbodiesel for a little more oomph .
Doubling the number of cylinders is sure to cut fuel economy , so VW may install a diesel - hybrid drivetrain .
The engine turns off at stop lights to save fuel , then automatically restarts when the driver depresses the accelerator pedal .
( Update :
The car reportedly has anti-lock brakes , stability control and airbags .
According to Canadian Driver , " Volkswagen says the One - Liter Car is as safe as a GT sports car registered for racing .
With the aid of computer crash simulations , the car was designed with built - in crash tubes , pressure sensors for airbag control and front crumple zones . " )
What 's it gonna cost ?
Car quotes " one well - placed insider " who says the One - Liter could have a sticker price of anywhere from 20,000 to 30,000 Euros ( about $ 31,750
to $ 47,622 ) .
That 's a lot of money .
But then , the One - Liter , despite its diminutive size , is a lot of car .
* Note / Update : Turns out the 282 mpg figure refers to Imperial gallons ; the proper figure when converted to U.S. gallons is 235 mpg . *

Thirty - six planes will make the trip across the Taiwan Strait this weekend
The first regular , direct flight from mainland China to Taiwan for nearly 60 years has landed at Taipei 's airport .
China 's top official on Taiwan affairs said the flight was " a new start " in exchanges between Taipei and Beijing .
The two sides have been ruled by separate governments since 1949 , forcing travellers to fly via a third destination .
But ties have improved significantly since Taiwan 's new president , Ma Ying - jeou , took office in May .
Mr Ma advocates stronger economic ties with China , which considers Taiwan a breakaway province and has threatened force if it moves towards formal independence .
The agreements on flights , signed last month , is seen as a big step towards improved cross -strait relations .
' One family '
The new flights , which will take place from Friday to Monday only , will connect five major cities in China with hubs in Taiwan .
In pictures : First day of flights China - Taiwan direct : Readers react The China Southern Airlines flight , from the southern city of Guangzhou , was the first of 36 cross - strait flights to be launched this weekend .
It carried about 250 passengers and was met with a water sprinkling ceremony .
Company chairman Liu Shaoyong flew on the inaugural flight .
" This is a sacred moment .
The two sides of the strait are like members in one family , " he told journalists in Taipei .
Other arriving passengers , many of whom are tourists , were greeted by lion dancers and aboriginal singers .
" It 's so convenient to get here , " Wang Qi , who arrived in Taipei from Xiamen , said .
" Since I was very young I always wanted to go to Alishan , " she told Reuters news agency , referring to Taiwan 's most famous mountain .
At the same time as the China Southern flight was travelling to Taipei , a Taiwan - based China Airlines flight with Taiwanese tourists was making its way to Shanghai .
Tourism boost
The new flight agreement is being seen as a high - profile endorsement for new Taiwanese President Ma Ying - jeou , and his Kuomintang ( KMT ) party , which has just taken power again after more than a decade in opposition .

Until now , people had to fly via Hong Kong or Macau to get to Taiwan China and Taiwan ruled by separate governments since end of Chinese civil war in 1949 China considers the island part of its territory China has offered a " one country , two systems " solution , like Hong Kong Most people in Taiwan support status quo
Taiwan flashpoint
As well as the symbolism , there 's a practical hope too that the increase in mainland tourists will boost Taiwan 's flagging economy .
Local businesses are predicting the new arrivals will provide a much - needed cash boost .
Tourist numbers from the mainland are expected to rapidly increase because - alongside the deal on flights - the two sides have also agreed that the number of Chinese tourists allowed to visit Taiwan will rise to 3,000 per day from 18 July .
Many Taiwanese are excited by the expected influx of tourists , says the BBC's Caroline Gluck in Taipei .
But others are more wary - citing concerns about rude behaviour , cheap spending habits and the potential for political disputes , our correspondent says .
Long road ahead
There is still much that could be done to improve China - Taiwan relations .
Direct cargo flights - much more useful to Taiwanese businesses than tourist flights - are still being blocked by Beijing .
And there is no sign of progress on political issues which are key for Taiwan , including Taipei 's demand for international recognition .
The new charter flights still take a circuitous route , through Hong Kong airspace , so that flying times are longer than need be .
This is because Taiwan 's military is on constant alert for an air attack from the mainland , and analysts say it cannot afford to let civilian flights clutter cross-straits radars .

DUBAI , May 1 ( Reuters ) - A Kuwaiti man released from the U.S. prison in Guantanamo Bay in 2005 has carried out a suicide bombing in Iraq , his cousin told Al Arabiya television on Thursday .
A friend of Abdullah Saleh al - Ajmi in Iraq informed his family that Abdullah carried out the attack in Mosul , his cousin Salem told the Dubai - based television channel .
" We were shocked by the painful news we received this afternoon ... through a call from one of the friend's of martyr Abdullah in Iraq , " said Salem al - Ajmi in a telephone interview aired by Arabiya .
He did not say when the suicide bombing happened .
Abdullah had been missing for two weeks and his family learned he left Kuwait illegally for Syria , he said .
Abdullah had sent messages to his wife from Iraq .
Abdullah , 30 , had a son after he was released from the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where the United States holds suspected terrorists , Salem said .
There were no indications Abdullah had any plans to join insurgents in Iraq although he became less sociable in the period before he disappeared , he said .
Many of the men held at Guantanamo were captured in Afghanistan in the U.S. - led war to oust the Taliban after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Many have been held for years and nearly all are being held without charge .
Washington has designated Guantanamo prisoners " enemy combatants " .

Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has instructed U.S. overseas missions to provide only minimal support to foreign visits by the two main presidential candidates , Sens. Barack Obama and John McCain , forbidding diplomats to hold events or arrange meetings for them .
In a cable sent late Thursday on the eve of Mr. Obama ’s swing through the Middle East and Europe , Miss Rice told U.S. diplomats to treat the candidates as “ members of Congress visiting in personal or semi-personal capacities , ” but “ with additional restrictions based on rules related to political activity . ”
“ Provide de minimis assistance to the candidate with logistical arrangements , ” said the cable , a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Times .
“ If the campaign staff wants to rent a bus for press , tell them where they can rent a bus . ”
Mr. Obama , Illinois Democrat , is in the midst of a high - profile foreign trip to Asia , the Middle East and Western Europe that is being intensely scrutinized for its political impact back home .
Mr. McCain , Arizona Republican , traveled to Europe and the Middle East more than four months earlier than Mr. Obama , but the State Department did not issue special instructions for overseas missions because during that trip he led an official congressional delegation , officials said .
“ It is imperative that , in implementing these various requirements , we treat both major presidential candidates evenhandedly , ” Miss Rice said in her cable .
American embassies and consulates around the world are actively engaged in official visits by members of Congress and other government leaders .
Diplomats meet the visitors at the airport , accompany them to meetings , most of which they have arranged , and host public events for them .
“ Our interactions with the candidates need to be made in the context that they are also sitting U.S. senators and very important U.S. visitors with special security concerns , ” Miss Rice said .
She banned embassies from providing and paying for transportation “ unless security considerations require otherwise . ”
But she demanded “ support to the candidate ’s Secret Service protective detail . ”
The secretary also let diplomats brief Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama before a meeting , and even attend meetings “ if the candidate allows ” it .
She forbade them , however , to “ hold or arrange receptions or public events for the candidate , ” to “ arrange the candidate ’s meetings ” or to “ use official funds and resources , beyond a de minimis level , to support a political trip . ”
Diplomats in Washington and overseas said that Miss Rice ’s instructions were appropriate , but their implementation becomes more complicated when part of a campaign trip is made with a congressional delegation , as is the case with Mr. Obama ’s current travels .
On his stops in Afghanistan and Iraq , the Democratic presidential hopeful was accompanied by Sens. Chuck Hagel , Nebraska Republican , and Jack Reed , Rhode Island Democrat .
Mr. Obama ’s other stops , including Jordan , Israel , Germany , France and Britain , are not considered part of an official congressional delegation , or “ CODEL ” in the language of Miss Rice ’s message .
Mr. Obama met briefly with top Kuwaiti officials Sunday after completing a visit to Afghanistan .
He is expected to be in Iraq on Monday .
Mr. Obama ’s trip is likely to overshadow Miss Rice ’s own travels this week , during which she is expected to meet for the first time with North Korean Foreign Minister Pak Ui Chun .
They are scheduled to attend a meeting of the six countries negotiating the dismantling of the North ’s nuclear programs on the sidelines of the annual gathering of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Singapore .
The other four countries are China , Japan , South Korea and Russia .

Sometimes false advertising is easy to spot .
Statements like " Lose 20 pounds in 5 days "  or " Make $ 1 million a month while sitting at home "  seem to choke on their own incredulity , but sometimes marketers employ a little more finesse to bamboozle you .
Here are six examples of shamelessly false advertising that were n't just implicitly misleading , they were blatant lies !
1. Listerine as a Cure - All
Listerine was the first over - the counter mouthwash sold in the United States in 1914 and by 1921 it was already falsely marketing its product .
Declaring itself a cure - all for common cold ailments like sore throats and coughs , a dandruff preventative , an anti-shave tonic , and a safe way to protect yourself from cuts , bruises , wounds , and stings , Listerine was slapped with numerous false advertisement lawsuits .
In 1975 , the Federal Trade Commission ordered the company to spend $ 10 million in corrective advertising , seeing as their product was no more effective in treating colds than gargling warm water .
Even then , the mouthwash giant did n't really learn their lesson .
In 2005 , the company was slapped with another lawsuit .
This time because Listerine claimed it was as " effective as floss "  after rigging clinical trials .
2. Lydia Pickham 's Vegetable Compound ( Great for boozy housewives ! )
Touted as one of the world 's first successful businesswomen , Lydia Pickham exploited her reputation as a local medicine woman to propel her herbal remedy into a commercial success , eventually grossing almost $ 400,000 yearly .
The remedy claimed to cure all womanly ailments and weaknesses and sold for $ 1 a bottle .
What was in the herbal remedy ?
Turns out , it contained less than 1 % solid substance from vegetable extracts and almost 20 % alcohol .
If a woman took the suggested 1 tablespoon , every 2 - 4 hours , she will have consumed 5 ounces of 13.5 % or higher alcohol by the end of the day - more than enough for a healthy buzz that made life seem a bit more cheery to boozy housewives .
When the Federal Trade Commission tightened its laws on claims made by medicines , Lydia Pickham 's Vegetable Compound had to swallow the restrictions with a spoonful of sugar .
3. Crystal Clear Amoco Gasoline : Good , Clean Fun
In 1996 , the Amoco Oil Company agreed to settle a Federal Trade Commission charge that its " Crystal Clear Amoco Ultimate " advertised unsubstantiated claims .
The premium gasoline , because of its clear color , boasted superior engine performance and environmental benefits .
The fact is , at the time the country was going through a clear revolution .
Pepsi had gone clear ( Crystal clear , in fact ! ) .
Clearly Canadian was dominating shelves .
And Amoco , which had for years made a clear colored fuel , decided to capitalize on the trend .
Unfortunately , they had no factual evidence to substantiate their " better for the environment and your engine " claims , and the company was forced to curb their campaign .
4. Dr. Koch's Cure All
Starting in 1919 , Dr. William Frederick Koch bottled and marketed a cancer , infection , and allergy cure - all with the help of his brother Louis .
His drug glyoxylide , which he claimed cured " practically all human ills , including . . . tuberculosis " sold for $ 25 ( 1948 price ) in local drug stores .
The FDA had always been suspicious of the doctor , but not until they tested the drug in 1948 and found it contained nothing more than distilled water were their suspicions confirmed .
And what proved to be more appalling , they discovered that Dr. Koch had been treating cancer patients by telling them to detox with the aid of enemas and fresh fruit and vegetable juices , taking only the smallest doses of painkillers .
Unfortunately , despite all of his patients dying enough evidence was never found to present a viable case against him , and Dr. Koch moved to Rio de Janeiro in the late 1940s .
5. Airborne Gets a Flunking Grade
" It 's the one designed by the school teacher ! " 
Airborne , which entered the market 10 years ago first claimed to prevent colds , then claimed to boost your immune system , and is now claiming a federal lawsuit .
In March of this year , Airborne settled a lawsuit in which it agreed to pay over $ 23 million in fines for false advertising .
David Schardt , who spearheaded the lawsuit against Airborne says there is no factual evidence to back the companies claims , amounting Airborne to a placebo and advising people fighting colds to simply take a Vitamin C pill .
6 . The Trick Wedding straight from Mickey Blue Eyes
We know this one is n't a product , but the story was so good we had to include it .
In September 1990 , a group of drug crime suspects in Corunna , Michigan , received an invitation to a wedding from a well " “ known drug dealer in the area .
Attendees were asked to check their guns at the entrance , apparently a common occurrence at these events .
As part of a five - month undercover investigation , the police staged and advertised a wedding on a Friday night , figuring it was easier to make drug suspects come to them than to round them up .
The groom was an undercover investigator , the bride a Flint police officer , and the bride 's father ( and reputed crime boss ) was the police chief .
That evening , after the vows , the toasts , and the dancing , the band , called SPOC , or COPS spelled backward , played " Fought the Law , " setting off the cue for the evening 's real agenda .
All the police officers were then asked to stand , and those who remained seated were arrested .
A dozen suspects were booked and , by Saturday afternoon , 16 were in custody .

Firefox Gains On Internet Explorer In Businesses
Even if IT shops are n't formally pushing employees to Firefox , they are moving to support the browser in their enterprise Web apps , Forrester Research suggests .
In what could be a foreboding sign for the future of Microsoft Internet Explorer , a new study finds that IE7 has done little to slow the gains Mozilla Firefox is making on Microsoft in enterprises despite Firefox 's relative lack of business - oriented features .
A Forrester Research survey of more than 50,000 large enterprise employees found that over the course of 2007 , Internet Explorer 's overall market share in that segment decreased by 10 % , while Firefox 's share almost doubled from 9.8 % to 18 % .
Also hidden in the numbers is an indication that Internet Explorer 7 is having trouble finding traction as companies are sticking with the 6 - year - old Internet Explorer 6 .
Microsoft released IE7 in October 2006 , but 55.2 % of companies still used IE6 as of December 2007 .
Only 23.4 % of companies used IE7 , barely outpacing the growth and use of Firefox .
Meanwhile , Firefox 2.0 , also released in October 2006 , " almost completely replaced " the previous version of Firefox , version 1.5 .
That result , along with Firefox 's growth despite the fact that " Mozilla continues to expend little energy on wooing IT managers to formally adopt Firefox , " as the report notes , could indicate that employees rather than IT managers are driving Firefox adoption .
Forrester suggests that even if IT shops are n't formally pushing employees to Firefox , they are moving to support the browser in their enterprise Web apps .
The data should be less than reassuring to Microsoft .
" Even with Microsoft spoon feeding users high - priority automatic updates , enterprise apathy is proving extremely difficult to overcome , " Forrester analyst Thomas Mendel wrote in the report .
Mendel and his co-authors recommend that businesses still without migration plans should now wait until the final version of standards - compliant IE8 is released -- the date has not been announced -- before upgrading .
In some ways , IE7 could be seen as a stepping - stone to IE8 .
IE7 improves security by blocking known phishing sites ; IE8 will do the same thing with sites known to contain malware .
IE7 increases standards support , but IE8 is much more completely standards - compliant .
IE7 catches up with Firefox in some ways by adding features such as tabs , a search box , and RSS support , but IE8 adds more significant innovations in WebSlices and Activities .
WebSlices are snippets of Web pages that users can subscribe to , much like RSS feeds .
Activities are a new set of right - click commands used to access a third - party service from within a Web page .
However , if IE7 is n't taking off in enterprises , it 's questionable whether Microsoft should expect any better in IE8 .
Analyst firm Gartner cautioned last month that IE8's default standards mode could break enterprise applications .
Apps might not render properly if they 've been developed primarily for earlier , non-standards - compliant versions of IE .
Gartner wrote then that companies should " strive to design for standards , not browsers . "
Many companies appear to be perfectly content with staying with IE6 until they see something better .
The same thinking has been part of the reason for the slow take - up of Windows Vista in enterprises .
And some of the security features added by IE7 and IE8 do n't work unless Vista is installed , so the pace of Vista uptake could also weigh on IE 's own upgrades .

White Whiskey : Legal Moonshine
FOR SOME PEOPLE , fine whiskey means Kentucky Bourbon .
Once upon a time it might have been Pennsylvania or Maryland Rye .
Of course , what they mean by " fine whiskey " is barrel - aged bourbon or rye which has acquired the caramel and vanilla flavors that result from years of storage in never - used - before , charred oak barrels .
Whiskey without those flavors is sometimes characterized as raw , crude , and evil - tasting ; a product suitable only for unsophisticated tastes , or perhaps as a novelty .
Now , to some of us who enjoy fresh - made whiskey , that characterization seems a little bit like suggesting that fresh peaches lack the delicate balance and flavor nuances of the more sophisticated canned peaches .
In the dim past , this was the whiskey that farmers made from their crops and sold to riverfront whiskey merchants .
In Pennsylvania and Maryland , the farmers were mainly German - Swiss ( Pennsylvania Dutch ) rye growers ; in Virginia ( which included Kentucky then ) they were mostly Scots - Irish corn ( maize ) growers .
But the rye farmers did n't make the Monongahela sipped in Baltimore and Philadelphia taverns .
And the corn farmers did n't make Bourbon .
No matter who wrote that book you read , or what that 275 - pound bartender with the nasty look on his face tells you .
Even if it meets all other criteria , whiskey cannot be called " bourbon " until it 's been stored in a new , charred , oak barrel .
Even if the old frontier farmers had a new , charred , oak barrel , it 's not likely that they 'd store whiskey in it .
Barrel - aged whiskey was the realm of the whiskey merchant , not the farmer - distiller .
And then there 's White Lightnin ' .
Many people believe that fresh whiskey and moonshine are the same thing .
This has an interesting effect on the public perception of this spirit , because the sense of " naughtiness " that view imparts adds both a tingle of excitement to the experience of drinking it , and a tendency for people to distance themselves from association with it .
There is such a thing as moonshine , of course .
In fact , there might be nearly as much real ' shine being made , sold , and drunk than there is legal fresh whiskey , at least in the states where it 's most prevalent .
In the movies , magazines , and novels , moonshine is nearly always portrayed as either a horrible hillbilly atrocity ( made crudely , of course , because " everybody knows " mountain people are n't supposed to be intelligent or sophisticated enough to make a refined product ) , or as prohibition bathtub gin made by evil criminals with nothing better to do than blinding and killing unsuspecting flapper - girlies and collegians .
Although there are plenty of examples to support either of these characterizations , most fresh - made whiskey falls into two somewhat more benign categories .
First we have the moonshine commonly known as white lightnin ' , or popskull , or mule - kick , or something along those lines .
It 's not really " whiskey " at all , being distilled from a " mash " of fermented sugar - water with perhaps a handful or two of cornmeal tossed in for flavor ( and so that everyone can pretend there is some relationship to corn in the product ) .
It is typically stored in 1 gallon plastic milk jugs .
It is also NOT typically consumed by the distiller or anyone he knows .
This is the ' shine you might obtain at a keg - party , in illegal " shot - houses " set up in people 's homes , or from a " blind - tiger " , which is a setup by which the money for the purchase is left in an unattended location and the ' shine is later picked up at that ( or another ) location , all without the buyer ever seeing the seller .
And once you get out of Elliot Ness ' Chicago and up into the hills , people are much less likely to confuse their local moonshiner with the likes of Al Capone .
According to an interview with Johnston County ( North Carolina ) District Attorney Tom Lock ( who defended several moonshiners before he was elected to run the office that prosecutes them ) , " In the scheme of things , it 's not treated all that seriously .
It 's only a misdemeanor .
We certainly can't condone it and we can't ignore it , but I do n't think the prosecution of non -tax - paid liquor in and of itself is a high priority in the minds of most citizens . "
In North Carolina , most charges regarding the manufacture and sale of liquor on which tax is not paid are misdemeanors , punishable by fines ranging from $ 50 to $ 500 .
A raid which actually succeeds in capturing the distiller , his still , his stock , and his customer list ( a rare occurrence ) would result in four charges : possession of non -tax - paid liquor ; possession with the intent to sell such liquor ; possession of equipment to manufacture it ; and manufacturing it .
Of those , the most serious charge is manufacturing .
Under state law , a second offense can be prosecuted as a felony , although it is the lowest - grade felony possible and generally would bring probation or a very short jail term .
Almost always , the defendant will plead guilty to one or two of the charges , pay a fine and get the others dismissed .
Other moonshiners , and often the same ones who make ' lightnin ' , make a different kind of ' shine in their stills .
This is real honest - to - Pete corn whiskey ( or rye whiskey )
This form of fresh whiskey , called " corn whiskey " or " rye whiskey " , " white whiskey " , or " white dog " , uses little if any Dixie Crystal Pure Cane Sugar , and obtains its sugars from the enzymes found in malted corn or barley .
This is the whiskey the distillers drink themselves and serve to friends .
Unless you 're family or a neighbor , the only way you 're going to taste this whiskey is to get yourself invited to the daughter 's wedding .
That 's because , unlike bread , or candles , or apple pies , or furniture , it 's illegal to make whiskey at home non-commercially in the United States .
The law sees no difference between a distiller of whiskey for gifts or personal consumption and an unlicensed commercial distiller .
Still meeting its original mandate to eliminate a competing monetary basis , the law forbids any distilling ( or even possession ) of beverage alcohol whatever , except for large , licensed , regulated commercial distilleries .
But we 're not concerned here with whiskey you can't legally buy or distillers you can't visit without " gittin ' yore haid blowed off " .
What separates the distillers of fresh whiskey we 'll be visiting here from their moonshinin ' , bootleggin ' cousins is that they 're legally licensed to produce , bottle , sell , and pay taxes on whiskey marketed through regular retail channels .
What separates their operations from the other whiskey distilleries we 've been visiting is that these distillers make fresh , white whiskey .
And within the past few years , some brave souls have gone to the considerable expense and trouble to obtain official sanction to produce and sell it legally .
In 2005 , Linda and John visited the sites of three such distillers .
One is Payton Fireman , a young lawyer and entrepreneur in Morgantown , West Virginia , whose West Virginia Distillery Company produces Mountain Moonshine , a perfectly legal unaged white spirit whiskey made from a bourbon - recipe base .
Another is Rodney Facemire , another West Virginian , who was the owner and winemaker at Kirkwood Winery in beautiful Summersville , West Virginia for many years ( and still is ) , before deciding to concentrate on his Isaiah Morgan Distillery operation .
Rodney not only makes corn liquor , but he is one of only two legal bottlers of unaged rye whiskey in the world ( actually the only one , since Old Potrero , the brand Fritz Maytag produces in San Francisco , California is no longer offered completely unaged ) .
Just outside of Culpeper , Virginia , we meet Chuck and Jeanette Miller whose Belmont Farms of Virginia produces Virginia Lightning and Copper Fox from corn grown on their own farm and distilled in their big old 1930 's moonshine still .
And they sell it , quite legally , through the Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control stores .
In 2011 , they visited another handful of ( legal ) white whiskey distillers .
As the laws of the individual states begin catching up to the federal 21st Amendment , there will be more and more small , craft / artisan distillers , and because you can't make old spirits or new spirits without starting with white spirits , we will almost certainly be seeing more and more of them .
It 's impossible to keep up , and we do n't intend to try , but each of these distillers offers an important experience in both the way spirits are made and they way America was made .
You should visit them , too , if you get a chance .
They 'd love to see you .
Corn whiskey ( and unaged rye whiskey as well ) is a very different spirit from aged bourbon or rye , and not everyone likes the taste of their whiskey raw .
But for those who do enjoy it , and for those who want to understand the relationship between the product of the corn or rye farmer and the spirit we know as bourbon or rye whiskey , the following explorations are vital to understand .
White Whiskey : Yes , Virginia ( and West Virginia , Tennessee , and even Kentucky ) , there is legal , hand - crafted hooch
Belmont Farms of Virginia Culpeper , Virginia Chuck and Jeanette Miller have been making Virginia Lightning and Copper Fox here since 1989 .
Now they 're being featured on public television and The History Channel and gearing up for visiting tourists .
Corsair Artisan Distillery Nashville , Tennessee
and
Bowling Green , Kentucky Darek Bell and Andrew Webber produce very sophisticated spirits , the type sought by the top bartenders and mixologists in the country .
They make them from white spirits they distill in Nashville , one of which is a white dog rye whiskey they bottle by itself as Wry Moon .
Isaiah Morgan Distillery Summersville , West Virginia Rodney Facemire 's distillery is ( a very small ) part of his Kirkwood Winery .
He makes white brandy ( grappa ) , Southern Moon white corn liquor , and unaged Isaiah Morgan Rye Whiskey .
M. B. Roland Distillery Pembroke , Kentucky Paul Tomaszewski and his wife Merry Beth ( nee Roland ) , for whom the distillery is named distill White Dog , Black Dog , and True Kentucky ' Shine from locally - grown corn , along with several other products made from white whiskey .
They make make aged whiskey , as well .
Prichard 's Distillery Kelso , Tennessee Phil Prichard is a craftsman and an experimenter , and a respecter of no one 's limitations on what can be made with a good still and some Moxie .
His interests tend toward rum , but he enjoys making whiskey .
Especially controversial whiskey .
His Lincoln County Lightning calls into question all the " expert " definitions of Tennessee whiskey .
West Virginia Distilling Co. Morgantown , West Virginia Payton Fireman makes Mountain Moonshine spirit whiskey and Mountain Moonshine Old Oak Recipe in Bo McDaniel 's old auto repair garage .

BAGHDAD  Dawoud Ameen , a former Iraqi soldier , lay in bed , his shattered legs splayed before him , worrying about the rent for his family of five .
Mr. Ameen ’s legs were shredded by shrapnel from a roadside bomb in September 2006 and now , like many wounded members of the Iraqi security forces , he is deeply in debt and struggling to survive .
For now , he gets by on $ 125 a month brought to him by members of his old army unit , charity and whatever his wife , Jinan , can beg from her relatives .
But he worries that he could lose even that meager monthly stipend .
In the United States , the issue of war injuries has revolved almost entirely around the care received by the 30,000 wounded American veterans .
But Iraqi soldiers and police officers have been wounded in greater numbers , health workers say , and have been treated far worse by their government .
A number of the half - dozen badly wounded Iraqis interviewed for this article said they had been effectively drummed out of the Iraqi security forces without pensions , or were receiving partial pay and in danger of losing even that .
Coping with severe injuries , and often amputations , they have been forced to pay for private doctors or turn to Iraq ’s failing public hospitals , which as recently as a year ago were controlled by militias that kidnapped and killed patients  particularly security personnel from rival units .

Built on the last remaining green space in the city center , ACROS Fukuoka ( Asian Crossroads Over the Sea ) is an amazing building in Fukuoka City , Japan .
It got our attention because it preserves the green space as much as possible , thanks to its stunning design .
On one side it has glass walls and looks just like a conventional office building that looks onto the most important financial street of Fukuoka , while the other side is an enormous green roof ( a garden roof ) with some 35,000 plants that step down floor - by - floor , in a stratification of low , landscaped terraces into a park .
Argentinian architects Emilio Ambasz & Associates are those with the vision , the looks and actually the whole idea .
Reaching up to 60 meters above the ground , the green roof is responsible to keeping the whole building at lower and constant temperature levels , which will obviously lead to less power consumption .
Many people in the area visit the terrace roof ( the gardens ) for meditation , relaxation , or for escaping from the congestion of the city .
Others are here just for the grand belvedere that provides an incomparable view of the bay of Fukuoka and the surrounding mountains .
These are all great reasons to consider the ACROS Fukuoka a great green architectural success in Japan .
Why ca n’t we see more of these buildings as a solution for a common urban problem ?
Anyone to call mr .
Trump ?
It 's a slightly odd sensation , discovering Sub Pop is about to turn 20 , akin to discovering that eternal teenager with the lank hair and torn jeans is finally , well , a grown man .
But that 's what 's happening .
On Saturday , the label is gathering past and present bands from its two - decade run for a mini-festival in Marymoor Park just outside Seattle , with old - timers like Mudhoney and Green River joining newcomers like Fleet Foxes , No Age , and comedy duo Flight of the Conchords , whose debut album saw the light of day on Sub Pop in the US .
In the UK , Sub Pop will perhaps always chiefly be associated with grunge , the Seattle sound that swept the globe in the early 90s , and for which Sub Pop acted as handmaiden , bringing the world Mudhoney , Tad , Soundgarden , and a little band called Nirvana to international attention .
Sub Pop 's groups were hairy , sweaty , unreconstructed , depressive , fucked - up ; but also sardonic , dryly witty and intelligent .
The video to Tad's Woodgoblins sums up the label 's early aesthetic neatly , which is to say extremely messily : mountain - sized frontman Tad Doyle playing the lunatic redneck , pursuing his bandmates through the woods with a chainsaw .
Of course , it was all a pose .
In the Tad documentary film Busted Circuits and Ringing Ears , photographer Charles Peterson claims he had to help Tad start the chainsaw .
" You wanna create that whole sense that we 're an invading horde and we live on mountains and eat raw flesh , " explains Sub Pop co-founder Jonathan Poneman .
" And Tad played that role to a tee . "
Grunge went big , thanks in part to glowing coverage in the UK music press , and many bands jumped to major labels - notably Nirvana , whose 1991 album Nevermind went on to top the Billboard charts .
Sub Pop did not cash in on grunge ; rather , it seemed quite ashamed by the way the look - battered Converse , flannel shirts , week - old stubble - quickly became a uniform and buzzword for style magazines the world over .
Sub Pop employee Megan Jasper suckered the New York Times , sending them a lexicon of " grunge speak " , which the newspaper printed verbatim - a " lamestain " is slang for a loser , while if you 're hanging out you might be " swingin ' on the flippety flop " .
Meanwhile , 1994 compilation album
The Grunge Years satirised the attentions of the corporate music industry with a sleeve picturing two suited businessmen poring over documents in a limousine and a note reading " limited edition of 500,000 " .
As grunge waned , Sub Pop signed a deal with Warner Music , but even with an influx of cash - or perhaps because of it - the label struggled to redefine itself .
Co-founder Bruce Pavitt jumped ship in 1996 to spend more time with his family , and a string of bands like Murder City Devils and the Black Halos failed to score either critical plaudits or actual sales .
More recently , however , the label has enjoyed something of a renaissance , finding success with a new crop of bands who , while not quite capturing the attention of the UK music press in the manner of their 90s stable , have come to define the tastes of a new generation of indie music fans who base their taste decisions on blogs and US indie webzine Pitchfork .
Excepting Nirvana 's Bleach , the label 's biggest seller , Sub Pop 's most successful acts are Seattle electronic duo the Postal Service and the Shins - a band immortalised in pop culture via their unwitting appearance in the film Garden State .
Natalie Portman pops a pair of headphones bleeding the band 's New Slang with the words " You gotta hear this song , it 'll change your life " .
It 's not quite Mudhoney 's Touch Me , I 'm Sick , but even an indie label 's gotta grow up eventually .
Nobel laureate Marie Curie died of aplastic anemia , the victim of radiation from the many fascinating glowing substances she had learned to isolate .
How could she have known ?
And the answer , as far as I can tell , is that she could n't .
The only way she could have avoided death was by being too scared of anything new to go near it .
Would banning physics experiments have saved Curie from herself ?
But far more cancer patients than just one person have been saved by radiation therapy .
And the real cost of banning physics is not just losing that one experiment - it 's losing physics .
No more Industrial Revolution .
Some of us fall , and the human species carries on , and advances ; our modern world is built on the backs , and sometimes the bodies , of people who took risks .
My father is fond of saying that if the automobile were invented nowadays , the saddle industry would arrange to have it outlawed .
But what if the laws of physics had been different from what they are ?
What if Curie , by isolating and purifying the glowy stuff , had caused something akin to a fission chain reaction gone critical ... which , the laws of physics being different , had ignited the atmosphere or produced a strangelet ?
At the recent Global Catastrophic Risks conference , someone proposed a policy prescription which , I argued , amounted to a ban on all physics experiments involving the production of novel physical situations - as opposed to measuring existing phenomena .
You can weigh a rock , but you can't purify radium , and you can't even expose the rock to X - rays unless you can show that exactly similar X - rays hit rocks all the time .
So the Large Hadron Collider , which produces collisions as energetic as cosmic rays , but not exactly the same as cosmic rays , would be off the menu .
After all , whenever you do something new , even if you calculate that everything is safe , there is surely some probability of being mistaken in the calculation - right ?
So the one who proposed the policy , disagreed that their policy cashed out to a blanket ban on physics experiments .
And discussion is in progress , so I wo n't talk further about their policy argument .
But if you consider the policy of " Ban Physics " , and leave aside the total political infeasibility , I think the strongest way to frame the issue - from the pro-ban viewpoint - would be as follows :
Suppose that Tegmark 's Level IV Multiverse is real - that all possible mathematical objects , including all possible physical universes with all possible laws of physics , exist .
( Perhaps anthropically weighted by their simplicity . )
Somewhere in Tegmark 's Level IV Multiverse , then , there have undoubtedly been cases where intelligence arises somewhere in a universe with physics unlike this one - i.e. , instead of a planet , life arises on a gigantic triangular plate hanging suspended in the void - and that intelligence accidentally destroys its world , perhaps its universe , in the course of a physics experiment .
Maybe they experiment with alchemy , bring together some combination of substances that were never brought together before , and catalyze a change in their atmosphere .
Or maybe they manage to break their triangular plate , whose pieces fall and break other triangular plates .
So , across the whole of the Tegmark Level IV multiverse - containing all possible physical universes with all laws of physics , weighted by the laws ' simplicity :
What fraction of sentient species that try to follow the policy " Ban all physics experiments involving situations with a remote possibility of being novel , until you can augment your own intelligence enough to do error - free cognition " ;
And what fraction of sentient species that go ahead and do physics experiments ;
Survive in the long term , on average ?
In the case of the human species , trying to ban chemistry would hardly have been effective - but supposing that a species actually could make a collective decision like that , it 's at least not clear - cut which fraction would be larger across the whole multiverse .
( We , in our universe , have already learned that you can't easily destroy the world with alchemy . )
Or an even tougher question :
On average , across the multiverse , do you think you would advise an intelligent species to stop performing novel physics experiments during the interval after it figures out how to build transistors and before it builds AI ?
Bush Changes Thomas Jefferson 's Speech At July 4 Celebration Posted by Pile ( 28486 views ) [ E - Mail link ] [ So - They - Say ]
[ Liars ]
President Bush was at Monticello for a 4th of July celebration and he delivered an address .
But it 's quite telling that his speechwriters , in quoting Jefferson , cut out an anti-religious statement from a long and famous quote .
Here 's the way Bush put it :
Thomas Jefferson understood that these rights do not belong to Americans alone .
They belong to all mankind .
And he looked to the day when all people could secure them .
On the 50th anniversary of America 's independence , Thomas Jefferson passed away .
But before leaving this world , he explained that the principles of the Declaration of Independence were universal .
In one of the final letters of his life , he wrote , " May it be to the world , what I believe it will be -- to some parts sooner , to others later , but finally to all -- the Signal of arousing men to burst the chains , and to assume the blessings and security of self - government . "
Now let 's look at the full quote , including the part that was cut out ...
This is from a letter he wrote to Roger Weightman reflecting on the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence ( which , it turns out , was the day both he and John Adams died ) :
May it be to the world , what I believe it will be , ( to some parts sooner , to others later , but finally to all , ) the signal of arousing men to burst the chains under which monkish ignorance and superstition had persuaded them to bind themselves , and to assume the blessings and security of self - government .
Jefferson made many such statements , of course .
Clearly they are best edited out by those who advocate nothing if not monkish ignorance and superstition .
BS Alert ! BS Alert !

Posted by BrakTalk on 2008-07-07 14:49:18 " monkish ignorance and superstition " .
Not sure how this is a definition of religion .
I 'm far from being a supporter of Bush ( nor am I religious ) but it 's quite a stretch to definitively state that Bush and / or his speechwriters were avoiding references to religion here for self - serving purposes .
There 's nothing definitive here that indicates he [ Jefferson ] was referring to religion .
" monkish " can also mean " self - denial " .
" self - denial " may be in some eyes , synonymous with religion or what 's wrong with religion ... but that 's merely an opinion , not definitive .
Stretching ?
Posted by hatekillpuke on 2008-07-07 15:21:51
It looks more like BrakTalk is stretching to make it not be about religion .
Jefferson was famously critical of religion , that people would get so caught up in the dogmatic aspects of it ( see : the Jefferson Bible ) , so it 's really no stretch at all to think he 's talking about religion here .
Posted by Jesse on 2008-07-07 15:35:49
" If you are going to make a famous quote , do n't cherry - pick what words you want , and leave the rest behind - otherwise , it 's not a quote , it is a lie . "
Hmmm ...
Actually , " quoting " is the process of taking the words you want and leaving the rest .
I am sure that the letter contained more than what was cited by President Bush ( and this article ) .
Both parties removed the words that they did not want .
Now quoting in such a fashion as to obscure , or change , the meaning of the words is oft referred to as " misquoting " which may be what President Bush 's speechwriters have done .
In any case , that is worth discussing .
I would argue that the meaning of the passage has not changed by President Bush 's omission of the source of said " chains " , but that is another topic .
Not quite ...
Posted by BrakTalk on 2008-07-07 16:50:47
My intention was to suggest that it was a stretch to assume that the omission of these words were demonstrative of Bush / speechwriters to be self - serving .
Especially since " monkish " does n't necessarily mean " religious " .
Actually ...
Posted by BrakTalk on 2008-07-07 17:15:09 ... after reading this analysis ( and subsequent comments ) , I am differently persuaded .
http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=324
Although I still find not - so - obvious to equate " monkish " with " religion " because an alternate meaning of the word is indeed " non-religious " , I am open to the fact that I am not as well informed of Jefferson 's views as others may be ( i.e. the author of this particular blog entry at BSALERT and / or the blogger at LanguageLog ) and therefore , ignorant of these indicators that may rightfully inform these speculations .
To the average listener , " monkish " may very well mean or suggest " religious / religion " and if the speechwriter thought that the average listener would be inclined to do so , it 's reasonable to speculate that the omission makes it less controversial for the listener on the " first pass " .
That alone suggests intent to mislead or to avoid " messiness " since , due to the well chronicled f'ups executed by this administration while it was thumping King James , it does n't take much effort to conceive of the irony .
Why not just look it up

If you 're going to knock Bush for excluding part of a found father 's document , go ahead and look at all the other papers and documents the founding fathers have written and see how much they 've been taken out of context by the ' other side ' .
See , the problem is that folks are playing sides instead of realizing that truly we will go NOWHERE unless we work together and do what 's best for the PEOPLE instead of a PARTY .

Posted by P. Shahir on 2008-07-08 20:46:12
Thanks for reminding of Thomas Jeffersen - quite a dynamic thinker , so much in accordance to my thoughts in so many ways .
I still feel that these last months if President G.W. Bush 's administration should be devoted to uncovering the dung in other hypocricies such as certain corrupt multinationals and oil concerns who still fund contempt against the USA and Humanity - ( and among them are abucive clergy as the occupiers of Iran and also in certain Arab countries .....
I wish to underline that I am totally non political .
I am mostly interested in principles of governance and International law .
I try my best to keep at long distance from futile divisions that divide good people .
( and thus away from party political conflict and extremes )
IT may seem obvious that for such a public event , certain religious groups may have felt offended - and yet , those truths about the abuse of religion , are exemplified and throughout the Holy Bible .
I have prayed and wished for the best for USA and good friends during Independence Day , and am glad that no feelings were hurt , and good people could pause , think and appreciate .
I thank for the reminder of Thomas Jeffersen .
I have so much to learn from US history , and appreciate every time someone points out something I could learn from the history that went into the making of the USA , and still continues ......
May the Spiritual ' Force ' be with you all , and God Bless :)

What ever happened to getting real dirt on people ?
Like Sex scandals and corruption !
Talk about pissing off the founding fathers !
The fathers are rolling over in their graves with the political BS this country has been spitting out over the last 60 years !
So , stop you whining about Bush and do something productive !
I mean come on people !
We have two assholes running for president !
Things are only gonna get worse from here .
Bush will be the least of our problems .
Bottom line : Stop your whining !
Respect your president !
Vote Independent !
After all , Its what our founding father would have wanted .
Posted by Pile on 2008-07-13 01:29:37

The move will make things easier for the expected influx of Chinese tourists
Taiwan has lifted some restrictions on Chinese currency exchange , in another sign of improving bilateral ties .
The move is part of a number of financial liberalisation measures agreed by the government last week .
It follows a pledge by Taiwan 's new President , Ma Ying - jeou , to promote better economic ties with China , which sees Taiwan as part of its territory .
For the first time , Chinese bank notes will be officially available at authorised Taiwanese banks .
They will also be available at foreign - currency trading counters at tourist hotels , airports and gift stores .
Tourist influx
The move comes just a few days before the start of regular direct weekend charter flights between Taiwan and China - marking a new chapter in relations between the two political rivals .
But the step is also considered a virtual necessity , since from next month up to 3,000 Chinese tourists will be allowed to visit Taiwan each day .
The move will provide a legal channel for them to exchange their money for local currency to spend in Taiwan .
The absence of a currency exchange service between Taiwan and China had led to rampant black market currency trading .
Under the new regulations , anyone will be able to buy or sell Chinese yuan at authorised institutions , although the government has initially set a cap of 20,000 yuan - just under $ 3,000 ( £ 1,500 ) - for each transaction .
Yuan conversion by institutions and companies will still be barred .
In the longer term , it is hoped that officials from Taiwan and China will be able to negotiate currency settlement agreements to provide mechanisms for normalising cross -strait currency clearance .
Until now , the conversion of Chinese currency could only take place on Taiwan 's outlying islands of Matsu and Kinmen .
Newzbin , considered by many to be the internet 's premier indexer and .nzb provider , is under legal threat from the MPAA .
The site , which was the creator of Usenet 's answer to the .torrent file , will likely have to undergo significant changes in order to appease the movie studios .
Newzbin is one of the original Usenet indexing sites and creators of the NZB “ >. NZB format .
In a very general way , . NZB files might be considered Usenet ’s equivalent of . torrent files .
They make the otherwise - complicated Usenet a breeze to use .
Downloading from Usenet with Newzbin is easy , and together with a good news provider , very quick .
The increased popularity of services such as Newzbin did n’t go unnoticed with the MPAA .
On 22nd May 2008 , administrator ‘ Caesium ’ made an announcement :
Newzbin has today received a letter from the Motion Picture Association ( MPA ) .
In the letter , they claim that some editors may be reporting material from Usenet that is infringing the copyright of their members .
While these claims have not been substantiated , it should be noted that Newzbin does not condone the distribution or indexing of such materials .
We will immediately act to remove any items that are found to be infringing copyright .
Please take a moment to refer to our Terms and Conditions , in particular sections 4 and 4.2 .
Please note that we may revoke privileges , or ban accounts , of users found to be violating these Terms and Conditions .
Since this announcement , worried Newzbin users have contacted Torrent Freak to see if we could find out exactly what had been going on .
Understandably , Newzbin did n’t want to tell us much .
However , if one looks closely at the announcement , it does n’t tell us anything that we did n’t already know .
The terms and conditions have been in place since 2007 , there does n’t appear to be anything new in those .
Of course Newzbin does n’t condone the indexing of copyright works .
How can it ?
It is a proper company that charges users for access , not an underground operation hiding in the shadows .
It appears to comply fully with the laws in the UK , where the service is based .
Newzbin also say they will remove anything that infringes copyright .
NZB files do not , so at that point they probably believed they would have little work to do .
But the MPAA is n’t known for letting the law stand in the way of a good threat , threats which have closed several US - based NZB sites in the past such as NZB - Zone and forced others to adjust the way they operate .
Newzbin has not been sued , we can confirm that , but it will have to change the way it operates too , if it is to comply with the movie industry demands .
Caesium is hinting at possible changes to the site in the future .
It ’s a possibility that all .
NZB related reports will have to be removed .
An alternative to appease the MPAA would be to remove only the posts related to movies and TV shows , an arrangement favored by BinNews.com when faced with the same legal threats .
At this point it is far from clear what measures Newzbin will be finally forced to take to stop the threat of legal action turning into an actual lawsuit .
Newzbin appear to be being as upfront as they can at this point and are suggesting that if users only use the site for .
NZB files , then they should consider not renewing their subscription .
For those who are n’t scared of making their own .
NZBs ‘ BinSearch ’ - style , the site will still be of great use , even if the most draconian measures are taken .
BinSearch provides Usenet indexing with a do - it - yourself .
NZB creator .
Anyone who knows the full scene release name of the material they seek will adjust to it in a few minutes , but it ’s no Newzbin .
For the uninformed , the learning curve is steep .
Newzbin has a secret weapon which has made it so attractive .
‘ Editors ‘ are essentially human beings who make reports which link to specific content on Usenet .
Newzbin can then generate a .
NZB file , based on the report .
Anyone with an NZB capable news reader , like Grabit , can use them .
It seems that it ’s this human intervention with the creation of reports which poses the legal headache .
Newzbin is considering that it may have to fully automate its operations in order to be totally sure of staying the friendly side of the law – no more human intervention , no more ‘ editor ’ named reports .
No more easily browsable pre-determined categories .
A simple Usenet search engine would likely attract little attention and would be entirely legal , as confirmed by Caesium : “ … we ’re pretty sure nobody is going to tell us that having an automated searchable index of the entire contents of Usenet is going to cause any problems . ”
But why would anyone bother using a degraded Newzbin over , say , the very useful ( but limited ) ‘ BinSearch ’ ?
After all , there would be presumably little to separate them , feature - wise .
The plan is to introduce a feature where Newzbin users can tag .
This way the site can provide an entirely legal automated index – no Newzbin staff involved – with only the users adding the tags .
It sounds like a great solution and may even prove just as workable longer term .
They say every cloud has a silver lining and for Newzbin , that might come in the form of a greatly increased userbase .
Newzbin is currently a subscription service but the changes may well turn it into a free site , which effectively opens it up to everyone rather than just its current paying userbase .
That ’s a hell of a lot of tags .
Thankfully there will likely be a ratings system , to ensure quality tagging .
WebKit Performance on iPhone OS X 2.0
As part of the iPhone SDK developer program , I ’ve been running a seed of the GM build of the new OS on my original iPhone for a few weeks now .
Overall , there are surprisingly few visible changes to the system .
Many of the built - in apps are , at least visibly , identical to the versions in iPhone OS 1.1.4 .
This includes Safari — if anything has changed in Safari ’s user interface , I have n’t noticed it .
1
But under the hood , MobileSafari 2.0 ’s performance is hugely improved over 1.1.4 .
Everything related to web surfing feels faster , and in side - by - side comparisons using my wife ’s iPhone running 1.1.4 , web pages consistently load faster on 2.0 , both via Wi-Fi and EDGE .
This has nothing to do with the new iPhone 3G hardware — this is about dramatic performance improvements on original iPhones upgraded to the 2.0 OS .
Using MobileSafari simply feels faster , especially with web applications .
Feel is by nature subjective , but JavaScript benchmarks back this up .
In August last year , Craig Hockenberry posted a few simple benchmarks to compare the iPhone ’s processing power and JavaScript interpreter against Safari 3 running on a Mac with a 1.83 GHz Core Duo .
At that time , the current version of the iPhone OS was 1.0.1 .
Here are the results of those same benchmarks on original iPhones running the 1.1.4 and new 2.0 OS versions , with Hockenberry ’s 1.0.1 results included for comparison :
Test 1.0.1 1.1.4 2.0 Vs. 1.0.1 / 1.1.4 100,000 iterations 3.209 1.096 0.145 22× / 8 × 10,000 divisions 0.413 0.181 0.029 14× / 6 × 10,000 sin(x ) calls 0.709 0.373 0.140 5× / 3 × 10,000 string allocations 0.777 0.434 0.133 6× / 3 × 10,000 function calls 0.904 0.595 0.115 8× / 5 ×
The last column shows how many times faster the 2.0 version of MobileSafari was versus 1.0.1 and 1.1.4 .
The same results , charted ( smaller bars are faster ) :
The results are obvious .
WebKit JavaScript performance has improved steadily and significantly in just one year , with a huge jump between 1.1.4 and the new 2.0.0 .
I also tested both iPhone 1.1.4 and 2.0.0 against Celtic Kane ’s JavaScript benchmarks .
The average time over three runs for iPhone 1.1.4 was 8,945 ms ; for iPhone 2.0 it was 5,307 — just under 1.7 times faster .
( For comparison , Safari 3.1.2 on my 2.5 GHz MacBook Pro took just 133 ms — 40 times faster than the iPhone . )
The tests I ran here were specific to JavaScript , but I strongly suspect WebKit performance has improved across the board .
In side - by - side page loading tests between two original iPhones running 1.1.4 and 2.0.0 , the new version consistently finished at least a few seconds faster .
For all the hubbub regarding the new App Store , most “ iPhone software ” runs in the web browser .
But improvements in WebKit performance often help native iPhone app performance , too — a slew of my favorite native iPhone apps have built - in WebKit browsers ( e.g. , NetNewsWire , Twitterrific , Instapaper , and Cocktails ) .
When WebKit performance improves , any app that uses WebKit improves , and WebKit improved a lot between iPhone 1.1.4 and 2.0.0 .

To the greatest extent in the history of oil futures trading , oil prices are now in continuous contango -- that is , oil futures get progressively more expensive each year into the future .
Does this mean that Peak Oil , as a meme , has " tipped " ?
Our latest oil price poll suggests that well over 70 % of the sample ( N>3000 now ) thinks that oil will at least stay above $ 114 a barrel for the next two months -- and almost half think it will hit $ 140 a barrel in that timeframe .
Search volume on Google for the term is up dramatically in the past month , as is traffic at The Oil Drum .
The following graph shows the dramatic swing from backwardation to contango over the last 6 weeks :
A few quick definitions : Backwardation is when prices in the future are lower than in the present .
Contango is the reverse , where future prices are higher than in the present .
Backwardation is the historical norm in oil futures markets , and it is conventional wisdom that there are fundamental reasons for this " normal backwardation . "
While contango has occurred in the past in oil futures markets ( most recently in 2005 - 2006 ) , past occurrences have always been " partial " contango -- where prices increase for some years , but decrease beyond that .
This type of contango is explained by expectations of near - term shortages , and can be seen in this chart of the backwardation curve in crude oil from February , 2006 :
The rapid swing to contango between May 16 , 2008 and May 20 , 2008 is unprecedented for both the degree of continuous contango and the rate of price movement ( today 's $ 9 + advance in December 2016 futures is the largest single advance in history ) .
What was the cause of this shift ?
Has market awareness and acceptance of Peak Oil " tipped " ?
This morning both Boone Pickens and Robert Hirsch appeared on CNBC discussing oil markets , with Hirsch laying out an explicit and forceful case for Peak Oil .
While the appearance of this historic contango in the oil markets is not dispositive of a sudden market awareness of Peak Oil , I think it is the most likely explanation .
Either way , the situation certainly bears scrutiny and discussion ...
Drug dealers are " extremely resilient " , the report says Police are fighting a losing battle against drugs crime , with seizures having little impact on reducing supply or demand , research has suggested .
The UK Drug Policy Commission said despite the large sums of money spent tackling the problem , traditional police tactics were not working .
It said the £ 5.3 bn British drugs market was too " fluid " for law enforcement agencies to cut supply .
It added more should be done to reduce the effects of drugs on communities .
A Home Office spokesperson said : " The government agrees that enforcement in isolation is not effective . "
Titled Tackling Drug Networks and Distribution Networks in the UK , it concluded that although the amount of Class A drugs seized between 1996 and 2005 doubled , the market had proved to be " extremely resilient " .
This was despite 12 % of the heroin and 9 % of the cocaine in Britain being impounded during the same period , and despite the convictions of dealers and traffickers .
The independent think - tank said dealers were able to adapt quickly to interruptions in supply , for instance by reducing purity , enabling them to maintain their profit margins .
The report estimated that between 60 % and 80 % of drugs would need to be seized to put major traffickers out of business - yet operations on such a scale have never been achieved in the UK .
It went so far as to warn that police operations could have a negative effect on the problem .
They could threaten public safety and health by " altering the drug users ' behaviour and potentially setting up violent drug gang conflicts as police move dealers from one area to another " , said our correspondent .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Instead , the study 's authors suggested the government concentrated on the " collateral damage " of the trade - sex markets , gangs , human trafficking , corruption , drug - related crime and anti-social behaviour .
The criminal justice costs of class A drugs alone are estimated at £ 4bn a year .
Tim McSweeney , one of the report 's authors , said : " We were struck by just how little evidence there is to show that the hundreds of millions of pounds spent on UK enforcement each year has made a sustainable impact . "
Former police chief constable David Blakey , of the UK Drug Policy Commission , said enforcement agencies tended to be judged by the amount they had managed to capture .
" This is a pity as it is very difficult to show that increasing drug seizures actually leads to less drug - related harm , " he added .
Neil McKeganey , professor of drug misuse research at the University of Glasgow , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the problem would be worse without the current enforcement measures .
There is no incentive at the moment for chief constables to tackle drug crime
Brian Paddick Former deputy assistant commissioner Metropolitan Police
More women used as drug mules
Send us your comments Differing views on drugs world " The UK heroin problem , for example , is less than one per cent of the population .
Many people might wonder just what it would be if drugs were able to enter the country much more easily than they do currently . "
Brian Paddick , a former deputy assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police , told Today part of the problem was the performance targets set for police forces .
" There is no incentive at the moment for chief constables to tackle drug crime .
All the performance indicators against which police forces are measured are based on reduction of acquisitive crime . "
The Home Office said seizures were only part of the government 's approach , with intervention programmes getting 1,000 offenders into drug treatment each week .
" Many of the report 's recommendations are already being implemented , " the spokesperson added .
" Our drugs strategy encompasses enforcement , prevention , education and treatment . "

What are these ?
More than 160 million Americans would be able to learn their all - important credit scores at no charge -- and with no strings attached -- under a settlement by credit reporting giant TransUnion Corp. of a long - running class - action lawsuit .
The agreement would entitle consumers to at least six months of a TransUnion monitoring service , giving them access to the latest information in their credit reports as well as their current scores at any time .
The service also would notify consumers by e-mail of significant changes to their files , including reports of late payments or accounts opened in their names .
The latter information could help thwart attempted identity theft .
TransUnion normally sells the service for $ 59.75 or more , giving the settlement a value that could top $ 10 billion .

Extracting free services from an industry that many Americans love to hate could give them a measure of satisfaction .
On a more practical level , the information could be especially useful for people who are borrowing more because of difficulties caused by the slowing economy or who simply want to find loans or cards with better terms .
Ken McEldowney , executive director of Consumer Action , a national advocacy group based in San Francisco , called the settlement mind - boggling .
“ It ’s everything we tell consumers that they need to find out if they have problems with their credit , ” he said .
“ They are getting information on how to improve it and information about whether they are creditworthy .
This is astonishing . ”
A credit report supplied by TransUnion or its rivals , Equifax Inc. and Experian , contains information about your current and recent home and auto loans , credit cards and other credit accounts , including how much is borrowed , your credit limits and whether payments are made on time .
Advertisement
A credit score , which is calculated using a formula based on that data , is a three - digit number that can determine what interest rate you pay on a loan or credit card , or whether you even are approved for one .
Federal law entitles everyone to a free copy of his or her credit report once a year from each of the three major credit - reporting companies , but it does n’t provide access to credit scores .
The case being settled stems from a business operated by TransUnion that sliced and diced data from the Chicago - based company ’s massive credit files to generate customized lists of consumers .
Retailers , lenders and other businesses would buy the lists to use in their marketing .
Federal law bars the sale of a person ’s private credit information except under certain circumstances , such as when he or she has applied for a loan .
Advertisement
Although companies can gather and sell public consumer information , such as mortgage lien information that ’s filed with counties , plaintiffs in dozens of suits argued that TransUnion had overstepped those bounds , violating privacy protections .
The plaintiffs alleged that anyone who had a credit file maintained by it had suffered damages , mainly by being inundated with junk mail from marketers who bought data about them .
The suits were combined into one class action in federal court in Chicago .
TransUnion and the plaintiffs in that case agreed to a preliminary settlement Wednesday .
It requires final court approval , which is expected in September .
Based on the number of people in the class , the settlement would be the largest in U.S. history , said Peter A. Chapman , editor of the Class Action Reporter .
Advertisement
“ This was a long , hard fight and an excellent result , ” said John Zarian , a Boise , Idaho , attorney whose clients -- some of the original plaintiffs in the case -- filed suit 10 years ago .
TransUnion , which discontinued the list - marketing business in 2001 , has said it did n’t violate the law .
“ TransUnion is committed to providing consumers with tools and services that empower them to manage their own credit health , ” said Colleen Ryan , a spokeswoman for TransUnion .
“ The services offered through this settlement complement our many consumer - empowering initiatives . ”
Under the settlement , anyone who had any type of loan account between January 1987 and Wednesday would be able to select one of two options :
Advertisement
* A basic service would provide free credit monitoring for six months .
It normally retails for $ 59.75 , according to the settlement .
Those who select this service can also apply for a cash payment .
* An enhanced service would provide nine months of free monitoring , plus use of a “ mortgage simulator ” that lets consumers see whether improving their credit score would affect their mortgage rates and how much they could save if it did .
This option also includes access to one ’s insurance score , which is used by some insurers to set rates ( though California bars their use ) .
The settlement values this option at $ 115.50 .
Under the settlement , a credit card number would not be required to sign up for either service .
After the free service ends , TransUnion could not charge for an extension unless it was requested by the consumer .
Advertisement
The agreement also creates a $ 75 - million fund that would be used to notify class members about their rights , to pay attorneys and pay any damages agreed to for people who opt out of the class and sue TransUnion on their own .
If there is money left in the fund after two years , it would be paid to people who applied for the cash .
Consumers who received the enhanced service do n’t have the right to apply for the money .
Claims can be filed starting June 16 by going to the settlement website at www.listclass action.com or calling ( 866 ) 416-3470 .

I think it ’s good to think outside the box .
Especially when it comes to finding solutions to some pretty major problems .
Let ’s take depression for example .
Starting in May 2007 , the FDA started requiring that a warning be posted on antidepressant drugs .
The warning was about the increased risk of suicide for patients in the 18 - 24 age range .
This warning was the result of a FDA analysis of patient data .
So it seems to me that depressed young people need more options besides medication .
Of course , all people who suffer from depression need options but for this age group , in light of this study , it seems necessary .
So , let ’s look at other possible options .
Therapy :
This is a standard treatment and it can be a good one .
But unfortunately this method of treatment requires a good therapist and this is n’t always easy to find .
Not because there ’s a shortage of capable therapist out there but because it can get complicated .
Sometimes the therapist does n’t practice the type of therapy that is best for your condition .
Maybe you live in a very small town with only 1 or 2 practicing therapists .
Many times therapists do n’t accept insurance or do n’t accept your insurance .
In the case of depression , Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is one of the better therapy choices .
But it can be hard to find a therapist that specializes in this type of therapy .
Many may offer some form of it but there ’s something to be said for someone who knows the intricacies of treating depression using only this therapy .
Classes :
This is n’t a usual treatment option but I think it ’s a good one .
It ’s my outside the box contribution , if you will .
Many people who are depressed suffer from various thinking patterns that make depression more likely to occur or enable the depression to stay around .
Bringing these patterns to patients ’ attention and then teaching them other ways to think can go a long way towards helping a depressed individual become healthier .
Other Support Systems :
There are a myriad of options available for supporting those with depression .
Whether it is some type of group therapy , support group , or study group .
One option that I find alluring is telephone treatment .
This type of treatment was offered to over 604 employees aged 18 years and over in various U.S. companies .
The treatment involved telephone assessment and facilitation to inpatient treatment , a psycho-educational workbook , support and monitoring of treatment .
The results were very positive .
Although medication is usually the first or second line of defense against depression , there are more options available .
Since medication may not the best treatment choice for many , and since traditional therapy is n’t always accessible , I think it ’s necessary to search for other ways to offer support and help so that those who need to treat their depression have a number of viable , encouraging choices at their disposal .

Parents are angry at the ease with which some schools collapsed
A Chinese teacher has been detained for posting images on the internet of schools that collapsed in the Sichuan earthquake , a rights group has said .
Human Rights in China said Liu Shaokun had been ordered to serve a year of " re-education through labour " .
Mr Liu was detained for " disseminating rumours and destroying social order " , the group said .
The 12 May quake killed nearly 70,000 people .
Many of those who died were children whose schools collapsed .
The poor condition of the school buildings has become a sensitive political issue for the government , and grieving parents have staged numerous protests demanding an inquiry .
Many have accused local officials of colluding with builders to allow them to get away with cheap and unsafe practices .
" Instead of investigating and pursuing accountability for shoddy and dangerous school buildings , the authorities are resorting to re-education through labour to silence and lock up concerned citizens like teacher Liu Shaokun and others , " said Human Rights in China Executive Director Sharon Hom .
No trial
According to Human Rights in China , Mr Liu 's wife was informed by police last week that the teacher , from Guanghan Middle School in Deyang city , had been sent to a labour camp .
The " re-education through labour " system allows police to incarcerate a crime suspect for up to four years without the need for a criminal trial or a formal charge .
The system , in place since 1957 , has been widely criticised by the UN and other organisations .
…e così , mi hanno rubato anche la nascita .
E , con essa , l’innocenza .
I pediatri degli anni Sessanta raccomandavano alle future mamme di partorire in strutture mediche .
Non voglio fare dietrologia , probabilmente erano mossi da scrupoli seri .
Fino alla decade precedente l’Italia era ancora , sotto molti aspetti , un Paese arretrato e le morti di parto non così infrequenti .
Quest ’operazione di “ pedagogia di massa ” non appariva quindi peregrina : e del resto la stragrande maggioranza dei miei coetanei del Centro e del Sud ( ma anche dell ’area non milanese ) continuava a veder la luce in casa .
I miei genitori , onesti operai animati dal proposito – il proposito pugnace e ingenuo di chi ha conosciuto le privazioni – di accogliere nel migliore dei modi quella che sarebbe stata la loro unica figlia , incuranti dei sacrifici economici , accettarono il consiglio di rivolgersi a una delle cliniche più lussuose e accreditate , situata nel centro di Milano : la Santa Rita , naturalmente .
Mi hanno raccontato che , quel giorno , pioveva .
Anche questo molto naturale , eravamo in ottobre e le stagioni non ancora così sballate .
Insomma quella fu la mia primissima “ casa ” : tra i motteggi bonari di qualche amico più grande , secondo cui io appartenevo alla generazione dei “ bambini da batteria ” o dei “ nati in cattività ” .
Ma ci si affeziona anche alle proprie “ prigioni ” , specie se dorate .
E poi quella santa , la mia protettrice : avrei saputo molti anni dopo che era una malmaritata , molto sofferente : pure la spina in fronte , le aveva regalato Gesù .
Un segno premonitore ?
Chissà .
Malgrado ciò la chiamavano la “ santa degli impossibili ” , era legata ai fiori , alla dolcezza , alla tenerezza .
Alla maternità .
Alla cura degli altri .
Ma adesso , su questi fragili ricordi qualcuno vi ha apportato uno sfregio .
Che non è una spina redentrice , ma un chiodo purulento .
Non che mi stupisca eccessivamente : da quel piovoso ottobre di 43 anni fa , ho saggiato diverse cose nella vita , e più volte ho sfiorato l’assoluta non-curanza dei degeneri figli d’Ippocrate .
Sicuro , non sono tutti uguali , non facciamo d’ogni erba un fascio , stiamo attenti al qualunquismo , ecc. ecc .
Vero , vero , ma adesso non riesco a ragionare diversamente .
Volgarità chiama volgarità e , se devo dirla tutta , ringrazio Iddio di non aver mai avuto davvero bisogno di loro .
Ma un giorno dovrà pur accadere ; e confesso di pensare con terrore a quel giorno .
Non sono né ricca né potente : cosa ne sarà di me ?
Alcuni amici mi hanno informata che , da almeno tre anni , il Comitato dell ’Elefante denunciava certe malefatte , ovviamente inascoltato .
Ora che è scoppiato lo scandalo – fra l’altro , solo grazie a quelle intercettazioni telefoniche contro le quali il governo sta scatenando una guerra senza esclusione di colpi – se ne parlerà per qualche giorno , si fingerà indignazione , poi si tenterà , già si sta tentando , di circoscrivere l’episodio alla sola clinica che mi vide nascere , quindi … non mi stupirei se si passasse a un’opera di denigrazione delle titolari dell ’inchiesta , le pm Tiziana Siciliano e Grazia Pradella .
I nostri esimi statisti , lo sappiamo , non sono teneri coi giudici “ persecutori ” .
E tutto tornerà alla normalità .
Come prima , peggio di prima ( * ) .
Forse sbaglio .
Forse sono troppo pessimista e , se le accuse verranno provate , i colpevoli puniti in modo esemplare .
Ma cambierebbe poi molto ?
Amputare un ramo ( mai verbo si è rivelato più calzante ) non basta per salvare l’albero .
E l’albero è il sistema .
Ci ripetiamo ?
Può darsi .
Ma anche “ loro ” ci ammanniscono , da secoli , la medesima sbobba sulla magnificenza del privato ( dimenticando che è participio passato di “ privare ” , cioè “ togliere ” ) .
Tuttavia non mi soffermerei troppo su questo aspetto .
In certe strutture pubbliche avviene lo stesso .
Punterei piuttosto il dito sul Signor Mercato , a sentir “ loro ” l’unico , vero garante di prosperità , civiltà , amore & pace .
Cosa c’entra il Mercato ? , chiederete voi .
C’entra , c’entra .
Lo dimostra l’amabile conversazione del principale accusato .
Il quale , sentendosi il fiato sul collo , sembra abbia scritto un sms di questo tenore : “ Ormai non dormo più .
Sono disperato .
Tra le cartelle chissà quante saranno pompate e mi arresteranno come truffatore .
L’ Arsenio Lupin della kirurgia ” .
Con la “ k ” .
Come usa tra adolescenti .
Un truffatore .
Ecco come temeva di essere considerato il primario di un’illustre clinica .
Senza nemmeno rendersi conto che “ pompare ” cartelle cliniche per asportare tumori inesistenti o mutilare organi sani in vista di un ragguardevole rimborso non si chiama truffa , ma crimine .
Un crimine contro l’umanità .
Ma è proprio questo il punto : l’umanità .
E per chi possiede una mentalità da “ Mercato ” , l’umanità non esiste .
Anzi è inconcepibile e persino fastidiosa .
L’uomo , quell ’integrità inscindibile di cui parla Moni Ovadia , per il Mercato è un alieno .
Si tratta semmai d’un ammasso di cellule , un ’accozzaglia di fegati milze polmoni cuori seni tibie , da commerciare o di cui sbarazzarsi come qualsiasi altra merce fruttuosa o avariata .
L’eventuale errore è solo di procedura .
Non sorprende pertanto , in quest ’ottica , il delitto derubricato a truffa .
Il massimo della sciagura , per l’affarista , non è infatti il primo , ma che l’investimento gli vada male .
Lui si è paragonato ad Arsenio Lupin , il ladro gentiluomo , come forse questi signori non sono tanto .
Restiamo sempre in una logica strettamente mercantile .
I giornali , invece , hanno scomodato Mengele .
E nessuno che si sia ricordato dell ’unico , vero accostamento possibile : quello col Guido Tersilli immortalato da Alberto Sordi in due famosissimi e profetici film .
Tersilli non è un raffinato e amabile truffatore ( ci risiamo ) come Lupin , né un genio del Male Assoluto come Mengele : a loro modo , due eccezionalità .
No. Tersilli è solo un banale , piccolo uomo qualunque , dall ’intelligenza mediocre , sballottato fra la sua stessa piccineria e l’avidità altrui .
Uno come tanti .
Uno che prima commercia , poi fa affari , nella più piatta e prevedibile logica di Mercato .
Questa brada normalità , così grettamente terra - terra , non piace né ai vanitosi rampanti , né ai titolisti in cerca di effettacci thrilling .
Ma il Mercato ci “ pareggia ” tutti , o meglio , ci livella .
Non è certo democratico .
E’ massificatore .
C’è la massa che prospera , e la massa che subisce la prosperità altrui .
Homo homini lupus .
E il Mercato , che oggettivizza la salute dei corpi , è lo stesso che produce l’ennesima strage sul lavoro ( ormai un necrologio quotidiano ) o che manda a ramengo l’istruzione ed i servizi al cittadino : anche in tal caso è una questione di costi , speculazioni , ricavi , profitti .
Di conseguenza non c’è spazio nemmeno per i Lupin del bisturi , non luogo per vellicare narcisisticamente il proprio ego , sia pur perverso .

Hillary is now trying to rally her major donors to help her stay in the race beyond this week ( her campaign is talking about challenging Michigan now ) , and at the same time the donors are magically , on their very own ( nudge nudge wink wink ) demanding that Hillary stay in the race until the convention .
A Clinton donor tells me that on a conference call today with major fundraisers this afternoon , Harold Ickes told them Clinton is n’t planning to drop out .
He pressed donors to stay unified , and reviewed tactical options , including challenging the Michigan delegation .
State finance committees are also circulating letters to deliver to Clinton tomorrow in New York , and I ’ve obtained a draft of the Illinois finance committee ’s letter , being circulated by a Clinton fundraising aide , Rafi Jafri , which stresses a fight until the convention , and a resolution in “ August , and no earlier . ”
They , along with Hillary , are now claiming that Hillary has the lead in the popular vote , which is a lie .
I personally like Ben Smith ’s take on this :
“ The problem is that Clinton has n’t won the popular vote by any accepted measure , only by the one that tilts further her way .
And superdelegates show no sign of accepting her count . ”
Unless the Democratic party leadership does something fast , we ’re going to lose the election in November because of this hateful woman .
Is a cow a motor vehicle ?
An interesting decision of the Ohio Court of Appeals for the 11th District recently came to my attention .
A couple were injured when their car struck a cow .
The owner of the cow had no insurance , so they filed a claim with their own insurance company for coverage under its uninsured motorist provision .
The company refused to pay , so they sued .
The trial court ruled against them , and they appealed .
The point of contention was whether a cow is a motor vehicle .
The court cites the American Heritage Dictionary 's definition : " a self - propelled , wheeled conveyance that does not run on rails "
The court correctly observes that :
a cow is self - propelled , does not run on rails , and could be used as a conveyance ; however , there is no indication in the record that this particular cow had wheels .
Therefore , it was not a motor vehicle ...
On this basis , buttressed by precedant to the effect that a horse is not a motor vehicle , it affirmed the decision of the Court of Common Pleas that the couple were not entitled to compensation .
I think that the Court of Appeals made the right decision , but for the wrong reasons .
The American Heritage Dictionary 's definition is wrong .
On the one hand , it is not necessary for a vehicle to have wheels in order to be a motor vehicle .
In my judgement , and I believe that of most people , vehicles such as snowmobiles , tanks , and bulldozers are motor vehicles even though they lack wheels .
Furthermore , adding wheels to a cow would not make it a motor vehicle .
On the other hand , not all self - propelled vehicles are motor vehicles .
A sled is not a motor vehicle , even though it is self - propelled .
What makes a vehicle a motor vehicle is , not surprisingly , its reliance on a motor .
The reason that a cow is not a motor vehicle is that it has no motor .

We 've covered some very strange topics over the years , but never did I imagine we would one day tackle the topic of shopping cart safety warnings .
On some level this probably constitutes hitting rock bottom , but if not us , who would give this deserving medium its due mockery ?
The answer is no one .
Let us thank the Something Awful Forum Goons for doing what had to be done .
In case you have no idea what on earth we 're talking about , take a look at this untouched image .
Virtually every reputable shopping cart in the world has one of these safety warnings .
RipVTide fulfilled his destiny by getting this stellar theme started .
Life is a delicate dance for Squish .

We have added a new feature at See 'n ' Report .
It now provides each user with a personal sub - domain URL .
The URL maintains user 's profile which lists all the photo reports submitted by the user .
For example my See 'n ' Report profile URL is http://sharjeel.seenreport.com/ .
Adding support for sub - domains in Django is simple but has a few catches .
It took me quite some time to get everything working .
The following links provide a quick way to make sub - domains :
rossp.org - Using Subdomains with Django Django Ticket # 5022 - Proposed middleware : SubdomainURLsMiddleware
The summary of above links is that you have to put a wildcard entry in your domain DNS so that all your subdomains resolve to the IP on which your site is hosted .
Then make sure apache handles all the requests to sub- domains ; again using a wildcard in apache 's configuration .
Then write a middleware which checks the subdomain in request 's HTTP
Host header and processes it accordingly by either loading a customized URLs pattern or by handling the request with a view with appropriate logic .
This worked well for me and I was quickly able to make the changes so that http://www.seenreport.com/user/sharjeel was available at http://sharjeel.seenreport.com/
There were a few little problems :
Firstly , sessions did not work across the subdomains .
If I were logged in www.seenreport.com, I would n't be logged in at sharjeel.seenreport.com .
This was solved by using setting the SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN variable in settings.py :
SESSION_COOKIE_DOMAIN = '.seenreport.com ' if not DEBUG else '.localhost '
Secondly , all the main navigation links ( login , register etc. ) which were written as relative links were now pointing to sharjeel.seenreport.com instead of www.seenreport.com.
For instance the login on my profile page became sharjeel.seenreport.com/login instead of www.seenreport.com/login .
I could have hardcoded " www.seenreport.com " with these links to make them absolute URLs but that would have been bad in terms of maintainability .
It requires an if - else logic for each link so that it renders accordingly on dev/test machines and the production machine .
I used < base / > tag with href = " http://www.seenreport.com/ " ( for production , and localhost for dev ) to make the navigation links relative to main domain .
This also changed the profile links .
However , in our case , profile links are very few so adding hardcoded absolute URLs alongwith some {{ if }} {{ else }} is viable .
Using base - href everything became well except one .
Ajax calls did n't work now .
When using < base / > tag , the URLs of your ajax calls become relative to href .
In this case when an ajax call is made , a domain other than your current one is contacted , which is disallowed by the browser and following exception is raised :
" Access to restricted URI denied " code : " 1012 "
To overcome this , I appended following with each ajax call 's URL :
location .protocol + '//' + location .host + original_url ...
This made all the ajax calls relative to the current subdomain and made everything work perfectly .
Took me quite some time to figure out :)
UNA : A 16 - year - old Dalit boy died after he was thrashed in front of other students by an upper caste teacher in a rural higher secondary school of this Himachal district for writing a verse in appreciation of an upper caste girl .
Surjit Singh was beaten up on Tuesday by a teacher in the Nangal Kalan Government High school in public , said the Dalit sarpanch of the village Gyan Kaur .
His two classmates said , " When the teacher came to know about the Surjit 's love poem , he caned him till he almost dropped dead . "
That was not the end of his ordeal ; he was again beaten up by the family members of the girl the next day , Wednesday .
Surjit was later found semi-conscious and taken to the hospital but succumbed to injuries .
Local leaders have sought an inquiry into the incident as the police appear to be siding with the upper caste girl 's family and the teacher .
The result of the post mortem examination is awaited to establish what caused the boy 's death .
Police have n't revealed any motive behind his unnatural death .
School headmaster , Bhagat Ram , expressed his ignorance about the incident saying he was out of school on the day of the incident .
The accused teacher is on leave and is inaccessible .
Surjit 's father , Telu Ram , a labourer , said , " How can I think of filing a case ?
I have no money . "
SP , Una , Gyaneshwar Singh , when asked why no case had been registered in this regard , said that the police was still investigating the case .
PARIS  Imagine gliding in a floating hotel over the Serengeti , gazing down at herds of zebra or elephants ; or floating over Paris as the sun sets and lights blink on across the city as you pass the Eiffel Tower .
Such flights of fancy may one day be possible , if the dream of Jean - Marie Massaud , a French architect , comes true .
As the cost of fuel soars and the pressure mounts to reduce carbon dioxide emissions , several schemes for a new generation of airship are being considered by governments and private companies .
“ It ’s a romantic project , ” said Mr. Massaud , 45 , sitting amid furniture designs in his Paris studio , “ but then look at Jules Verne . ”
It has been more than 70 years since the giant Hindenburg zeppelin exploded in a spectacular fireball over Lakehurst , N.J. , killing 36 crew members and passengers , abruptly ending an earlier age of airships .
But because of new materials and sophisticated means of propulsion , a diverse cast of entrepreneurs is taking another look at the behemoths of the air .
A new satirical video that mocks Republicans has topped the charts on YouTube and elsewhere this week , perhaps illustrating that there 's a untapped market online for budding Michael Moores .
The provocative partisan video , embedded below , is the creation of British born writer and director Charlie Steak and Synthetic Human Pictures , a digital film production house in Phoenix , Arizona .
" We made this with the intent of creating a viral video that would reach as many people as possible with the goal of causing them to register to vote , " Steak said in an interview .
" I 'm very depressed about the general direction that America seems to be headed in under eight years of Republican leadership . "
Steak has lived in the US for years , and is a citizen .
" I love America .
I 'm so glad that I live here .
I just do n't believe that we do treat all citizens equally , and I do n't believe that we should be spending what we 're spending on this war to make people in other countries hate us , " he said .
Unlike other viral videos , however , this one links back to a web page that more fully explains the filmmakers ' earnest points of view as expressed in the video .
Steak , 46 , says that it took him a day to write the script and Synthetic Human Pictures about three months of shooting on the week - ends to complete the project .
He raised $ 2,000 to finance it .
The video , posted on YouTube on Tuesday , has already garnered more than 680,000 views as of Friday evening .
It has sparked off a raging debate of 3,253 comments , making it the most discussed video on YouTube for the week .
It has received 3,626 " Diggs " on the social bookmarking site Digg , and is the number one listing on Unruly Media 's Viral Video Chart for the week .
Maybe it 's time for someone to make " I'm voting Democrat ? "

Hard and soft .
Dark and bright .
High and low .
Wide and thin .
JAXA and NASA .
And that ’s just one spacecraft .
Japan ’s space agency , JAXA and NASA are teaming up to create a new spacecraft to study the extreme environments of the universe .
NeXT , which stands for New exploration X - Ray Telescope is a next generation x-ray astronomy satellite currently under development , with launch scheduled in 2013 .
While Japan will provide the main spacecraft and several instruments , NASA , and in particular the Goddard Space Flight Center just announced they will be adding a new instrument to the spacecraft , the High - Resolution Soft X - Ray Spectrometer ( SXS ) .
While the spacecraft ’s main instrument will be its Hard X - ray Telescope ( HXTs ) the addition of SXS is just one of several complementary instruments that provide a “ yin and yang ” aspect to NeXT ’s explorations , which hope to reveal new facets of the universe .
The concept of yin and yang involves two opposing , but at the same time , complementary aspects of any one phenomenon , or comparison of any two phenomena .
NeXT will employ both those aspects .
With the addition of NASA ’s SXS , NeXT will be observing both so - called “ hard ” and “ soft ” x-rays .
Hard x-rays are the highest energy x-rays , typically having energies greater than 10,000 electron volts ( or 10 keV ) while the lower energy x-rays are referred to as soft x-rays , which have less energy and longer wavelengths .
Different types of instruments are needed to detect each kind .
Conventional X - ray mirrors usually can just concentrate on only soft X - rays up to 10 keV.
NeXT ’s HXTs will use a “ super mirror ” which has a multi- layer coating on the reflecting surface in order to observe hard X - rays .
The mission designers plan to utilize this technique to extend the energy band of the X - ray mirrors by nearly an order of magnitude .
Observation of hard X - rays will enable the study of the various acceleration phenomena in the universe , such as dark energy , cosmic rays and supernova remnants , which astronomers say can never be completely understood through the observations of the thermal phenomena below 10 keV .
We have known for some time that cosmic X - rays are accelerated by supernova remnants .
But some cosmic X - rays have energy levels so high that they cannot possibly come from a supernova remnant .
These high - energy or hard cosmic X - rays may have been created when galaxy clusters evolved .
According to this theory , when the galaxy clusters , which were small at first , were colliding and merging into large ones , shock waves were created , which greatly accelerated the particles .
NeXT , may confirm or refute this theory .
NeXT will have both a soft x-ray telescope and soft x-ray spectrometer .
With these instruments , the spacecraft can investigate the nature of dark matter on large scales in the universe , and can also explore how bright galaxies and clusters of galaxies form and evolve .
“ We are thrilled to have the opportunity to create a powerful new x-ray spectrometer that will open up a whole new realm in high energy astrophysics in collaboration with our partners in Japan , ” said Richard L. Kelley , the Principal Investigator for the SXS mission at Goddard .
We have a great team in place that is anxiously waiting to start work . ”
To compliment the x-ray telescopes there will also be Wide - band X - ray Imagers ( WXI ) to cover a wide energy range .
Because it is difficult to cover such a wide energy range with a single detector , NeXT will use a hybrid detector , which consists of an upper - stage , soft X - ray detector and a lower - stage , hard X - ray detector .
It will use thinned X - ray CCDs ( charged coupled devices ) for the upper stage , which stop only the soft X - rays and and a CdTe ( cadmium telluride ) pixel detector for the lower stage .
Also in the suite of instruments is a Soft Gamma - ray detector ( SGD ) , which is still under development .
It will include an ultra -low background , high - sensitivity detector in soft gamma-ray band by combining an active shield and an pixel detector .
Charles Gay , deputy associate administrator for NASA ’s Science Mission Directorate in Washington said missions like SXS and NeXT “ expand NASA ’s science through partnerships with international and commercial organizations , ” – just another complimentary aspect of a mission full of yin and yang .

Drying of food as a means of preservation has been around for a long time .
Populations in suitably dry climates all around the globe have dried meat , fish , fruit , and vegetables in times of plenty as a way to provide for the leaner months of the year .
My grandmother used to tell us of when she was a child , helping to spread apple slices on the top of a tin - shed roof for drying .
An aunt once described stringing fresh young bean pods on a long heavy thread and hanging them to dry , coming up with what they called leather - britches beans .
Obviously , these were simple and imperfect food drying systems , but they do show ways in which food can be dried at home .
Essentially , dehydration of food removes the moisture that provides the environment conducive to the growth of bacteria .
Removal of the moisture results in a product that can be stored for months or even years .
Fortunately , for those of us in the less arid climates , methods exist which enable us to dry suitable quantities of foods at home without having to spread the food out on our rooftops .
In fact , a really good food dehydrator can be made easily .
For the past few years , some round plastic food dehydrators have been available at retail outlets , by mail order , and from “ infomercials ” on TV .
These units introduced many people to food drying .
The ones I examined , however , were too lightly constructed to stand up to many years of regular and heavy use .
They also lacked the capacity to do much in the way of drying a large quantity of food .
Other commercially available dehydrators that I have seen used were large , high quality units .
These models were mounted on rollers and resembled a portable dishwasher in size .
These units could dry a considerable quantity of food at a time and were being put to heavy use by the family who owned the two of them .
They were also way too expensive for me .
When I decided to begin food drying , I did so after visiting with the folks using the floor model dehydrators described above .
These friends showed me containers of dried , diced carrots , onion slices , apples , and other fruits and vegetables .
What impressed me the most about this method of preservation was the amount of space that was saved by drying the foods .
For example , a five - gallon bucketful of carrots could be sliced , steamed , and dried and made to take up the space of a shoebox .
Half of a five - gallon bucket of apples , when sliced and dried , fit nicely in a gallon - sized freezer bag .
Since building our own dehydrator , we have dried jerky , apples , strawberries , carrots , onions , green beans , bananas , fruit leathers , and several other fruits and vegetables .
Some of these were experiments , but we use the dryer each year to put up several bushels of sliced apples .
These treats make a healthful and tasty alternative to junk snack food for the whole family , much better to munch on than potato chips .
Below are instructions for building a food dryer similar to ours .
Use your imagination , intuition , and abilities when building your own .
Use what you have or what you can obtain easily and cheaply in the way of materials .
Make your food dryer to suit your own circumstances .
It might be nearly identical to the one described or a vastly improved version .
The dryer cabinet and the polycarbonate trays
For our dehydrator , I began by purchasing the light polycarbonate trays .
I then designed and built the dryer cabinet around them .
After considering various materials for constructing the trays from scratch , and after studying the effects of these materials on some foods , I decided the trays were what were needed .
The acids in some foods may react unfavorably with certain metals such as aluminum screen .
Wood , as used in dowel rod - type trays may absorb food tastes and odors .
Fiberglass screen can leave minute fiberglass splinters sticking to the dried food .
Galvanized screen is out , due to its zinc - based coating reacting with foods .
One material which I have not tried , and which may warrant experimentation , is nylon screening .
If stretched tightly on light wooden frames , this material might be durable enough to withstand repeated use .
I do not know of any health problems posed by the use of the material on dryer trays .
The trays that we used were simply better than any alternative that I could come up with at the time .
Whatever the size or material of your trays , design the cabinet size around them allowing for sufficient room below for the heat element and room to easily fit the trays within .
I am providing the measurements below to serve only as a guide for your own construction process , because the type and size of trays that you come up with may vary from that which I devised .
Our dryer measures 48 ″ tall by 14 ¾ ” wide by 16 ″ deep .
The trays themselves measure 13 ¾ ” square .
A slightly different size tray is available from Excalibur Dehydrators , listed at the end of this article .
In the accompanying photographs and drawing you can see some of the construction details of our dryer .
I made the base of heavy one - inch particle board because that is what I had .
Quarter - inch plywood made up the sides and top of the cabinet .
I ripped 1 x 2s for the framing in the cabinet and for the rails which support the drying trays .
Ordinary screen wire covers the six x six - inch fan opening .
Holes cut near the top of each side are covered on the inside with strips of screen and allow moisture and air to escape .
If you do not have one , a wide variety of suitable fan and motor assemblies are available from : W.W. Grainger Distribution Group , 1901 Plantside Drive , Louisville , KY 40299 .
Request one of their catalogs .
This is an electrical supply wholesaler .
You may have to have a retailer order this unit for you .
Order fan - motor assembly # 7C7 - 27 .
The cost was under $ 20 .
Just remember to use a relatively small fan ( about four inches in diameter ) to move the air rather slowly through the dryer .
You want the fan to ventilate the box and move the heated air throughout , but not to cool the food on the trays .
The 600 - watt ceramic heat coil [ Top ] screws into an ordinary porcelain lamp base .
[ Bottom ]
The heat source is a ceramic heat coil screwed into a regular porcelain lamp base .
The lamp fixture is secured to the base and either wired directly to a three - prong plug or through a thermostat .
The coil was purchased from a local hardware store and is rated at 600 watts .
The cost was less than $ 5 .
The lamp base cost about a dollar .
Although it is n’t absolutely necessary , I added a thermostat assembly that I had scrounged up .
This addition helped to cut down on tending and tray rotation .
The thermostat easily handles the appropriate 100° - 150 °F temperature range .
If you purchase a thermostat , specify a fairly narrow temperature spread for the on - off cycle .
Old unmatched hinges for the door and hooks and eyes for the closures were scrounged from the workshop .
Dried apples
Since dried apples are so popular at our house , I will give you the simple directions for drying them as an example of how simple it is to dry foods .
First , I use one of the clamp - on slicers that core , slice , and peel the apples in one operation .
It takes about three to five seconds to do one apple with one of these peelers .
I have looked over several models and prefer the one I purchased from Back To Basics Products , listed at the end of the article .
With this peeler , a simple knife cut is all that is needed to produce a handful of neatly prepared apple rings .
By the way , you can save the peelings and cores and make a nice batch of apple jelly from them later .
As I peel the fruit , I place the rings in a bowl containing a solution made from about a half - cup or so of lemon juice and about two to four cups water .
This acid bath prevents the apples from turning brown as they dry .
I have also heard of some folks dipping the apple rings in plain 7 - Up or Sprite for the same purpose .
After dipping the apples , I drain them in a plastic colander and arrange them on the dryer trays .
Let them dry to a chewy leathery consistency and they are ready to store .
We have found that the 10 trays full of freshly dried apples fills up a one - gallon zip - top plastic bag .
After bagging , they are stored in the freezer .
They make great snacks for work , camping , hiking , or TV - munching .
They make a really good apple pie as well .
Vegetables are similarly easy to dry , usually requiring a simple steaming prior to going into the dryer .
My wife has also used the dryer to dry sprays of flowers such as baby ’s breath , statice , and globe amaranth for use in dried bouquets and wreaths .
It worked quite well for that , too , as she prepared those items for sale .
Herbs can also be dried in the dehydrator .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Joshua Packwood knows what it 's like to be a minority .
Joshua Packwood , 22 , will be the first white valedictorian at the historically black Morehouse College .
This weekend he 'll be the first white valedictorian to graduate from the historically black , all male Morehouse College in the school 's 141 - year history .
Morehouse , in Atlanta , Georgia , is one the nation 's most prestigious universities of its kind .
For more than a century , the school has prided itself on personifying the dream of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , one of the school 's most notable alums , by producing " Morehouse Men " - intelligent and successful black leaders .
" Because I 'm one of the only white students , it 's easy to call me ' the white boy , ' I 'm naturally going to stand out , " says Packwood .
But Packwood , 22 , does n't stand out solely because he is white or has maintained a 4.0 grade point average .
For those who do n't know him , what is surprising is that a Rhodes Scholar finalist turned down a full scholarship to Columbia University to attend the all - black men's university .
This came naturally to Packwood , who attended a predominantly black high school .
" A large majority of my friends , like all my girlfriends have been minorities , " says Packwood .
" So it was very , it was kind of strange that I always kind of gravitated to the black community . "
Packwood fit in immediately at Morehouse .
His charm , movie - star good looks and chiseled physique made him popular among students .
He was elected dorm president and to class council during freshmen year - and was a favorite at campus fashion shows .
White valedictorian makes history »
He also gained worldly experience studying and traveling abroad .

Life has n't always been easy for Packwood .
He grew up in a poor area of Kansas City , Missouri , where he says he found himself gravitating to the black community at a young age .
Adolescence was rough .
His mother 's second marriage to a black man ended in divorce and family tension forced him to seek refuge with his best friend 's family - who were black and middle - class .
The experience of living with his best friend 's family had a profound effect on Packwood , who says he saw a " different side of black America . "
During his teens , Packwood says he got into his share of fights and even landed in jail a few times .
Still , his grades were good and eventually earned him a full scholarships to Morehouse College and Columbia University .
Against the advice of some family members , Packwood gave up the scholarship to an Ivy League school .
He felt the true college experience was at Morehouse - where he believed he would get more than an education .
" I gained this interest in African - American studies and I thought that Morehouse would probably be the best experience , " says Packwood .
" I think of it in terms of ' study abroad . '
If I really want to learn it , if I really want to understand it - maybe it 's best if I immerse myself in the culture . "
" Mr. Packwood is deserving .
He has earned this , " says Dr. Robert Franklin , the president of Morehouse .
" We are committed to merit , to hard work - no matter who it might be . "
For the most part , Packwood says the experience among his Morehouse brethren has been overwhelmingly good - with the exception of a few negative comments .
" One guy came up to me and told me -- he did n't like the fact that I was here , " recalls Packwood .
" He absolutely did n't like the fact that I dated black women . "
" So I heard him out , and said , ' I appreciate your opinion but do n't agree with what you have to say , '... and now we 've become , not necessarily close , but very cool , " Packwood says .
That student , Vinson Muhammad , says he was curious about the reasons why someone like Packwood would choose to attend an all - black college .
" I do n't necessarily support him being here , but because he's here and we can't discriminate against other races , I support him and his mission to be successful in life , " says Muhammad , a junior .
" I just kind of wish he had done it at a different institution . "

Even though he received the support of school administrators , Packwood 's scholastic success did not come without some controversy .
When word got out that he might become the next valedictorian , some of his classmates - even friends - were admittedly chafed .
" They approached me and said , ' Yeah , I have a problem with you being valedictorian .
I know you 've earned it and even though I know you on a personal level - I like you a lot - but it disturbs me that out of roughly 3,000 black men - there 's not one that 's done as well as or better than you academically , ' " says Packwood .
Still , the majority of students told CNN that he earned his accolades and they stand behind him .
Some say , if anything , Packwood 's academic success should serve as a lesson to his fellow students .
" I think that it should be a wake - up call to an all black campus , " says Muhammad .
" At Morehouse we 're supposed to be at the top as black men .
We only have a few white students and to see a white student will rise to this - is something unsettling to me because it shows that we need to work harder . "
Campus administrators say that black or white , Packwood 's experience is consistent with the school 's mission : to produce future leaders .
" I think some of our alumni are a little nervous about a white student graduating from Morehouse with all of its rich history for producing African - American male leaders .
But I do n't think it 's contradictory at all , " says Sterling Hudson , the dean of admissions .
Overall , Packwood says his experience is the best proof of Morehouse success , because the school was able to produce a white valedictorian - against the odds .
He 's eager to quote the school 's most notable alums .
" What Morehouse stands for at the end of the day , and what Dr. King epitomized , it 's not about black or white , it 's about the content of [ a person 's ] character , " says Packwood .
" It 's about me , representing Morehouse in that light -- not as a white man or a black man . "
His experience was so positive that Packwood 's younger brother , John , will follow in his footsteps when he enrolls as a freshman at the college next year .
Could this type of recruitment signal a new trend for Morehouse and other historically black colleges and universities ?
" We 're not aggressively pursuing white students , " says Hudson .
" But like every other college , we 're interested in diversity .
So , if a white student becomes interested in Morehouse - of course we are going to treat him like any other student . "
For now , Packwood is enjoying his rise to the top .
This week , he started his first job with the prestigious investment banking firm Goldman Sachs on Wall Street .
But he 'll be back at Morehouse Sunday wearing his cap and gown along with the 500 members of his graduating class .
Not as a white man or a black man - but as a Morehouse Man .
" The interesting thing about Josh 's experience is that he had a full Morehouse experience , " says Hudson .
" When he marches across the stage on May 18 and receives his diploma , he 's going to be a Morehouse Man in every way -- except ethnicity . "
" I do n't think ethnicity makes the difference ; it 's what 's in his heart . "

Culture shock USA - 6th and last installment
I came back to Germany .
Since I moved here last in 1992 , Germans have been asking me why I stay and whether I even like Germany .
Usually , the question almost seems to insinuate that it must be hard for any foreigner to like this Germany .
Sometimes , it seems to me that Germans have so many complexes because of a 12 - year period that they unjustifiably feel that they have nothing to be proud of .
In contrast , Americans expect everyone to like it in the US .
Maybe that 's why I feel so strange when Germans ask me if I do n't want to go home .
One night , I was talking to the US soldier I dubbed Manta in part V ( Love it or leave it ) to protect his identity .
I 'll now give his wife the pseudonym Sandy in honor of the man behind Kentucky Fried Chicken , Colonel Sanders , who earned his fortune only after retiring at 65 with a measly monthly Social Security check .
Sandy and Manta wanted me to tell them how they could emigrate so they would n't have to work all their lives like all the other Americans without having anything to show for it except a bit of consumerism .
I warned them to be careful .
" Why ? "
Sandy asked .
" Do n't you like Germany ? "
" Of course I do , " I assured her , " it has little to do with Germany itself and everything to do with the status of foreigners .
Germany is definitely just as good as 30 or 40 other countries , but I do n't speak all of the languages in those other 30 or 40 countries that are just as good .
Do you speak a foreign language ? "
" A little bit of Spanish , " the two of them said .
" Good , that will help .
So you want to go to Spain ? "
" It does n't matter .
Italy would also be nice , " Manta said .
" Or France , " Sandy added .
" It certainly does matter , " I said .
" If you do n't speak the language at all , you can't be yourself .
You wo n't be able to show your humor and your personality for years .
You should be going out and spending time with the natives so you can learn their language , but you 'll get a headache after talking to them for 10 minutes at a party .
A whole night in the foreign tongue will feel like a college admission test .
Pretty soon , you 'll be spending all your time with all the other foreigners who are suffering the same fate . "
" Us Americans have it even harder in a way , because everyone all over the world wants to speak English with us .
You might not get much of a chance to learn the local language .
But we 're actually pretty fortunate , " I explained .
" I know a refugee from Iran who lives in Freiburg .
This guy witnessed a state - sponsored mass murder on the way home one evening .
He did n't even bother going home after that ; he went straight over the border .
He spent years in makeshift barracks in southern Germany with other asylum - seekers .
None of them spoke German , and the Germans did n't teach them any German , because it would just cost money , and in the end you did n't know who was gonna be sent home .
Now imagine having to prove to people whose language you do n't speak that you are on the run because you witnessed something that did n't even officially happen ... "
" It 's easy to criticize the natives because foreigners are not well integrated , but foreigners also put themselves in ghettos , " I continued .
" At some point , you find yourself surrounded by nothing but other foreigners , who also do n't have any friends that are n't foreign , and then everybody starts complaining about how hard it is to make friends with these cold , unfriendly natives .
I saw that go on for years in Germany and also thought it must be true because all the foreigners thought the Germans were not interested in us .
" Then I spent a year in France .
You think the foreigners in France spoke differently about the French ?
The Germans I met in France loved spending time with me because they could tell me exactly how they felt in their own native tongue .
You would n't believe how these Germans talked bad about the French !
You can never make friends with them , they 're not interested in foreigners anyway , and so forth .
Real integration is almost impossible even when the conditions in the country of your choice are good .
Both sides have to give it their all . "
" But you made it , did n't you ? "
Sandy asked me .
" You are integrated in Germany ? "
" You know , sometimes I do n't know myself .
I 'll always be a little bit different .
Let 's face it , nobody in the States asks me how I like it in the US .
But even 17 years after I first arrived here , the standard icebreaker in Germany still goes basically like this :
Nice new acquaintance :
What was your name again ?
Me : Craig
Nice new acquaintance :
So where are you from , Greg ?
Me : From the US .
Nice new acquaintance :
And what are you doing here ?
Me : I live here .
Nice new acquaintance :
Why is that ?
Do you like it here ?
I mean , most Americans ...
" I am then entertained with an informative lecture about the nature of my countrymen , accompanied by perplexed looks and repeated questions about whether I can really stand living in Germany . "
" So what gives ? "
Sandy asked .
" Germans do n't like Germany ? "
" You bet your pumpernickel they do , " I said , " they just ca n't admit it because of Hitler and all that .
They look down condescendingly upon us for walking around with the Stars & Stripes everywhere because they know that they are better than we are because they do n't act like they 're better . "
" Fascinating , " Sandy said .
" Wacko , " said Manta .
" But not half as bad as all of these idiotic Americans who do n't want to have the theory of evolution taught in schools .
We are all supposed to learn that God made the world 6,000 years ago ! "
If you can't read this sign , you are driving too slow .
George W. Bush took this exit a few years ago to speak at his Alma Mater .
He told the C students there not to lose heart : " You , too , can become president . "
The sign is said to predate Bush Jr. 's presidency .

" I know what you mean , " I stated .
" I was really furious back in 1994 when California decided to block access to the welfare system , schools , and other public facilities not only for illegal immigrants , but for a lot of legal aliens .
Everybody knows that we have lots of illegal immigrants .
We need them .
Nobody else wants to do the work they do .
But if they need us , we deny them public services . "
" Unfortunately , it 's not any different anywhere else , " I continued , " just the other way around because then we are the foreigners .
You are right to be upset about all the hypocrites who call themselves Christians in the US , but it 's still our country , and we still have rights .
As a foreigner , you do n't have any .
And then , the hypocrites are out to get you . "
" Even in Germany ? " Manta asked .
" Oh yea , " I said .
" In the 1990s , the political party that calls itself the Christian Democrats declared ' The boat is full ' when they were trying to reduce the number of foreigners entering the country .
And under the Christian Democratic government of Helmut Kohl , foreigners had to wait 15 years before becoming eligible for German citizenship .
The left - of - center government that took office in 1998 shortened that period to eight years .
Having said that , Germany 's immigration policy is not that bad compared to the rest of world outside the EU .
I just do n't understand why it always seems to be the people who call themselves Christians who are so strict with the foreigners .
But that 's the same in Germany and the US . "
" But then you should be able to get German citizenship after more than 11 years .
So what 's the problem ? "
Sandy asked .
" I would have to give up my US passport .
Officially , Germany says it does not allow double citizenship , but in practice this only applies to foreigners .
When Germans get their passports renewed , nobody ever checks whether they 've gotten a second passport in the meantime .
In the US , foreigners can get US citizenship after five years of residency , and they do n't have to give up their other passport .
Do n't expect to be treated like that abroad .
Then you wo n't be disappointed . "
" So do you have access to social welfare and all that as a foreigner in Germany ? "
Sandy asked .
The Dream Green Card that was n't
In 1998 , my five - year position at the University of Freiburg ended .
I resolved to try my luck in Freiburg and not go back to the States .
Strangely , in 1997 , when I signed the last extension of my contract , there was a clause stating that I intended to return to the US .
The reason was simple : the University did n't want a lawsuit .
At the time , people from the rest of the EU , who by that time were considered citizens everywhere within the EU , were going to court about such temporary positions because they claim they were being treated like foreigners .
Although a certain amount had been deducted from my paycheck as an unemployment contribution for five years , when I lost my job I was not eligible for unemployment benefits because my residency permit expired on the same day as my work permit and my contract with the University .
The people at the Labor Department told me they were more than willing to give me unemployment benefits , but first I had to be living here legally .
Then , when I went to have my residency permit extended , I was asked how I was going to pay my rent .
' Unemployment benefits ' was not the right answer .
Back then , Germany did not have a green card like the US or a carte de séjour like the French , but only separate permits for residency and work .
Every time I was offered any work anywhere , I had to go get a work permit from the local authorities .
If I got a job working for four hours a week in a town 15 minutes north of Freiburg , I would have to go there to apply for a work permit for just these four hours .
The Labor Department there would then first try to find an unemployed German who was willing to do that work .
If they had n't found one in a couple of months , I would get the permit .
And just because I had a work permit for those four hours just outside of Freiburg did n't mean that I could work another two in Freiburg .
In the 1990s , I repeatedly spent hours waiting along with all of the other foreigners to get a German official to talk to me .
But this time was not a complete loss .
I learned that the only people that German authorities treat better than Americans are EU citizens and " blood Germans " from Eastern Europe .
Foreigners from developing countries are treated the worst as they are generally suspected of being up to no good .
They probably want to stay in Germany !
( Unimaginable , I know , what else could they want but social welfare , the best that Germany has to offer ... what else is there to like here ? )
I resolved to tempt fate .
The friendly , understanding officials patiently explained to me one last time what the law said .
I explain to them that I was n't even going to consider waiting months to get a permit for each and every little job that was offered to me .
I demanded a combined work - and - residency permit à la green card or carte de séjour .
They could give it to me for a year , I told the officials , and I assured them that I was not planning to live off of welfare .
I was not here for free ride .
The officials put on their saddest faces and regretted to inform me that what I was asking them to do simply was not possible in Germany .
Their hands were tied .
" Then you 'll just have to deport me , " I said , " for I have never heard such nonsense and I am not about to obey the law . "
The poor officials had also never heard such nonsense .
They asked me to wait and disappeared for a moment .
A few minutes later , I was asked to talk to their superior in the next room .
He was curious to know why I wanted to live in Germany so badly .
Why did I like it here so much ?
He himself would love to live in the US , like most Germans .
( Keep in mind that this was in 1997 , before Bush took office .
Today , I am not so sure that very many Germans want to live in the US . )
I rattled on at length about culture versus consumerism , intellectual values versus materialism , social bonds instead of individualism -- the latter probably being exactly what no foreigner should ever say when applying for a residency permit .
Something impressed him .
It certainly was n't my sermon .
It must 've been my hard head .
He pulled out a piece of scratch paper and a pen and issued the " Green card " below , which , if push had ever come to shove , would never have done me any good , but at least the man got me out of his office for the next few months until I had a right to a permanent residency permit .
( I got my a permanent work permit to a half years later . )
My own personal ' Green Card ' on genuine scrap paper reads : " Permanent residency permit can be granted in February 98 .
Stipulations -- gainful employment and freelancing as usual .
Otherwise -- gainful employment as freelance teacher of English and translator , music teacher , musician , and choir director permitted .
" I was thus very disappointed , " I told Sandy and Manta , " when Germany came up with a combined permit for residency and work a few years later and even called it in German ' Green Card ' .
They wanted to get IT specialists from India to come work for them , but the Indians did n't fall for it .
They knew what the differences were between the American and the German green card .
The Germans wanted the Indians to go home no later than after five years .
Why would anyone bust their butt to learn German if you can't use it later because you get kicked out of the country ? "
" Wait a minute , " Sandy said with a sarcastic look in her eye as she stood in front of a shelf full of history books , " why should these Indians benefit from such a boss welfare system ?
I mean , their forebears were n't even there when German workers sat down with employers to demand their hard - earned rights ; instead , they were probably off somewhere not doing jack in some European colony ... "
12 September 2001
Since 1998 , I have often asked myself whether it was really such a good idea to subject myself to life as a foreigner just so I could get away from ... what ?
What do n't I like about the US ?
And is Germany any better ?
Back in 97-98 when I decided for Germany and against the US , I was very disappointed in my country .
Bill Clinton had basically done away with welfare starting in 1994 .
And although an overwhelming majority of Americans wanted to have a state health care system , the Democrats proved incapable of setting one up against the opposition of industry lobbies .
As a lecturer at the University of Freiburg from 1993 to 1998 , part of my job had been explaining my country 's political system .
Republican Senator Jesse Helms was appointed chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in 1994 .
He wasted no time making clear that he did n't want to waste any American money in " rat holes " in Africa .
So much for my country 's development policies .
I also introduced my German students to the longest - serving Senator ( 48 years ) : Republican Strom Thurmond .
Back during the civil rights movement , this man even switched parties to protest racial integration -- three decades after he had gotten a black woman pregnant .
I asked my German students what parties such people would be members of in Germany .
They all agreed that such people would be ' Republikaner ' in Germany : neo -Nazis .
And if a German politician ever said that German development aid should not be wasted in some African rathole , but that taxes should be lowered , my students felt that lots of Germans would take to the street to protest .
Americans never demonstrated against Jesse Helms ; they made him chairman of the committee responsible for development aid .
Among other things , it was such highfalutin political issues that kept me in Germany in 1998 , but starting on September 12 , 2001 everyday matters took over the spotlight again .
In 1998 , I withdrew my application for a position as Director of the Center for International Studies at a good university in the US .
I probably stood a good chance of getting the job : the professor who had been my first reader for my bachelor 's thesis had become a deacon at this university .
From 1998 to 2001 , I often asked myself if I had made the right decision .
After September 12 , 2001 , I felt sure that I had .
From Europe , Americans seemed to be blind with patriotism .
Organisation like the American Council of Trustees and Alumni ( ACTA ) published studies like " Defending Civilization : How Our Universities Are Failing America and What Can Be Done About It " , in which they railed against all professors and students who did not support Bush :
Rarely did professors publicly mention heroism , rarely did they discuss the difference between good and evil , the nature of Western political order or the virtue of a free society .
Indeed , the message of much of academe was clear : BLAME AMERICA FIRST .
ACTA was founded in 1995 by Lynn Cheney ( wife of the current Republican vice - president ) and Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman , who made history in 2000 when Al Gore chose him as his running mate , thus making him the first Jewish candidate for the White House .
At the end of 2001 , blacklists like Campus Watch began popping up so people could list the names of professors allegedly critical of Israel and hence pro-Arab , i.e. pro-terrorist .
On the website of the Students for Academic Freedom , people can still denounce professors who misuse their classrooms to propagate their own political beliefs .
This website is not , as the name might suggest , the product of concerns students , but rather the brainchild of David Horwitz , author of the book " Unholy Alliance : Radical Islam and the American Left " .
Mercy , mercy me
" They would have made life hell for you as the director of the abroad program , " I thought as I drove from Austin back to New Orleans .
As I went through the radio channels , I found several Christian stations preaching hate .
I kept thinking of talks I had had back when I lived in the states with " conservatives " who were against abortion , homosexuals , etc .
I listened to these people back then and took them seriously .
I asked them if it would n't be a good idea to concentrate on preventing violence in heterosexual marriages before we prohibit functioning relationships between homosexuals .
I asked them why an omnipotent and omniscient God needed humans to punish sins .
And I tried to make it clear to them that the whole point of the New Testament was a rejection of the Old : " Those without sin throw the first stone . "
I do n't know if I made anyone back then more compassionate .
Today , my countrymen seem to all be upset at each other .
Conservatives are persecuting liberals , and liberals are bad - mouthing conservatives .
Is anyone out there still able to have a calm , respectful discussion ?
There is also a lot of confusion .
The people who call themselves conservatives seem to be able to decide what is moral and what is not .
Environmental protectionists who literally want to " conserve " the earth are at a loss when it comes to getting their message across because their opponents are already called " conservative " .
But the so - called conservatives are the ones who want to use up the resources of the earth as fast as possible because the end of the world is near .
They have even come up with an Pindex to forecast its arrival .
Suddenly , a song by Mose Allison came on the radio .
Mose , my guru -- white bread from Mississippi , just like me .
A man who does n't let his lack of a real , booming blues voice like Willie Dixon 's stop him from singing the blues about the absurdity of the world .
As I cruised down the highway in southern Louisiana , his words from the days of the Vietnam War accompanied me :
I can't believe the things I 'm seeing
I wonder ' bout some things I 've heard
Everybody crying mercy
But they do n't know the meaning of the word
A bad enough situation
Is sure enough getting worse
Everybody crying justice
Just as long as there 's business first
The road trip was relaxing .
No Germans raced up from behind doing 120 mph and flashing their headlights for me to get out of the way .
In the US , we flash our headlights to tell oncoming traffic that there 's a cop ahead , not get a fellow traveler our of our way .
I was n't in anyone 's way .
We were all driving 85 mph .
Maybe the speed limit was 70 , maybe 75 , I was n't sure .
Who knows , who cares .
As long as we all drive too fast together , we are safe because the police can't stop everybody .
An 18 - wheeler even passed me up on the left ; it must 've been doing 90 .
Nobody was in more of a hurry than anyone else .
We all drove together .
Why do Americans limit their cooperation and their civil disobedience to speeding ?
The country has always been splintered .
Whites used to be told that blacks were subhuman .
Open season on niggers !
Racism was fostered so that poor whites and poor blacks would never even think of working together to defend all of the many interests they share against the rich people who run the country .
Better to let the white trash lynch a couple of niggers than have them vote us out of office ...
Every four years , politicians pull all of the old smoke and mirrors out of their hat : gay marriage , abortion , the fight against crime , etc .
They distract voters with issues that are controversial everywhere .
They divide voters up into little groups to prevent them from defend the most important interests they all share .
It is a scheme designed to get people to vote against their own interests .
Who shows mercy ?
Mose , can you help me here ?
Everybody crying peace on earth
Just as soon as we win this war
Departure
At the airport in New Orleans the next day , my head began spinning even though I had n't had anything to drink .
I said goodbye to my brother and walked to the terminal .
Passengers were soon being called to board by section : " Now boarding passengers in sections A and B . "
I got up and walked to the end of the line .
A group of some 20 Germans aged 30 - 45 was standing in front of me .
They were all holding boarding passes with a large letter F on them .
I overheard them discussing in German whose English was the worst .
They wanted to send that person up to the front of the line to try to get on board right away .
The others said they would follow along behind .
" You bastaaaaards ! " something screamed inside me .
My head , already spinning , was now dizzy with outrage .
" How dare you come into my country and not respect our ways !
Ever heard of integration ?!
You know exactly how things work here , but you can't wait like everybody else , no , you have to sit in the plane longer than everyone else ! "
" Do n't get on board , " I suddenly heard a voice say in my left ear .
I turned and saw a tiny creature floating in the air .
" Lucifer ! " my Bible Belt soul gasped .
But then I seemed to recognize the creature .
Mose , is it you ?
Have you finally come to tell me what to do ?
But no , it was Ralph Nader .
" Stay here , Craig .
You 've done your best over there , but they are not your people .
You have n't bought a book in a store in years if you could order it online because you can't stand the elbow mentality of Germans .
Germans will never be able to stand in line , Craig , forget it .
And they drive you crazy on the autobahn !
You are constantly looking in the rearview mirror to make sure some environmentally conscious German is not coming up behind you flashing like a Christmas tree doing 120 .
And what do Germans say when they want to get by you ?
' Achtung ! ' ( warning ! ) or ' Vorsicht ! ' ( careful ! ) , but not ' Verzeihung ' ( excuse me ) .
You are just in their way .
So get outta there .
" Craig , your country needs obsessive weirdos like you who spend their leisure time looking into the lies the government tells and shouting the truth from the mountaintop .
I am 81 .
Chomsky is 76 .
If all the Americans who have been thinking about leaving since November actually do so , who is going to be left behind to keep the neoconservatives in check ?
And do n't forget the good food here !
We have more than bread ! "
" Get in the plane ! " I heard two voices shouting in my right ear .
Two tiny creatures were floating in the air .
It was my four - year - old daughter and seven - year - old son in Germany .
" Daddy , you 've been gone too long .
Do n't listen to that idiot !
You 're just having delusions of grandeur .
Mom 's never gonna play along with that , and you know it .
You belong here with us .
Stop thinking it's better on the other side -- you 're just making excuses !
Only you can make you happy , and no one can make you unhappy if you do n't let them -- is n't that what you 're bringing back with you from New Orleans ( Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans ? ) ?
" Daddy , the Germans are meister complainers .
Come back , and bring the frontier spirit from Texas with you ( Die Definition von " Pioniergeist " ) !
Forget all those highfalutin goals ; learn do deal with what life doles out - like a real frontiersman !
You just spent 30 days in the States trying to show Americans what the Germans do better .
Come back , and bring the best from the States with you .
Take the best from both worlds ! " ( Craig Morris )
