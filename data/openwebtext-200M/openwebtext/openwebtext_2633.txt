Nicole Salame , 19 , was filling out an application to UCLA last year when she got to the question about race and ethnicity .
She thought a mistake had been made .
“ I read it five times and was like , where is Middle Eastern ? ” the freshman recently recalled .
“ Is it on the other page , did it get cut off ?
I thought they forgot . ”
Her Lebanese - born mother told her Arabs are considered white , but Salame did n’t believe her .
Her high school counselor told her the same thing .
“ It did not make sense to me , it ’s so far - fetched , ” said Salame , who ended up checking “ Other . ”

For years the federal government has classified Arab Americans and Middle Easterners as white .
But confusion and disagreement have led some students to check “ Asian ” or “ African , ” depending on what part of the Middle East they came from .
Some , like Salame , simply marked “ Other . ”
Now several UCLA student groups -- including Arabs , Iranians , Afghanis and Armenians -- have launched a campaign to add a Middle Eastern category , with various subgroups , to the University of California admissions application .
They hope to emulate the Asian Pacific Coalition ’s “ Count Me In ” campaign , which a few years ago successfully lobbied for the inclusion of 23 ethnic categories on the UC application , including Hmong , Pakistani , Native Hawaiian and Samoan .
The UCLA students said having their own ethnic designation goes beyond self - identity and has real implications for the larger Arab and Middle Eastern communities .
The “ white ” label can hurt them with universities and companies that use the information to promote diversity , they say , and can result in the gathering of little or no statistical data on important issues , such as health trends in the community .
Voter - approved Proposition 209 bars California ’s public colleges from considering race in admissions .

The Arab American Institute estimates that including Middle Easterners in the white category on the census has led to a population undercount of more than a million , said Helen Samhan , who works at the institute .
There are more than 3 million Arabs in the United States , the institute says .
There is no count of Middle Easterners at UCLA .
Student groups estimate that there are hundreds , perhaps thousands , of Persians and Arabs among the more than 40,000 students on campus .
“ It ’s not just about wanting a category on a form , ” said Sarah Gualtieri , a USC professor of American studies and ethnicity .
“ I think you see particularly among a younger population a desire to really claim . . . both sides of the hyphen of Arab and American . ”
Gualtieri is the author of a forthcoming book , “ Between Arab and White : Race and Ethnicity in the Early Syrian American Diaspora , ” that explores how Syrian immigrants , who were considered Asian , waged a legal battle in the early 1900s to be classified as white and thus eligible for citizenship .
At the time some were barred by the courts under the Asian Exclusion Act .

That classification was cemented in the late 1970s when the Office of Management and Budget , a federal agency , listed all Middle Easterners as white .
But in the last few decades there has been a push to establish a separate category as the general population has grown more diverse and because of the possible benefits it could bring .
“ Back then , to get rights you needed to be white , ” said Yasi Chehroudi , president of the Iranian Student Group , which is helping spearhead the University of California campaign .
“ Now it helps to be yourself . ”
UC officials are aware of the UCLA students ’ campaign and are exploring the possibility of changing the ethnic categories on the university ’s application form , said Nina Robinson , director of policy for the Department of Student Affairs .
A decision could come in the next six months .

But any change in ethnicity categories could affect data trends , Robinson said .
For example , if those who in the past would have checked white were to start checking another category , it would appear as a sudden drop in white applicants .
“ It ’s reasonable that Middle Eastern people do n’t like to be lumped in with white , so I think there ’s a lot of sympathy for the issue , ” Robinson said .
“ But there are also a lot of issues ” to consider .
In a 1997 report on the census , the Office of Management and Budget pointed out that while Arab Americans suffer from stereotyping , they tend to be more educated and affluent than the average American .
The report questioned whether they should be placed in a minority category , which could increase their chances for benefits aimed at the socially and economically disadvantaged .
Some in the Middle Eastern community agree .
But UCLA junior Shawn Gabrill said he has more in common with other children of immigrants than with those whose parents were born in this country .

“ I feel like when I put down ‘ white ’ on an application , they assume my parents finished high school , went to college and that English was my first language , ” the 20 - year - old English major said .
“ And none of these things describe me . ”
Gabrill , the son of Jordanian and Egyptian parents , said he had difficulties with the college application but , because he was seen as white , he was n’t identified as someone who needed extra help from high school counselors .
“ So it ’s kind of like we ’re in between .
We ’re not white , but we ’re not as disadvantaged as the other groups so we do n’t get any of that aid , ” he said .
“ So we ’re kind of invisible in that way . ”

as I am by the news this morning that more infighting and withheld evidence have forced Attorney General Eric Holder not only to waver on releasing more Bush - era interrogation memos but to drop all charges against the doubly villainous Ted Stevens , take heart : the Spaniards are here .
Lost in the tabloidy drumbeat of " the Obamas ' vacation to London " ( also known as the most important economic meeting of the millennium ) was Saturday 's buried headline that a Spanish judge would finally — finally — take Bush administration lawyers to task for justifying the horrors at Guantánamo .
But this was n't just any judge ; this was Baltasar Garzón , a man who is not only extremely well dressed and an extremely diligent professor but a fucking hero — the kind of legal mind that should show up in high school textbooks here , the kind of man only rivaled on this side of the pond by Patrick Fitzgerald .
Garzón understands what justice means .
It means you do n't let Pinochet , bin Laden , poet killers , genocidal Argentine military men , or money laundering bankers live on as untried enemies of the state , even if that state is not your own .
And it certainly means you do n't let the U.S. Justice Department sit on its hands while six prominent enablers of America as Torturer sign book deals .
That 's why you should become a fan of Garzón , despite the sad reality that the most he can hope to achieve in the coming months is to keep Alberto Gonzales from taking a European vacation ( if he ever finds a job ) , to put more pressure on John Yoo ( if Jose Padilla 's lawsuit does n't finish him first ) and to discourage Doug Feith from whining to Bill O'Reilly .
And it 's possible he may not even be around to do this much longer : his own country is investigating him for misconduct ... for getting paid by NYU to enlighten America to its own ideals for a couple semesters .
It seems we 're not the only country trying to sweep the dirt of the last eight years under the carpet .

The chant " Drill Baby Drill ! " , commonly heard at Republican rallies last autumn , became one of the most memorable slogans of the 2008 US presidential election .
Oil prices had skyrocketed , with prices running to almost $ 150 a barrel .
While John McCain suggested ratcheting up domestic oil production as the solution , Barack Obama promised a technological revolution that would allow the development of green alternatives to petrol within 10 years .
Energy independence became the watchword of the day .
President Obama clearly believes America 's addiction to oil is a national security problem , and is calling for the US to wean itself off foreign oil .
Just six days into his presidency , he declared : " America 's dependence on oil is one of the most serious threats our nation has faced .
It bankrolls dictators , pays for nuclear proliferation , and funds both sides of our struggle against terrorism . "
Among the steps toward energy independence he recommends are improving energy efficiency and building fuel - ­efficient vehicles .
But although these initiatives will reduce oil consumption , they will not remotely achieve the goal of US energy independence .
The US will never again meet oil demand through domestic production , as it faces permanent declines .
The 1970s saw the American peak in oil production .
Since then , annual production rates in the US have fallen .
The US accounts for nearly one quarter of worldwide oil consumption , and now close to 60 % of that must be imported .
Even a huge increase in the number of wells drilled there cannot reduce the import level by more than a few percentage points .
Potential new oil discoveries , including any in the Arctic national wildlife refuge , will be insufficient to reverse projected declines .
The US is more extensively explored than any other country , and estimates by the US Geological Survey dash any hope of drilling to energy independence .
Too little oil remains in American reservoirs .
Switching to alternative sources of energy is touted as the other great solution .
But even high oil prices and market forces are unlikely to halt US import dependence , as no meaningful near and midterm alternatives exist .
Options to limit or end oil dependence in the transportation sector include fuel switching and improvements in fuel economy .
Fuel switching entails the retooling of the transportation sector to vehicles powered by natural gas , electricity , biofuels or hydrogen fuel cells .
Fuel economy improvements could be attained by the more widespread adoption of either hybrid cars or diesel - powered vehicles .
Although these changes might affect consumption per mile , projected increases in travel would more than offset such gains .
This means that nothing short of fuel switching can reduce oil usage to the point where all oil used is produced domestically .
Fuel switching is likelier to occur in an era of high oil prices , but market incentives are low now that oil prices have slid from the record highs of summer 2008 .
High - volume US oil importation will remain a constant for at least two to three decades .
The current global energy market presents many geostrategic challenges .
These include the stability of oil producers , terrorism , embargoes , sanctions and ethnic conflicts .
Also , by 2020 , Chinese consumption will outpace that of the US .
This adds an additional challenge for national security planners , as the US has previously been the sole superpower engaging oil - producing regions and trying to influence their politics .
A rising China is likely to challenge the US for access and influence throughout the oil - exporting world .
Within the developed world , renewable production from wind , solar and geothermal sources will need to be dramatically increased .
This will eventually free fossil fuels for transportation use as opposed to electrical generation .
Where oil originates is largely irrelevant economically , so developing diverse supplies of energy globally may be the best energy security for all importers – not just the US .
The major energy - consuming countries must work together on long - term solutions to replace oil rather than worrying about where it comes from .

AUSTRALIANS have been advised to stockpile food and water after the World Health Organisation raised its swine flu alert to phase five yesterday , indicating an imminent pandemic .
The Federal Government 's pandemic plan , a 132 - page manual issued to medics , media and the public , insists that once the world reaches phase five , Australians should stock their pantries with food and bottled water to last 14 days , check on elderly neighbours and put emergency numbers by the phone .
But yesterday a spokesman for the Department of Health and Ageing called for calm , saying the Government did not want to spark panic buying - ignoring its own plan , already issued to hospitals across the nation .
" I agree that is it confusing , " the spokesman said , admitting he had not read the pandemic plan despite being employed to answer questions about it from national media .
" The manual may say people should be preparing but we do n't want a run at the shops , " he said .
Where 2.6.29 came from
Did you know ...?
LWN . net is a subscriber - supported publication ; we rely on subscribers to keep the entire operation going .
Please help out by buying a subscription and keeping LWN on the net .
We are very much creatures of tradition here at LWN .
So , as the 2.6.29 development cycle nears its end , tradition drives us to take a look at where the code came from in this development cycle .
As of March 17 , 11,610 non-merge changesets have been folded into the 2.6.29 kernel .
These patches added an amazing 1,228,000 lines of code and documentation , while removing 401,000 ; the 2.6.29 kernel will have 827,000 more lines than its predecessor .
Some 1420 1166 developers took part in this cycle .
Your editor , sensing that this number represents a record , decided to look back at previous kernels :
Release Developers 2.6.22 885 2.6.23 854 2.6.24 950 2.6.25 1124 2.6.26 1027 2.6.27 1022 2.6.28 1078 2.6.29 1166
It would seem that there is a clear trend here : the kernel development community has grown significantly over the last couple of years .
The number of employers represented by these developers ( 175 ) has grown a little , but the uncertainties involved in associating developers with employers argue against reading too much into that particular number .
Suffice to say that quite a few companies are supporting kernel development work .
Here are the individual developer statistics :
Most active 2.6.29 developers
By changesets Chris Mason 671 5.8 % Takashi Iwai 173 1.5 % Jaswinder Singh Rajput 158 1.4 % Stephen Hemminger 154 1.3 % Mike Frysinger 150 1.3 % Christoph Hellwig 143 1.2 % Ben Dooks 142 1.2 % Alexey Dobriyan 138 1.2 % Ingo Molnar 133 1.1 % Rusty Russell 127 1.1 % Steven Rostedt 110 0.9 % Mauro Carvalho Chehab 109 0.9 % Mark Brown 108 0.9 % Sam Ravnborg 108 0.9 % David S.

Chris Mason comes out on top of the " changesets " category as a result of the Btrfs merge .
It is a significant body of code , to be sure , but the changeset count is as high as it is because the entire Btrfs development history was merged .
So we 're seeing rather more than three months worth of work there .
Takasi Iwai did a great deal of work in the ALSA subsystem , and in the Intel HDA driver in particular .
Jaswinder Singh Rajput contributed quite a few patches of the cleanup variety .
Stephen Hemminger 's work consisted mainly of changing the network driver API , then fixing a long list of broken drivers .
And Michael Frysinger contributed a lot of changes to the Blackfin architecture .
If one looks at the number of lines changed , the picture is a little different .
As with 2.6.28 , Greg Kroah - Hartman fed large amounts of crap ( his word ) into the - staging tree ; that code does not retain the original author information within the git repository ( though , of course , credits in the code itself are unchanged ) .
Luis Rodriguez did a lot of work on Atheros wireless drivers and the cfg80211 subsystem ; much of this work was associated with regulatory compliance support .
Daniel Krueger achieved his place on the list by contributing a single patch : the Systec Electronic openPOWERLINK network stack .
David Kiliani is another one - patch wonder ; his was a driver for Meilhaus ME - IDS data collection cards .
Daniel and David 's patches both went into the - staging tree .
So , three of the top five code contributors put their work in by way of - staging .
The associated employer statistics look like this :
Most active 2.6.29 employers

The employer numbers tend not to change radically from one release to the next ; many of the same companies show up every time .
New appearances this time include Vyatta ( which supports Stephen Hemminger 's work ) and some companies ( Simtec , SYS TEC , Cavium Networks ) which contributed support for their own products .
The number of patches with Reviewed - by tags remains relatively small - less than 5 % of the total .
The top credited reviewers this time around are :
Developers with the most reviews James Morris 64 20.2 % Dave Chinner 51 16.1 % Christoph Hellwig 39 12.3 % Andrew Morton 14 4.4 % Eric Sandeen 12 3.8 % Daisuke Nishimura 11 3.5 % KOSAKI Motohiro 10 3.2 % Matthew Wilcox 8 2.5 % WANG Cong 7 2.2 % Zhu , Yi 5 1.6 % KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki 5 1.6 % Eric Anholt 4 1.3 % Pekka Enberg 4 1.3 % Tomas Winkler 4 1.3 % Paul Menage 4 1.3 % Mike Christie 4 1.3 % Grant Grundler 4 1.3 %
These numbers remain an artifact of how the reporting of reviews is done ; certainly there is more code review than this going on .
The same is true for reporting and testing credits .
For 2.6.29 , the numbers are :
Most credited 2.6.29 reporters and testers Reported - by credits Randy Dunlap 13 3.8 % Ingo Molnar 7 2.0 % Li Zefan 6 1.7 % Alexander Beregalov 5 1.5 % Stephen Rothwell 5 1.5 % Stefan Richter 4 1.2 % Johannes Berg 4 1.2 % Eric Sesterhenn 4 1.2 % Kamalesh Babulal 4 1.2 % Larry Finger 3 0.9 % Linus Torvalds 3 0.9 % Andrew Morton 3 0.9 % Guennadi Liakhovetski 3 0.9 % Huang Ying 3 0.9 % Daisuke Nishimura 3 0.9 % Meelis Roos 3 0.9 % Geert Uytterhoeven 3 0.9 % Tested - by : credits Hin-Tak Leung 14 5.2 % Mike Frysinger 7 2.6 % Larry Finger 7 2.6 % Ingo Molnar 6 2.2 % Herton Ronaldo Krzesinski 6 2.2 % Li Zefan 5 1.9 % Daisuke Nishimura 4 1.5 % KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki 4 1.5 % Andrew Patterson 4 1.5 % Meelis Roos 4 1.5 % KOSAKI Motohiro 3 1.1 % Stephen Gildea 3 1.1 % Robert Jarzmik 3 1.1 % Serge Hallyn 3 1.1 % Eric Sesterhenn 3 1.1 %
All told , 2.6.29 was one of the most active development cycles yet , with vast amounts of code finding its way into the kernel and a record number of developers participating .
The development community might be justified in taking a rest after this much work , but the kernel process , it seems , never stops .
There is already a lot of work waiting for the 2.6.30 merge window to open , at which point the whole cycle will start anew .

Looks like Amazon is in toraburu for selling Japanese rape simulation games .
Excerpt from Belfast Telegraph article :
The shocking ' rape simulator ' , Rapelay , is set in Japan and carries a sickening game description on the Amazon website .
An MP said last night that he plans to raise the issue in Parliament .
Reviews by gaming websites have expressed horror at the basis for the game .
One website review describes " tears glistening in the young girl 's eyes " as she is attacked in graphic detail .
Players begin the game by stalking a mother on a subway station before violently raping her .
They then move on to attack her two daughters described as virgin schoolgirls .
Players are also allowed to enter ' freeform mode ' where they can rape any woman and get other male game characters to join the attacks .

Paulson ’s Financial Bailout
It is becoming clear that the bailout measures of late 2008 may have consequences at least as grave for an open society as the response to 9/11 in 2001 .
Many members of Congress felt coerced into voting against their inclinations , and the normal procedures for orderly consideration of a bill were dispensed with .
It is clear that there has been a sustained move in the direction of martial law preparations , a trend that has been as continuous as it has been unheralded .
The excuse for bypassing normal legislative procedures was the existence of an emergency .
But one of the most reprehensible features of the legislation , that it allowed Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to permit bailed - out institutions to use public money for exorbitant salaries and bonuses , was inserted by Paulson after the immediate crisis had passed .
According to Congressman Peter Welch ( D - Vermont ) the bailout bill originally called for a cap on executive salaries , but Paulson changed the requirement at the last minute .
Welch and other members of Congress were enraged by “ news that banks getting taxpayer - funded bailouts are still paying exorbitant salaries , bonuses , and other benefits . ” 1
In addition , as AP reported in October , “ Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y . questioned allowing banks that accept bailout bucks to continue paying dividends on their common stock .
` There are far better uses of taxpayer dollars than continuing dividend payments to shareholders , ’ he said . ”
2
Even more reprehensible is the fact that since the bailouts , Paulson and the Treasury Department have refused to provide details of the Troubled Assets Relief Program spending of hundreds of billions of dollars , while the New York Federal Reserve has refused to provide information about its own bail - out ( using government - backed loans ) that amounts to trillions .
This lack of transparency has been challenged by Fox TV in a FOIA suit against the Treasury Department , and a suit by Bloomberg News against the Fed.3
The financial bailout legislation of September 2008 was only passed after members of both Congressional houses were warned that failure to act would threaten civil unrest and the imposition of martial law .
U.S. Sen. James Inhofe , R - Okla. , and U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman , D - Calif. , both said U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson brought up a worst - case scenario as he pushed for the Wall Street bailout in September .
Paulson , former Goldman Sachs CEO , said that might even require a declaration of martial law , the two noted .
4
Here are the original remarks by Senator Inhofe :
Speaking on Tulsa Oklahoma ’s 1170 KFAQ , when asked who was behind threats of martial law and civil unrest if the bailout bill failed , Senator James Inhofe named Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson as the source .
“ Somebody in D.C. was feeding you guys quite a story prior to the bailout , a story that if we did n’t do this we were going to see something on the scale of the depression , there were people talking about martial law being instituted , civil unrest …. who was feeding you guys this stuff ? , ” asked host Pat Campbell .
“ That ’s Henry Paulson , ” responded Inhofe , “ We had a conference call early on , it was on a Friday I think – a week and half before the vote on Oct .
1 . So it would have been the middle … what was it – the 19th of September , we had a conference call .
In this conference call – and I guess there ’s no reason for me not to repeat what he said , but he said – he painted this picture you just described .
He said , ‘ This is serious .
This is the most serious thing that we faced . ’” 5
Rep. Brad Sherman ( D - CA 27th District ) reported the same threat on the Congressional floor ( Rep. Sherman later downplayed his remarks slightly on the Alex Jones show ) :
“ The only way they can pass this bill is by creating a panic atmosphere … .
Many of us were told that the sky would fall … .
A few of us were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no .
That ’s what I call fear - mongering , unjustified , proven wrong . ”
6
So it is clear that threats of martial law were used to get this reprehensible bailout legislation passed .
It also seems clear that Congress was told of a threat of martial law , not itself threatened .
It is still entirely appropriate to link such talk to the Army ’s rapid moves to redefine its role as one of controlling the American people , not just protecting them .
In a constitutional polity based on balance of powers , we see the emergence of a radical new military power that is as yet completely unbalanced .
The Army ’s New Role in 2001 : Not Protecting American Society , but Controlling It
This new role for the Army is not wholly unprecedented .
The U.S. military had been training troops and police in " civil disturbance planning " for the last three decades .
The master plan , Department of Defense Civil Disturbance Plan 55 - 2 , or " Operation Garden Plot , " was developed in 1968 in response to the major protests and disturbances of the 1960s .
But on January 19 , 2001 , on the last day of the Clinton administration , the U.S. Army promulgated a new and permanent Continuity of Operations ( COOP ) Program .
It encapsulated its difference from the preceding , externally - oriented Army Survival , Recovery , and Reconstitution System ( ASRRS ) as follows :
a . In 1985 , the Chief of Staff of the Army established the Army Survival , Recovery , and Reconstitution System ( ASRRS ) to ensure the continuity of essential Army missions and functions .
ASRRS doctrine was focused primarily on a response to the worst case 1980 ’s threat of a massive nuclear laydown on CONUS as a result of a confrontation with the Soviet Union .
b . The end of the Cold War and the breakup of the former Soviet Union significantly reduced the probability of a major nuclear attack on CONUS but the probability of other threats has increased .
Army organizations must be prepared for any contingency with a potential for interruption of normal operations .
To emphasize that Army continuity of operations planning is now focused on the full all - hazards threat spectrum , the name " ASRRS " has been replaced by the more generic title “ Continuity of Operations ( COOP ) Program . ”
7
This document embodied the secret Continuity of Operations ( COG ) planning conducted secretly by Rumsfeld , Cheney , and others through the 1980s and 1990s .
8
This planning was initially for continuity measures in the event of a nuclear attack , but soon called for suspension of the Constitution , not just “ after a nuclear war ” but for any “ national security emergency . ”
This was defined in Reagan ’s Executive Order 12656 of November 18 , 1988 as “ any occurrence , including natural disaster , military attack , technological emergency , or other emergency , that seriously degrades or seriously threatens the national security of the United States . ”
The effect was to impose on domestic civil society the extreme measures once planned for a response to a nuclear attack from abroad.9
In like fashion ARR 500 - 3 Regulation clarified that it was a plan for “ the execution of mission - essential functions without unacceptable interruption during a national security or domestic emergency . ”
Donald Rumsfeld , who as a private citizen had helped author the COG planning , promptly signed and implemented the revised ARR 500 - 3 .
Eight months later , on 9/11 , Cheney and Rumsfeld implemented COG , a significant event of which we still know next to nothing .
What we do know is that plans began almost immediately – as foreseen by COG planning the 1980s — to implement warrantless surveillance and detention of large numbers of civilians , and that in January 2002 the Pentagon submitted a proposal for deploying troops on American streets .
10
Then in April 2002 , Defense officials implemented a plan for domestic U.S. military operations by creating a new U.S. Northern Command ( CINC - NORTHCOM ) for the continental United States .
11
In short , what were being implemented were the most prominent features of the COG planning which Oliver North had worked on in the 1980s .
Deep Events and Changes of Party in the White House
Like so many other significant steps since World War Two towards a military - industrial state , the Army ’s Regulation 500 - 3 surfaced in the last days of a departing administration ( in this case the very last day ) .
It is worth noticing that , ever since the 1950s , dubious events –of the unpublic variety I have called deep events –have marked the last months before a change of party in the White House .
These deep events have tended to a ) constrain incoming presidents , if the incomer is a Democrat , or alternatively b ) to pave the way for the incomer , if he is a Republican .
Consider , in the first category , the following ( when a Republican was succeeded by a Democrat ) :
* In December 1960 the CIA secured approval for the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba , and escalated events in Laos into a crisis for which the Joint Chiefs proposed sending 60,000 troops .
These events profoundly affected President Kennedy ’s posture towards Cuba and Indochina .
* In 1976 CIA Director George H.W. Bush installed an outside Team B intelligence unit to enlarge drastically estimates of the Soviet threat to the United States , eventually frustrating and reversing presidential candidate Jimmy Carter ’s campaign pledge to cut the U.S. defense budget .

Equally important were events in the second category ( when a Democrat was succeeded by a Republican ) :
* In late 1968 Kissinger , while advising the Johnson administration , gave secret information to the Nixon campaign that helped Nixon to obstruct the peace agreement in Vietnam that was about to be negotiated at the peace talks then taking place in Paris .
( According to Seymour Hersh , “ The Nixon campaign , alerted by Kissinger to the impending success of the peace talks , was able to get a series of messages to the Thieu government ” in Saigon .
making it clear that a Nixon presidency would offer a better deal .
This was a major factor in securing the defeat of Democratic candidate Hubert Humphrey .13
Kissinger was not the kind of person to have betrayed his president on his own personal initiative .
At the time Nixon ’s campaign manager , John Mitchell ( one of the very few in on the secret ) , told Hersh that “ I thought Henry [ Kissinger ] was doing it because Nelson [ Rockefeller ] wanted him to .
Nelson asked Henry to help and he did .
” 14
* In 1980 the so - called October Surprise , with the help of people inside CIA , helped ensure that the Americans held hostage in Iran would not be returned before the inauguration of Reagan .
This was a major factor in securing the defeat of incumbent Jimmy Carter .
15
Once again , the influence of the Rockefellers can be discerned .
A CIA officer later reported hearing Joseph V. Reed , an aide to David Rockefeller , comment in 1981 to William Casey , the newly installed CIA Director , about their joint success in disrupting Carter ’s plans to bring home the hostages .
16
Both the financial bailout , extorted from Congress and the escalated preparations for martial law can be seen as transitional events of the first category .
Whatever the explanations for their timing , they will constrain Obama ’s freedom to make his own policies .
I fear moreover they may have the consequence of easing this country into unforeseen escalations of the Afghan war .
The Intensive Quiet Preparations for Martial Law
Let us deal first with the preparations for martial law .
On September 30 , 2008 , the Army Times announced the redeployment of an active Brigade Army Team from Iraq to America , in a new mission that “ may become a permanent part of the active Army ” :
The 3rd Infantry Division ’s 1st Brigade Combat Team has spent 35 of the last 60 months in Iraq patrolling in full battle rattle , helping restore essential services and escorting supply convoys .
Now they ’re training for the same mission — with a twist — at home .
Beginning Oct. 1 for 12 months , the 1st BCT will be under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , the Army service component of Northern Command , as an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks .
. . .
After 1st BCT finishes its dwell - time mission , expectations are that another , as yet unnamed , active - duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one .
. . . They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control .17
This announcement followed by two weeks the talk of civil unrest and martial law that was used to panic the Congress into passing Paulson ’s bailout legislation .
Not only that , the two unprecedented events mirror each other : the bailout debate anticipated civil unrest and martial law , while the announced positioning of an active Brigade Combat Team on U.S. soil anticipated civil unrest ( such as might result from the bailout legislation ) .
Then on December 17 , 2008 , US Northern Command chief General Renuart announced that “ the US military plans to mobilize thousands of troops to protect Washington against potential terrorist attack during the inauguration of president - elect Barack Obama .
”
18
The US Army War College has also raised the possibility of the U.S. Army being used to control civil unrest , according to the Phoenix Business Journal :
A new report by the U.S. Army War College talks about the possibility of Pentagon resources and troops being used should the economic crisis lead to civil unrest , such as protests against businesses and government or runs on beleaguered banks .
“ Widespread civil violence inside the United States would force the defense establishment to reorient priorities in extremis to defend basic domestic order and human security , ” said the War College report .
The study says economic collapse , terrorism and loss of legal order are among possible domestic shocks that might require military action within the U.S.19
It is clear that there has been a sustained move in the direction of martial law preparations , a trend that has been as continuous as it has been unheralded .
Senator Leahy was thus right to draw our attention to it back on September 29 , 2006 , in his objections to the final form of the Fiscal Year 2007 National Defense Authorization Act , which gave the president increased power to call up the National Guard for law enforcement :
It . . . should concern us all that the Conference agreement includes language that subverts solid , longstanding posse comitatus statutes that limit the military ’s involvement in law enforcement , thereby making it easier for the President to declare martial law .
There is good reason for the constructive friction in existing law when it comes to martial law declarations .
20
This quiet agglomeration of military power has not “ just growed , ” like Topsy , through inadvertence .
It shows sustained intention , even if no one has made a public case for it .
How the Bush Administration Protected Predatory Lending and Let the Financial Crisis Grow
Let us now consider the financial crisis and the panic bailout .
No one should think that the crisis was unforeseen .
Back in February Eliot Spitzer , in one of his last acts as governor of New York , warned about the impending crisis created by predatory lending , and reveled that the Bush Administration was blocking state efforts to deal with it .
His extraordinary warning , in the Washington Post , is worth quoting at some length :
Several years ago , state attorneys general and others involved in consumer protection began to notice a marked increase in a range of predatory lending practices by mortgage lenders . …
Even though predatory lending was becoming a national problem , the Bush administration looked the other way and did nothing to protect American homeowners .
In fact , the government chose instead to align itself with the banks that were victimizing consumers .
. . .
Several state legislatures , including New York ’s , enacted laws aimed at curbing such practices .
. . . Not only did the Bush administration do nothing to protect consumers , it embarked on an aggressive and unprecedented campaign to prevent states from protecting their residents from the very problems to which the federal government was turning a blind eye .
Let me explain :
The administration accomplished this feat through an obscure federal [ Treasury ] agency called the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) .
The OCC has been in existence since the Civil War .
Its mission is to ensure the fiscal soundness of national banks .
For 140 years , the OCC examined the books of national banks to make sure they were balanced , an important but uncontroversial function .
But a few years ago , for the first time in its history , the OCC was used as a tool against consumers .
In 2003 , during the height of the predatory lending crisis , the OCC invoked a clause from the 1863 National Bank Act to issue formal opinions preempting all state predatory lending laws , thereby rendering them inoperative .
The OCC also promulgated new rules that prevented states from enforcing any of their own consumer protection laws against national banks .
The federal government ’s actions were so egregious and so unprecedented that all 50 state attorneys general , and all 50 state banking superintendents , actively fought the new rules .
But the unanimous opposition of the 50 states did not deter , or even slow , the Bush administration in its goal of protecting the banks .
In fact , when my office opened an investigation of possible discrimination in mortgage lending by a number of banks , the OCC filed a federal lawsuit to stop the investigation .
21
Eliot Spitzer submitted his Op Ed to the Washington Post on February 13 .
If it had an impact , it was not the one Spitzer had hoped for .
On March 10 the New York Times broke the story of Spitzer ’s encounter with a prostitute .
According to a later Times story , “ on Feb. 13 [ the day Spitzer ’s Op Ed went up on the Washington Post website ] federal agents staked out his hotel in Washington . ” 22
It is remarkable that the Mainstream Media found Spitzer ’s private life to be big news , but not his charges that Paulson ’s Treasury was prolonging the financial crisis , or the relation of these charges to Spitzer ’s exposure .
As a weblog commented ,
The US news media failed to draw the obvious connection between the bizarre federal law enforcement investigation and leak campaign about the private life of New York Governor Spitzer and Spitzer ’s all out attack on the Bush administration for its collusion with predatory lenders .
While the international credit system grinds to a halt because of a superabundance of bad mortgage loans made in the US , the news media failed to cover the details of Spitzer ’s public charges against the White House .
Yet when salacious details were leaked about alleged details of Spitzer ’s private life , they took that information and made it the front page news for days .
23
After Spitzer ’s Op Ed was published , according to Greg Palast , the Federal Reserve , “ for the first time in its history , loaned a selected coterie of banks one - fifth of a trillion dollars to guarantee these banks ’ mortgage - backed junk bonds .
The deluge of public loot was an eye - popping windfall to the very banking predators who have brought two million families to the brink of foreclosure . ” 24
What are we to make of Spitzer ’s charge that the Bush administration interfered to preempt state laws against predatory lending , and of the fact that the mainstream media did not report that ?
A petty motive for the OCC ’s behavior in 2003 might have been to allow the housing bubble to continue through 2003 and 2004 , thus facilitating Bush ’s re-election .
But the persistence of Treasury obstruction thereafter , despite the unanimous opposition of all fifty states , and the continuing silence of the media about this disagreement , suggest that some broader policy intention may have been at stake .
One is struck by the similarities with the Savings and Loan scandal which was allowed to continue through the Reagan 1980s , long after it became apparent that deliberate bankruptcy was being used by unscrupulous profiteers to amass illegal fortunes at what was ultimately public expense .
25
In the same way , the long drawn - out housing bubble of the current Bush decade , and particularly the derivative bubble that was floated upon it , allowed the Bush administration to help offset the trillion - dollar - plus cost of its Iraq misadventure , 26 by creating spurious securities that sold for hundreds of billions , not just in the United States , but through the rest of the world .
In the long run , this was not a sustainable source of wealth for America ’s financial class , which is now suffering like everyone else from the consequent recession .
But in the short run , the financial crisis and bailout made it possible for Bush to wage a costly war without experiencing the kind of debilitating inflation that was brought on by America ’s Vietnam War .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
The trillion dollar meltdown , 27 in other words , can be rationalized as having helped finance the Iraq War .
When we turn to the martial law preparations , however , they are being made in anticipation of civil unrest in the future .
Why such intense preparation for this ?
The obvious answer of course is memory of the rioting that occurred in San Francisco and elsewhere during the great depression of the 1930s .
Indeed that thought may be uppermost among those who recently arranged for the redeployment of a Brigade Combat Team from Iraq to America .
But the planning for martial law in America dates back almost three decades , from the days when Reagan appointed Rumsfeld , Cheney and others to plan secretly for what was misleadingly called Continuity [ i.e. , Change ] of Government .
Concern about the 2008 recession cannot have been on their minds then , or on those who introduced the Army ’s “ Continuity of Operations ( COOP ) Program ” on January 19 , 2001 .
Instead the “ full all - hazards threat spectrum ” envisaged in that document was clearly ancillary to the doctrine of “ full - spectrum dominance ” that had been articulated in the Joint Chiefs of Staff blueprint , Joint Vision 2020 , endorsed eight months earlier on May 30 , 2000.28
The interest of Cheney and Rumsfeld in COG planning , including planning for martial law , also envisaged full spectrum dominance .
This is made clear by their simultaneous engagement in the 1990s in the public Project for the New American Century ( PNAC ) .
PNAC ’s goals were stated very explicitly in their document Rebuilding America ’s Defenses : to increase defense spending so as to establish America ’s military presence throughout the world as an unchallengeable power .
This would entail permanent U.S. forces in central as well as east Asia , even after the disappearance [ jam1 ] of Saddam Hussein.29
In short PNAC ’s program was a blueprint for permanent overseas American empire , a project they recognized would not be easily accepted by an American democracy .
Their call frankly acknowledged that it would be difficult to gain support for their projected increase in defense spending to “ a minimum level of 3.5 to 3.8 percent of gross domestic product , adding $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion to total defense spending annually . ”
“ The process of transformation , ” the document admitted , “ is likely to be a long one , absent some catastrophic and catalyzing event — like a new Pearl Harbor . ”
30
There is of course every reason to hope that the disastrous era of Rumsfeld and Cheney is about to end , with the election of Barack Obama .
Obama has made it clear that he will pursue a foreign policy dedicated to diplomacy and multilateralism .
In this spirit he has declared his willingness to talk to Iran without preconditions .
But Obama ’s stated reason for disengagement from Iraq – “ The scale of our deployments in Iraq continues to set back our ability to finish the fight in Afghanistan ” 31 – is very ominous .
Few serious students of the Afghan scene believe that America can “ finish the fight in Afghanistan , ” any more successfully than could the Russians or British before them .
The U.S. position there is visibly deteriorating , while the U.S. strategy of cross - border attacks is having the effect of destabilizing Pakistan as well .
The U.S. - backed Karzai regime has so little control over the countryside that Kabul itself is now coming under rocket attack .
Experts on the scene agree that any effort to “ finish ” will be a long - term proposition requiring at a minimum a vastly escalated commitment of U.S. troops .
32
One cannot predict the future , but one can examine the past .
For thirty years I have been writing about the persistence in America of a war mentality that , time after time , trumps reasonable policies of negotiation , and leads us further into armed conflict .
This dominant mindset is not restricted to any single agency or cabal , but is rather the likely outcome of on - going tensions between hawks and doves in the internal politics of Washington .
If a container of rocks and gravel is shaken vigorously , the probability is that the gravel will gravitate towards the bottom , leaving the largest rocks at the top .
There is an analogous probability that , in an on - going debate over engaging or withdrawing from a difficult military contest , the forces for engagement will come out on top , regardless of circumstances .
Available military power tends to be used , and one of the most remarkable features of history since 1945 is that this tendency has not so far repeated itself with atomic weapons .
Let me explain this metaphor in more concrete detail .
Progressive societies ( in this era usually democracies ) tend to expand their presence beyond their geographic boundaries .
This expanded presence calls for new institutions , usually ( like the CIA ) free from democratic accountability .
This accretion of unaccountable power , in what I have elsewhere called the deep state , disrupts the public state ’s system of checks and balances which is the underpinning of sane , deliberative policy .
We might expect of progressive democracies that they would evolve towards more and more rational foreign policies .
But because of the dialectic just described , what we see is the exact opposite – evolution towards foolish and sometimes disastrous engagements .
When Britain became more democratic in the late 19th Century , it also initiated the Boer War , a war very suited to the private imperial needs of Cecil Rhodes , but irrelevant if not deleterious to the interests of the British people .
33
Hitler ’s dreams of a Third Reich , entailing a doomed repeat of Napoleon ’s venture into the heart of Russia , suited the needs of the German industrialists who had financed the Nazis ; but from the outset sane heads of the German military staff could foresee the coming disaster .
For over a half century now , beginning with Vietnam , unaccountable forces have been maneuvering America into unsustainable adventures on the Asian mainland .
We now know that Kennedy did not intend ever to commit U.S. combat troops to Vietnam .
34
But the fatal planning to expand the Vietnam War north of the 17th parallel was authorized in the last week of his aborted presidency , probably without his being aware .
35
When elected , Jimmy Carter was determined to reduce the size and frequency of CIA covert operations .
36
Yet his national security advisor , Zbigniew Brzezinski , initiated maneuvers in Afghanistan that led to the largest CIA covert operation ( and in my view , one of the most deleterious ) of all time .

Does Nicolas Sarkozy have a clue ?
He says the VAT cut had “ absolutely not worked ” :
Britain is cutting taxes .
That will bring them nothing .
Consumption continues to decrease .
However , official figures ( pdf ) flatly contradict this .
They show that the volume of sales actually rose by 1.6 per cent in December , to stand 3.9 per cent higher than last December .
Of course , there are all sorts of ways to quibble with this data – ordinary noise is magnified by uncertainties about seasonal adjustment processes and the fact that the statisticians ’ definition of “ December ” actually stretched to January 3 .
And yes , the CBI and BRC data do show that sales are falling .
But these are smaller samples of retailers than official data , and refer only to the value of sales , which would fall as prices fall .
What ’s more , one retailer in particular seems to be thriving .
John Lewis – one of the few major retailers not run by baboons – says its January trading was “ hugely fruitful . ”
Far from showing that the VAT cut has n’t worked , the data has for me had the opposite effect .
My immediate reaction was that the cut would n’t work , as consumer spending is not terribly price - elastic .
But the data has caused me to have a little ( only little ) doubt about this .
But even if the cut has n’t worked yet – and we ’ll never know the counterfactual – it does not follow that it will bring us nothing .
The move has an income effect .
If shoppers do n’t spend more in response to lower prices , they ’ll have more cash left over .
Which they could spend .
They need n’t have done this already .
It ’s possible , therefore , that even if the VAT cut has n’t worked yet , it might eventually do so .
Sarkozy ’s dogmatism is , therefore , inconsistent with both data and theory .
But I suppose his mind is on other things .
A plane , that appears to be a commercial jet tailed by fighter jets , is a " pre-planned " military flight taking photos of the Statue of Liberty , according to the Federal Aviation Administration .
Reports from some eyewitnesses indicate it may be Air Force One .
" It is pre-planned , pre-coordinated with everyone involved , " said FAA spokesman Jim Peters .
" It 's a military flight over New York to take photos .
" Several lower Manhattan buildings were evacuated as a precaution .
Peters , who stressed it is not an emergency , said the flight is circling the Statue of Liberty and New York City to take photos .
Peters said city officials as well as state government agencies in New York and New Jersey were briefed on the flight in advance .
Numerous people have called the Advance newsroom worried after seeing the low - flying plane on the North Shore .
The incident invoked memories of Sept. 11 , 2001 when two hijacked commercial airliners flew into the World Trade Center towers .
Utah Governor Vetoes Violent Game BillUtah Governor Jon Huntsman vetoed a bill seeking to impose fines on retailers violating their voluntary policy of not selling M- rated games to minors .
The bill , HB 353 , was introduced by Utah House Representative Mike Morley and sought to expand its Truth in Advertising statute to fine or even file suit against retailers who adhere to the Entertainment Software Ratings Board 's voluntary rating system but are found to sell an M - rated game to minors .
Huntsman 's veto overrides the House and Senate , both of which near unanimously supported the measure , passing it with a 70 - 2 majority and a 25 - 4 majority earlier this month , respectively .
" While protecting children from inappropriate materials is a laudable goal , the language of this bill is so broad that it likely will be struck down by the courts as an unconstitutional violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause and / or the First Amendment , " said Huntsman in a letter to Utah President Michael Waddoups .
The Governor noted that the industries who would have been affected by the bill would likely drop their age - appropriate labels rather than risk being fined or sued for false advertising if they violate the self - imposed rule .
"
The unintended consequence of the bill would be that parents and children would have no labels to guide them in determining the age appropriateness of the goods or service , " he explained .
" This would increase children 's potential exposure to something they or their parents would have otherwise determined was inappropriate under the voluntary labeling system now being recognized and embraced by a significant majority of vendors .
Michal Gallagher , president and CEO of the Entertainment Software Association , a trade body representing U.S. game publishers added in a statement , " This is an absolute win for families .
Utah 's parents will benefit from Governor Huntsman 's leadership and thoughtfulness on this issue . "
" His decisive action helps caregivers and prevents businesses from being opened to unproductive , wasteful civil litigation and needless expense , " he continued .
" Parents can be assured that the strength of the ESRB rating system remains intact and continues to serve as a valuable resource and will continue to effectively serve them . "
' We just thought it was jet lag ' , say newlyweds who caught swine flu and brought it to UK
A crucial four - day delay in isolating the British honeymoon couple who contracted swine flu in Mexico meant they came into close contact with hundreds of potential victims .
Iain Askham , 27 , and his wife Dawn , 24 , returned home to Scotland from their dream honeymoon in Cancun feeling drained and under the weather .
Assuming their symptoms were nothing more than a dose of jet lag and a common cold , they waited two days before seeing a doctor .
Iain and Dawn Askham , from Polmont , near Falkirk , are the first UK cases of the swine flu disease after returning from honeymoon in Mexico
Though they were inspected by a health professional last Thursday , it was not until the Saturday - when fears of a global spread of swine flu emerged - that the couple were treated in isolation in hospital .
During those four days the newlyweds came into close contact with hundreds of people , including fellow passengers , work colleagues , relatives and friends in their home town of Polmont , near Falkirk .
Those who they saw face an anxious wait to discover if they have caught the flu strain .
Medical experts say that people who have come into contact with swine flu should be ' all clear ' if they show no symptoms after seven days .
The couple , who are the first confirmed cases of swine flu in Britain , yesterday expressed their ' shock ' at testing positive for the illness .
They remained in isolation in Monklands Hospital , Airdrie , last night .
No decision has been made as to when they will be released .
Happy couple :
The Askhams in their wedding finery
Nine people they have been in contact with since returning home are showing ' mild , cold - like ' symptoms and are being tested for swine flu .
Another 14 cases are under investigation .
Scotland 's chief medical officer said most of the suspected cases were aged in their 20s or 30s , as were most of the victims in Mexico .
This is worrying as the 1918 - 19 ' Spanish flu ' pandemic which killed more than 50 million also disproportionately affected the young and healthy .
Among those who have been tested for the flu strain are workers at the local Boots where Mrs Askham worked as a pharmaceutical dispenser .
One staff member said yesterday : ' When we found out Dawn had contracted swine flu we were really concerned .
' What 's particularly worrying is knowing that a disease which has killed more than 150 people in Mexico has come into this shop .
Those working directly with her have been given medication and have been sent home .
' I just hope Dawn and her husband recover and I hope no one else at Boots gets it . '
First British victims : Iain Askham and wife Dawn at their wedding earlier this month .

Wedding bliss :
They take their first dance after becoming man and wife
Members of Mr Askham 's six - a - side football team FC Mallard have also been caught up in the scare .
Its players had been due to play tonight , but the fixture has been cancelled as a precaution .
Mr Askham , an analyst for a power company , and his wife headed for the popular resort of Cancun after tying the knot on April 4 .
It is thought they contracted swine flu towards the end of their trip .
Both sets of the couple 's parents revealed yesterday how they had been given anti-viral treatment because they had come into close contact with their offspring on their return from Mexico .
In a statement released to the media , the family statement said : ' We are delighted that they continue to make good progress and they remain in good spirits .
' They were both quite shocked that the result was positive for swine flu but are relieved that their symptoms have been very mild .
' We are aware that some close friends have displayed some mild symptoms , having been in close contact with Dawn and Iain , and we understand they are receiving treatment and are being closing monitored .
' This is an incredibly difficult time for us all . '
Tourist hotspot : Thousands of Britons fly to Cancun every year
Neighbours in the pebble - dashed houses in the couple 's street spoke of their shock at the developments .
Rachel Anderson , who lives across the road , said : ' On Saturday one of the neighbours noticed a paramedic on the street and they have not seen the them since .
' It is a shame for them and I feel for their family .
They will be very worried .
It 's not the kind of honeymoon you want . '
Another neighbour , James Carswell , added : ' It was a bit of a shock when I heard this morning .
I heard there was a couple in Monklands Hospital but I had no idea it was someone across the road . '
Second honeymoon couple under ' house arrest '
A second couple who became ill after returning from their honeymoon in Mexico have been quarantined in their home as they wait to find out if they have contracted the swine flu virus .
Pete and Jenny Marshall said they had been told to stay at their house in the Gorgie area of Edinburgh with their friend Gemma O'Brien , who had been looking after the property , until they get test results back in five days .
The couple have stocked up on DVDs and takeaway food for their time indoors .
The newlyweds were in Cancun around the same time as Iain and Dawn Askham from Polmont in Falkirk - the first two Britons confirmed with swine flu , who are now recovering in a Lanarkshire hospital .
Mr and Mrs Marshall and Ms O'Brien are among 23 suspected swine flu cases in Scotland .
The couple consulted doctors after arriving back in the UK last week .
They said they were then told to stay in quarantine for five days , along with Ms O'Brien , 27 , from London , who had been temporarily staying in their house .
Mr Marshall , 37 , a flower wholesaler , told the Daily Record : ' We were feeling great on holiday .
It was the best time of our lives .
' My wife felt ill when we got back with a kind of sickness bug and with the news this weekend , I started to get a bit worried . '
He added : ' Jenny 's feeling a lot better but she 's still not 100 per cent .
Now I 'm starting to get a runny nose and am a bit blocked up . ''

The Beastie Boys was already a rap phenomenon when the group 's raunchy debut Licensed to Ill dropped in 1986 .
But the New York trio became a hip - hop legend after the brilliant , sample - based production of its 1989 follow - up , Paul 's Boutique , put it over the top for good .
Now that 20 years have passed , the Boys are going back to the well with a remastering of that foundational effort .
Until Feb. 10 , the trio is releasing limited - edition CD , vinyl and digital ( including FLAC and Apple lossless ) versions of Paul 's Boutique , complete with videos , swag , posters , commentary and other treats from its official site .
But that 's all just repurposed ear and eye candy .
The true treats still lie within the recording itself .
Two decades after the Dust Brothers - produced epic exploded the limits of sample - based hip - hop and musical production , it sounds as fresh as ever .
Mostly because Paul's Boutique mined pop culture for all it was worth like few releases before or after .
Here are some of the record 's coolest samples and allusions .
" Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun " : From pounding drums lifted from Pink Floyd , Mountain and the Incredible Bongo Band to the introduction of live instrumentation played by the Beasties themselves , this head - banging track sequenced the gene for the trio's future work on the hyper - successful Check Your Head and more .
It also contains some seriously esoteric lyrical allusions : " Three on the tree in the middle of the night " refers to a rival gang staking out James Dean in Rebel Without a Cause .
And the trivia rabbit hole goes deeper :
One of those gang members was a very young Dennis Hopper .
" Eggman " :
This riotous spoof on the serious subject of drive - by violence lifted everything from Cheech and Chong to Aliens , but it 's axis remains Bernard Hermann 's horrific " Shower Theme " from Alfred Hitchcock 's classic Psycho .
One of the most memorable musical numbers ever written , it is ripped out of context and used to support the Beasties ' confessional about egging everything and everyone they want .
" The Sounds of Science " : Few hip - hop acts had sampled the Beatles by 1989 , and not just because they were afraid to death of losing their shirts like they are in these copyfight - happy days .
But the Beasties blew that door down in this multi-movement track , lifting riffs from " Back in the USSR , " " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , " " When I 'm Sixty - Four " and especially Abbey Road 's " The End " without compunction .
It was so ambitious that its kind of sampling may never happen again , especially if the lawyers have anything to say about it .
" B- Boy Bouillabaisse " :
This is one of the Beastie Boys ' most ambitious songs ever , a nine - part epic that careens among many tempos , styles and subjects .
It is probably also one of the most stacked songs ever , featuring more than 25 samples , ranging from the classic ( Johnny Cash 's " Folsom Prison Blues , " Led Zeppelin 's " When the Levee Breaks " ) to the obscure ( Scotty 's " Draw Your Brakes " and Idris Muhammad 's " Loran 's Dance , " whose moody funk bookends the entire album ) .
A stone - cold classic .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The chairman of the New York Post , Rupert Murdoch , personally apologized Tuesday for an editorial cartoon published by the newspaper that drew charges of racism .
This New York Post cartoon by Sean Delonas sparked a debate over race and cartooning .
" Today I want to personally apologize to any reader who felt offended , and even insulted , " said the statement from Murdoch , who is also chairman and chief executive of News Corporation , which owns the paper .
" I can assure you -- without a doubt -- that the only intent of that cartoon was to mock a badly written piece of legislation .
" It was not meant to be racist , but unfortunately , it was interpreted by many as such .
We all hold the readers of the New York Post in high regard , and I promise you that we will seek to be more attuned to the sensitivities of our community . "
The cartoon by Sean Delonas referenced the mauling of a Connecticut woman by a chimpanzee who was later shot and killed by police .
In the caption , one of the officers says , " They 'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill . "
The cartoon was published on Wednesday , a day after President Obama signed the stimulus bill .
The Post issued a statement the following day , apologizing but noting that the cartoon was meant to mock what it called an " ineptly written " stimulus bill .
Many critics said the cartoon played on historically racist images by appearing to compare Obama , the nation 's first black president , to the chimpanzee .
Leaders of the NAACP on Saturday called for the firing of Delonas .
Delonas called the controversy " absolutely friggin ' ridiculous . "
" Do you really think I 'm saying Obama should be shot ?
I did n't see that in the cartoon , " Delonas told CNN .
iReport.com : Share your thoughts on the cartoon , Murdoch 's apology

Trying to buy health insurance on your own and have gallstones ?
You 'll automatically be denied coverage .
Rheumatoid arthritis ?
Automatic denial .
Severe acne ?
Probably denied .
Do you take Metformin , a popular drug for diabetes ?
Denied .
Use the anti-clotting drug Plavix or Seroquel , prescribed for anti-psychotic or sleep problems ?
Forget about it .
This confidential information on some insurers ' practices is available on the Web -- if you know where to look .
What 's more , you can discover that if you lie to an insurer about your medical history and drug use , you will be rejected because data - mining companies sell information to insurers about your health , including detailed usage of prescription drugs .
These issues are moving to the forefront as the Obama administration and Congress gear up for discussions about how to reform the healthcare system so that Americans wo n't be rejected for insurance .
It 's especially timely because growing numbers are looking for individual health insurance after losing their jobs .
On top of that , small businesses are frequently finding health policies too expensive and are dropping coverage , sending even more people shopping for insurance .
The problem is , material available on the Web shows that people who have specific illnesses or use certain drugs can't buy coverage .
" This is absolutely the standard way of doing business , " said Santiago Leon , a health insurance broker in Miami .
Being denied for preexisting conditions is well known , but when a person sees the usually confidential list of automatic denials for himself , " that 's a eureka moment .
That shows you how harsh the system is . "
A 50 - year - old Broward County , Fla. , man , with two long - standing medical conditions , saw the harshness for himself when surfing the Web trying to learn why insurers kept denying him coverage .
He was shocked to find several insurers ' instructions to sales personnel , usually called the Guide to Medical Underwriting and often marked " confidential and proprietary . "
" I think it 's atrocious what 's going on , " he said .
" Basically , they 're taking only the healthy so they can get the fattest profits .
If you really need insurance , then you can't get it . "
The man , a self - employed consultant , did n't want his name or preexisting conditions identified for fear that the information might frighten away potential employers .
Insurers do n't want to talk about the guides .
Sunrise , Fla . -- based Vista , which has its 35 - page " confidential and proprietary " guide tucked away within its website , refused to make executives available for an interview and instead issued a brief statement :
" The medical underwriting guidelines used by VISTA are based on industry standards , comply with all regulations and are subject to review by the Florida Department of Insurance .
VISTA 's Guide to Medical Underwriting is an educational tool intended to assist agents and brokers who are selling VISTA individual plans .
We do not comment on our specific underwriting processes and practices . "
Sandra Foertsch , who sells individual policies , says the fundamental concern of insurers is clear : " They do n't want to buy a claim , " meaning that they would start to collect $ 500 monthly premiums from a person and quickly pay out more than that to doctors and other providers .
Foertsch said she was surprised that any of the guides could be found on the Web .
" I 'd guess someone made a mistake . "
VISTA 's Guide to Medical Underwriting is now on The Miami Herald Web site : media.miamiherald.com/smedia/2 … rod_affiliate.56.pdf

WASHINGTON , March 10 ( UPI ) --
The official in charge of coordinating the U.S. government 's cybersecurity operations has quit , saying the expanding control of the National Security Agency over the nation 's computer security efforts poses " threats to our democratic processes . "
" Even from a security standpoint , " Rod Beckstrom , the head of the Department of Homeland Security 's National Cyber Security Center , told United Press International , " it is unwise to hand over the security of all government networks to a single organization . "
Advertisement
" If our founding fathers were taking part in this debate ( about the future organization of the government 's cybersecurity activities ) there is no doubt in my mind they would support a separation of security powers among different ( government ) organizations , in line with their commitment to checks and balances . "
In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano last week , Beckstrom said the NSA " dominates most national cyber efforts " and " effectively controls DHS cyber efforts through detailees , technology insertions and the proposed move " of the NCSC to an NSA facility at the agency 's Fort Meade , Md. , headquarters .
" I believe this is a bad strategy on multiple grounds , " wrote Beckstrom in the letter , a copy of which was obtained by UPI .
" The intelligence culture is very different than a network operations or security culture .
In addition , threats to our democratic processes are significant if all top - level government network security and monitoring are handled by any one organization . "
Greg Garcia , who was the Bush administration 's first presidentially appointed head of cybersecurity at DHS before leaving last December -- and who worked with Beckstrom for nine months -- told UPI that , while he does not share Beckstrom 's anxiety , " I recognize the cautionary flag he is raising . "

Beckstrom 's resignation -- after just less than a year in office -- comes as the new Obama administration moves to complete a 60 - day review of the way cybersecurity efforts are organized in the U.S. government .
Successive administrations have wrestled with the complex problem of how to delineate and define the roles of various intelligence , military and security agencies in assuring the integrity of the nation 's computer networks -- the vast majority of which are owned and operated by the private sector and depend for their efficacy on their open and accessible , and therefore security - unfriendly , architecture .
" There 's been a lot of duplication and not enough coordination , " Jessica Herrera - Flanigan , a former senior congressional staffer on the House Homeland Security Committee , told UPI .
Garcia said there had been " a fairly collaborative partnership , not just between NSA and DHS , but … with a whole lot of moving parts " and different agencies within the government .
" Clearly , both operationally and technologically , the Intelligence Community is a key element , " he said , using the insider 's terms of art for the sprawling and sometimes fractious collection of spy agencies that serve the U.S. government .
But he said DHS ' role had to be primary " from a legal standpoint and from a trust and privacy standpoint . "
" Unlike the ( Department of Defense ) or the Intelligence Community , DHS has a statutory responsibility to work across all levels of federal , state and local government and the private sector , " he said .
DHS has come under fire for its cybersecurity work , with some criticizing an approach they saw characterized by turf squabbles and overlapping and contradictory lines of authority .
Some , including most recently Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair , have called for a greater role for U.S. intelligence agencies in cybersecurity as a result of the 60 - day review , which is being led by an official in Blair 's office .

Garcia acknowledged what he called " growing pains " in DHS ' cybersecurity efforts but maintained it would be a mistake to shift primary responsibility for the issue away from the department .
" If there were a move , " as a result of the 60 - day review , " to centralize or focus cybersecurity strategy on the Intelligence Community , that would jeopardize the relationship we ( at DHS ) built up over several years with the private sector . "
Another Bush administration DHS official , former Assistant Secretary for Policy Stewart Baker , told UPI that although Beckstrom 's criticism of the NSA 's role was receiving more media attention , " I suspect his frustration was driven as much by the funding and organizational issues as by NSA . "
In his resignation letter , Beckstrom wrote that " the NCSC did not receive appropriate support inside DHS .
…
During the past year , the NCSC received only five weeks of funding , due to various roadblocks engineered within the department and by the Office of Management and Budget . "
" Someone canceled all our contracts for office space , computers and furniture … without telling us , " he told UPI .
" I never had a one - on - one meeting with the new secretary , although I reported directly to her … and last year , there were only five weeks during which we had access to the money to make hires , rent office space and buy equipment we needed . "
" He came from a very different background " than most federal officials , said Herrera - Flanigan of Beckstrom , who was a Silicon Valley entrepreneur and author before joining the department .
" There was a big challenge " for him in negotiating " the dynamics between the different players " in the department , she said .
" Unless he was given the authorities to coordinate across the department , it would have been a problem , " she added .

Beckstrom said the center he ran , set up to oversee and coordinate all federal government cybersecurity activity , " has a role which is much coveted by others in government , so there were natural tensions . "
" Rod is a friend and a remarkable talent , " said Baker .
" He understood Washington much better than most in Silicon Valley .
His inability to move the bureaucracy shows how deep is the divide between government and the tech community . "
Department spokeswoman Amy Kudwa told UPI that DHS " has a strong relationship with the NSA … and is fully engaged with the 60 - day cybersecurity review . …
We look forward to our continued , positive working relationship with all our partners on outreach to the private sector as we strive to further secure our nation 's cyber networks .
" We thank Rod for his service , and regret his departure , " she concluded .
The NSA 's public affairs office referred requests for comment to DHS .
Image Programming in JavaScript : Converting to Monochrome
In part 1 of this series , we looked at how each pixel of an image is composed of three parts ; red , green and blue , and showed how to make histograms to give a summary of each .
Towards the end , I showed that they can be averaged in different ways to create a single histogram .
In this article , we 're going to look at the idea of mixing colors in more depth and show how we can use it to turn color images into monochrome in a variety of ways .
Some Terminology
In the last article , we talked about how each pixel is composed of a red , a green , and a blue component , and how each of those has a value between 0 and 255 .
What I did n't tell you then was that it 's often useful to consider just the red components of pixels in an image , just the green components , or just the blue components .
A channel of an image I 1 is an image I 2 composed entirely of one component of I 1
So when we talk about the red channel of an image , we 're talking about the image that results from simply dropping the green and blue components of each of its pixels .
It 's best to see it in action :
The first image above can be entirely reconstructed from the last three monochrome images , using the first for the red channel , the second for the green channel , and the third for the blue .
By the end of the article , we 'll show the code for the demo that was used to convert the color image above into each of the monochrome ones .
Monochrome in Black and White
Before we discuss converting a color image into monochrome , it will help to understand a bit more about what we mean by monochrome .
Conceptually , we can consider each pixel of a monochrome image to consist of just one byte of information , instead of three bytes for red , green and blue as in a color image .
This byte represents the brightness of a pixel , where 0 is black ( no brightness ) and 255 is white ( no brightness ) .
The values in between represent the grays , from the dark low numbers to the light high colors .
Since monochrome images are composed of values other than ( r , g , b ) , let 's update the working definition of a digital image that we used last time :
A Digital Image is a sequence of pixels , each of which is composed of one or more channels .
The value of each channel represents its strength in that pixel .
So a monochrome image consists of only one channel , that representing the brightness of each pixel .
The Real World Intrudes
We 've got a nice new mental model of a monochrome image , but the real world , as it tends to do , will complicate matters .
We 're working with color images on the < canvas > element , which means that each pixel needs to be composed of red , green , and blue .
In order to display a monochrome image on a < canvas > , we 'll need to convert each pixel from one channel , brightness , to three .
A convenient property of RGB images makes this transformation easy : any pixel made up of equal parts red , green , and blue will be gray .
Therefore , to convert an image from monochrome to RGB , we simply use the brightness channel of each pixel in the monochrome image as all three channels in the RGB image .
Mixing it Up
Reversing the process , to create monochrome images from color ones , offers us a few more options .
For every pixel , our task is to take three channels and condense them into one .
The obvious thing to do is to simply average them ; and indeed , this is exactly what happens by default in most photo editing programs when you convert an image to monochrome .
There 's no reason that we need to limit ourselves to that transformation , though .
We should consider other options because the average often produces flat , uninteresting pictures .
Instead , we can mix the channels any way we want to produce the most interesting result possible .
I 've put up a demo where you can play with the mixture of colors .
Simply put numbers into each of the three inputs at the bottom of the page and hit " desaturate " to create a monochrome image where the channels have been weighted proportionally to the numbers you 've entered .
The histogram below the desaturate button will show you the effects of your mix .
Play with the values to find the result you find most pleasing , and notice how different the images that result from each mix can be .
Show Me The Goods
Here 's the important parts of the code in the demo , with the fiddly bits stripped out :
function desaturate ( rweight , gweight , bweight ) { // normalize the color weights var scale = 1 / ( rweight + gweight + bweight ) ; rweight *= scale ; gweight *= scale ; bweight *= scale ; each_pixel ( image_data , function ( r , g , b ) { var brightness = r * rweight + g * gweight + b * bweight ; //replace the r , g , and b values of the pixel with " brightness " return [ brightness , brightness , brightness ] ; } ) ; } //red channel only : desaturate ( 1 , 0 , 0 ) ; // green channel only : desaturate ( 0 , 1 , 0 ) ; // blue channel only : desaturate ( 0 , 0 , 1 ) ; // my favorite mix : desaturate ( 5 , 1 , 4 ) ;
First we convert the color weights into percentages , then we multiply each component of each pixel times its weight to arrive at a new value for the pixel to take .
Finally , we use the brightness value we 've calculated as the value for all three channels to render the image in grayscale .
Conclusion
In this article , we 've extended our definition of an image to include images with channels other than just red , green , and blue .
We learned how to convert monochrome images for display in RGB , and looked at a couple different ways to convert back from RGB to monochrome .
Finally , we looked at code to do the conversions we 'd spent the whole article talking about .
Hopefully you have a pretty good grasp on what an image on a < canvas > is by now .

If ever you think the Anglican church of Nigeria cannot get more incoherently bigoted about gay people , you 're wrong .
The latest proof comes in a position paper ( pdf ) submitted by the church to a parliamentary committee which is planning a law against gay marriage .
Homosexuality is already illegal in Nigeria , of course , as is gay marriage .
But the proposed law would provide three years in jail for gay couples who got married , and five years for any witnesses .
Earlier drafts have proposed long jail sentences , also , for anyone who argues in favour of gay marriage .
If ever a law were a simple incitement to hate , this is it , and here is Archbishop Akinola of the Church of Nigeria cheering them on :
Same sex marriage , apart from being ungodly , is unscriptural , unnatural , unprofitable , unhealthy , un-cultural , un -African and un-Nigerian .
It is a perversion , a deviation and an aberration that is capable of engendering moral and social holocaust in this country .
It is also capable of existincting [ sic ] mankind and as such should never be allowed to take root in Nigeria .
Outlawing it is to ensure the continued existence of this nation .
The need for doing this is urgent , compelling , and imperative .
His statement also suggests that the penalties in the law be changed around , so that the happy couple be sentenced to up five years in jail , and individual witnesses to up to three years .
If witnesses were to be charged collectively , the archbishop suggests , there should be a mandatory sentence for all of them of one year in jail .
Compare and contrast the resolution of the Anglican Primates , meeting at Dromantine in 2005 :
We continue unreservedly to be committed to the pastoral support and care of homosexual people .
The victimisation or diminishment of human beings whose affections happen to be ordered towards people of the same sex is anathema to us .
We assure homosexual people that they are children of God , loved and valued by him , and deserving of the best we can give of pastoral care and friendship .
Archbishop Akinola also signed up to that statement , which tells you all you need to know about his sincerity .
The contrast between the two statements also tells you a great deal about Archbishop Rowan Williams 's chances of holding the Anglican Communion even notionally together , if after nearly four years of discussion and , now , professional mediation , Akinola still comes out with this kind of hate speech .
There is one further irony .
The preamble of the law , which Akinola so enthusiastically supports , states that " only marriage contracted between a man and a woman under Islamic law , customary law , and marriage act is recognised in Nigeria . "
So it turns out that Archbishop Akinola , the scourge of soft western liberals who fail to resist Islam , is a supporter of sharia law – at least when it is practised in Nigeria .
“ FOR these ten marks I sold my virtue , ” were the words a Berliner noticed written on a banknote in 1923 .
He was buying a box of matches , all the note was worth by then .
That was in the early days .
By November 5th , a loaf of bread cost 140 billion marks .
Workers were paid twice a day , and given half - hour breaks to rush to the shops with their satchels , suitcases or wheelbarrow , to buy something , anything , before their paper money halved in value yet again .
By mid-November , when a new currency was issued , prices had added twelve noughts since the first world war began in 1914 .
Currencies have collapsed , and inflation turned hyper - , in other places : in Shanghai awaiting Maoist takeover in 1949 , in Argentina in 1989 , when , in July alone , prices rose 197 % .
But Germany 's was the most spectacular bout of inflation ever to hit an advanced economy ; and none has had more awful results .
It was not the main reason for Hitler 's rise , but it was as the leader of a failed mini -coup during the crisis that most Germans first heard of him .
And the anger of those who had lost their all fed Nazism 's growth .
The origins of the hyperinflation lay in the war , and the readiness of Germany 's legislature to let the authorities suspend the individual 's right to convert banknotes into gold .
The central bank was also authorised to use government and commercial paper as part of the reserves it was required to hold against newly issued notes .
This freed the government to finance the war by running the printing presses , with the usual effect : prices rose .
By the end of 1918 the mark had fallen more than 50 % against the dollar .
The government continued to run a huge deficit .
From 1919 to 1923 , taxes never exceeded 35 % of expenditure .
The gap was covered by heroic money - printing .
The public finances , bad enough anyway , were worsened by the Allies ' demands for reparations , enough not just to compensate for damage done but to pay the pensions of Allied combatants .
Even ignoring the part due to be paid in some bonds of dubious worth , the total was $ 12.5 billion — a huge amount for the time , about half Britain 's GDP .
How could it be found ?
The Allies did not want to see German exports boom , nor were they united in encouraging payment in labour to rebuild Europe .
So — roll the presses .
Notes in circulation increased from 29.2 billion marks in November 1918 to 497 quintillion ( 497 plus 18 noughts ) five years later .
As early as 1919 , when the peace treaty was signed , Keynes had warned that the settlement imposed on Germany would ruin it .
By early 1922 , even the Times , much given to berating Germany for allegedly failing to meet its promises to disarm , was warning that the Allied demands would lead to
further production of paper marks on a massive scale .
In the present state of German finances , that would mean a big step on the way to Moscow .
To Auschwitz , in the event , but the analysis of money - printing was sound enough .
In vain : the victorious powers shut their ears .
Later that year , the German government defaulted on its reparations payments .
In response , in January 1923 French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr , Germany 's industrial heartland .
The direct economic cost was huge ; the Ruhr provided 85 % of Germany 's coal .
But , besides that , the government backed a campaign of passive resistance — in effect , a general strike .
To pay the 2 m workers involved , it printed more money .
This was enough to tip the economy over the edge .
Prices roared up .
So did unemployment , modest as 1923 began .
As October ended , 19 % of metal - workers were officially out of work , and half of those left were on short time .
Feeble attempts had been made to stabilise prices .
Some German states had issued their own would - be stable currency : Baden 's was secured on the revenue of state forests , Hanover 's convertible into a given quantity of rye .
The central authorities issued what became known as “ gold loan ” notes , payable in 1935 .
Then , on November 15th , came the Rentenmark , worth 1,000 billion paper marks , or just under 24 American cents , like the gold mark of 1914 .
Prices quite soon stabilised , but the damage was done .
Millions had seen their life savings evaporate , and were ready later to believe that Germany had been stabbed in the back by a conspiracy of Jews , international financiers and local appeasers .
Elias Canetti , a German writer , likened the Nazis ' treatment of Jews to the great inflation : depreciation to the point where they could be “ destroyed with impunity by the million ” .
He strained the analogy .
But he was right that a debauched currency was one reason why a whole country could lose its virtue .

Part one
What is Marxism ?
As in private life one distinguishes between what a man thinks and says of himself and what he really is and does , still more in historical struggles must one distinguish the phrases and fancies of the parties from their real organism and their real interests , their conception of themselves from their reality .
Karl Marx , The 18th Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte
" All I know , " said Marx , " is that I 'm not a Marxist . "
What in the 1870s was a neat dialectical joke has since been transformed into a major political problem .
The one hundred years since Marx 's death have seen the emergence of innumerable divergent and conflicting " Marxisms " .
The centenary of that death seems an appropriate moment to attempt to untangle this particular knot , to establish the criteria for accepting claims to the title of Marxism and thus to answer the question " What is the genuine Marxist tradition ? "
But first let us be clear about the dimensions of the problem .
It is not just that people who call themselves Marxists hold different views on certain questions ( say " the tendency of the rate of profit to fall " or the class nature of the Soviet Union ) : that is something to be expected in any living democratic movement .
The real problem is that frequently the " Marxists " are to be found imprisoning , killing , and making war on each other , and , more fundamentally , that in all the great social conflicts of our age self - proclaimed " Marxists " are to be found on opposing sides of the revolutionary barricades .
Think of Plekhanov and Lenin in 1917 , of Kautsky and Luxemburg in 1919 , of the Communists and the POUM in Barcelona in 1936 , of Hungary in 1956 and of Poland in 1981 .
It is this which compels us to pose the question of what defines Marxism .
There are , of course , some who would reject the question altogether , denying that the search for a " true " Marxism has any meaning and simply accepting as Marxist all those who claim the label .
On the one hand this is a convenient response for the bourgeoisie and its cruder ideologists , in that it permits them to condemn all Marxism and Marxists by association with Joe Stalin and Pol Pot , the butcher of Cambodia .
On the other hand it also suits the academic Marxologists , enabling them to produce numerous profitable " guides to the Marxists " , offering cribs to every school of thought from the Austro - Marxists to the Althusserians .
Such an approach is essentially contemplative .
Action , especially political action , requires decisiveness in theory as well as practice .
Marxists who want to change the world , not just to make a living from interpreting it , have no choice but to face the problem and to draw a dividing line between the genuine and the false .
One way of trying to draw such a dividing line might be to identify Marxism with the works of Marx and to measure the followers simply by their faithfulness to the word of the master .
Again this is a scholastic , even religious , approach .
It fails to take account of the fact that if Marxism is , as Engels said , " not a dogma , but a guide to action " , then it must be a living , developing theory , capable of continuous growth , which has to analyse and respond to an ever changing reality  a reality which has in fact changed enormously since Marx 's day .
Even if , for historical reasons , we name the theory after the individual who did most to establish it , we cannot , at the price of total impotence , reduce or confine it to what that individual himself wrote .
As Trotsky observed , " Marxism is above all a method of analysis  not analysis of texts but analysis of social relations . " [ 1 ]
This quotation from Trotsky points in the direction of an alternative solution to the problem  one adopted by Hungarian Marxist George Lukacs .
In History and Class Consciousness Lukacs asked " What is Orthodox Marxism ? " and answered as follows :
Orthodox Marxism ... does not imply the uncritical acceptance of the results of Marx 's investigations .
It is not the " belief " in this or that thesis , nor the exegesis of a " sacred " book .
On the contrary , orthodoxy refers exclusively to method . [ 2 ]
This is a much more serious proposal in that it takes account of the need for development , and it contains an important element of truth in that the dialectical method is without doubt central to Marxism .
Nonetheless it is inadequate as a solution to our problem .
It is not possible to establish such a rigid demarcation between Marx 's method and his other analyses , nor to reduce the essential contents of Marxism solely to method . [ 3 ]
This is shown by the very example Lukacs gives to illustrate his proposition .
Let us assume [ writes Lukacs ] for the sake of argument that recent research had disproved once and for all every one of Marx 's individual theses .
Even if this were to be proved , every serious " orthodox " Marxist would still be able to accept all such modern findings without reservation and hence dismiss all of Marx 's theses in toto  without having to renounce his orthodoxy for a single moment . [ 4 ]
Quite the contrary is the case .
If , for example , in defiance of Marx 's whole analysis of the dynamic of capitalist development , capitalism were to evolve into a new form of world bureaucratic society without internal competition and contradictions , which precluded the possibility of either socialism or barbarism , then Marxism would clearly be refuted , and the proponents of such a perspective 
Max Weber , Bruno Rizzi and James Burnham  would be vindicated .
As Trotsky concluded when considering this hypothetical perspective , " nothing else would remain except only to recognise that the socialist programme , based on the internal contradictions of capitalist society , ended as a Utopia . " [ 5 ]
What the foregoing argument might seem to suggest is that Marxism should be defined as a method combined with certain essential analyses and propositions .
But this apparent solution in reality only pushes the problem one stage back .
By what criterion can it be decided which analyses and propositions are fundamental and which are secondary ?
Moreover such an approach bears with it the danger of theoretical sectarianism , of defining Marxism as " the correct line on everything " , and so arriving at the position that Luxemburg was not a Marxist when she disagreed with Lenin about the party , that Lenin was not a Marxist when he maintained the bourgeois nature of the Russian Revolution , and so on .
How then can we break out of this circle ?
Not by first seeking to extract from Marx 's work certain theses , but by using Marxist theory to view Marxism as a totality .

1 The class basis of Marxism
For Marx
" It is not social consciousness that determines social being , but social being that determines social consciousness . " [ 6 ]
Consequently the understanding and definition of any philosophy , theory , or ideology is first and foremost a matter of disclosing the " social being " that constitutes its foundation .
Thus Marx treats religion in general as " the self - consciousness and self - awareness of man who either has not yet attained to himself or has already lost himself again . " [ 7 ]
" This state , this society , " he writes , " produces religion 's inverted attitude to the world , because they are an inverted world themselves . " [ 8 ]
He reveals the earthly family as the secret of the Holy Family . [ 9 ]
Similarly Engels analyses early Christianity as " the religion of slaves and emancipated slaves ... of peoples subjugated or dispersed by Rome . " [ 10 ]
In the Communist Manifesto Marx defines the various existing schools of " socialism " directly by reference to the class interests they represent , giving us in turn feudal socialism , petty - bourgeois socialism , bourgeois socialism and so on .
And , at a later date , Trotsky showed that the key to fascist ideology as well as the fascist movement lay in the class position of the petty - bourgeois crushed between capital and labour .
These examples can be multiplied indefinitely ; the point is that the same method of analysis must be applied to Marxism itself  and this of course was the procedure of Marx and Engels themselves .
Engels begins Anti-Dühring with the assertion that " Modern socialism is , in its content , primarily the product of the recognition , on the one hand , of the class antagonisms prevailing in modern society between proprietors and non-proprietors , between capitalists and wage - workers , and on the other , of the anarchy ruling in production . " [ 11 ]
We can complete Engels ' formulation by adding that Marxism is the recognition of these contradictions from the point of view of the proletariat , the industrial working class .
As Marx puts it in The Poverty of Philosophy : " Just as the economists are the scientific representatives of the bourgeois class , so the Socialists and Communists are the theoreticians of the proletarian class . " [ 12 ]
And in the Communist Manifesto : " The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented , or discovered , by this or that would - be universal reformer .
They merely express , in general terms , actual relations springing from an existing class struggle , from an historical movement going on under our very eyes . " [ 13 ]
Also in the Communist Manifesto is the following immensely important passage :
The Communists are distinguished from the other working - class parties by this only : 1 . In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries , they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat , independently of all nationality .
2 . In the various stages of the development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through , they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole . [ 14 ]
This amplifies and clarifies the definition of Marxism as the theory of the working class , establishing that what is involved is the articulation of the interests not of this or that section of the class but of the working class as a whole regardless of nationality  and today we might add of race or of sex .
It thereby serves as the starting point for the identification and criticism of opportunism , at the root of which lies the sacrifice of the overall interests of the class to the temporary interests of particular national , local or craft groups within it .
What we have proposed is not only a social but also an historical definition .
Such a definition also explains why Marxism arose when it did .
Exploitation and oppression existed for thousands of years and capitalism in its early forms for centuries , but Marxism could not emerge until capitalism had developed the productive forces , and therewith the proletariat , to the point where the latter 's potential to overthrow capitalism could be perceived .
We should note that Marx arrived at Marxism only on the basis of his contact with revolutionary workers ' circles in Paris in late 1843 .
It was then that Marx discovered " the formation of a class with radical chains " , and first declared his allegiance to the proletariat .
When the proletariat " proclaims the dissolution of the hitherto existing world order , " wrote Marx at the time , " it merely declares the secret of its own existence , since it is in fact the dissolution of this order . " [ 15 ]
This approach to the origins of Marxism differs markedly from that offered by Kautsky and taken up by Lenin in What Is To Be Done ?
as part of his argument that socialism must be introduced into the working class " from without " .
Kautsky wrote that " socialism and the class struggle arise side by side and not one out of the other ... the vehicle of science is not the proletariat but the bourgeois intelligentsia " [ 16 ] and Lenin argued that " in Russia , the theoretical doctrine of social democracy arose altogether independently of the spontaneous growth of the working class movement ; it arose as a natural and inevitable outcome of the development of thought among the revolutionary socialist intelligentsia . " [ 17 ]
I have attempted elsewhere [ 18 ] to refute this position , to show its harmful consequences , and to demonstrate that it was characteristic of Lenin 's thought only up to his experience of the revolutionary working class in 1905 .
Suffice it to say here that the Kautsky - Lenin theory is an example of the contemplative materialism criticised by Marx in the Theses on Feuerbach , and that , in the Communist Manifesto , Marx offers his own explanation of the role of the socialist intelligentsia .
A section of the ruling class , " in particular a portion of the bourgeois ideologists who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole " , cuts itself adrift and " goes over to the proletariat " [ 19 ]
Clearly one cannot " go over " to a class which is not in existence and which has not yet made its presence felt in the battle  as was the case with the Russian working class at the time Kautsky and Lenin were considering .
Finally , when considering the class basis of Marxism , it is necessary to emphasise that Marxism is not just the theory of the proletariat 's resistance to capitalism and its struggle against capitalism ; it is also , and above all , the theory of its victory .
This point was made by Marx himself when he disclaimed all credit for discovering classes and class struggle :
Long before me bourgeois historians had described the historical development of this class struggle and bourgeois economists the economic anatomy of the classes .
What I did that was new was to prove : ( 1 ) that the existence of classes is only bound up with particular historical phases in the development , ( 2 ) that the class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat , ( 3 ) that this dictatorship itself only constitutes the transition to the abolition of all classes and to a classless society . [ 20 ]
And the same point is made with even greater force by Lenin when , in The State and Revolution , he insists that " A Marxist is solely someone who extends the recognition of the class struggle to the recognition of the dictatorship of the proletariat ...
This is the touchstone on which the real understanding and recognition of Marxism should be tested " . [ 21 ]
Lenin 's assertion was directed above all at Kautsky , who had spent decades presenting himself as the last word in Marxist orthodoxy yet turned his back on the actual workers ' revolution in Russia .
However , it retains all its relevance today when there is no shortage of intellectuals " interested in " , or even adhering to , Marxism as a method of interpreting society but who show no interest at all in the theory , still less the practice , of the struggle for workers ' power .
Thus far , analysis of Marxism as the theory of the proletariat has shown that this conception contains three elements ; Marxism as the theory of the common interests of the entire class internationally ; Marxism as the product of the birth of the modern proletariat and the developments of its struggle against capitalism ; Marxism as the theory of the victory of that class .
The definition that most succinctly summarises these elements is that Marxism is the theory of the international proletarian revolution .

2 The scientific status of Marxism
To many people the definition of Marxism as the theory of a particular social class is incompatible with its claims to be scientific .
The argument runs both ways .
On the one hand there are those who recognise Marxism to be based on a definite social group and consequently deny its status as science .
The foremost representative of this position is the sociologist Karl Mannheim . [ 22 ]
On the other hand there are those who proclaim Marxism as science and therefore deny that it derives from the standpoint of the proletariat .
The most important contemporary proponent of this view is Althusser , for whom such a definition reduces Marxism to " the level of ideology " .
These objections are the product of a double confusion : first as to the nature of natural science , second as to the relationship between natural science and social science .
Natural science is seen as providing exact , " objective " and non-socially determined knowledge , and therefore is held to be the model for " objective " social science .
But this view of natural science is itself a social product .
In the last analysis it derives from the alliance between science and the bourgeoisie which was necessary for the battle against feudalism and for the development of modern manufacturing .
Just as the bourgeoisie depicted the laws of capitalism as natural and eternal so it depicted the achievements of science as absolute truth .
The history of science , however , shows it to consist of a series of provisional relative truths which are produced under the stimulus of developing practical human needs , and which in turn demonstrate their truth in practice , by making possible the performance of definite tasks . [ 23 ]
Natural science is therefore not absolute but historical and changing .
All social science , including Marxism , is , of course , subject to these same limitations , but there is also a fundamental difference between natural and social science .
Natural science possesses an objectivity [ 24 ] which is not available to social science .
There are two main reasons for this .
Firstly , knowledge is always a relationship between knower and known , between subject and object .
In natural science the object of knowledge , nature , exists outside of human beings .
Society however is human beings , the ensemble of human relations . [ 25 ]
Nature and the laws of nature are not the creation of humanity .
Society and social laws are .
The world of nature can be altered by men and women but only on the basis of natural laws which can not be altered .
Social laws however can be changed .
The consequence of these differences is that all human beings stand in roughly the same relationship to the laws of nature but in markedly different relationships to the laws of society .
Thus , as a result of the law of gravity , a worker and a capitalist dropped from the Leaning Tower of Pisa will strike the ground at the same speed and with the same consequences .
The law of value however does not have the same consequences for the worker and the capitalist  it produces poverty for one and riches for the other .
Which is why the idea of " proletarian " as opposed to " bourgeois " natural science is a piece of Stalinist nonsense . [ 26 ]
But " to expect [ social ] science to be impartial in a society of wage - slavery is as silly and naive as to expect impartiality from employers on the question of whether the worker 's wages should be increased by decreasing the profits of capital " . [ 27 ]
Secondly , the purpose of knowledge is to assist in changing reality .
This is equally true of natural and social science .
The bourgeoisie has an interest in changing , indeed is continually compelled to change , the natural world in order to accumulate capital .
It therefore needs natural science .
In relation to society , however , the predominant interest of the bourgeoisie is not to change it but to preserve it as it is .
Consequently the basic need of the bourgeoisie is not for social knowledge but for social apologetics , for ideology . [ 28 ]
Thus much of what passes for bourgeois social science is not science of any description .
It is not practical or operational even for the bourgeoisie  but simply justification and mystification .
Good examples are the marginal utility theory of value in economics and the pluralist theory of power in politics .
Of course the bourgeoisie does need to change society within certain limits , the limits of the capitalist mode of production , and so bourgeois social science does yield a certain limited amount of real knowledge  knowledge which can also be used against capitalism .
But this knowledge is always set within , and cramped and distorted by , a theoretical framework which obstructs real understanding of society as a whole .
The only class which is both interested in , and capable of , arriving at an understanding of society as a totality , is the class that is interested in and capable of changing it as a totality  namely the proletariat .
As Marx put it , " The existence of revolutionary ideas in a particular period presupposes the existence of a revolutionary class . " [ 29 ]
Thus the class basis of Marxism , far from compromising its standing as science , is precisely what makes its scientific character possible .
A further argument against this view , really an extension of the argument considered above , is that it wrongly narrows down and limits the applicability of Marxism .
This argument has been advanced by the older Lukacs .
In his 1924 study of Lenin Lukacs began with the statement that " Historical materialism is the theory of proletarian revolution " , [ 30 ] but in his 1967 Postscript he dismisses this proposition as a product of " the prejudices of the time " and protests at such an attempt " to reduce to a single dimension and to cramp the real and methodological wealth  the social universality  of historical materialism , by such a definition . " [ 31 ]
This objection is false because the definition of Marxism as a class theory in no way restricts it to the analysis of just the proletarian struggle or even just capitalist society ( though that is of course its central task ) .
It is perfectly possible to analyse the whole of human history up to the present from the standpoint of the proletariat .
Witness , for example , Engels ' article on " The Part Played by Labour in the Transition from Ape to Man " .
The central idea of this article is that labour " is the prime basic condition of all human existence and ... that , in a sense ... labour created man himself " . [ 32 ]
This could be arrived at only on the basis of an understanding of the labour of the modern working class [ 33 ] , and indeed was so derived for it is present in embryo in the 1844 Manuscripts and The German Ideology [ 34 ] , before Marx and Engels had conducted any anthropological researches and before Darwin .
Moreover , in this same article Engels does not fail to point out the political conclusion that follows from his proposition  the necessity of " a complete revolution in our hitherto existing mode of production " . [ 35 ]
The " social universality " demanded by Lukacs is possessed by Marxism precisely because it is based on the interests of the proletariat , the universal class  universal in the sense that it is the bearer of the future and liberation of all humanity , and in the sense that , needing neither a class above it to rule it nor a class below it to exploit , it can become all humanity .
Lukacs ' objection signifies not his broadened or deepened conception of Marxism but simply his own abandonment of a revolutionary class position through his absorption by Stalinism .

3 From practice to theory
To complete the argument that the essence of Marxism is that it is the theoretical expression of the proletarian revolution , it is necessary to demonstrate the connections leading from the conditions of existence of the proletariat and the tasks confronting it in the struggle ( the social practice that is the proletariat ) to the main propositions of Marxist theory .
To do this comprehensively and rigorously is beyond the reach of this small book , all we can do is to trace the outline of some of the most important of these connections .
Let us begin with those aspects of Marxism that might be called its political principles and programme .
Firstly , internationalism .
There can be no doubt as to the central role played by internationalism in the thought of Marx , but Marxist internationalism owes nothing to an abstract moral ( in reality bourgeois liberal ) commitment to " the international brotherhood of peoples " . [ 36 ]
Rather it is grounded in the existence of the proletariat as an international class , created by the capitalist world market , and engaged in an international struggle against that system .
The statement in the Communist Manifesto that " The working men have no country " , and that " national differences and antagonisms between people are daily more and more vanishing , owing to the development of the bourgeoisie , to freedom of commerce , to the world market , to uniformity in the modes of production and to the conditions of life corresponding thereto " , has often been criticised as an exaggeration or an outright error , in the light of the continuing hold of nationalist ideology over the proletariat .
Nonetheless it remains true at two levels .
First as a statement of tendency rather than accomplished fact .
Secondly as a statement about the proletariat relative to other social classes .
The modes of production ( and the cultures ) of Japan , Brazil and Britain have infinitely more in common today than they did a century ago .
In relation to the peasantry it was not even possible to speak seriously of international consciousness or organisation .
The internationalism of the bourgeoisie , despite its creation of the world economy and its plethora of international organisations , remains qualitatively inferior to the international potential of the proletariat .
The highest level it can rise to is the international bloc or alliance set against rival international blocs and even these are continually disrupted by national antagonisms .
The basic characteristic of Marxist internationalism is , as we have noted , the priority of the whole ( the interests of the world working class ) over the part .
To make this more concrete : a revolutionary worker who has never left his home town , speaks only his native language , and yet opposes his " own " government in time of war is far more of an internationalist than the learned professor who has travelled the world , speaks half a dozen languages , is steeped in the knowledge of different cultures , and yet in time of war supports his own government .
Again , because of the priority of the whole , Marxist internationalism is perfectly compatible with recognition of the right to national self - determination and support for national liberation struggles , if the interests of the international class demand it . [ 37 ]
Secondly , take the principle of state ownership of the means of production .
To many ( especially the bourgeoisie , but also many would - be Marxists ) this has been seen as the fundamental principle of Marxism and of socialism in general .
Usually , when those who take this view are socialists , they reason as follows .
Capitalism , which equals private ownership , is irrational and unjust , it causes economic crises , poverty , war etc .
If production were state - owned and there was state planning of the economy , it would be an altogether better , more rational , arrangement and these evils would be ended .
The struggle of the proletariat is then seen as a means by which this end can be achieved .
Should an alternative means to this end present itself , say peasant guerrilla war or parliamentary legislation , then that makes no real difference .
Marxist reasoning is quite different .
The proletariat is locked in class struggle against the bourgeoisie which exploits and oppresses it .
The only way it can win that battle and emancipate itself is to defeat the bourgeoisie politically and take possession of the means of production .
This it can do only by creating its own state .
This is how the question is presented in the Communist Manifesto :
We have seen above , that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class , to win the battle of democracy .
The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest , by degrees , all capital from the bourgeoisie , to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State , i.e. of the proletariat organised as the ruling class ; and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible .
For the state socialists state ownership is the end , the working class the means .
For Marxism the emancipation of the class is the end , state ownership the means .
This difference  the " two souls of socialism " as Hal Draper has called it  has been of immense significance in the past hundred years and we shall return to it repeatedly .
The ultimate aim of Marxism  the classless society has of course been an age - old human aspiration .
What distinguishes Marxism is that it derives the classless society , as a realistic possibility , from the development of the proletariat , " a class which owing to its whole position in society , can only free itself by abolishing altogether all class rule , all servitude and all exploitation . " [ 38 ]
To cite the Communist Manifesto again :
All preceding classes that got the upper hand , sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation .
The proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation .
They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify ; their mission is to destroy all previous securities for , and insurances of , individual property .
In terms of theory the transition from capitalism to communism  the dictatorship of the proletariat  was considered to be ( as we have noted ) merely (! ) the extension of the proletarian class struggle to the point of victory .
However , the specific form of this dictatorship was discovered neither by Marx nor any other Marxist theorist , but by revolutionary workers themselves .
First by the Parisian workers in the Commune of 1871 , who showed that rather than taking over the existing state machine it was necessary to smash it , and whose actions indicated the first principles of workers ' democracy  payment of all officials at workers ' wages , election and recall of all delegates , replacement of the standing army by the armed workers , etc .
Second by the workers of Petrograd ( and then all Russia ) who created the organisational form uniquely suited to the expression of workers ' power  the soviet or workers ' council .
The great merit of the soviet , it should be noted , is that it is based not on the worker as individual citizen in a geographical area , but on the worker as part of a collective in the workplace , the unit of production , and that it arises within capitalism as a natural development of the workers ' struggle against capitalism  its historical point of departure was an enlarged strike committee .
It should also be noted that Marxist theory on this question ( Marx 's The Civil War in France , Lenin 's The State and Revolution , Gramsci 's articles in Ordine Nuovo ) is a direct generalisation of the most advanced experience of the class .
Now we must turn from the programme of Marxism to its theoretical foundations : the materialist conception of history and the critical analysis of capitalism .
What is the basis of historical materialism ?
This question can be approached analytically ( by considering the concepts and propositions of this theory ) or historically ( by tracing its genesis and development in the works of Marx ) .
Of these the analytic approach is more important as the historical genesis of a theory might include all sorts of accidental factors and detours .
Let us begin with the question of materialism versus idealism .
Idealism  belief in the priority of mind ( " spirit " , " ideals " , " God " , etc. ) over matter  and the idealist conception of history ( history as determined by the development of ideas , consciousness , etc. ) has , itself , a material basis .
It lies in the division between mental and manual labour and the emergence of a ruling class freed from manual labour , in other words living off the labour of others .
Division of labour only becomes truly such from the moment when a division of material and mental labour appears .
( The first form of ideologists , priests , is concurrent . )
From this moment onwards consciousness can really flatter itself that it is something other than consciousness of existing practice , that it really represents something without representing something real ; from now on consciousness is in a position to emancipate itself from the world and to proceed in the formation of " pure " theory , theology , philosophy , ethics , etc . [ 39 ]
By contrast materialism is the " natural " theory of a producing class struggling for its emancipation . [ 40 ]
But of course we cannot simply identify historical materialism with materialism .
Materialism preceded Marxism by more than two thousand years and in the eighteenth century materialism was the standpoint of the rising bourgeoisie .
What distinguishes Marxist materialism from this bourgeois materialism ?
Marx expressed it thus :
The chief defect of all hitherto existing materialism ( that of Feuerbach included ) is that the thing , reality , sensuousness , is conceived only in the form of the object of contemplation , but not as sensuous human activity , practice , not subjectively . [ 41 ]
In other words bourgeois materialism is mechanical .
It treats human beings as passive , as mere products or effects of material circumstances  as objects .
In doing so it reflects the actual position of men and women in capitalist society  the worker as an appendage of the machine , labour as a " factor " of production equivalent to other factors ( land , machines , etc. ) , living labour as subordinate to and a " part " of dead labour .
Mechanical materialism , however , is incapable of complete consistency ; in consistent form it would be a total determinism and fatalism and it is impossible to act in the world on this basis .
Therefore it always contains a more or less hidden exemption clause for itself whereby idealism re-enters through the back door , as the " knowledge " , " science " , or sometimes " will " of the elite :
The materialist doctrine concerning the changing of circumstances and upbringing forgets that circumstances are changed by men and that it is essential to educate the educator himself .
This doctrine must , therefore , divide society into two parts , one of which is superior to society . [ 42 ]
Marx overcame this antinomy through the concept of practice .
" The coincidence of the changing of circumstances and of human activity or self - changing can be conceived and rationally understood only as revolutionary practice . " [ 43 ]
The model for this concept of practice was human labour , the means whereby humanity shapes and changes nature , and creates itself .
Hegel 's outstanding achievement , Marx writes :
... is , first , that Hegel grasps the self - creation of man as a process ... and that he therefore grasps the nature of labour , and conceives objective man ( true because real man ) as the result of his own labour . [ 44 ]
But , Marx goes on , " Labour as Hegel understands and recognises it is abstract mental labour . " [ 45 ]
Marx was able to go beyond Hegel , to stand him on his feet and recognise labour as concrete practical activity as the basis of man and history ( " this simple fact hitherto concealed by an overgrowth of ideology " [ 46 ] ) because , and only because , he had before him in the proletariat the first class of immediate producers able to transform society and become its master .
It is this conception of the role of labour , of production , that constitutes the methodological and empirical point of departure of the Marxist theory of history .
From it are developed the key concepts of " forces of production " , " relations of production " and " mode of production " which in turn culminate in the theory of the social revolution :
In the social production of their life , men enter into definite relations that are indispensable and independent of their will , relations of production which correspond to a definite stage of development of their material productive forces .
The sum total of these relations of production constitutes the economic structure of society , the real foundation , on which rises a legal and political superstructure and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness ...
At a certain stage of their development , the material productive forces of society come in conflict with the existing relations of production , or what is but a legal expression for the same thing  with the property relations within which they have been at work hitherto .
From forms of development of the productive forces these relations turn into their fetters .
Then begins an epoch of social revolution . [ 47 ]
At this point one important confusion must be cleared up .
Historical materialism has frequently been subject to a mechanical materialist distortion in which the dialectic of forces and relations of production is interpreted simply as an antagonism between the technical instruments of production ( " forces " ) and the system of property ownership ( " relations " ) which operates independently of human activity , thus arriving at a theory of technological determinism .
In this interpretation both Marx 's key concepts undergo a reduction in their meaning .
For Marx the forces of production signify not only the instruments in the sense of tools , machines etc. , but the total productive capacity of society including the productive activity of the working class .
" Of all the instruments of production , the greatest productive power is the revolutionary class itself . " [ 48 ]
Property ownership , on the other hand , is " but a legal expression of relations of production . "
Thus the contradiction between the forces and relations of production is not separate from the class struggle but is the very ground on which the latter arises .
This theoretical demonstration that historical materialism is history viewed from the standpoint of the proletariat is , as we have noted , more important than the question of how Marx happened to develop the theory but , in fact , its historical genesis parallels the theoretical logic almost exactly .
The first comprehensive statement of historical materialism was The German Ideology of 1845 .
This work was immediately preceded by two major texts , The Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844 , and the Introduction to a Critique of Hegel 's Philosophy of Right .
The 1844 Manuscripts begin not with " philosophy " or with " alienation " but with the class struggle .
The opening sentence reads : " Wages are determined by the bitter struggle between capitalist and worker . " [ 49 ]
The economic analysis that follows is , by Marx 's later standards , primitive but it is carried out explicitly from the point of view of the worker .
It aims to show " from political economy itself , in its own words " that :
the worker sinks to the level of a commodity , and to a most miserable commodity ; that the misery of the worker increases with the power and volume of his production ; that the necessary result of competition is the accumulation of capital in a few hands , and thus a restoration of monopoly in a more terrible form ; and finally that the distinction between capitalist and landlord , and between agricultural labourer and industrial worker , must disappear , and the whole of society divide into the two classes of property owners and the propertyless workers . [ 50 ]
In seeking to explain this state of affairs Marx is led to an analysis of the nature of workers ' labour .
Workers produce the wealth of the capitalists and their own misery because their labour is alienated .
Thus Marx arrives at the conception of the dual role of labour : labour as the means by which people create their life and their world , and alienated labour as the means by which they vitiate their life and create a world which stands over and against them  a dual role which implies the potential for human liberation with the abolition of alienated labour , and which thus anticipates both the starting point and conclusion of the materialist conception of history .
However , if we move back one stage further to the Introduction to the Critique of Hegel 's Philosophy of Right ( early 1844 ) we find already present what later appears as the result of the analysis of alienated labour and the result of historical materialism , namely the revolutionary role of the proletariat .
" When the proletariat announces the dissolution of existing social order , it only declares the secret of its own existence , for it is the effective dissolution of this order . " [ 51 ]
And , as we have already seen , Marx 's recognition of this role was itself the product of his own experience of revolutionary workers ' circles in Paris .
Thus both theoretically and biographically Marx 's general conception of history and society can be traced back to its material basis  the proletarian struggle .
The Marxist analysis of capitalism ( usually referred to as " Marxist economics " though really it is a " critique of political economy " ) was designed to provide a firm scientific foundation for the workers ' movement by revealing the law of motion of the capitalist mode of production .
That the entire analysis is conducted from the standpoint of the revolutionary working class should be obvious , after all its major themes include : an explanation of how workers are exploited ; a demonstration that the whole system is founded on that exploitation ; a prediction that because it is founded on exploitation this system must inevitably break down . [ 52 ]
Since however this aspect of Marxism has , more than any other , been presented as " objective " , " value - free " , " class - free " , a few observations on the genesis and logic of Marx 's critique of political economy seem justified .
Marx 's critique is , of course , an application of the theory of historical materialism to the capitalist mode of production , and like historical materialism itself , is rooted in an analysis of labour [ 53 ]  an analysis of labour as alienated .
It can not be emphasised too strongly that basically Marx 's theory of alienation is not a theory of how the worker " feels " about work , or of the general state of human consciousness , but a theory of alienated labour  in other words of that labour which the worker is compelled to make over to another , to sell .
Alienated labour is wage labour , not just a state of mind but " an economic fact " . [ 54 ]
However , it is also an economic fact that can only be perceived by looking at labour from the point of view of the worker .
Indeed Marx was the first " philosopher " and the first " economist " in the history of the world to analyse the labour process from the standpoint of the worker .
Just how central the theory of alienated labour is to the Marxist analysis of capitalism can be seen from two of Marx 's propositions .
First that " although private property appears to be the basis and cause of alienated labour , it is rather a consequence of the latter " . [ 55 ]
Second that the differentia specifica of capitalism is that under it labour power becomes a commodity .
A long theoretical road lies between the 1844 Manuscripts and Capital , between alienated labour and the theory of surplus value .
It is a road on which the early generic critique of capitalism is painstakingly transformed into a precise analytic tool with which to lay bare all the workings of the capitalist economy .
But in the process the original concept is neither " forgotten " nor " rejected " .
It remains at the heart of the analysis .
Consider the following passages :
1 ) All these consequences follow from the fact that the worker is related to the product of his labour as to an alien object .
For it is clear on this presupposition that the more the worker expends himself in work the more powerful becomes the world of objects which he creates in face of himself , the poorer he becomes in his inner life , and the less he belongs to himself .
It is just the same as in religion .
The more of himself man attributes to God , the less he has left in himself . [ 56 ]
2 ) It can not be otherwise in a mode of production in which the labourer exists to satisfy the needs of self - expansion of existing values , instead of , on the contrary , material wealth existing to satisfy the needs of development on the part of the labourer .
As in religion man is governed by the products of his own brain , so in capitalistic production , he is governed by the products of his own hand . [ 57 ]
3 ) The alienation of the worker in his object is expressed as follows in the laws of political economy : the more the worker produces the less he has to consume , the more value he creates the more worthless he becomes ; the more refined his product , the more crude and misshapen the worker ; the more civilized the product the more barbarous the worker ; the more powerful the work the more feeble the worker ; the more the work manifests intelligence , the more the worker declines in intelligence and becomes a slave of nature . [ 58 ]
4 ) ... within the capitalist system all methods for raising the social productiveness of labour are brought about at the cost of the individual labourer ; all means for the development of production transform themselves into means of domination over , and exploitation of , the producers ; they mutilate the labourer into a fragment of a man , degrade him to the level of an appendage of a machine , destroy every remnant of charm in his work and turn it into a hated toil ; they estrange from him the intellectual potentialities of the labour - process in the same proportion as science is incorporated in it as one independent power ; they distort the conditions under which he works , subject him during the labour - process to a despotism the more hateful for its meanness ; they transform life - time into working time , and drag his wife and child beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of capital . [ 59 ]
Passages 1 ) and 3 ) are from the 1844 Manuscripts and 2 ) and 4 ) are from Capital ; twenty - three years later the same basic idea , at times almost the same language .
And these are only a few of numerous passages that could be quoted from all Marx 's major theoretical works from The German Ideology to Theories of Surplus Value . [ 60 ]
Finally some observations on the Marxist theory of crisis , in particular its most important component , the declining rate of profit .
The tendency of the rate of profit to decline is not an individual thesis , a separate proposition , which can be abstracted from the rest of Marx 's thought , rather it is a point of convergence of all his major theories .
It derives directly from the theory of surplus value , according to which the source of profit is the unpaid labour time of the workers , and from the proposition that under capitalism living labour falls progressively under the domination of accumulated dead labour ( a theme already present in 1844 ) .
At the same time the tendency of the rate of profit to decline is the concrete economic expression of the conflict between the forces and relations of production  the proof that capitalist relations of production have become a fetter on the forces of production , that " the real barrier of capitalist production is capital itself " . [ 61 ]
Moreover , and this brings us back to our starting point , it was a theory which could only be formulated from the standpoint of the proletariat .
The classical bourgeois economists observed the phenomenon of the declining rate of profit but were unable to theorise it for to do so would have been to recognise the historically limited , transitory , nature of capitalism . [ 62 ]
To some " Marxists " it has seemed that Marx 's analysis of the contradictions of capitalism is separate from his commitment to proletarian revolution .
A recent proponent of this view is Lucio Colletti [ 63 ] , but the idea dates back to the Second International .
Thus Rudolph Hilferding wrote that : " It is one thing to recognise a necessity , but quite another to place oneself at the service of that necessity , " [ 64 ] with the conclusion that to get from the " is " of capitalist breakdown to the " ought " of socialism required a supplementary ethical commitment ( usually from the " eternal " ethical principles of Kant ) .
Hilferding however has reversed the real logic of Marxism .
It was the commitment to the proletariat that made possible the disclosure of capitalism 's contradictions , and the " ought to " of this commitment itself derived from the prior external existence of the proletariat which had already begun its struggle for self - emancipation .
To sum up the whole argument : in theory the proletarian revolution appears as the consequence of the theories of historical materialism , and surplus value etc. , but in reality it is also their foundation .
The empirical confirmation of this proposition is found in the fact that as a rule workers ' revolutions begin spontaneously  Paris 1848 and 1871 , Petrograd 1905 and 1917 , Germany 1918 , Spain 1936 , Hungary 1956 , France 1968 , and so on .
The role of Marxism is not to create or launch the revolution but to guide it to victory .
We are now in a position to grasp both the essential unity of Marxism and its developing nature  on the basis of the proletarian struggle against capital .
These two great social forces , locked in battle , are continually changing and developing , as is the balance of forces between them and their interaction with other classes .
Marxism must therefore change and develop too , but it must do so without departing from the standpoint of proletarian revolution .
If it does so depart then it ceases to be Marxism .
Lenin once described Marxism as " a block of steel " .
The metaphor is of strictly limited validity , but it is greatly preferable to the widespread view that Marxism consists of a series of detachable parts which can be discarded and replaced at will .
More accurate is Lenin 's contention that Marx " laid the cornerstones of the science which socialists must advance in all directions , if they do not want to lag behind events " . [ 65 ]
It is the nature of revisionism that it attempts to displace these cornerstones ( which are not arbitrary but theoretical expressions of the social being of the proletariat ) and in so doing departs from the standpoint of the proletariat to that of a different class .

Part two
The transformations of Marxism
It should already be clear that , by the criteria already established , many of the ideologists and theoretical systems that have claimed the title of Marxism in the past hundred years are not Marxist at all .
Before proceeding to demonstrate this in relation to specific examples it is necessary to make some preliminary observations on the social position and consciousness of the proletariat under capitalism .
In potential the proletariat transcends capitalism , but so long as capitalism exists it remains an oppressed and exploited class .
In normal times therefore the consciousness of the majority of workers is dominated by bourgeois ideology ( " The ruling ideas are the ideas of the ruling class " ) .
Yet at the same time workers are impelled by their economic position to resist the attacks of capital and to fight for improvements in their lot , even when they are not ready to challenge the system as a whole .
Corresponding to this contradiction there have emerged hybrid ideologies which combine elements of bourgeois and elements of socialist ideology  the most obvious example to hand is British Labourism .
However , these hybrid ideologies also have their own distinct material base in the class whose social position is itself part bourgeois and part proletarian , namely the intermediate stratum known usually in Marxism as the petty bourgeoisie .
The category of petty bourgeois has a general validity , but it must not be allowed to obscure the fact that in the modern world it covers a number of social layers whose conditions of existence are markedly different .
The most important of these are : the " old " petty bourgeoisie of small shopkeepers and other small employers ; the " new " middle class of salaried employees in positions of authority over the working class ; the trade union and labour movement bureaucracy ; and in most countries , the peasantry .
Taken together these groups " surround " the proletariat ( they are in much closer daily contact with it than is the bourgeoisie ) and exert an influence on its consciousness .
Each of the groups , however , tends to generate its own version of petty bourgeois ideology and to exert its own kind of pressure on the workers .
The consciousness of the proletariat , and with it Marxist theory , exists therefore in a permanent state of siege and the history of Marxism has been a history of battles with the hybrid ideologies of the petty bourgeoisie : hence Marx 's polemics against Proudhon and Bakunin , Engels ' against Duhring , Plekhanov and Lenin against the Narodniks , and so on .
The problem which concerns this article however is conflicts within " Marxism " , or rather between theoretical and political tendencies that claim to be Marxist .
The question that must be posed is whether the most important of these conflicts are also struggles between the standpoint of the proletariat and that of the petty bourgeoisie or other alien classes .
If this is a phenomenon that can be established it also needs to be explained .
Lenin suggested that " The dialectics of history is such that the theoretical victory of Marxism forces its enemies to disguise themselves as Marxists . " [ 66 ]
But although this explanation contains an important kernel of truth it is somewhat over - conspiratorial .
It is more historically accurate to suggest that the process usually runs on these lines : leaders or movements arrive at a perspective of proletarian revolution and adopt Marxism , then for a variety of reasons ( in the last analysis the pressure of capitalism ) they move away from this perspective but retain the label and language of Marxism  either through self - deception or a desire to preserve their radical credentials or both  while transforming its real content .
Once this process has occurred this " transformed " Marxism can be passed on to other leaders and movements that have never had anything to do with proletarian revolution . [ 67 ]
But this is to anticipate results that have first to be demonstrated by historical analysis .
The history of Marxism since Marx has been dominated , in terms of material power and numbers of adherents , by three tendencies : firstly , the social democracy of the Second International ; secondly Stalinism ; and thirdly , Third World nationalism .
Clearly it is out of the question to present , within the confines of this small book , a comprehensive analysis of any one , let alone all three , of these tendencies .
I shall therefore approach each in terms of the most important features of its most important representatives .

1 Kautskyism
The leading party of the Second International was German Social Democracy , the SPD .
Founded in 1875 at the Gotha Conference , which united Marx 's German supporters with the followers of Lassalle , [ 68 ] the party developed through a period of semi-legality ( Bismarck 's anti-socialist laws ) into a position , by the turn of the century , of considerable strength within the German state .
This was a period of general advance for German capitalism within which it was possible for the developing working - class movement to win concessions and improvements in its lot .
Of course these gains were the result of struggle capitalism never gives anything without some fight  but they required no overall confrontation , no life or death class battle .
( In fact the level of strikes in Germany was very low . [ 69 ] )
As a whole it was a time of relative social peace and the German working class took advantage of this to build the largest , best organised socialist party in the world  a party with hundreds of thousands of members , thousands of party organisations , and over eighty daily papers , as well as a multitude of social and cultural organisations .
From the late 1890s this party was divided into an " orthodox Marxist " majority and a ( growing ) " revisionist " minority .
The latter , led by Eduard Bernstein , maintained that capitalism , contrary to Marxist theory , was gradually overcoming its contradictions and that therefore the SPD could and should be no more than a party of democratic social reform .
Since the revisionists were more or less openly anti-Marxist they are not essentially relevant to this article : it is the " orthodox " wing that concerns us here .
The SPD officially committed itself to Marxism at its congress at Erfurt in 1891 when it adopted the Erfurt Programme drafted by the " Pope of Marxism " , Karl Kautsky .
This programme , together with the commentary on it , also by Kautsky [ 70 ] , remained the basic statement of the movement 's world outlook , just as Kautsky remained its leading theorist , until the First World War .
Without doubt the Erfurt Programme was intended , and generally accepted , as a statement of completely orthodox Marxism .
Its first section is " an analysis of present day society and its development " , [ 71 ] and consists of a condensed and simplified exposition of the theory of capitalist development outlined by Marx in The Communist Manifesto culminating in the proposition that " private ownership of the means of production has become irreconcilable with their effective use and complete development " . [ 72 ]
Its second section calls for the resolution of this contradiction by " the conversion of private ownership into social ownership and conversion of commodity production into socialist production carried on for and by society " . [ 73 ]
The third section deals with " the means which are to lead to the realisation of these objects " [ 74 ] , namely the class struggle of the proletariat .
With regard to the nature of this struggle the programme tells us :
The struggle of the working class against capitalist exploitation is necessarily a political struggle .
The working class cannot develop its economic organisation and wage its economic battles without political rights .
It cannot accomplish the transfer of the means of production to the community as a whole without first having come into possession of political power . [ 75 ]
We are here still on the grounds of orthodoxy .
Time and again Marx insisted that " the struggle of class against class is a political struggle " , that " to conquer power had therefore become the great duty of the working classes " . [ 76 ]
But what was to be the content of this " political struggle " , this " conquest of political power " ?
For Marx , as we have seen , it was above all the destruction of the bourgeois state and the establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat  the concrete example of which was the Paris Commune .
What it was for Kautsky and the SPD is shown clearly in Kautsky 's commentary on the programme  namely an exclusively parliamentaty struggle .
To demonstrate just how exclusively parliamentarist the SPD strategy was , a lengthy quotation is unfortunately necessary :
Like every other class , the working class must strive to influence the state authorities , to bend them to its purposes .
Great capitalists can influence rulers and legislators directly , but the workers can do so only through parliamentaiy activity [ my emphasis throughout ] ...
By electing representatives to parliament therefore the working class can exercise an influence over the governmental powers .
The struggle of all the classes which depend upon legislative action for political influence is directed , in the modern state , on the one hand toward an increase in the power of the parliament ( or congress ) , and on the other toward an increase in their own influence within the parliament .
The power of parliament depends on the energy and courage of the classes behind it and on the energy and courage of the classes on which its will is to be imposed .
The influence of a class within a parliament depends , in the first place , on the nature of the electoral law in force .
It is dependent further on the influence of the class in question among the voters , and , lastly , upon its aptitude for parliamentary work ...
The proletariat is , however ... favourably situated in regard to parliamentary activity ...
Their unions are to them an excellent parliamentary school ; they afford opportunities in training in parliamentary law and publicspeaking ...
Moreover it finds in its own ranks an increasing number of persons well fitted to represent it in legislative halls .
Whenever the proletariat engages in parliamentary activity as a self - conscious class , parliamentarism begins to change its character .
It ceases to be a mere tool in the hands of the bourgeoisie .
This very participation of the proletariat proves to be the most effective means of shaking up the hitherto indifferent divisions of the proletariat and giving them hope and confidence .
It is the most powerful level that can be utilised to raise the proletariat out of its economic , social and moral degradation .
The proletariat has , therefore , no reason to distrust parliamentaty action . [ 77 ]
This parliamentary perspective was adopted in response to the dramatic electoral gains of the SPD  its vote rose from 550,000 ( 9.7 per cent ) in 1884 to 1,427,000 ( 19.7 per cent ) in 1890  and it constituted a definite shift to the right from earlier positions .
In 1881 Kautsky had written that , " Social Democracy harbours no illusions that it can directly achieve its goal through elections , through the parliamentary road " and that " the first step of the coming revolution " would be to " demolish the bourgeois state " . [ 78 ]
But from the 1890s onwards the parliamentary road remained the dominant strategy of both Kautsky and the SPD .
Thus , when in the controversies with the revisionists within his own party , Kautsky appears as the defender of " revolution " it is a conception of " parliamentary revolution " that he is defending : in other words that the workers ' party will remain in opposition , refusing all coalitions or participation in bourgeois governments until such time as it has won an overall majority in parliament and forms the government , whereupon it will use its position to legislate the introduction to socialism . [ 79 ]
That this strategy involved taking over , not smashing , the capitalist state was emphasised by Kautsky himself in his 1912 polemic against Pannekoek :
The objective of our political struggle remains what it has been up to now : the conquest of state power through the conquest of a majority in parliament and the elevation of parliament to a commanding position within the state .
Certainly not the destruction of state power . [ 80 ]
Underpinning the parliamentary strategy was a view of the transition to socialism as the more or less inevitable outcome of economic development .
The growth of capitalism would mean the growth of the proletariat .
As the proletariat grew so its consciousness would rise and that would mean more votes for Social Democracy , until such time as there would be an overwhelming majority for socialism .
" Economic development " , wrote Kautsky , " will lead naturally to the accomplishment of this purpose . " [ 81 ]
The whole process would go ahead smoothly , inevitably , and without any life or death struggles , provided only that the party leadership did not fall into adventurism and provoke premature battle .
The only actual activity required was organisation and education :
Building up the organisation , winning all positions of power , which we are able to win and hold securely by our own strength , studying the state and society and educating the masses : other aims we cannot consciously and systematically set either to ourselves or to our organisations . [ 82 ]
The question we must now pose , following the methodology adopted in the first part of this article , is : what was the social basis of this ideology of passive expectancy ?
In one sense , clearly , the social base was the period of detente between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie which accompanied the prosperity and advance of German capital at the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century .
At the same time , however , within this general situation this ideology expressed the interests , not of the working class , but of the social layer whose very existence was a product of this social truce : namely the vast Social Democratic and trade union bureaucracy , the army of privileged officials , who had arisen to administer their beloved organisations .
Nothing illustrates this better than the attitude of these trade union and party leaders to that fundamental question of the class struggle , the mass strike  a question that became urgent in Germany as a result of the role of the mass strike in the Russian Revolution of 1905 . [ 83 ]
The trade union leaders were implacably opposed to the mass strike and , at the Cologne Congress of the trade unions in May 1905 , adopted a resolution condemning it .
The party , however , at Jena in September 1905 , passed a resolution " accepting " the mass strike in principle without specifying what should be done about it .
Then the outbreak of a mass movement in Saxony for the widening of the franchise demanded the resolution of this contradiction in practice :
On 1 February 1906 a secret conference of executives of the party and the unions was held .
This gathering promptly revealed the real balance of forces between the two organisations .
The party capitulated to the unions , committing itself to trying to prevent a mass strike with all its might . [ 84 ]
This was followed by a compromise at the Mannheim Party Congress in September 1906 , where the unions and the party reached agreement on the basis of " common theoretical acceptance of the possibility of recourse to the mass strike in the indeterminate future " , and then only with " the adherence of the leaders and the members of the unions . " [ 85 ]
Kautsky 's role in this process was that of a " left " critic of the union leaders .
He complained of their narrow economistic outlook and called for the supremacy of the Social Democratic spirit in the unions , but he refused to break with them and simultaneously attacked the real advocates of the mass strike ( such as Rosa Luxemburg ) as " fabricators of revolution " . [ 86 ]
When faced with a choice Kautsky sacrificed the demands of the class struggle to the unity of the party and trade union organisations .
The labour movement bureaucracy is part of the petty bourgeoisie .
It stands between labour and capital and its objective role is that of mediator between the classes .
In relation to the mass of workers it is privileged in terms of income , job security , working conditions and life style .
However its position , and consequently its political behaviour , is different from that of the traditional petty - bourgeoisie of small businessmen , shopkeepers , self - employed , and so on .
The latter , as owners of private property , are in normal times more or less completely under the hegemony of the big bourgeoisie .
In times of crisis , when they are squeezed between labour and capital , they can be pulled behind the working class by a powerful revolutionary movement that shows its determination and capacity to resolve the crisis of capitalism .
In the absence of such a movement they can swing far to the right and form the mass base of fascism .
By contrast the labour bureaucracy is organisationally bound to the working class and therefore , as a social layer , cannot swing so far to the right ( which is why the theory of " social fascism " is such nonsense ) .
At the same time however it has a much closer relationship to the ruling class than does the small employer .
Its role as " representative " ( parliamentary or union ) brings it into daily contact with the bosses and their state , and it depends for its mass support on the concessions it can obtain from them .
Threatened equally by fascism , which would destroy its " organisations " , and revolution , which would destroy its negotiating role , it is profoundly conservative .
It fears , above all , mass actions that might " get out of hand " , disrupt the organisations , provoke a ruling class offensive , and undermine its delicate balancing act between the classes .
Its political need is for an ideology that combines socialism in words with passivity and compromise in deeds .
It needs the working class to sustain the organisations that pay its salaries , and as a stage army that can be wheeled into battle to gain concessions which in turn retain support for the organisations , but it needs the working class in its place and under control .
The ideology of German Social Democracy fitted these needs like a glove .
Kautsky's " Marxism " was a theoretical system that in all crucial questions adapted itself to the needs of the bureaucracy .
This was true even at the level of philosophy .
For mechanical materialism , the philosophical outlook characteristic of Kautsky and the Second International as a whole , is , as we have shown , a bourgeois position at bottom .
It treats the working class as a merely passive product of material circumstances , and therefore excludes the active revolutionary role of the workers , and particularly of the party . [ 87 ]
Once this social basis of Second International Marxism has been grasped ( and what was true for Kautsky and the SPD was even more true for most of the other socialist parties ) , the capitulation to chauvinism in the First World War presents no particular problems of analysis .
On the one hand the various bureaucracies had developed a vested interest in the prosperity and imperial power of their respective national capitals  the greater that prosperity the more easily they could negotiate concessions .
On the other hand they could not risk an unpopular stand that would jeopardise their legality , their organisations , and their support .
Thus on 4 August 1914 , the SPD 's vote for war credits was a betrayal  of all the fine anti-war and internationalist rhetoric of the previous years  but it was also the continuation and culmination of well - established political practice . [ 88 ]
In conclusion , to describe Kautskyism as a variant of Marxism , or as one aspect of the Marxist tradition , is to mistake form for content .
In content it was the theory of a different class .
In content the anti-Marxist Bernstein and the " orthodox " Marxist Kautsky stood much closer to each other than either did to the revolutionary theory of Marx .
They differed not on what political practice should be but on how it should be described .
We will leave the last word to Kautsky himself .
In his 1932 obituary of Bernstein he wrote that their polemics at the turn of the century were " only an episode " , that they had come together " during the World War " and that subsequently on all questions , of war , of revolution , of the evolution of Germany and of the world , " we have always adopted the same point of view . " [ 89 ]

2 Stalinism
Stalinism 's point of departure was very different from that of Kautskyism .
Stalinism emerged within the Bolshevik Party in the years following the Civil War and rose to dominance in the Soviet Union through a series of bitter inner party struggles in the 1920s , finally achieving absolute control in 1928 - 29 .
Theoretically , therefore , it evolved out of Leninism , the development of Marxism which expressed and guided to victory the workers ' revolution of October 1917 .
Leninism 's principal characteristics were its revolutionary intransigence , its fierce internationalism , its analysis of and opposition to imperialism , its insistence on the destruction of the bourgeois state by workers ' power based on soviets , and its conception of the party as an interventionist vanguard organisation .
However , the material situation in which Stalinism was born was almost the opposite of that expressed in its theoretical starting point .
The Russian working class , which in 1917 had reached the highest level of consciousness and revolutionary struggle yet seen anywhere in the world , had , by 1921 , virtually ceased to exist .
In the course of the Civil War the vast majority of the most militant and politically conscious workers had either been killed in battle or raised to the position of state officials .
Under the combined impact of the Civil War , the Revolution itself , and the World War that preceded it the Russian economy had collapsed utterly .
Gross industrial production fell to 31 per cent of its 1913 level , large scale industrial production to 21 per cent , production of steel to 4.7 per cent , the transport system was in ruins , epidemics and famine raged .
The total of industrial workers fell from about three million in 1917 to one and a quarter million in 1921 , and those that remained were politically exhausted .
As Lenin put it in 1921 :
[ The ] industrial proletariat ... in our country , owing to the war and to the desperate poverty and ruin has become declassed , i.e. dislodged from its class groove and has ceased to exist as a proletariat . [ 90 ]
The Bolshevik party found itself suspended in a vacuum .
To administer the country it had to take over and use a vast army of Tsarist officials and against all its intentions it itself became bureaucratised .
Bureaucracy is essentially a hierarchy of officials not subject to popular control from below .
In Russia the social force that Marxists ( above all Lenin ) counted on to prevent the development of bureaucracy , an active revolutionary working class , had been cut from under the feet of the party .
In this situation it was impossible to implement the Marxist programme in pure form .
For a period it was possible to mount a holding operation , relying on the hardened socialist commitment of the Bolshevik old guard , to cling to the basic revolutionary aspirations while making the necessary practical compromises ( for example the New Economic Policy or NEP ) and waiting for help from the international revolution .
This in essence was the course taken by Lenin .
But failing the international revolution ( and it did fail ) a stark choice had eventually to be made .
Either remain loyal to the theory and goal of international proletarian revolution , with the possibility of losing state power in Russia , or cling to power and abandon the theory and goal .
The situation was extremely complex and the participants did not see it in these clear terms , but , essentially , Trotskyism was the product of the first choice and Stalinism of the second . [ 91 ]
But of course Stalinism did not ditch Leninism or Marxism openly .
In order to retain the aura and prestige of Leninism , Stalinism had to perform two interconnected operations .
First the transformation of Marxism - Leninism from a developing practice - oriented doctrine into a fixed dogma , the equivalent of a state religion , was necessary .
Stalin 's aspiration in this direction appears clearly in his " Oath to Lenin " delivered shortly after Lenin 's death :
In leaving us , Comrade Lenin ordained us to hold high and keep pure the great title of member of the party .
We vow to thee , Comrade Lenin , that we shall honourably fulfil this thy commandment ...
In leaving us , Comrade Lenin ordained us to guard the unity of our party like the apple of our eye .
We vow to thee Comrade Lenin that we shall fulfil honourably this thy commandment , too ...
In leaving us , Comrade Lenin ordained us to guard and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat .
We vow to thee Comrade Lenin , that without sparing our strength we shall honourably fulfil this thy commandment too ... [ 92 ]
Also expressions of this tendency were Stalin 's Foundations of Leninism  a rigid schematic codification of Lenin 's principles  and the vast mass of self - styled Marxist texts and formal Soviet academic commentaries that continue to pour from the party 's publishing houses to this day .
In this form Stalinist Marxism was completely severed from the practice of the working class and thus became completely lifeless .
( It is anything but an accident that , oppositionists apart , not a single Marxist thinker of any stature has emerged from Stalinist or post - Stalinist Russia . )
No longer concerned with changing reality , its function was to mask it .
Stalinist Marxism became ideology in the fullest sense of the word .
If for this purpose Stalin would have liked to preserve Leninism untouched , embalmed like Lenin 's body in the mausoleum , he was nonetheless unable to .
The gap between theory and reality became so wide that " certain amendments " to the theory were unavoidable if even the appearance of their correspondence was to be maintained . [ 93 ]
Thus a second operation  the revision of Leninism and Marxism to bring it into line with actual Stalinist practice  arose as a necessary consequence of the first .
It is by focussing on this process that we can gain the clearest insight into the real structure of Stalinist Marxism and the interests it represented .
By far the most important such amendment was the theory of socialism in one country , first promulgated by Stalin in autumn 1924 .
The introduction of this theory needs to be considered from a number of angles : how it was done , why it was done , the social interests it served , and its consequences .
First Stalin 's method .
" Socialism in one country " marked a dramatic break with the internationalist position formulated by Marx and Engels as early as 1845 and 1847 [ 94 ] and tirelessly repeated by Lenin in relation to the Russian Revolution . [ 95 ]
It also contradicted what Stalin himself had written in The Foundation of Leninism as late as April 1924 :
The main task of socialism  the organisation of socialist production  still remains ahead .
Can this task be accomplished , can the final victory of socialism in one country be attained without the joint efforts of the proletariat of several advanced countries ?
No , this is impossible . [ 96 ]
Stalin " solved " this contradiction by rewriting this passage to read the opposite ( " After consolidating its power and leading the peasantry in its wake the proletariat of the victorious country can and must build a socialist society " [ 97 ] ) and having the first edition withdrawn from circulation .
There was no new analysis , simply the assertion of a new orthodoxy ( retrospectively grafted on to Lenin ) .
Indeed , apart from this one passage the rest of the text was left unchanged , including passages which clearly reflected the earlier perspective . [ 98 ]
Only later were " analyses " concocted to justify the new line .
This procedure was not an isolated example , rather it was typical .
When Social Democracy ( according to Stalin ) changed from an ally ( 1925 - 27 ) to " the main enemy " ( 1928 - 33 ) and then back to an ally again ( 1934 - 39 ) , the change of line was not based on any new analysis of Social Democracy .
It was simply a fiat to which analysis had to accommodate itself afterwards .
The " secret " of this method is not that Stalin had no analysis but that the analysis he had could not be spoken publicly , because its real criteria , and real purposes , had ceased to be those of the theory whose language it retained .
What then was Stalin 's reason for introducing socialism in one country in 1924 ?
Clearly it was a response ( a defeatist response ) to the failure of the German Revolution in 1923 and the relative stabilisation of capitalism that followed .
Stalin had never been much interested in world revolution ( he was by far the most insular of the leading Bolsheviks ) and now he wrote it off entirely , but this alone does not explain why he did n't simply continue to pay lip service to the old internationalism .
The answer is that socialism in one country fitted exactly the needs and aspirations of the bureaucrats now dominating the country .
They longed for business as usual , uncomplicated by international revolutionary adventures .
At the same time , they needed a banner around which to group themselves , a slogan defining their goal .
As Trotsky put it , socialism in one country " expressed unmistakeably the mood of the bureaucracy .
When speaking of the victory of socialism , they meant their own victory . " [ 99 ]
It was to the bureaucracy what " All power to the soviets " was to the working class in 1917 .
As we have seen , Stalin introduced his new theory with the minimum of fuss ( precisely to disguise its newness ) yet in reality it marked a decisive shift in orientation which had the most far - reaching consequences .
The Soviet Union was isolated in the face of a hostile capitalist world  a world which had already demonstrated its eagerness to strangle the Revolution by its intervention in the Civil War , and which , as Lenin emphasised , remained economically and militarily stronger than the young workers ' state .
The strategy of the early years of the Revolution  the strategy of Lenin and Trotsky  included , of course , the most determined military defence but ultimately it relied on stimulating international revolution to overthrow capitalism from within .
The policy of socialism in one country changed this emphasis .
It replaced reliance on the international class struggle with reliance on the power of the Soviet Union as a nation state , and this decision had its own implacable logic .
The defence of the Soviet state demanded armed forces equal to those of its enemies and in the modern world that meant an equivalent industry and an equivalent surplus .
Engels had already grasped this crucial fact of 20th century economics and politics in 1892 :
From the moment warfare became part of the grande industrie ( iron clad ships , rifled artillery , quickfiring and repeating cannons , repeating rifles , steel covered bullets , smokeless powder etc. ) la grande industrie , without which all these things cannot be made , became a political necessity .
All these things cannot be had without a highly developed metal manufacture .
And that manufacture cannot be had without a corresponding development in all other branches of manufacture , especially textiles . [ 100 ]
Stalin 's grasp on this reality was no less firm :
No comrades ... the pace must not be slackened !
On the contrary , we must quicken it as much as is within our powers and possibilities .
To slacken the pace would mean to lag behind ; and those who lag behind are beaten .
We do not want to be beaten .
No , we do n't want to .
The history of old ... Russia ... she was ceaselessly beaten for her backwardness ...
For military backwardness , for cultural backwardness , for political backwardness , for industrial backwardness , for agricultural backwardness ...
We are fifty or a hundred years behind the advanced countries .
We must make good this lag in ten years .
Either we do it or they crush us . [ 101 ]
But Russia was poor , compared with its rivals desperately so , and its productivity of labour was low .
To industrialise it required massive investment and without international aid there was only one possible source for this investment , the labour of its workers and peasants .
A massive surplus had to be extracted and ploughed back into industrial growth .
But with the majority of the population living not much above subsistence level there was no way such a surplus could be extracted and set aside voluntarily by collective decision of the associated producers .
It could be done only through forcible exploitation and that in turn required an agency to apply this force  a social class freed from the burdens , but reaping the benefits , of the process of capital accumulation  a class playing the same historical role as the bourgeoisie had done in western Europe .
Thus the consequence , in practice , of socialism in one country was its direct opposite , state capitalism in one country .
Socialism in one country also had theoretical consequences .
It could not be confined , much as Stalin may have wished it , to a minor amendment to the orthodoxy .
In Russia the overwhelming majority of the population were not workers but peasants .
Marx and Lenin , although they recognised the possibility of a revolutionary alliance between workers and peasants to overthrow the capitalists and landlords , always insisted that the peasantry was not a socialist class .
" The peasant movement ... is not a struggle against the foundations of capitalism but a struggle to cleanse them of all survivals of serfdom . " [ 102 ]
But if Russia , by itself , was to accomplish the transition to socialism , then this attitude to the peasantry had to be revised .
So for a period Stalin ( and his ally Bukharmn ) advanced the notion of the peasantry " growing into " socialism .
In practice of course the peasantry was crushed by the forced collectivisation of 1929 - 33 , for it constituted an obstacle not only to socialism but also to state capitalism , but not before the blurring of the distinction between the working class and the peasantry had passed into Stalinist ideology .
Another casualty was the theory of imperialism .
This had been developed by Luxemburg , Bukharin and Lenin as an analysis of the latest stage of world capitalism and it asserted , above all , the primacy of the world economy over all its constituent national parts .
Socialism in one country necessarily denied this .
Indeed , in seeking to defend his theory against the objections of the Left Opposition , who pointed out that Marx and Engels had explicitly rejected " national " socialism , Stalin was led to argue that while socialism in one country was impossible under the industrial capitalism of Marx 's day , it was possible under imperialism which was characterised by the " law of uneven development " . [ 103 ]
In this way Stalinism deprived the Leninist theory of imperialism of its real analytical content and reduced it to mere anti-colonialism , not at all a distinctively Marxist position .
Finally the logic of socialism in one country played havoc with the Marxist theory of the state .
By 1934 Stalin was claiming that socialism had been established in Russia .
This was on the basis that with the transformation of the peasantry into state employees , classes no longer existed  the bureaucracy of course was not a class for Stalin .
According to Marxism , the state , as an instrument of class rule , was destined to wither away under socialism , but Stalin 's state had not the slightest intention of withering away , and this was a fact that no amount of propaganda could hide .
Stalin fielded this particular contradiction by asserting that Marx and Engels had expected the state to wither away because they viewed socialism as an international phenomenon , whereas when socialism existed only in one country the state had to be strengthened . [ 104 ]
It was the kind of circular argument that works well when anyone who points out the circularity is a candidate for the firing squad .
But if this argument justified the existence of the state it still left unsolved the problem of the class nature of this state .
It could not be a specifically workers ' state if Russia was a classless society  and precisely this was involved in the claim that Russia was socialist .
The only solution was the notion that the Soviet state had become a state of " the whole people " , a thoroughly bourgeois view of the state vigorously attacked by Marx in his Critique of the Gotha Programme and by Lenin in The State and Revolution .
Moreover it was a view of the state adopted by the Stalinist bureaucracy for exactly the same reason that the bourgeoisie has always viewed their state as a state of the whole people , namely its refusal to acknowledge its own existence as a ruling class .
It is useful at this point to note the ideological similarities and differences between Stalinism and Kautskyism .
Both involved a systematic separation of theory and practice , in contrast to the Marxist aim of the unity of theory and practice .
Both evinced a strong attachment to the state in contrast to the sharp hostility of Marx and Lenin .
Both collapsed from internationalism to nationalism .
Yet the differences are equally striking .
Kautskyism blunted Marxism in theory and then further blunted it in practice ; it spoke of social revolution ( through parliament ) and practised conciliation with the bourgeoisie .
Stalinism retained a more revolutionary rhetoric and practised the complete opposite : it spoke of insurrection and the dictatorship of the proletariat and practised the outright suppression of the working class .
Kautskyism was awed and attracted by the power of the state and therefore unwilling to contemplate its destruction .
Stalinism developed a positive cult of state worship .
Whereas for Marx and Lenin the dictatorship of the proletariat was already a " semi- state " or " no longer a state in the proper sense of the word " [ 105 ] , for Stalinism the road to socialism ( and even communism ) lay through strengthening the state ad infinitum .
Kautskyism capitulated to nationalism in 1914 shamefacedly and under the cover of " peace " slogans .
Stalinism , having formally inserted nationalism into Marxism with " socialism in one country " , degenerated into the crudest possible Great Russian chauvinism , even exalting Russia 's Tsarist imperialist past . [ 106 ]
These similarities and differences reflected similarities and differences in the social bases of the two ideologies .
Both were ideologies of bureaucracies that had risen from the working class movement , but in the case of Kautskyism the bureaucracy stood midway between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie , whereas the Stalinist bureaucracy , with the old bourgeoisie annihilated and effectively declassed , actually found itself in power .
Kautskyism consequently appeared as a moderate , cautious " Marxism " which pushed to the fore the elements of Marxism " acceptable to the bourgeoisie " . [ 107 ]
Whereas Stalinism appeared as an arrogant , ruthless " Marxism " with little or no regard for the feelings of the bourgeoisie but which transformed the content of this theory into its extreme opposite .
However , just as Kautskyism had more in common with its opponent Bernstein than it did with Marxism , so , at bottom , Stalinism , for all its verbal denunciations , stood far closer to Kautskyism than it did to the revolutionary theory of Marx and Lenin .
The parallels with Social Democracy become even clearer once we examine Stalinism as an international phenomenon .
So far the focus of our attention has been on Stalinism within Russia but it also had a major impact beyond Russia 's borders , first and foremost through the parties of the Communist International ( the Comintern ) , all of which rapidly absorbed the Stalinist world outlook .
This impact itself needs a note of explanation .
From the outset the Comintern was dominated by its Russian section ; as was only to be expected given that they were its founders and had the authority of the successful Revolution behind them .
But in the early years there was full and free debate and western Communist leaders felt able to challenge the Russians even if the latter 's point of view generally prevailed .
However , the defeat of the European revolutionary wave between 1919 and 1923 undermined the confidence of the western parties and emphasised their sense of inferiority to the seemingly victorious Russians .
This , combined with the in-creased use of bureaucratic pressure and material aid , confirmed and intensified Russian domination of the Comintern to the point where it could be used to divert the International fundamentally from its original purpose of world proletarian revolution .
The ideological medium through which this shift was effected was again the theory of socialism in one country .
If the main task , the establishment of socialism , could be achieved in one country , then the international revolution became a kind of optional extra or bonus , a distant goal to be rcndered occasional homage , rather than an immediate necessity guiding practical activity .
One consequence of this was the establishment of a tendency to reduce the role of the Communist Parties to " frontier patrols " for the Soviet state .
Their first duty was to hinder any possibility of military intervention against Russia and to this end they were induced to act as reformist pressure groups on their respective bourgeoisies , downplaying revolutionary politics for fear of alienating potential friends and allies .
The first fruits of this orientation were the subordination of the Chinese Communist Party to the " progressive " bourgeois nationalist Kuomintang , which resulted in the smashing of the Chinese Revolution of 1925 - 27 by that same Kuomintang ; and the subordination of the British Communist Party to the " left " leaders of the TUC General Council , who were simultaneously posing as " friends of the Soviet Union " in the Anglo - Soviet Trade Union Committee and betraying the General Strike of 1926 .
Later fruits included the Popular Fronts of the mid1930s , with their sacrifice of the Spanish Revolution ( and therefore the Spanish Republic ) to Franco , for the sake of a potential Soviet alliance with bourgeois democratic Britain and France , and , eventually , the dissolution of the Comintern itself in 1943 , as a gesture of good will to the Allies in the Second World War .
However , if the parties of the Comintern were to be manipulated in this way they had to be transformed organisationally as well as ideologically .
The mass of members of the Communist Parties were , undoubtedly , sincere workers who had joined their parties in order to overthrow capitalism .
If they accepted the theory of socialism in one country it was precisely because they did not understand its implications .
Moreover , their class position would continually impel them to act in ways that transcended the role of Soviet frontier patrols .
Consequently to impose this role on them , the parties of the Comintern had to be removed from the control of their members  they had to be bureaucratised , staffed by a hierarchy of officials who could be relied upon to subordinate the interests of the working class ( and of their own worker members ) to the interests of the ruling bureaucracy in Russia .
With the power , prestige and funds available to it Stalinism did not find this a difficult task .
By the end of the 1920s the Comintern and its parties were entirely in the hands of thoroughly " reliable " Stalinist apparatchiks .
Yet it must also be understood that there was an inherent limit to this process .
If the Comintern parties were to be effective frontier patrols , more effective than the Soviet diplomatic corps , then they had to dispose of certain forces , they had to have mass support , and for historical reasons that support would be predominantly working class .
To gain and retain that support they would have to be , to a certain extent , responsive to the needs of that class .
Thus , just as the Social Democratic bureaucracy mediates between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie to the advantage of the latter , so the bureaucracies of the Communist Parties mediated between the interests of their local proletariat and the interests of Russian state capitalism , also to the advantage of the latter .
At the same time , however , socialism in one country generated a second , and contradictory , tendency within international communism .
Since it was a nationalist theory as applied to Russia , it opened the doors to nationalism within every Communist Party .
As Trotsky put it at the time :
If it is at all possible to realise socialism in one country , then one can believe in that theory not only after but before the conquest of power .
If socialism can be realised within the national boundaries of backward Russia , then there is all the more reason to believe that it can be realised in advanced Germany ...
It will be the beginning of the disintegration of the Comintern along the lines of social - patriotism . [ 108 ]
At first this nationalist tendency lay dormant , overshadowed by loyalty to Russia .
But the very process of working as Soviet frontier patrols , of building bridges to the nationalist bourgeoisie in the backward countries ( China ) or the reformist trade union leaders ( Britain ) or the " democratic " bourgeoisie ( the Popular Fronts in Spain and France ) itself fostered the nationalist infection .
That the nationalist tendency remained subordinate to the frontier patrol tendency up until the Second World War was shown by the general Comintern acceptance of the Soviet line that the war was an imperialist war ( a line dictated by Stalin 's temporary alliance with Hitler ) .
The nationalist tendency then received a massive boost from the Soviet switch in 1941 ( induced by the German invasion of Russia ) to the line that the war was now an anti-fascist people 's war , which demanded the complete cessation of independent working - class struggle and required Communists to act as super - patriots .
After the war the nationalist tendency grew apace .
In those countries where Communist Parties came to power by their own efforts ( China , Yugoslavia , Albania ) it triumphed completely and led to open breaks with Moscow .
It remained weakest in those parties installed in power by the Red Army ( Poland , Hungary , East Germany among others ) and in parties that were small , persecuted or exiled and thus dependent on Soviet patronage ( for example the Greek and the Portuguese ) .
It became dominant in parties with a mass working - class base which aspired to a role in government ( most notably the Italian ) . [ 109 ]
The phenomenon of Eurocommunism was the ideological reflection of this process .
Set aside for the moment the question of Stalinism in the under - developed countries and consider the elements we have traced in the evolution of western Stalinism : reformist pressure group politics , dependence on trade union leaders , alliances with the " left " of the bourgeoisie , nationalism and bureaucratic organisations .
What is this but a carbon copy of the elements that made up Social Democracy ?
Small wonder then that the ideological positions of western Stalinism  national parliamentary roads to socialism , explicit rejection of the dictatorship of the proletariat , and so on  have become increasingly indistinguishable from those of Social Democracy .
The parallel extends even to the division of Left and Right Eurocommunism .
Left Eurocommunism is more or less a return to Kautskyism in that it envisages a more or less rapid parliamentary transition to socialism , backed by mass pressure of course . [ 110 ]
Right Euro - communism is more or less equivalent to Bernsteinism in that it envisages nothing more radical than coalitions ( the Italian " historic compromise " ) and thus is to the right of traditional Social Democracy 's left wing .
( Compare the current positions of the " Marxist " Eric Hobsbawm and the " non-Marxist " Tony Benn in Britain ) .
To conclude : Stalinist " Marxism " has taken two forms .
The first , in Russia , was the ideology of the counter - revolutionary bureaucracy which established itself , in the name of socialism , as a state capitalist ruling class .
The second , principally in Europe , has evolved from being the ideology of bureaucratic agents of the first into the ideology of a section of the labour movement bureaucracy in its own right .
These two forms are different and cannot simply be equated  but on the fundamental question , the international workers ' revolution , the self - emancipation of the world working class , they are united in their opposition .
Neither is in any sense part of the genuine Marxist tradition .
In the Third World , Stalinist " Marxism " has evolved somewhat differently .

3 Third World nationalism
The first Marxist to recognise the significance of Third World national liberation movements was Lenin .
His analysis of imperialism demonstrated the " colonial and financial enslavement of the vast majority of the world 's population by an insignificant minority of the richest and advanced capitalist countries " [ 111 ] and showed that this enslavement would inevitably provoke a wave of revolts and wars of liberation .
What Lenin envisaged was a world alliance between the proletarian revolution , principally in the west , and the national liberation movements , principally in the east , to crus
Brown ' ignored 2004 warning on crisis '
Gordon Brown came under fire today when it emerged that he failed to act on a warning about a gaping hole in emergency planning to cope with a banking crisis .
Too little , too late : the disaster was seen as too remote in the boom years .
A bombshell official report revealed that the Treasury realised in 2004 that it did not have a proper plan to deal with a bank that ran out of ready cash and put the financial system under threat .
But at the height of the boom , it was decided that the threat was not important enough .
Just two years later the credit crunch brought Northern Rock to its knees and began a banking meltdown that drove the country into recession .
Conservatives and Liberal Democrats today turned the heat on the Prime Minister who , as Chancellor at the time , was in charge of decisions after the warnings were sounded .
Shadow treasury secretary Phillip Hammond said : ' The fact that Gordon Brown was head of the Treasury who were warned about the system 's inability to deal with this scenario but chose to ignore that warning says all you need to know about his lack of competence .
' This demonstrates why he is part of the problem , not the solution . '
Liberal Democrat shadow chancellor Vince Cable said : ' Gordon Brown had his head in the sand . '
The 2004 warning was revealed in a scathing report from the National Audit Office into the nationalisation of Northern Rock a year ago .
It disclosed that the tripartite regulators - the Treasury , the Bank of England and the FSA - decided to hold war - gaming exercises to test their ability to handle crises .
One of the first tests was of options if ' a major financial institution got into difficulty for liquidity reasons ' .
It went on : ' The report of the exercise noted that thinking was relatively underdeveloped as to how the resolution of an insolvent firm with systematic repercussions would be handled and by whom .
' It concluded that work was required to understand the issues they would face in dealing with an insolvent institution posing potential systemic risks to the financial system . '
But the NAO disclosed that the Treasury did not feel it was a likely enough danger .
' At this stage , work on improving the existing arrangements was not considered within the Treasury to be a priority , in the benign economic environment then prevailing , compared with other financial crisis planning that was being taken forward . '
In 2005 , the Tripartite authorities concluded more work was needed because its only options were to let a bank fail or to bail it out with taxpayers ' cash .
Further exercises were held in 2006 and 2007 - too late to draw up a plan for Northern Rock .
As the United States mobilized for war after mid-1940 , the governments demands for munitions and related resources began to put pressure on certain markets , and soon prices began to rise .
In 1941 they rose faster : from December 1940 to December 1941 , the producer price index increased by 17 percent , the consumer price index by 10 percent .
In response the government imposed a growing number of selective price controls , enforced by the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply , an agency created by executive order on April 11 , 1941 .
The Emergency Price Control Act of January 30 , 1942 , provided a statutory basis for a successor agency , the Office of Price Administration ( OPA ) .
Strengthened by later legislation and executive orders , the OPA eventually administered a price - control system that encompassed almost all civilian goods and services .
Thus from early in 1942 until late in 1946 , the OPA endeavored to control prices by administrative decree .
As the governments war outlays rose steeply and the incomes of a growing legion of war - industry workers rose along with them , consumer demand for goods and services increased rapidly .
If prices had been unregulated , this increasing demand would have pushed prices ever higher , especially given that the resources available for augmenting the supply of civilian goods were being depleted by the governments buildup of the armed forces and the war industries .
But because price controls eventually kept the legal prices of civilian goods and services from rising substantially , civilian markets became subject to excess demand and the available goods had to be rationed by nonprice means , such as first - come - first - served transactions and discrimination according to race , sex , and friendship .
Supplies of some goods including rubber products , sugar , and coffee had been diminished by Japanese capture of supply sources ( Malayan rubber plantations ) or by naval warfare or scarcity of shipping services ( German U - boats sank many U.S. merchant ships early in 1942 ) .
Government claims on rubber and tin cut further into supply , creating extreme excess demand for these goods .
Shortages arose for automobile , truck , and tractor tires as well as for sugar and coffeegoods obtained largely from Latin American sources .
Canned foods grew much scarcer because imports of Bolivian tin , used to coat the inside of cans , had been diminished by the increased shortage of shipping services .
Therefore , many consumers could not obtain certain goods they normally consumed , and workers and housewives grew restive .
To curb the growing dissatisfaction , the OPA subjected scores of basic goods and services ( which accounted for about one - seventh of all consumption spending ) to rationing , creating a two - price system .
To purchase a rationed good legally , the buyer had to surrender to the seller not only the ( controlled ) money price but also a stipulated amount of ration coupons or stamps ( points  ) .
The system quickly became complex , and it remained subject to periodic changes and to a variety of exemptions for certain classes of buyers and goods .
The table below shows the programs coverage and duration :
Rationed products Effective dates Sugar May 1942 to June 1947 Coffee November 1942 to July 1943 Processed foods March 1943 to August 1945 Meats , fats , canned fish , cheese , and canned milk March 1943 to November 1945 Rubber footwear ( six heavy - duty types ) October 1942 to September 1945 Shoes February 1943 to October 1945 Fuel oil and kerosene October 1942 to August 1945 Stoves December 1942 to August 1945 Solid fuels ( Pacific Northwest only ) September 1943 to August 1945 Tires January 1942 to December 1945 Automobiles February 1942 to October 1945 Gasoline ( initially East Coast only ) May 1942 to August 1945 Bicycles July 1942 to September 1944 Typewriters March 1942 to April 1944
Rationing greatly increased the transaction costs of shopping for ordinary goods .
Historian Richard R. Lingeman writes in Dont You Know Theres a War On ? ( 1970 ) :
For the housewife , the rationing system meant the mastery of a constantly changing system of point values in the papers ; while shopping , she kept one eye peeled on the monetary price and the other on the little red numerals posted on the shelf below products indicating their point price .
She practiced double budgeting : money and points .
She had to keep track of which stamps were valid during a certain time period , which were outdated , and what they might buy .
Mastering the prevailing stamp regime was only half the battle .
Lingeman writes ,  Housewives trekked from one market to another seeking meat for tonights supper ; some days they were lucky to get frankfurters .
All sorts of expedients cropped up in response to these shortages .
Lingeman continues ,  So in demand were [ frankfurters ] that OPA told meat - packers to stretch them with various fillers such as soybeans , potatoes or cracker meal .
Coffee also suffered the addition of various fillers .
Even gasoline was adulterated , with a substance known as Lubrigas .
Even so , gasoline along with sugar , butter , beef , pork , and baconat times disappeared from local markets .
Lingeman concludes that compared to the average level of peacetime living that most [ Americans ] were used to , they underwent hardships . 
So much for wartime prosperity .
Making Crime Pay
Price controls and rationing created opportunities , however , for people willing to break the law .
Active black markets developed all over the country .
Substantial proportions of all transactions in some goods especially beef and gasoline occurred illegally .
Housewives routinely bent the rules by trading , giving away , or selling ration stamps , which the law forbade .
Mobsters entered the scene en masse , stealing ration coupons from OPA offices and reselling them , counterfeiting ration coupons and selling them , and hijacking trucks and selling their cargos without collecting ration stamps .
Cattle rustling made a comeback .
Between February 11 , 1941 , and May 31 , 1947 , the OPA instituted 259,966 sanctions of various sorts .
 One in fifteen businesses wholesale , retail , service and so on was charged with illicit transactions ,  and one in five of all establishments in the country received some kind of warning short of criminal prosecution ,  according to Lingeman .
Of course , many violations escaped notice , even though the OPA enforcement corps included at various times 2,000 5,000 investigators , working under 500  1,000 attorneys , and many thousands of part - time volunteers .
As economic historian Hugh Rockoff notes ,  [ B ] lack - market activities do not leave good statistical records and any estimate must be viewed as having a wide margin of potential error . 
Yet he also remarks that  the appearance of deterioration and related evasive schemes in relatively homogeneous commodities ,  such as fuel oil , coal , and gasoline , testifies to the ubiquity of evasion . 
After an extensive study of wartime price controls during World War II , Rockoff concludes in his book Drastic Measures ( 1984 ) :  The modern state has the power to control prices even in the face of a vast expansion of aggregate demand relative to output , but it can do so only through a drastic regimentation of economic life .
Rationing was an important part of that regimentation .
A Vatican cleric is defending a Brazilian archbishop 's decision to excommunicate several doctors who performed an abortion last week on a nine - year - old girl who became pregnant with twins after alleged sexual abuse by her step - father .
" It is a sad case , but the real problem is that the twins conceived were two innocent persons , who had the right to live and could not be eliminated , '' Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re told the Italian daily La Stampa .
" Life must always be protected .
The attack on the Brazilian church is unjustified , " Re was quoted as saying .
He also heads the Pontifical Commission for Latin America .
The controversy erupted when media reported that a nine - year - old girl from the northeastern Brazilian state of Pernambuco had had an abortion to remove twin fetuses .
The girl and her family learned she was 15 weeks pregnant when she went to hospital complaining of pains .
The girl , who has not been identified , told authorities her step - father had sexually abused her since age six .
The 23 - year - old step - father is currently in police custody .
Doctors performed the abortion Wednesday , saying they feared the pregnancy could kill her because of her slim frame .
Upon learning of the abortion , the regional archbishop excommunicated the doctors , as well as the girl 's mother .
He did not excommunicate the step - father , saying the crime he is alleged to have committed , although deplorable , was not as bad as ending a fetus 's life .
" The law of God is higher than any human laws , " Archbishop Jose Cardoso Sobrinho said in an interview on Globo television .
" When a human law is against the law of God , that law has no value . "
Abortion is illegal in Brazil , which has more Catholics than any other country .
However , it can be carried out before the 20th week of pregnancy if the mother 's life is deemed in danger or if the baby was conceived through rape .
The controversy has continued up the government and religious hierarchy , with Brazil 's president and his ministers coming out in support of the girl .
On Friday , President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva denounced the church 's strict interpretation of the law .
" The doctors did what had to be done : save the life of a girl of nine years old , " Lula told news outlets .
That , in turn , brought out counter - condemnations from the Vatican .
" Excommunication for those who carried out the abortion is just , " Cardinal Re said .

Evil geniuses take note : a near - fatal robot attack only costs an organization about $ 3,000 in Sweden these days .
Swede online rag
The Local has reported that a factory north of Stockholm has been fined 25,000 kronor ( £ 2,100 ) after a malfunctioning bot nearly killed one of its workers .
The robo - assault reportedly took place in 2007 , when a man attempted to repair a defective machine used to lift rocks without properly checking the power supply beforehand .
And unfortunately , the human head is n't all that different than a big juicy rock to such a robot .
Unsympathetic to the worker 's accidental lack of proper lock - out / tag - out procedure , the machine dutifully latched on to the man 's head and went about its work .
The man managed to " defend himself " from the robot , according to The Local , but not before suffering serious injuries .
" The man was very lucky .
He broke four ribs and came close to losing his life , " public prosecutor Leif Johansson told the news agency Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå .
Johansson had considered pressing charges against the company , but recently concluded a simple fine should do .
" I 've never heard of a robot attacking somebody like this , " he said .
Johansson reportedly blamed the company for inadequate safety procedures , but saved some share of the guilt for the injured worker .
The robot apparently got off scot - free for his brief - but no doubt satisfying - revenge against its fleshy overlords . ®
Socially Responsible Investing for “ Values ” Investors
Yesterday was Earth Day , and the event encouraged many people to start thinking about their investments and whether or not they support companies that have policies and practices that are environmentally friendly and socially responsible .
Socially responsible investing is growing in popularity as an increasing number of people wish to embrace an investment strategy that takes the good of society into account as well as returns .
The practice of socially responsible investing in the Americas goes all the way back to the middle of the 18th Century , when Quakers insisted that their congregants avoid investments in enterprises related to the slave trade .
Today , socially responsible investing encompasses an awareness of whether a company has practices in line with diversity , transparent and ethical corporate governance , consumer protection , environmentally sustainable efforts and human rights .
Socially responsible investing can also include choosing investments based on how well they align with religious beliefs ; Christian and Muslim investing are two growing strategies within the religious financial realm .
Socially Responsible Mutual Funds and Exchange Traded Funds
One way to make socially responsible investments is to choose mutual funds and exchange traded funds ( ETFs ) composed of companies that have approved practices .
Most socially responsible funds and ETFs do not include companies that do business with countries that violate human rights , such as Somalia or Sudan .
Additionally , many funds avoid including companies that represent “ sin ” stocks , such as tobacco , alcohol or gambling .
It is also possible to choose funds , such as the The Sierra Club mutual fund , that avoids including companies that pollute excessively .
You can find a number of socially conscious funds , and their criteria , on SocialFunds.com .
It is possible to use the criteria posted by a fund to determine how closely it aligns with your values .
The downside to socially responsible mutual funds is that the fees are often higher than other funds .
Imagine an actively managed fund , and then add 0.5 % to 1 % to the fee .
The argument , of course , is that as soon as the fund starts increasing its returns , the fees will be reduced .
But I would n’t count on it .
For those who want to combine two investing trends , it is possible to invest in socially responsible ETFs .
There are a number of exchange traded funds that include companies with approved social practices , as well as funds that include only companies that are related to the production of clean energy .
And , finally , there are socially responsible index funds .
These funds track indexes such as the Domini 400 Social Index and the Citizens Index .
There are a number of indexes now ( including the Dow Jones Sustainability Index ) that are composed solely of socially responsible companies .
The fees on socially responsible ETFs and index funds are generally lower than the fees charged by their mutual fund counterparts .
Investing in socially responsible companies
If you are interested in investing in individual companies , it is possible to find companies that are socially responsible .
One of the easiest things to do is to look at which companies are included in funds and on socially responsible indexes .
In order to be included , companies have to meet certain criteria .
However , it is a good idea to check the criteria the funds set ; some only require a very small threshold of policy that may not be stringent enough for some socially conscious investors .
And some socially responsible investors decry the inclusion of some oil and nuclear power companies in a few of the environmentally friendly funds .
Another place to look for socially responsible investing ideas is SustainableBusiness.com .
This site keeps track of sustainable companies , putting out lists of the most sustainable stocks available .
Many of the stocks are reasonably good performers , appearing on top stock indexes around the world .
Indeed , it is possible to diversify a socially responsible stock portfolio to include small cap and large cap companies , as well as domestic and foreign companies .
( CNN ) --
A central Colombian farm worker has been accused of raping his daughter for decades and fathering eight children with her .
The daughter , 35 - year - old Alba Nidia , told CNN that her biological father has sexually abused her since she was about 5 , shortly after her mother 's death , resulting in 14 pregnancies .
Eight children -- five girls and three boys -- survived .
Her father , Arcedio Alvarez Quintero , is being held in jail to face charges of sexual abuse , incest and aggravated sexual assault .
Alvarez and his family live near the town of Mariquita in the western province of Tolima , and the local media have dubbed him a " monster . "
The case has been likened to that of Josef Fritzl , the 73 - year - old Austrian who was sentenced this month to life in prison for imprisoning and raping his daughter in his basement over 24 years , during which time she gave birth to seven children .
Alvarez 's lawyer , Ricardo Correa , told CNN affiliate Caracol that his client appeared Saturday before a judge , who read the three charges .
The judge ruled that the case against Alvarez was strong enough for him to be jailed with special protection as he awaits trial .
No trial date has been scheduled .
Caracol reported that Alvarez entered " innocent " pleas to the charges .
Correa did not respond to CNN requests for an interview .
According to Caracol , the 59 - year old Alavarez told the court he is innocent .
Correa told Caracol that his client 's defense " will be that Alba Nidia is not his biological daughter , " but his adopted child .
Nidia insists that she is his daughter .
Authorities plan to conduct blood tests to determine the two 's genetic relationship , local officials said .
" I feel confused -- knowing that he has been arrested , he is still my father , " Nidia told CNN in a phone interview .
" But I think it 's the right thing to do . "
She added that , " The children do n't talk about this situation .
They are silent much of the time . "
Gilma Jimenez , a local councilwoman who has had close contact with Nidia , has offered her financial assistance and has been speaking out against child abuse .
" One of the tragedies of this whole story , is that it seems that many different people in the community knew about this situation , but no one said anything , " Jimenez told CNN .
" This is the indifference , the silence that encourages more child abuse . "
Nidia said that " problems in the house " forced her to run away from the home she shared with her father nine months ago , taking her five daughters -- the youngest of whom was less than a year old -- and her 5 - year - old son .
She moved to a nearby town and worked 15 hours a day at a restaurant .
" For this job , for all of those hours , she earns a miserable wage of under $ 3 a day , " said Hugo Parra , an investigator with Jimenez 's office .
" We 've been sending her money , just so she can survive . "
If Alvarez is convicted , he could receive as little as eight years , Jimenez said .
" This is not enough .
...
We have failed our children in Colombia , " she said .
Jimenez added that Alvarez is receiving special protection in the jail , saying , " Criminals will tolerate any crime , except child abuse .
I 'm sure all the other prisoners are waiting to try to get to him . "
This case comes as Colombia is weighing whether to change the constitution to punish convicted child abusers with up to life imprisonment .
A campaign calling for a referendum on the issue says it has collected more than 2 million signatures .

Blame D.L. Hughley .
If you got fed up with the non -stop Rush Limbaugh coverage last week , point your finger at him .
He 's the soon - to - be- exiting CNN host who made a simple statement last week that resulted in Limbaugh taking precedence over everything .
Everything .
Man of Steele
Well , GOP Chairman Michael Steele played a part in it too .
Perhaps his pride was injured when Hughley said Limbaugh was the de facto leader of the Republican party .
And you know the rest .
Steele said he deserved that title and called Limbaugh an entertainer who could get incendiary and ugly .
BOOM .
Everything has taken a back seat since then .
Not even rumors of Jennifer Aniston being pregnant can get the proper coverage it deserves .
1600 Penn
Watch David Shuster on MSNBC 's 1600 Pennsylvania .
His favorite topic this week ?
Limbaugh .
Every night he 's asking Republicans why they wo n't denounce the talk show host for saying he wants President Obama to fail .
Perhaps it 's because they do n't want to fulfill Rahm Emanuel 's prophecy that you 'll end up apologizing to the radio host if you take him on .
Look at Emanuel 's track record .
Miss Cleo better hope Rahm does n't get an 800 number .
Ron Paul
Texas Congressman and former presidential candidate Ron Paul was a guest of Shuster 's last week and would n't take his bait .
But , unlike most Republicans , he was n't afraid to criticize Limbaugh .
( video below )
Further , he said he would debate him .
" I was disappointed with Rush because he is a good conservative , yet he hardly said hardly boo against George Bush , " Paul said .
" He supported all that big spending .
Did he complain about George Bush ?
Did he complain about all those wars that were going on that caused us so much trouble ?
" That 's the kind of issues that I want to talk about .
And I will be quite willing to challenge Rush Limbaugh on those issues .
But just to pick out a word or two and say , he is wrong , I do n't think that solves any problems . "
Paul 's comments did n't satisfy Shuster .
The MSNBC host asked him at least four times to say Rush was wrong .
He would n't .
But he came closer to that rail than most .
The GOP
Paul said Republicans should n't be " terrified " of Limbaugh , but said the real problem is internal .
" We talk about personal liberties and balanced budgets .
The Republican Party lost credibility because they did n't do any of that , " he said .
" It violated the privacy of individuals , it flaunted the spending and ran up these huge deficits .
Got us into wars that are not winnable .
And those are the real issues . "
More Paul
It 's been a full week since Hughley created the firestorm of discussion .
Can he do it again tonight ?
With Ron Paul scheduled to appear , Hughley 's got a chance .

The UK is on red alert for further local measures after a record high in the number of daily coronavirus cases , with health chiefs set to consider new measures next week to further restrict mixing between households in London .
Merseyside is said to be one of the areas poised to join the north east under tougher restrictions which ban households mixing indoors .
Four North Wales local authority areas – Denbighshire , Flintshire , Conwy and Wrexham – will go into lockdown from 6 pm on Thursday .

Letter From the CAW to Chrysler :
PORT ELGIN , ON , April 17 / CNW / -
The past week has seen an unprecedented
and outrageous series of attacks on Canadian autoworkers and their union .
One
after another , business executives and political leaders , working clearly in
tandem , have lined up to denounce the CAW 's role in the auto restructuring
process , and to demand that we accept up to $ 19 per hour in concessions or
else face massive job losses and economic dislocation .
We heard earlier from Fiat CEO Sergio Marchionne , Federal Industry
Minister Tony Clement , and Chrysler Canada CEO Reid Bigland .
The letter
distributed in Chrysler plants today from Robert Nardelli and Tom LaSorda , a
clear attempt to sidestep and undermine the CAW , is the most offensive yet .
Let me remind these businesses and political leaders , and the public at
large , of some key facts in this debate :
- Canada has been an incredibly successful and profitable place for
Chrysler to do business in .
In addition to several billions of
dollars in profits generated here over past decades , the company 's
current activities in Canada are truly enviable .
Chrysler enjoys
significantly lower hourly labour costs , and higher labour
productivity , in its Canadian plants than in its U.S. plants .
It
enjoys a very high market share among Canadian consumers ( in fact , in
February it sold more vehicles than any other automaker for the first
time in history ) .
Canada 's health care system , infrastructure ,
education system , and research facilities have been and continue to
be immensely valuable to this company .
Canadians deserve better than
to be threatened by a company which has enjoyed billions of dollars
in profits here .
- Far from being " inflexible " and " intransigent , " the CAW has been pro-
active , creative , and constructive in our response to the financial
crisis which has enveloped our industry .
In May 2008 we negotiated a
forward - looking contract , months ahead of the contract deadline ,
which saved the industry $ 300 million per year .
Then this March ,
following government instructions that we had to be " part of the
solution , " we negotiated ( for the second time in ten months ) the
contract all over again .
We settled with GM on provisions which will
reduce active labour costs by several dollars per hour , and will
eliminate a billion dollars of so - called " legacy costs . "
GM itself
confirmed that this contract meets the goal of preserving Canada's
investment advantage .
Our labour costs will continue to be lower than
average of all the suppliers selling into the North American market .
On top of that , our productivity is consistently superior .
- Every time we negotiate a new agreement , however , the goalposts are
shifted by companies who sense an opportunity to inflict long - term
damage on the credibility and influence of the union .
We could have
reached a valuable new contract with Chrysler , prior to the original
March 31 deadline that would have provided substantial savings to the
company ( including Chrysler - specific productivity and operational
changes worth several dollars per hour ) .
But the company , after
accepting our offers , always wanted more ; with President Obama's
announcement on March 30 , our talks were put on the back burner .
- Now we face the prospect of our own federal government interfering in
our negotiations , which were already complex and difficult to begin
with .
The federal government has linked arms with the employers to
demand exactly the same concessions .
Seeing our own government
echoing perfectly the painful demands made on hard - working , tax -
paying Canadians by the executives of multinational corporations is
deeply troubling .
Worse yet , by clearly taking sides in private
negotiations between an employer and the union , and hence emboldening
the company to keep asking for more , the federal government is making
it harder to reach a deal .
- We do not accept Chrysler 's claim that the work of CAW members costs
$ 76 per hour .
This is an inflated and artificial figure that includes
many non-relevant factors , such as expenses associated with retirees
who have not worked at Chrysler for years , and payroll taxes which
are paid to government not to workers .
Perhaps most galling of all ,
Chrysler 's number even includes the proportional cost of downtime and
lay - offs .
In essence , we are being " charged " for our own
unemployment .
The best way to reduce that artificial $ 76 number is to
put Chrysler workers back to work : that alone would reduce hourly
costs by several dollars per hour .
- And we do not remotely accept the claim that there is cost gap of up
to $ 19 per hour between our facilities and non-union auto assembly
plants in Canada .
The Canadian executives of Toyota and Honda have
described many times their strategy of essentially matching wages ,
pensions , and core benefits to those paid in CAW - represented
facilities ( as a key part of their long - term effort to avoid
unionization ) .
- Remember , the restructuring of Chrysler and the other companies is a
complex , high - stakes process .
Chrysler 's future will ultimately be
decided by bond - holders ( who have yet to accept any concessions ) and
governments .
The more we give up , the less bondholders and other
vested interests will have to sacrifice .
- The CAW has a proven track record of ensuring that Canadian plants
are competitive within North America .
It is no accident that Canada
has attracted more than its share of new investment , and why our
share of total continental production has actually grown in recent
years ( despite the industry 's overall challenges ) .
We will work to
defend the interests of Canadian autoworkers - both union and non -
union ( since remember , any reductions in CAW wages and benefits will
quickly be reflected in matching rollbacks in wages and benefits at
Toyota and Honda ) .
We will ensure that Canadian plants retain their
investment advantage .
If Chrysler or any other company goes into
bankruptcy protection ( an increasingly likely prospect , given the
stalemate with bondholders in the U.S. ) , it will not be because of
us .
The top dogs at Chrysler sent a letter to the Canadian Auto Workers union that essentially said that the automaker needed wage concessions of $ 19 per hour , or else it was Game Over .
As a further way to apply pressure , Chrysler 's letter frequently referenced the U.S. and Canadian governments as heavies , all of them now waiting for the CAW to provide the necessary " support .
"
In response , CAW members burned the letter , but not before making notes so it could pen a response of its own .
In an official response , CAW President Ken Lewenza calls Chrysler 's missive " the most offensive attempt yet " to undermine the CAW , then decries statements made by the Canadian government about the situation .
He follows that with a point - by - point defense of the CAW 's cost and efficiency , and accuses Chrysler of not only playing with the numbers , but of changing the rules every time a game is agreed upon .
He finishes by stating that instead of looking at the CAW , Chrysler should be speaking to its bondholders who , so far , appear to have been left out of game of sacrifice .
You can read those and the rest of his thoughts in the full letter after the jump .

We ’re all in this together , folks .
This is a rant about the greed that permeates the American political landscape .
In fact the very core of who we are as a nation and a people .
Until we re-regulate our glorious corporate overlords , our condition - the Human Condition - in this country and on this planet remains in the hands of a select group of sociopathic plutocrats that care nothing of their nation and only about their personal fortunes .
Self appointed Masters of the Universe who do n’t seem to realize that their gene pool has been diminished and dulled by decades of greed , avarice and a sense of entitlement .
All born on 3rd base , swearing they hit a triple .
We Were RIght .
They will devour themselves .
My only hope is that the rest of us survive the feast .
Microsoft has accompanied the third of its anti-Apple commercials with a creative document detailing what it calls the ‘ Apple Tax ’ .
The latest ad follows the same theme : ‘ ordinary ’ shoppers ( this time a mother and son ) head out with a $ 1,500 budget and wind up choosing a PC over a Mac .
This time the requirements are for a fast computer suitable for gaming , though the child is swayed to a PC laptop because of its Blu-ray capabilities .
As usual , the Mac is dismissed as pretty but inadequate and expensive .
Here is the ad :
With the shock value of the direct attack gone , online reaction has been somewhat muted .
It seems that for future ads to have much impact , Microsoft needs to tweak the concept , perhaps getting much more specific about why a particular PC is better than a particular Mac .
Meanwhile Microsoft has taken the concept of the Apple Tax , a line created by the firm ’s consumer marketing chief in an interview last October and turned it into a very literal marketing program .
The firm has put out an 11 - page study claiming that an average family buying two PCs rather than two Macs would save $ 3,367 over the following five years , and even produced a dummy IRS form itemising the costs .
Only around half the supposed savings come from the purchase price of the machines .
The rest come from software , support and various upgrades .
However , several points are either confusing or plain misleading .
For example , when it comes to office software the study assumes the buyer already has a copy of Microsoft Office from owning a PC but would have to pay to buy Mac equivalents .
In other words , it ’s a comparison of the cost of switching from a PC to a Mac , not a straight comparison starting from scratch .
That may be a realistic scenario for many would - be Mac buyers , but it ’s certainly not fair : after all , a Mac user switching to a PC would face a similar ‘ Microsoft Tax ’ on software .
The figures also include costs for the MobileMe service and in - store Apple care , but do n’t take into account PC equivalents or free alternatives for Mac users .
Ironically this appears to be one of the rare situations where added detail makes a much less convincing case .
Close study of the ‘ Apple Tax ’ reports leave you with the feeling that Microsoft is greatly exaggerating the genuine price differences .
The TV spots , however simplified and manipulated , at least make a more credible general point that Macs are usually more expensive .
Engineers from energy supplier Ecotricity are investigating why a blade more than 20 meters ( 66 ft ) long fell off the turbine at a wind farm in Conisholme Fen , Lincolnshire , early on Sunday morning .
In the meantime , locals are coming to their own conclusions after many of them saw strange flashing tentacle shaped lights above the wind farm on the night before the damage occurred .
John Harrison , a resident of nearby Saltfleetby , said he looked out of his window on Saturday night to see “ a massive ball of light , ” and “ tentacles going right down to the ground ” over the site .
“ It was huge ” he said “ At first I thought it must have been a hole where the moon was shining through but then I saw the tentacles – it looked just like an octopus .
Just ask the inventors of these products , each one having changed the way we live , and each one having come about either by serendipity or complete fuck - up .

5 The Microwave Oven
The microwave oven , aka the " Popcorn and Hot Pockets Warmer , " was a happy accident that came from , of all things , a weapons program .
Percy LeBaron Spencer was a self - educated engineer working on radar technology in the years following WWII .
The technology in question was the sci - fi sounding magnetron , a piece of machinery capable of firing high intensity beams of radiation .

Above : a scientist , with robot .
Apparently , P.L.S. , as some have called him , had a bit of a sweet tooth .
Or a strange fetish .
Either way , he had a candy bar in his pants while he was in the lab one day .
The self - proclaimed engineer noticed that the chocolate bar had melted when he was working with the magnetron .
Spencer disregarded the simple idea that his body heat had melted the chocolate in favor of the less logical and therefore more scientific conclusion that invisible rays of radiation had " cooked it " somehow .
A sane man would stop at this point and realize these magical heat rays were landing just inches from his tender scrotum .
Indeed , most of the military experts on hand probably dreamed of the battlefield applications of their new Dick - Melting Ray .
But like all men of science , Spencer was fascinated and treated his discovery like a novelty .
He used it to make eggs explode and pop kernels of corn ( " Imagine , a future where a building full of workers in cubicles eat this all day ! " )

I proclaim myself to be awesome .
Spencer continued to experiment with the magnetron until he boxed it in and marketed it as a new way to cook food .
The initial version of the microwave was roughly six feet tall , weighed in around 750 pounds and had to be cooled with water .
But they got it down to size , and today we use it mostly to destroy random objects on YouTube .
Sir Fred 's pension has been a major controversy
There is uncertainty about whether Sir Fred Goodwin will pay back a £ 2.7 m advance on his £ 16.9 m pension pot .
Earlier on Tuesday , Treasury Minister Lord Myners told MPs that Sir Fred had pocketed that amount .
In response , RBS said its former chief executive might return the advance if certain conditions are met .
The issue has deflected attention away from Lord Myners role in the approval of Sir Fred 's pension after the government stepped in to rescue RBS .
Lord Myners reiterated that he had not approved Sir Fred 's pension deal .
Tax assurance Sir Fred resigned from RBS in October after the bank needed a government rescue , and has continued to refuse to agree to have his pension reduced .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
BBC Business Editor Robert Peston said Sir Fred 's £ 2.7 m pension advance had actually been worth £ 4.5 m , because RBS had agreed to pay his £ 1.8 m tax liability on it .
He added that Sir Fred has agreed to pay back the money , " so long as he can get an assurance from HM Revenue & Customs that the tax man wo n't come after him for the ... tax that would - in theory - still be due " .
Such an assurance has not been forthcoming .
If Sir Fred ends up keeping the £ 2.7 m , his annual pension income would go down from £ 703,000 a year to £ 555,000 , but its overall value would not be reduced .
' Beyond comprehension ' Lord Myners has found himself at the centre of the storm surrounding Sir Fred 's pension after accusations that he effectively signed off the £ 16.9 m package .
Speaking to the Treasury Committee on Wednesday he once again denied that this had been the case .
" The decision on the pension was made by the board directors of RBS .
I made no decision , " he said .
Lord Myners said he had been " very clear " with RBS and the other banks that there should be " no rewards for failure " and that payments for departing directors should be minimised .
He added that it was " beyond my comprehension " that RBS directors had not exercised their discretion to reduce Sir Fred 's pension .
" Someone at RBS took the decision to treat him [ Sir Fred ] more favourably than required , " said Lord Myners .
' Quite straightforward '
He said RBS was wrong to think it had no choice but to give Sir Fred his full pension from the age of 50 , because this arrangement should only have been available to employees voluntarily retiring early .
" Sir Fred Goodwin did n't have the option of staying .
The board had decided he must go , " he said .
He added that the RBS board could have dismissed Sir Fred with just 12 months salary .
" It would have been a quite straightforward and simple thing to have done , " said Lord Myners .
As an expert in pension funds , Lord Myners became financial services minister in October 2008 , as the government was negotiating taking large stakes in RBS , Lloyds TSB and HBOS .
Last month , RBS reported that it made a loss of £ 24.1 bn in 2008 - the largest annual loss in UK corporate history .
The government now owns a 68 % stake in the lender .

Savant - like skills , such as astounding memory , perfect pitch or the ability to multiply very high numbers together , may be much more common among people with autism than previously thought .
A new study of about 100 adults with autism shows that one third have skills that stand out , both in comparison with their other abilities and with the skills of the general population .
Previous studies put the prevalence of savantism in autistic people as around 1 in 10 .
“ People often focus on the things people with autism ca n’t do , ” says Patricia Howlin of the Institute of Psychiatry at King ’s College in London , who led the study .
“ One of the things our study illustrates is that these are people who do have special skills but they are not being used . ”
The notion of the savant – someone who has a skill that is exceptional both compared to the general population and to that person ’s other skills – has long captured the imagination of cognitive scientists and the general public alike .
But despite this fascination , the connection between autism and savantism remains mysterious .
Advertisement
Some studies indicate that there are more savants within the autistic population than among the general population and among the populations of people with other mental difficulties .
Putting an exact figure on the prevalence of such special skills among people with autism , however , has proved difficult .
Outstanding skills
In an attempt to quantify this , Howlin ’s team looked at two different measures of exceptional ability in a group of people with autism – all now adults – who the team have been studying periodically since they were first diagnosed between 1950 and 1985 .
They found that 39 met criteria for either what they call a “ savant skill ” or an “ exceptional cognitive skill ” .
To identify savant skills , the researchers sent the parents of the autistic adults a questionnaire asking them to identify and describe , using specific examples , any outstanding skills and talents that were present “ at a level that would be unusual even for normal people ” .
Of almost 100 parents who replied , about half ( 45 ) claimed that their child had a special skill .
But only 24 met the researchers ’ tough criteria for what constitutes a savant skill : both exceptional in terms of population norms and above the individual ’s overall level of ability .
Relying on parents ’ anecdotal reports of skills could be risky .
However , Francesca Happe , also at the Institute of Psychiatry but not involved in the study , says that the team ’s criteria were “ pretty strict ” :
“ They did n’t count anything that could conceivably be considered a normal skill .
I do n’t think the parental reports are inflated . ”
Searching for savants
Among those skills considered at the savant level were : being able to name the elevation of both the sun and the moon at any time of day , on any specified date ; being able to name the day of the week for any date in the distant past or future ( a fairly common savant ability known as calendrical calculation ) ; perfect pitch ; and the ability to say , from a single chord , which piece of music it came from .
To identify exceptional cognitive ability , Howlin ’s team also examined the volunteers ’ scores on standard intelligence tests consisting of a range of subtests aimed at different aspects of IQ , such as arithmetic , spatial and motor skills and memory span .
They found that 23 had an ability on at least one of these subtests that was well above the general population ’s average score on that subtest .
Eight of these 23 had also been identified as a mathematical or calendrical savant according to the first criteria , and the team concludes that overall 28.5 % – or almost one third – of their volunteers had either a savant skill or an exceptional cognitive ability .
“ I think it is a surprisingly high number , but believable , ” says Happe .
She says that the study opens a window into the mind of a child with autism and recommends using these isolated , exceptional abilities as a way to motivate people with autism to learn other skills – such as social or communication ones – that might not come as easily .
One in ten ?
Darold Treffert , a psychiatrist based in Fond du Lac , Wisconsin who studies savants , says that he sticks by an earlier estimate of the prevalence of savantism as being one in ten among people with autism .
This is based on previous studies and backed up by his own observations .
He says this is partly because he is mistrustful of parental reports , and partly because he does not think that the peak ability in the intelligence subtests qualifies someone as a savant .
“ Some autistic savants do well on IQ subtests , but not all autistic persons who do well on IQ subtests are savant . ”
But he says the study is interesting , because it underscores the failings of IQ tests to measure overall intelligence .
“ We are all made up of a series of intelligences , especially the savant , and IQ measures one component , ” he says .
“ Savants starkly challenge our definition of ‘ intelligence ’ and require us to look for ways to measure other ‘ intelligences ’ . ”
“ We need a more reliable definition of savant syndrome , and a more reliable definition of intelligence , ” he adds .

In a piece titled Connecting the Dots : The Link Between Gay Marriage and Mass Murders , Robert Peters the president of Morality in America , argued that same sex marriage is a part of the moral decline in American society which has led to an increase in mass murders .
Mr. Peters blamed the media for creating a secular values system that has replaced Judeo - Christian values , “ For many citizens , what has replaced Judeo - Christian faith and values is the secular value system that is reflected in films , rap / music lyrics , and videogames and on TV and now the Internet , where the taking of human life for just about any reason is commonplace and is often portrayed in an appealing manner and in realistic detail .
Murder motivated by hatred and revenge is also justified . ”
The media has caused a loss of religious values which has led to the success of the same sex marriage movement , “ This secular value system is also reflected in the ‘ sexual revolution , ’ which is the driving force behind the push for ‘ gay marriage ; ’ and the Iowa Supreme Court decision is another indication that despite all the damage this revolution has caused to children , adults , family life and society ( think abortion , divorce , pornography , rape , sexual abuse of children , sexually transmitted diseases , trafficking in women and children , unwed teen mothers and more ) , it continues to advance relentlessly . ”
Advertisements
He points out that he is n’t blaming same sex marriage for murder , but he is blaming the gay marriage movement for the decline in values that has brought about the recent mass murder incidents , “ It most certainly is not my intention to blame the epidemic of mass murders on the gay rights movement !
It is my intention to point out that the success of the sexual revolution is inversely proportional to the decline in morality ; and it is the decline of morality ( and the faith that so often under girds it ) that is the underlying cause of our modern day epidemic of mass murders . ”
In summary , Bob Peters believes that there is a connection between the same sex marriage movement and the decline in values in American society .
He is arguing that if America had better , in other words , religious values the gay marriage movement would not be successful and mass murders would not occur .
Of course , the flaw in his tattered logic is that he assumes that gay people have no values , because of their lifestyle .
He is assuming that sexuality is a choice , and he is equating the choice to be gay with the choice to commit mass murder .
People like Bob Peters give all Republicans a bad name .
The people I wonder about are those individuals who are homosexual conservatives of faith .
In Peters ’ mind these people do n’t exist , but we all know that they do .
In fact some of these very same men have served , or if rumors are to be believed are serving the Republican Party in Congress .
The social conservative movement has fallen so far out of step with American society , that after enjoying the spotlight for more than a decade , they are descending back into being a fringe movement , which good news for anyone who does n’t want to live in a Christian theocracy .

Moments later , the vehicles – looking like the offspring of a submarine and a tank – burst through the surf , surging forward as their treads bit into the sand .
The hydraulic brakes slammed into action , and the rear of the vehicles opened , disgorging more than 100 troops from eight countries .

“ Shape up over there ! ”
Overhead , a brace of helicopters rented the sky .
The assault on the beach at Mayport Naval Station was part of the Marine ’s Partnership of the Americas exercise , held in conjunction with the Navy ’s Unitas exercise .
“ It ’s really a learning environment for everybody , ” said Col. Jay Huston , commanding officer of the task force doing the exercise .
During the past week , the troops – Marines from the U.S. and six countries in Central and South America , as well as soldiers from Canada – worked together at Camp Blanding , fast - roping out of helicopters , firing weapons and sharing tactics .

BEIJING  Last Saturday was tomb - sweeping day , when the Chinese traditionally honor the dead .
Sun Wenguang , a 75 - year - old retired professor , was one of many to visit the cemetery .
Apparently , though , he chose the wrong death to commemorate .
He came to remember Zhao Ziyang , a former prime minister and Communist Party general secretary who lost his party position and his freedom after sympathizing with student - led , pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 .
Mr. Zhao , who died in 2005 , is a martyr to some democracy advocates .
As Mr. Sun entered the cemetery in Jinan , a city about 230 miles south of Beijing , he said , four or five men attacked him and beat him severely .
He is now in a Jinan hospital with three broken ribs and injuries to his spine , head , back , arms and legs , according to China Human Rights Defenders , a Hong Kong - based group .
The group said the attack on Mr. Sun was part of a concerted effort by the Chinese government to head off any efforts to memorialize the deaths of hundreds of Tiananmen Square protesters on June 4 , the 20th anniversary of the government ’s crackdown .
“ Chinese authorities are staging a campaign of terror to intimidate and suppress expressions of commemoration for the 1989 Tiananmen massacre , ” the group said in a statement .
The attack on Mr. Sun “ is part of the overall campaign , ” it said .

Each year , around 15 million children fall ill with rheumatic heart disease worldwide ; half a million of them die as a consequence .
At the beginning of the medical cases of these children stands a simple throat infection with streptococcus – spherical bacteria responsible for causing a range of different infections .
However , it is only certain streptococcal strains that trigger a whole chain of reactions in the body that culminates in the life - threatening rheumatic heart disease .
These bacteria carry a special protein sequence , the so - called PARF motif , on their surface .
Singh Chhatwal and his colleague Patric Nitsche - Schmitz of the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research ( HZI ) in Braunschweig illustrate the role played by PARF in the development of rheumatic heart disease .
With this knowledge they are developing a test system that is able to recognise and prevent the disease at an early stage .
" PARF means ' peptide associated with rheumatic fever ' , " explains Nitsche - Schmitz .
" It is a small section from a bacterial surface protein , which is used by the streptococcus to adhere to our cells and cause disease . "
Rheumatic fever develops from harmless sore throats amongst children in India , Australia and Africa in particular .
The reason : inadequate medical treatment .
If children with a streptococcus infection in the throat receive no or inadequate antibiotic treatment , then the surviving bacteria with the PARF sequence on their surface will adhere to their collagen .
Collagen is present throughout the body – as a major component of bone and cartillage it determines shape and structure of our body and it strengthens the connective tissue of the skin , the heart valves and blood vessels with its high resistance to tensile forces .
Adhesion of PARF - bearing streptococci to collagen confuses our immune system and our body 's defence system not only targets the bacteria , but also healthy and vital collagen .
The auto - immune disease rheumatic fever breaks out .
If this in turn also fails to be treated correctly , the consequence is rheumatic heart disease : the heart valves , rich in collagen , become inflamed and cease to function .
Overall , only around five percent of all throat infections with streptococci result in an auto - immune disease .
In order to filter out these five percent and treat them at an early stage , the Braunschweig infection researchers are developing a simple test strip that reacts to the PARF motif .
" We hope that this will soon give us a test system that we can use for examination of children on a routine basis , " says Singh Chhatwal : " This would save the lives of a lot of children . "

The Supreme Court has long struggled to balance the privacy rights of students against schools ’ need to keep campuses safe .
On Tuesday , the court hears arguments in a suit brought on behalf of a 13 - year - old girl who was strip - searched based on a fellow student ’s false report that she had possessed ibuprofen pain - relief pills .
The invasion of privacy was extreme and the security rationale weak .
The court should rule , as a lower appellate court did , that the search was unconstitutional .
Savana Redding was an honors student at a middle school in Safford , Ariz . , with a clean discipline record .
A friend of Savana ’s , who was found in possession of pain relievers , told school authorities that Savana had given her 400 - milligram ibuprofen pills , a prescription - level dose of the pain reliever in over - the - counter Advil and Motrin , used to treat headaches and menstrual cramps .
Based on this information , a male assistant principal had Savana taken out of class and strip - searched by two female employees .
Savana was told to pull her bra in a way that exposed her breasts , and to pull out her underwear to expose her pelvic area .
Savana , who was too scared to refuse , later called the search “ the most humiliating experience ” in her life .
No drugs were found .
The great - great grandfather said : " I love it here , it is my home .

Twitter Clients Are a UI Design Playground
Twitter ’s elevation into the mainstream has , predictably , spawned a backlash against the service .
To paraphrase the great Yogi Berra , “ Nobody uses Twitter anymore ; it ’s too popular . ”
The most interesting product of Twitter ’s popularity , to me , has been the explosion of Twitter API client software .
There are a slew of cross-platform Adobe Air - based clients , including Twhirl and TweetDeck .
TweetDeck in particular appears to be the most popular interface for Twitter other than the Twitter.com web site .
( One could be forgiven for assuming the entire point of Air is to serve as a runtime for cross- platform Twitter clients . )
There are dozens of native iPhone Twitter clients in the App Store .
And in just the past two months , a number of new native Mac clients have appeared , including Nambu , Canary , Bluebird , and of course , Tweetie .
And on both the iPhone and Mac , there ’s Twitterrific .
There are several factors that make Twitter a nearly ideal playground for UI design .
The obvious ones are the growing popularity of the service itself and the relatively small scope of a Twitter client .
Twitter is such a simple service overall , but look at a few screenshots of these apps , especially the recent ones , and you will see some very different UI designs , not only in terms of visual style but in terms of layout , structure , and flow .
I ’m not saying it ’s easy to write a good Twitter client .
In fact , that ’s the point — that it is not easy to write a good client for something as small in scope as Twitter hints at just how hard it is to write a good app for anything , let alone something truly complex .
Less obvious is the fact that different people seek very different things from a Twitter client .
TweetDeck , for example , is clearly about showing more at once .
Tweetie is about showing less .
That I prefer apps like Tweetie and Twitterrific does n’t mean I think they ’re better .
There is so much variety because various clients are trying to do very different things .
Asking for the “ best Twitter client ” is like asking for the “ best shirt ” .
Also , Twitter is a nearly ideal service for the iPhone .
Yes , yes , Twitter was originally conceived with “ mobile phones ” in mind , hence the SMS gateway .
But on a phone without a good web browser you ’re missing half the fun ( at least for the sort of thing I enjoy about Twitter ) because you do n’t have a way to follow the links people tweet .
I read web sites and email and RSS feeds on my iPhone , but Twitter is the one service where reading on my iPhone does n’t feel constrained compared to reading on my Mac .
Put another way , MobileSafari is a good web browser for the iPhone , MobileMail is a good email client for the iPhone , but my favorite few iPhone Twitter clients are just plain good Twitter clients , with no need for a “ for the iPhone ” qualification .
It does n’t feel limiting to only use Twitter from my iPhone .
But perhaps the most important factor that has made Twitter such a rich category for client software is that there is so little friction to switch between apps .
There ’s nothing to import or export , and zero commitment .
As Tweetie author Loren Brichter said in an interview with Macworld Indonesia executive editor Aulia Masna , “ One of the fantastic things about Twitter clients is how easy it is for users to jump from one to another .
Just type in a username and password and off you go . ”
It may be wise to trust the female nose when it comes to body odor .
According to new research from the Monell Center , it is more difficult to mask underarm odor when women are doing the smelling .
" It is quite difficult to block a woman 's awareness of body odor .
In contrast , it seems rather easy to do so in men , " said study lead author Charles J. Wysocki , PhD , a behavioral neuroscientist at Monell .
The researchers speculate that females are more attuned to biologically relevant information in sweat that may guide women when choosing a mate .
In the study , women and men rated the strength of underarm odors , both alone and in conjunction with various fragrances .
The fragrances were selected to test their ability to block underarm odor through a method known as cross-adaptation .
Olfactory adaptation refers to the loss of sensitivity to an odor when one is constantly exposed to that odor .
Olfactory cross-adaptation occurs when the nose adapts to one odor and then also becomes less sensitive to a second odor .
Sniffed alone , the underarm odors smelled equally strong to men and women .
When fragrance was introduced , only two of 32 scents successfully blocked underarm odor when women were doing the smelling ; in contrast , 19 fragrances significantly reduced the strength of underarm odor for men .
advertisement
Wysocki noted that in earlier studies , men and women did not differ in their ability to cross - adapt to odors not from the body .
" Taken together , our studies indicate that human sweat conveys information that is of particular importance to females .
This may explain why it is so difficult to block women 's perception of sweat odors , " he said .
Not only were women better smellers the men , but male odors were harder to block than female odors .
Even though underarm odors from the two sexes did n't differ in how strong they smelled , only 19 percent of the fragrances successfully reduced the strength of male underarm odor ; in contrast , over 50 percent decreased intensity of female underarm odor .
In the study , one sensory panel evaluated fragrances for their ability to counteract female underarm odor ; a second panel judged the effectiveness of fragrances against male odor .
Each panel contained both men and women .
To make their odor evaluations , panelists sniffed vials of underarm sweat previously collected in the laboratory from volunteers .
Panelists first rated the intensity of underarm odor to provide a measure of the odor 's strength .
They then continued to rate underarm odor intensity while sniffing a fragrance for 2 - 1/ 2 minutes .
A drop in intensity ratings for the underarm odor indicated that the fragrance was a successful cross-adapting agent , capable of neutralizing the odor .
" Men and women differ in how they perceive body odors from both their own and the opposite sex , " summarized Monell scientist George Preti , PhD , an analytical organic chemist who co-led the research with Wysocki .
" Women are more aware of underarm odor and they appear to be detecting differences in odor quality . "
The study appears online in Flavour and Fragrance Journal .
Also contributing to the research were Monell researchers Jennifer Louie and Manjindar Gill ; James Leyden ( University of Pennsylvania ) ; David Blank ( Dartmouth College ) ; Les Smith ( Coty Inc. ) ; and , Keith McDermott ( Symrise Inc. ) .
It is of absolute urgency , for the sake of saving the literary and artistic creations of our time and the future from oblivion , and for the sake of human liberty , that the whole rotten system be smashed .
The argument to that effect is crystallized and made super compelling in the fifth chapter of Against Intellectual Monopoly by Michele Boldrine and David Levine .
The chapter is pithy , thorough , dead on in its practical analysis , and deeply radical .
It is the perfect illustration of why I think this is one of the most original and compelling books on economics in a generation .
Large swaths of the literary output of the last fifty years , for example , now lie buried in the vaults of large publishers who neither print them nor permit them to be printed absent some huge fee ; nor will they return rights to the author .
Nor will the publishers allow them to be posted .
Getting them back in print is a very expensive and time - consuming operation .
Today , serious “ classical ” composers have to keep returning to public domain material like folk songs to make variations on themes .
The music of the 20th century is largely off limits .
Meanwhile , the search for originality has created bizarre forms of music within the conservatory culture , none of which has sticking power in the culture at large because it is illegal to imitate it .
As for recording , the effort to prevent file sharing has been a disaster for artists .
Again , this resulted from special - interest legislation .
The tethers are so tight now that many bands are reduced to refusing any recording contracts at all , merely so that they can distribute their own music the way they want to .
This has been proven again and again to be compatible with huge sales .
The best selling CDs of last year were also the ones available for free download .
Whenever this subject comes up , unthinking people toss around crazy bromides .
“ You mean you want to allow anyone to just steal anyone ’s work ?
Why would anyone bother to write a book or write a song . ”
These kinds of questions reflect what happens to our thinking in a time of statism ; we ca n’t imagine how freedom would work .
We do not , for example , ask similar questions about other sectors .
“ If you allow the private growing of vegetables , why would anyone bother to start commercial farms or open grocery stores ?
If you allow people to cook at home , why would anyone open a restaurant ?
If you allow people to just share recipes , why would anyone become a master chef ?
You would allow just anyone to steal the idea of a tomato or a sauce or a fancy dish that took years in culinary school to create ? ”
Finally , let me say this : I know that I ’ve written many articles on this book and this live blog of this one chapter is long , but the truth is that I ’ve barely scratched the surface here .
This one chapter has far more to offer , but I ’ll end for now .
One last note : do not write me with some smarty pants remark about how , if we are serious , the Mises Institute should allow anyone to publish our books .
All our new works , insofar as it is possible , will be published with a Creative Commons license as a matter of signed contract with authors .
As for this article , please “ steal ” it .
That goes for anything I write .
If you can sell it and make a buck , good for you .
If you become a millionaire , shame on me for not thinking of it first .

Could the world ’s currency of choice have the face of Mao Tse - tung on it , not George Washington ?
Quixotic or not , the Chinese are preparing for that day .
In a series of what might be called baby steps , Chinese officials recently have moved to globalize the yuan and promote its influence overseas , with Shanghai designated as command central .
Since last December , China has signed deals with six countries , including South Korea , Malaysia and most recently Argentina , for currency swaps that would inject Chinese money into foreign banking systems .
That would allow foreign companies to pay for goods they import from China in yuan , bypassing the dollar -- the currency that dominates international trade and finance , including foreign exchange reserves .
Advertisement
Beijing is also taking initiatives to use the yuan , also known as the renminbi , to settle trade accounts between some Chinese provinces and neighboring states , starting with Hong Kong .
“ The central bank has set promoting the renminbi for payment settlements as the main task for this year ’s work , ” said Shi Lei , an analyst in the global financial markets section at Bank of China in Beijing .
China is also spreading the yuan ’s influence in Asia by making loans and investments in other countries , as well as through its many tourists who carry loads of Chinese currency abroad .
In Cambodia , where the dollar has long dominated , a tour guide in Angkor Wat recently asked visitors if they could pay him in yuan .
Meanwhile , Chinese officials have called attention to the risks of an international monetary system that relies on the dollar , which many analysts have begun to see as unstable because of heavy deficit spending embraced by Washington to combat the recession .
Advertisement
China ’s central banker last week called for the creation of a new global currency , although he did n’t propose that the yuan replace the dollar .
The idea was quickly dismissed by some U.S. and Western officials , and it did n’t get much attention at the Group of 20 summit Thursday in London .
Still , Kirby Daley , a strategist in Hong Kong for brokerage Newedge Group , said : “ I think these are very , very shrewd moves ” by the Chinese .
“ The timing is really good . ”
Daley and other experts say it would take years for the yuan to supplant the dollar ; the Chinese currency is currently tightly controlled and not even freely tradable in international markets .
It will take time for the yuan to gain international acceptance and for China to reform its capital markets and diversify its economy , crucial preconditions before the Chinese can elevate their currency to rival the dollar .
But given the risk of inflation diminishing the value of the dollar , and neither the euro nor the Japanese yen viewed as attractive alternatives , Chinese and Western analysts say they can envision the yuan becoming the dominant global currency by 2020 .
That ’s when Beijing expects the yuan to have been fully liberalized , institutional arrangements and rules to have been set , and Shanghai to be firmly established as an international financial center .
Advertisement
“ That ’s a reasonable timetable , ” said Tim Condon , chief Asia economist for ING Financial Markets in Singapore , adding that the outlooks for the U.S. and Chinese currencies go in opposite directions .
“ I see undesirable risk against the dollar and appreciation pressure on the Chinese yuan . ”
For the Chinese , that ’s not necessarily a good thing at the moment .
China holds about $ 2 trillion in foreign exchange reserves , about half in U.S. Treasury bonds and other government - backed debt .
A weakening dollar would erode the value of those investments .
Yet any sudden or large move to shift those funds could destabilize the dollar and cause just such a scenario to unfold .
At the same time , the yuan is widely thought to be undervalued .
American manufacturers and politicians have long complained that China manipulates its currency to boost exports .
By keeping the yuan ’s value artificially low , critics say , China enables its manufacturers to sell their goods more cheaply in overseas markets .
If the exchange rate -- currently pegged at 6.8 yuan to the dollar -- were n’t tightly set by Beijing , even Chinese analysts figure the ratio could drop to 5 yuan to the dollar .
Given China ’s heavy reliance on trade and related investments for growth , Beijing ca n’t afford to let the yuan appreciate too quickly .
To reduce those risks , it needs time to continue to grow its economy and transfer more of its economic output to services and the domestic sector .
Advertisement
A shift from the dollar to the yuan as the global currency would have significant practical and symbolic consequences .
The dominance of the dollar in trade , financing tools , commodity pricing and international payments has given the U.S. a big advantage in driving commerce and funding the running of the country , although that ’s also allowed Americans to spend more than they produce and save .
Psychologically , the unseating of the dollar would send a signal that the U.S. is losing its stature as the world ’s supreme economic power .
Yi Xianrong , a researcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences , cautions against getting too excited about the central government ’s recent moves , including the announcement last week that Shanghai would be built into an international finance hub .
He says there ’s a long way to go before the yuan can become an international currency .
At the moment , the yuan is traded in the open market in only a few small countries such as Romania .
“ It ’s not so meaningful to talk about this right now , when the renminbi is not yet convertible , ” Yi said .

AN unexplained rash could be a sign that your couch is making you sick .
A toxic fungicide in imported furniture is behind an outbreak of chronic dermatitis , skin burns , eye irritation and breathing difficulties across the world .
Medical experts here are warning consumers to watch for symptoms .
The international journal Allergy has confirmed what thousands of British and mainland European citizens have known for more than a year : new leather sofas imported from China are a hotbed of allergens .
Dimethyl fumarate , in the form of a fine , white crystalline powder , was found in sachets embedded in the furniture sourced to China .
It is believed the body heat generated from sitting on a contaminated couch causes a toxic vapour to seep out .
Rosemary Nixon , from Melbourne 's Skin and Cancer Foundation , said although there have been no reported cases in Australia , people may not have made a link between a skin outbreak and their couch .
Here ’s the CNN headline : “ Report : 1 in 50 American children homeless ”
Here ’s the top of the article : “ ( CNN ) —
One in 50 children is homeless in the United States every year , according to a report released Tuesday . ”
The photo on the article showed a mother and children ( one in a baby stroller ) walking through what seems to be a park .
They ’re homeless , right ?
But it seems unlikely that 1 in 50 children live in parks , so I looked for the “ study . ”
It ’s from the “ National Center on Family Homelessness , ” which is no doubt a public interest group with no interest at all in inflating the numbers .
( Do groups like that ever report good news ?
Ever ? )
And after visiting their website , I managed to find a little on their methods of counting .
The “ study ” claims that “ OVER 1.5 MILLION OF OUR NATION ’S CHILDREN GO TO SLEEP WITHOUT A HOME EACH YEAR . ”
By “ each year , ” they mean “ at least one night a year . ”
But what does “ without a home ” mean ?
Well , I was evidently homeless as a child .
When my father changed jobs , we stayed with friends .
We also stayed for a time in a — horrors ! — trailer park !
If you do that , you are counted as homeless , as the criteria include :
• Sharing the housing of other persons due to loss of housing , economic hardship , or a similar reason ( sometimes referred to as doubled - up ) ;
• Living in motels , hotels , trailer parks , or camping grounds due to lack of alternative accommodations ;
Other friends of my parents also stayed with us while looking for work or transitioning into new jobs , as did relatives .
So all of us children would have been counted as “ homeless ” by the criteria applied by the National Center on Family Homelessness .
It ’s worth repeating that if you did that for one night out of a year , you are counted by the National Center on Family Homelessness as “ homeless ” : “ These data come from a Point - in - Time ( PIT ) count and therefore do not tell us how many people are homeless in a given year , but only those counted on a given night . ”
There does not seem to be any discussion of whether “ homelessness ” as the National Center defines it is getting worse or better .
I searched for the word trend in the report and it appeared once , en passant in a discussion of data sources on academic proficiency and the National Assessment of Educational Progress ; that is to say , there seems to be no discussion at all of trends regarding “ homelesness . ”
Similarly for “ change , ” which did not discover any discussion of “ changes ” in homelessness .
( I also note that the numbers are for 2005 - 2006 , but I will need to study this more carefully to determine whether they are referring to two calendar years or a 12 month period that straddles those years . )
This deserves more study .
The headlines and the claims that “ One in fifty American children was homeless in 2005 - 2006 ” sure caught my attention .
But it seems that , by those standards , I was a homeless child .
And such claims do violence to meaningful language and represent a deliberate deception of the public .
This is a serious issue .
What seems to be a deliberately misleading “ study ” does not advance our knowledge of the topic .
Kids living in parks or shuttled in and out of residency motels by local bureaucracies are in bad situations , the causes of which deserve serious study in order to remedy the problem .
Counting my childhood as a “ homeless ” one merely mocks their condition and does nothing to advance our understanding .
( After a more careful study , I ’ll get back to this .
There may be some answers to my objections , but I could not find any with a quick read .
If anyone finds any , please let me know .
I suspect , based on the shoddiness of the report , that I will just find more deception , but I will work to keep an open mind . )
The world 's first broad - spectrum antimicrobial paint has been developed by scientists from South Dakota .
It kills mold , fungi , viruses and even " superbug " bacteria .
Advertisement
The new polymer is a mixture of normal latex paint and bleach - like N - halamines .
It 's capable of wiping out even tough , antibiotic - resistant microbes — the source of 88,000 hospital - induced deaths a year according to the researchers .
Plus , the paint is good for more than a year of use , can be tested through simple means and requires only a simple chlorination process to be recharged ( which we assume means a touch - up coat every once in a while ) .
Hopefully the technology works as well as advertised and it enters mass production soon .

SHOP OUR VIBES :
The pork industry is not keen on the name " swine flu " because it fears that it will be bad for its image .
Its fears are not groundless .
Ten countries , including China and Russia , have now banned the import of pork products , even though the World Health Organisation advises that you can't get H1N1 from eating bacon .
Egypt has even ordered a cull of all the country 's pigs .
Presumably , in a Muslim state , there are n't so very many pigs , and people are n't going to be that upset about them dying in a rhetorical gesture .
Mexican flu , the obvious alternative , is disliked by Mexicans , because it is felt that this stigmatises the whole country .
Some Mexican politicians argue anyway that H1N1 originated in Asia , then spread into Mexico via the US .
The US - owned , Mexican - based pig - farm at the centre of the story insists that neither any of its staff nor any of its livestock has tested positive .
The plausible theory that H1 Ni originated in Mexico is still just a plausible theory .
One expert sympathetic to Mexico 's worries about blame has suggested that the new strain should be called novel flu .
No one involved in the production of literary fiction has baulked at the title , which is a good sign , although it does n't solve the problem of what to call the next new flu .
Meta - novel flu , perhaps .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
No , that wo n't do .
This flu , after all , has achieved the quality of a meta - novel already , one that is being written and re-written in all its possible permutations before anyone even knows how the real story will unfold .
The absurdity of such an approach was summed up on Tuesday night , on Newsnight .
If swine flu " cannot be contained " , an authoritative - sounding voice asked , " how can we stop it spreading ? "
By re-phrasing the question , let 's hope .
" We " , of course can't " stop it spreading " , not at an individual level , until we catch swine flu ourselves .
Then we can stay home till the ambulance comes , hoping that our own experience of the illness will be mild , and that we are not responsible for passing the virus on to somebody who is more vulnerable .
( This probably is n't the time to remind people that their babies should be immunised against such things as measles , mumps and rubella for similar reasons , but I 'm going to anyway . )
As yet , barely anyone on the planet has a personal interest in this story .
It is still a prurient global spectacle centred on a small number of individual and far - off tragedies .
Even the panic - stricken media coverage has driven only a small number of people to seek medical attention .
Weirdly , even some of those with good reason to be worried ( like a recent trip to Mexico ) were advised to go to their GP , trailing their possible infection with them .
One GP , in Clapham , South London , has told the press that he is in no position to deal with such patients , even though he has had one and is waiting for her test results .
He has been given no anti-virals to take himself , is in contact with other patients all day , and none of the local pharmacies have any Tamiflu to supply to patients with prescriptions anyway .
Amid the huge effort to get every detail of this narrative out to the public , there seems to be a gap .
No one is telling doctors what to do .
Governments are concentrating on talking to the public , via the media .
In Britain the government may not be slaughtering pigs .
But the huge fuss they are making about " reassuring the public " is a sophisticated version of the same sort of thing .
In part , the great gush of information about this barely nascent new take on an old illness is an impressive consequence of the match - fitness of the international structures that exist to control disease , and also yet another reminder of how astonishingly quickly information can be disseminated around the world .
Mostly , however , it 's yet another dreary confirmation of how media organisations love to turn concern into panic into audiences into profit , and how governments , when they see a big running story , want to position themselves flatteringly and busily at the heart of it , when the people at the heart of it really ought to be health professionals .
You would n't know it from the already feverish speculation , but there is no reason to imagine that this flu – and 36,000 people a year die of flu on average – is any more dangerous than any other flu .
For Britons , in the short - to - medium term , this means a different winter flu shot to the one that vulnerable people already get , and a few other simple precautions .
As Michael O'Leary of Ryanair so robustly put it , " the slum - dwellers " are the people at real risk .
Nevertheless , I am interested to note how fears of " beggar - my - neighbour protectionism " melt away when that scary consequence of " globalisation " , the pandemic , kicks its way into the global bar - room .
Despite warnings from more authoritative figures than Mr O'Leary that it is the poorer countries that will really suffer if this strain of flu turns out to be notably virulent , governments of the developed world are making strenuous efforts to protect their own citizens first .
Those with the money are ensuring that they have enough vaccine , that they have enough effective masks , or that they have , in Britain 's case , a comprehensive leafleting campaign and lots of television advertisements .
Brown might not be able to save the world on this occasion .
But he can save Britain , whether it turns out to need saving , or not .
Yet should n't " we " , at present , be trying to work out how best to distribute as many of our stocks of vaccine as we can reasonably spare to Mexico , Brazil , Peru and Guatemala , the nations that already are looking most susceptible , instead of working hard at getting our mitts on more ?
The global effort to stop a pandemic seems political more than practical .
There are as yet unconfirmed reports in Mexico of three doctors dying after treating infected patients .
In La Gloria , Mexico , where the outbreak is believed to have started , residents say they have been fighting the disease for months .
It 's horrible , the sight of ordinary Mexicans trying to " keep calm and carry on " in face - masks that we have already been told in Britain are useless .
It certainly puts California 's state of emergency , now that it has 13 cases , into some perspective .
As I write the World Health Organisation has not yet decided whether it agrees with California 's Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger that 13 cases comprises " sustained community - level transmission " , which will notch the alert system up to " five " .
When the WHO 's emergency committee earlier this week graded the risk of a pandemic at an " unprecedented four " , it also had to explain that its system only went up to six .
Five indicates community - level transmission in more than one country , while six implies a global pandemic in more than one continent .
More puzzling is phase one of the alert - level scale which signals that " no animal influenza viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infection in humans " .
The WHO advises that in a phase one situation , as well as in a phase two or three , countries should " prepare the health system to scale up " .
In other words , official advice is to live constantly in fear .
I do n't think this is official advice that " we ' should take .
In the developed world the hard work of gifted scientists will bring a new flu pandemic under reasonable control , as long as government lets it .
The hype , like a package trip to Mexico , is just a cheap holiday in other people 's misery , but without the much needed benefit to the local economy .
As a spectacle it is not at all edifying .

Mr Messina and Ms Di Leo run a shop in Palermo selling mafia - free goods
A Sicilian couple are planning a wedding designed to keep money out of the pockets of the mafia .
Fabio Messina , 30 , and Valeria Di Leo , 29 , are part of a campaign against the payment of " pizzo " protection money , Italy 's Ansa news agency reports .
The two say everything from the bride 's dress to the catering and honeymoon will be bought from " Addiopizzo " or " goodbye protection money " businesses .
Palermo officials say 80 % of the city 's businesses pay off organised crime .
The mafia is estimated to extort 200 m euros ( £ 185 m ; $ 265 m ) a day from Italian businesses through pizzo , loan sharking and other crimes , a 2006 report by the national retailers ' association Confesercenti shows .
The report says organised crime groups rake in 80 m euros every day from shopkeepers alone .
But anti-mafia police say increasing numbers of Sicilian businesses are joining a grassroots anti-racketeering association called Addiopizzo .
The group publishes a list of businesses that refuse to pay protection money to the mob .
The scheme has been an immediate hit with the public , who welcome the opportunity to keep their cash out of mafia coffers , Ansa reports .
The campaign has prompted Mr Messina and his fiancee to open Palermo 's first Addiopizzo shop - selling clothes , food and home decorations exclusively from Addiopizzo suppliers - in March last year .
'' I thought it was right to give those traders who refuse to pay protection money an extra opportunity , '' Mr Messina said .

Computer spies have broken into the Pentagon 's $ 300 billion Joint Strike Fighter project and made off with several terabytes of code .
The Pentagon , and consequently the Wall Street Journal , suspects Chinese involvement .

The Joint Strike Fighter , also known as the F - 35 Lightning II Fighter , is the most costly project in Pentagon history , so it 's a little bit problematic that some spies scampered in and nicked an unknown , but undoubtedly large , quantity of data without getting anywhere near caught .
The cyber - spies encrypted the data on its way out , so nobody 's really sure where they came from or where the data went , but some IP addresses have been tracked to China , prompting a little bit of back - and - forth between the DoD and the Chinese government .
A Pentagon report issued last month said that the Chinese military has made " steady progress " in developing online - warfare techniques .
China hopes its computer skills can help it compensate for an underdeveloped military , the report said .
The Chinese Embassy said in a statement that China " opposes and forbids all forms of cyber crimes . "
It called the Pentagon 's report " a product of the Cold War mentality " and said the allegations of cyber espionage are " intentionally fabricated to fan up China threat sensations . "

Though the most valuable information , including data on the F - 35 's flight control and sensors , is inaccessible ( stored on non-networked computers ) , nobody 's really sure exactly what happened , and nobody , from the manufacturers to the researchers to the Pentagon 's press team , wants to talk about it .
It 's a pretty alarming read , check it out .

Minilight
a minimal global illumination renderer
Description MiniLight is a minimal global illumination renderer .
It is primarily an exercise in simplicity .
But that makes it a good base and benchmark ( in some sense ) for development and experimentation .
And it just might be the neatest renderer around ( on average , about 650 lines ) .
There are translations into several programming languages .
Someone asked me how to develop a renderer in three months .
It seemed not nearly enough time .
But then I began to think how small such a program could be , whilst still being a complete physically based simulation with a clear , well - formed design .
( A somewhat different aim from the ‘ Minimal Ray Tracer Programming Contest ’ of 1987 . )
I could n't resist an attempt .
It is a command - line application .
It reads a simple text model file and writes a PPM image file .
Supported platforms include Mac 🍏 , Linux 🐧 , and Windows .
The rendering features are : Monte - carlo path - tracing transport
Emitter sampling
Progressive refinement
RGB light
Diffuse materials
Triangle modelling primitives
Octree spatial index
Pin-hole ‘ lens ’

Images A Cornell Box ( of course ) throughout the day : Cornell Box , at morning ( 24 KiB ) Cornell Box , at noon ( 23 KiB ) Cornell Box , at evening ( 26 KiB ) Cornell Box , at night ( 23 KiB ) The models are physically based too .
For example , at noon :
The sky has a colour temperature of 10000 K and a luminance of 1 x 104 cd / m2 .
The sun has a colour temperature of 5400 K and a luminance of 1 x 109 cd / m2 , a diameter of 1.392 x 109 m , and distance of 149.6 x 109 m .
( It is just a square though . )
Some of the Smits test scenes : Smits tests ( 32 KiB ) A room , at noon - ish , and night ( made in HDR and tonemapped with p3tonemapper ) : Front room , at noon ( 97 KiB ) Front room , at night ( 47 KiB ) All these renders are 1000 paths per pixel .
The standard Cornell Box , at 500 x 500 pixels , should take about 15 minutes on a 2007 machine .
( Models / scenes are just in a simple individual text format , but if they were in JSON a suggested JSON - schema of the model / scene format is here . )
Algorithm path tracing
The simplest method of global illumination is pure monte - carlo path tracing .
For each pixel , a ray is sent into the scene .
When it hits something it notes its color and emission .
It then bounces off and continues .
Eventually all the noted info is sent back , step by step .
Each step scales the light by certain factors until a final value is returned to the pixel .
Repeat the whole process many times with some randomness added and average all the results .
An image slowly emerges .
This strategy is essentially a blind search for light emitters .
Unless a ray hits an emitter it will return only blackness .
For outdoor scenes most rays will bounce into the sky , and find brightness .
But for indoors the emitters are small and many many rays are needed to find them .
It is too slow .
emitter sampling
This can be alleviated with emitter sampling .
The location of all emitters is known from the model , and this can be used .
Each step sends an extra ray to an emitter .
But now there are two rays gathering the incoming light they must not duplicate any .
To ensure this , ‘ local ’ emission at each bounce is no longer included .
monte carlo
Each interaction along the main path is handled mostly by monte - carlo .
The bounce direction is chosen by importance sampling : proportionally more likely in directions the surface allows more reflection through .
For ideal diffuse that is lots near perpendicular , little near grazing .
The overall reflectivity is controlled by russian - roulette : proportionally more likely to bounce the more reflective the surface is .
This allows a non-arbitrary end for the recursion .
The colour is just scaling , because there is no advantage in monte - carlo there .
Both uses of monte - carlo sample more where the surface interaction transfers more light .
This is a fairly good approach .
Why ?
A simple analysis is that apparent noisiness is the product of detail / richness and intensity : greater detail means adjacent pixels more likely see different values , greater intensity probably means more contrast .
The latter is easiest to address , because interaction 's effect on intensity is simple .
The treatment — sampling more — reduces noise by averaging - out the effect of the randomness .
Over many iterations this puts more computation into resolving more visibly noisy regions , rather than wasting it on regions that wo n't noticeably improve .
That computes an image of particular quality more quickly .
But there are still shortcomings . . . rendering equation
Here is the specific rendering equation for this algorithm : Meaning :
The radiance outward at a position and direction equals the sum of two terms ( the first representing the main path , the second the emitter sampling ) .
The first term integrates over the surrounding hemisphere of directions the inward radiance scaled by its projection and the reflectivity function .
The second term sums over all emitters , for each integrating over the area the emission scaled by the solid angle , the visibility , the projection , and the reflectivity function .
unbiased ?
Monte - carlo path - tracing is described as ‘ unbiased ’ .
The term is now sometimes used in the manner of a marketing tag .
Its real meaning is too abstract for that purpose .
It denotes a lack of consistent error — the only error is in the effects of the randomness .
Such niceties are appropriate for mathematics but for engineering we must live by practicalities .
All implementations are biased and incorrect in various ways .
The task is to arrange them acceptably .
ultimately
The value of this method is its simplicity , while having full generality .
It allows the implementation to be almost proven correct by inspection .
( Correct meaning ‘ following the rules for a particular standard approximation ’ . )
The images produced can be authoritative references for other renderers .
The core idea has also proven remarkably durable and adaptable since Whitted 's paper of 1980 .
One could reasonably call it the key engineering concept for rendering , and it looks to remain so .
Pseudocode
Here is the algorithmic structure in high - level pseudocode / PDL ( produced by editing the code comments into a reduced form ) .
Whereas the actual source - code is broken into modules and procedures , this represents the sequence in a single coherent view .
Thought of like geographic maps , the first is roughly 38:1 scale , the second 10:1 . high - level – 38:1 Scale 17 lines – roughly 1 for every 38 of actual code .
- render , by progressive refinement - render a frame , to the image - sample each image pixel - make sample ray direction - get radiance returning in sample direction - intersect ray with scene - if intersection hit - get local emission ( only for first - hit ) - calculate emitter sample - calculate recursive reflection - sum local emission , emitter sample , and recursive reflection - else no hit - use default / background scene emission - add radiance to image - save image - divide pixel values by frame count - apply tonemapping factor medium - level – 10:1 Scale 66 lines – roughly 1 for every 10 lines of actual code .
- render , by progressive refinement , as many frames as wanted - display UI feedback - render a frame , to the image - sample each image pixel - make sample ray direction ( with sub - pixel jitter ) - get radiance returning in sample direction - intersect ray with scene - if octree branch - step through subcells and recurse - find which subcell holds ray origin - step through intersected subcells - intersect nested subcell ( by recursing ) - exit branch if triangle hit - find next subcell ray moves to - move to ( outer face of ) next subcell , or exit branch - else octree leaf - exhaustively intersect contained triangles - avoid false intersection with triangle just come from - intersect ray with triangle - check if nearest so far - check intersection is inside cell bound - note hit details - if intersection hit - get local emission ( only for first - hit ) - read triangle attribute - calculate emitter sample : emissive area , ideal diffuse BRDF : reflected = ( emitivity * solidangle ) * ( emitterscount ) * ( cos(emitdirection ) / pi * reflectivity ) - request emitter sample point from scene - if emitter sample point available - if shadow ray is unshadowed - calculate inward emission value - emit from front face of triangle only - estimate solid angle - multiply emitivity by solid angle - calculate amount reflected by triangle - check both directions are on same side of triangle ( no transmission ) - calculate ideal diffuse BRDF : radiance scaled by reflectivity , cos , and 1 / pi - scale radiance by number of emitters in scene - calculate recursive reflection : single hemisphere sample , ideal diffuse BRDF : reflected = ( inradiance * pi ) * ( cos( in ) / pi * color ) * reflectance reflectance magnitude is ' scaled ' by the russian roulette , cos is importance sampled , and the pi and 1 / pi cancel out , leaving just : inradiance * reflectance color - calculate next direction - do russian - roulette with reflectivity ' magnitude ' - if alive - make direction as cosine - weighted importance sample of hemisphere - make color by dividing - out mean from reflectivity - if not path end - recurse to ' get radiance returning in sample direction ' - scale recursed radiance by color - sum local emission , emitter sample , and recursive reflection - else no hit - use default / background scene emission - add radiance to image - save image periodically - divide pixel values by frame count - apply ( Ward linear ) tonemapping factor - write image file ( PPM P6 format )
The website of Shogakukan 's new Monthly Shonen Sunday magazine has announced on Wednesday that Azumanga Daioh manga creator Kiyohiko Azuma will appear in the inaugural issue .
The first issue will ship on May 12 .
Azuma 's staff also revealed on his Yotsuba Studio website on Wednesday that he is creating 16 pages of new Azumanga Daioh art for each volume of the revamped 10th anniversary edition that will launch in Japan on June 11 .
Those three 16 - page installments will first debut in Monthly Shonen Sunday magazine between May and July .
ADV Manga published the original manga in North America , while its ADV Films sibling released the anime adaptation .
Yen Press has since picked up the rights to publish a new English - language edition , although Publishing Director Kurt Hassler indicated that his company is not releasing a version of Japan 's 10th anniversary edition .

Update : Background information added .
More bad news for those of us who are already out here struggling to stay afloat - and for the people trying to hold onto jobs :
WASHINGTON — Nearly one in 10 U.S. workers will be unemployed before the job market starts to improve , economists in a USA TODAY survey predict .
Most expect continued deterioration in the overall economy over the next six months .
The unemployment rate will peak at 9.8 % , according to their median forecast , up a full percentage point from the prior survey in January .
Twenty - one economists predict the unemployment rate will top out at 10 % or higher , according to the survey of 51 economists by USA TODAY April 16 - 22 .
Economists also predict the jobless rate will rise for a longer time .
Two - thirds say it wo n't stop rising until 2010 or later , vs. 51 % in January .
The unemployment rate in March was 8.5 % , the highest in a quarter - century .
The rate of underemployment — adding in part - timers who wanted full - time work or those who had stopped looking for a job — hit a record 15.6 % .
" Even after we come out of the recession , I expect the unemployment rate to go higher and stay there for a while , " says Sean Snaith , director of the Institute for Economic Competitiveness at the University of Central Florida .
Given the severity of the downturn , he says , " Firms are going to proceed with caution when it comes time to staff up . "
( CNN ) -- After Denise Honeycutt sashayed down the catwalk modeling a sleek sleeveless black dress with a blue lace jacket , she felt so good she bought the outfit .
A model walks the runway at the Arlington United Methodist Church fashion show in an outfit from Goodwill .

" I got those two pieces and a skirt for $ 20 , " she said .
" How 's that for a deal ? "
Such bargains may not be haute couture , but during a recession they are a thrifty shopper 's dream .
As budgets tighten during the economic crunch , buying used clothing is no longer just for fans of vintage wear .
Many are discovering the hidden treasures in consignment shops , as well as thrift stores and other places once thought to be only for the destitute .
That 's a message that Brendan Hurley , senior vice president of Marketing and Communications for Goodwill of Greater Washington , has been working hard to get out .
Goodwill of Greater Washington provided the fashions Honeycutt modeled for the show at the Arlington United Methodist Church in Arlington , Virginia , and has been actively campaigning to spread the word that Goodwill fashion is contemporary and hot .
" Most people have a misunderstanding of Goodwill 's mission and they believe that our mission is to sell inexpensive merchandise to the poor , " Hurley said .
" In fact , Goodwill 's mission is to provide job training and employment services to people with disadvantages and disabilities .
We just happen to fund that mission through the resale of donated items at our retail stores . "
To change the negative perception , Hurley said that four years ago they started a campaign to make the stores more appealing as a source of inexpensive fashions by holding virtual and live fashion shows .
See one of Goodwill 's fashion shows »
Hurley said things really took off after they launched a viral marketing campaign and the very successful DCGoodWillFashions blog .
Em Hall is the retail marketing manager who blogs as the DC Goodwill Fashionista in a gig that has become so high - profile that she was invited to blog this year from Fashion Week in New York .
About once a month on average , Hall and her team put together " travel and trunk shows " where they pull merchandise from their nine stores , put them on rolling racks and take them to events for attendees to shop .
People respond to the great prices and selection as well as the opportunity to recycle by buying someone 's gently used clothing , Hall said .

Tell us about your thrift fashions
" The response has been tremendous , " Hall said .
" We know that finding that treasure at Goodwill , finding that vintage piece , really resonates with people . "
Across the country , Goodwill stores have launched several creative ideas to attract divas ( or divos ) who may have more style than funds .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
Goodwill Industries of Michiana Inc. of South Bend , Indiana , has " Boutique Days , " where they work with local fashion reporter and consultant Kathy Friend to raise awareness that Goodwill can be an excellent resource for brand name and designer clothing .
Those who donate at least 20 clothing items receive an opportunity for a private consultation with Friend at a reduced rate .
" On a trip to Goodwill I 've found Chanel handbags still in the tissue paper and in Saks Fifth Avenue bags , " said Friend , who as part of her consultation teaches clients everything from how to spot signs of wear to how they can get pieces altered .
" I was like , are you kidding me ? "

The Goodwill / Easter Seals program in Minnesota held a " Second Runway " fashion show in February where 30 volunteer fashion designers took existing clothes from surrounding Goodwill stores and turned them into hip new outfits .
The event attracted more than 500 attendees .
" We were given $ 50 and we could create up to three looks out of things we found at the Goodwill , " said designer Kristina Bell , who whipped up a cute little dress out of recycled T - shirts .
" I 've always been a thrifter , but now it 's a really good way to save money . "
Someone else 's hard times can be a fashionista 's gain .
Denise McShane owns McShane 's Exchange , whose two locations in the Chicago , Illinois , neighborhood of Lincoln Park have seen an uptick in those unloading their Prada and St. John .
" Business has really boomed , " McShane said .
" The bad news is that we are in a recession , but I absolutely have had a surge in consigners . "
McShane said she offers those who still have a cash stash a bit of retail therapy during hard times .
They can get great buys at a reduced rate .
Such shops , known in the industry as resale stores , have long attracted quality merchandise , said Barbara Nell , owner of The Daisy Shop on Oak in Chicago .
Nell said women are bringing in only the best for resale .
" Women seem to be cleaning their closets of their most luxurious items , " said Nell .
" It 's not just the bread and butter or staples of their wardrobe anymore . "
i Reporter Elizabeth McElherne scored a $ 25 mink coat in August at a shop in Fredericksburg , Virginia .
Check out Elizabeth 's iReport on her find
" If you can't buy something new , you might as well recycle and buy someone else 's stuff , " McElherne said .
" I saw that coat and I said ' If it 's less than $ 100 I have to get it . ' "
Nicole Mladic is the " babe " behind the " Budgeting Babe " blog for " young , working women who want to spend like Carrie in a Jimmy Choo store but have a budget closer to Roseanne . "
Mladic said she encourages her readers to not only shop thrift , but also to be generous in their giving .
" I make sure to thin out my wardrobe every so often , " she said .
" Any pieces that I am not wearing , I donate . "
That type of generosity is much appreciated , especially in the current economy .
Melissa Temme , a national spokeswoman for the Salvation Army , said that while the need for low - cost clothing is increasing , donations for such clothing have remained consistent and that could spell trouble .
" It means that down the road we may not be able to stock our shelves , " Temme said .
" In the long term , that 's a concern . "
Katherine Ransom , communications manager for Goodwill of Orange County , California , said that as more people turn to thrift fashions to help stretch their dollars , they are discovering the clothing is a lot more current than they might have imagined .
Ransom said even Hollywood types are getting in on the act , as wardrobe consultants for television shows and movies are also perusing the racks for good buys .
A recently launched coupon campaign is bringing in even more shoppers , she said .
" People are saying ' I 've never done this before , but now is a good time to start , ' " said Ransom , whose organization launched shopgoodwill.com 10 years ago .
It now includes merchandise from 77 Goodwill organizations around the country .
" They are taking advantage of the quality merchandise with really deep discounts . "

Wikileaks has published the secret list of sites blocked by Australia 's state - sponsored parental filter — a list that the government plans to expand to the entire Australian Internet , making it the basis for a new Great Firewall of Australia .
The list is compiled in secret and is not readily inspected or appealed , and the officials who maintain it have secretly expanded its mandate so that " half of the sites on the list are not related to child porn and include a slew of online poker sites , YouTube links , regular gay and straight porn sites , Wikipedia entries , euthanasia sites , websites of fringe religions such as satanic sites , fetish sites , Christian sites , the website of a tour operator and even a Queensland dentist . "
Julian Assange , founder of Wikileaks , dug up the blacklist after ACMA added several Wikileaks pages to the list following the site 's publication of the Danish blacklist .
He said secret censorship systems were " invariably corrupted " , pointing to the Thailand censorship list , which was originally billed as a mechanism to prevent child pornography but contained more than 1200 sites classified as criticising the royal family .
" In January the Thai system was used to censor Australia reportage about the imprisoned Australian writer Harry Nicolaides , " he said .
" The Australian democracy must not be permitted to sleep with this loaded gun .
This week saw Australia joining China and the United Arab Emirates as the only countries censoring Wikileaks . "
Shell will no longer invest in renewable technologies such as wind , solar and hydro power because they are not economic , the Anglo - Dutch oil company said today .
It plans to invest more in biofuels which environmental groups blame for driving up food prices and deforestation .
Executives at its annual strategy presentation said Shell , already the world 's largest buyer and blender of crop - based biofuels , would also invest an unspecified amount in developing a new generat­ion of biofuels which do not use food - based crops and are less harmful to the environment .
The company said it would concentrate on developing other cleaner ways of using fossil fuels , such as carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) technology .
It hoped to use CCS to reduce emissions from Shell 's controversial and energy - intensive oil sands projects in northern Canada .
The company said that many alternative technologies did not offer attractive investment opportunities .
Linda Cook ,
Shell 's executive director of gas and power , said : " If there are n't investment opportunities which compete with other projects we wo n't put money into it .
We are businessmen and women .
If there were renewables [ which made money ] we would put money into it . "
Shell said biofuels fitted its core business of providing fuels , logistics , trading and branding .
Cook added : " It 's now looking like bio­fuels is one which is closest to what we do in Shell .
Wind and solar are interesting [ but ] we may continue to struggle with other investment opportunities in the portfolio even with big subsidies in many markets .
We do not expect material investment [ in wind and solar ] going forward . "
The company also confirmed that it would increase its dividend payments this year by about 5 % to $ 10bn .
Friends of the Earth ( FoE ) criticised Shell for freezing investment in renewables such as wind in favour of biofuels .
" Shell is backing the wrong horse when it comes to renewable energy – biofuels often lead to more emissions than the petrol and diesel they replace , " the campaign group said .
Until recently , Shell 's investment in wind power featured prominently in its corporate advertisements .
FoE said the company 's move heralded a slightly more honest approach .
" Shell is at least being a bit more honest about the fact they are a fossil fuel company .
It has seen the limitations of the greenwash it was putting out a few years ago . "
Shell has about 550 megawatts of wind farm capacity around the world , enough to power a city the size of Sheffield when the wind blows .
Last year , it pulled out of the 1,000MW London Array project , the joint venture to build what would be the world 's largest offshore wind farm , in the Thames Estuary .
Former project partner E.ON has yet to decide to continue with the £ 3bn investment needed .
Outgoing chief executive Jeroen van der Veer admitted that the company had suffered some " technology baths " in the past when it backed unprofitable technologies .
" We do n't do it [ renewables ] all . "
The company has predicted that by 2025 , 80 % of energy will come from fossil fuels and 20 % from alternative energy sources .
Yet it is spending just over 1 % of its budget on alternative technologies .
Over the past five years , only $ 1.7bn of the $ 150bn it has invested has gone towards alternative energies .
Cook pointed out that at one stage the company only invested 1 % of its budget on liquefied natural gas , which is now a big part of its business .
" You have to start somewhere , " she said .
Van der Veer also admitted that Shell 's overall R&D budget would " fall a bit " as the company focused on the most promising technologies and in the wake of the oil price slump .
The company said it would raise debt levels to maintain dividend payments and its spending programme .
Van der
Veer insisted that energy demand in the long term was strong and oil prices would recover .
" The problem is you do n't know when the long term starts . "
We observed 2,700 families with young children walking along main streets in cities and villages throughout Britain .
We found that forward - facing strollers were by far the most common , but that babies in them were the least likely to be interacting socially .
When traveling with their babies in forward - facing strollers , caregivers were observed speaking to infants in only 11 percent of cases , while the figure was 25 percent for those using toward - facing strollers , and even higher for those carrying children or walking with them .
Could it be that parents who buy toward - facing strollers simply talk more ?
Probably not .
In a follow - up exploratory study , we gave 20 mothers and infants aged 9 to 24 months a chance to try out both stroller types , and recorded their conversations .
Mothers talked to their children twice as much during the 15 - minute toward - facing journey , and they also laughed more .
The babies laughed more , too .
Of course , infants do not spend all their time in strollers , but anecdotal evidence suggests that babies can easily spend a couple of hours a day in them .
And research tells us that children ’s vocabulary development is governed almost entirely by the daily conversations parents have with them .
When a stroller pusher can’t easily see the things that attract a baby ’s attention , valuable opportunities for interaction can be missed .
Ours was a preliminary study , intended to raise questions rather than to provide answers .
It is now clear that future research on the effects of stroller design would be worthwhile .
Meanwhile , the findings already encourage us to think again about how babies experience stroller rides  and other forms of transportation like car seats , shopping carts and slings .
Parents need n’t feel worried , but instead curious about the elements of the environment that attract their children ’s interest .
The core message of our findings is simple :
Talk to your baby whenever you get the chance  and whichever direction your stroller faces .
The Street.com 's Scott Moritz pans the not - yet - announced Apple tablet and gets the Apple blog army up in arms .
Specifically , Moritz predicts that Apple 's ( AAPL ) supposedly forthcoming tablet computer " will flop . "
He says :
Apple will fail because competitors have .
HP , Gateway , and Lenovo sell $ 1,400 tablets that do n't " score well on any popularity indexes . "
People are mostly buying cheap :
Most of the top 10 best - selling computers at Amazon are netbooks that cost $ 400 or less .
Apple cares more about design than selling cheap stuff .
But its " design hubris and slumping sales " will force it to try selling a netbook - like computer anyway .
Apple 's tablet " will be lucky to fall anywhere in the top 100 " of Amazon 's notebook sales .
We do n't know any more than Moritz about Apple 's supposed tablet plans .
It 's possible he will be right .
But Moritz forgets to mention a few important things that are in Apple 's favor :
General Motors of Canada , once the mightiest industrial enterprise in the country , will become a tiny shadow of itself within a few years by slashing jobs , shuttering dealerships and eliminating the iconic Pontiac brand .
In an aggressive update of a " viability plan , " GM disclosed yesterday that the company will chop an already - diminished workforce by 6,000 jobs , or almost 60 per cent within five years ; slash its dealer network by about 300 retailers , or 42 per cent ; and eliminate the 83 - year - old Pontiac .
Industry officials said in addition to the 6,000 direct job losses , another 14,000 eventually will disappear at dealerships and a further 18,000 will be out of work in the parts sector .
The shrinking auto giant said it is moving " faster and deeper " on restructuring plans so it can qualify for short - term government bridge loans here .
The federal and Ontario governments rejected an earlier survival plan from GM , which is seeking between $ 6 billion and $ 7 billion in aid .
In Ottawa , Industry Minister Tony Clement described the job cuts as " terrible and unfortunate but necessary to secure public aid and keep the company viable .
GM said in a statement the latest plan " will speed the reinvention of the company 's operations into a more customer - focused , leaner and more cost - competitive auto maker . "
It also confirmed the phase - out of the Pontiac brand – which created models like the Bonneville and the GTO , the first performance car – to concentrate on four core names : Chevrolet , Buick , GMC and Cadillac .
Pontiac holds about 4 per cent of the market .
The company said in the update that it will employ only about 4,400 production workers in 2014 , down from 10,300 last year .
That 's far below the go - go years of the late 1980s when GM had a production workforce of almost 40,000 at three assembly plants in Oshawa , two more in suburban Scarborough and Ste. - Thérèse , Que. , and sprawling parts operations in St. Catharines and Windsor .
The Scarborough and Ste. - Thérèse operations closed long ago ; a truck plant in Oshawa shuts down permanently next month and the transmission factory will end output next year .

Technology.am ( Apr. 7 , 2009 ) — The Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has announced an ambitious project to extend super - fast broadband internet systems across the country .
“ Just as railway tracks laid out the future of the 19th Century and electricity grids the future of the 20th Century , so broadband represents the core infrastructure of the 21st Century , ” he said .
Under the new plan , the government will initially invest A$ 4.7bn with the overall investment from government and the private sector reaching up to A$ 43 bn over eight years .
Mr Rudd linked the project to his plans to help Australia cope with the global financial downturn , saying it would create 25,000 jobs a year during construction .
Private firms , such as Singapore ’s Optus and Canada ’s Axia NetMedia had been bidding for a A$ 10bn – A $ 15 bn fibre - to - the - node network offering speeds up to 12 megabits per second .
Experts advised the government to choose instead the more ambitious fibre - to - the - home network offering 100 megabits per second , accessible by 90 % of Australian homes .
Google 's containers are real .
And it 's not an April Fool 's Joke .
Four years after the first reports of server - packed shipping containers lurking in parking garages , Google today confirmed its use of data center containers and provided a group of industry engineers with an overview of how they were implemented in the company 's first data center project in the fall of 2005 .
" It 's certainly more fun talking about it than keeping it a secret , " said Google 's Jimmy Clidaras , who gave a presentation on the containers at the first Google Data center Efficiency Summit today in Mountain View , Calif .
The Google facility features a " container hanger " filled with 45 containers , with some housed on a second - story balcony .
Each shipping container can hold up to 1,160 servers , and uses 250 kilowatts of power , giving the container a power density of more than 780 watts per square foot .
Google 's design allows the containers to operate at a temperature of 81 degrees in the cold aisle .
Those specs are seen in some advanced designs today , but were rare indeed in 2005 when the facility was built .
Google 's design focused on " power above , water below , " according to Clidaras , and the racks are actually suspended from the ceiling of the container .
The below - floor cooling is pumped into the hot aisle through a raised floor , passes through the racks and is returned via a plenum behind the racks .
The cooling fans are variable speed and tightly managed , allowing the fans to run at the lowest speed required to cool the rack at that moment .
" Water was a big concern , " said Urs Holzle , who heads Google 's data center operations .
" You never know how well these couplings ( on the water lines ) work in real life .
It turns out they work pretty well .
At the time , there was nothing to go on . "
Google was awarded a patent on a portable data centerin a shipping container in October 2008 , confirming a 2005 report from PBS columnist Robert Cringley that the company was building prototypes of container - based data centers in a garage in Mountain View .
Containers also featured prominently in Google ’s patent filing for a floating data center that generates its own electricity using wave energy .
Holzle said today that Google opted for containers from the start , beginning its prototype work in 2003 .
At the time , Google housed all of its servers in third - party data centers .
" Once we saw that the commercial data center market was going to dry up , it was a natural step to ask whether we should build one , " said Holzle .
The data center facility , referred to as Data Center A , spans 75,000 square feet and has a power capacity of 10 megawatts .
The facility has a Power Usage Effectiveness ( PUE ) of 1.25 , and when the container load is measured across the entire hangar floor space , it equates to a density of 133 watts per square foot .
Google did n't identify the facility 's location , but the timeline suggests that it 's likely one of the facilites at Google 's three - building data center complex in The Dalles , Oregon .
Data center containers have been used for years by the U.S. military .
The first commercial product , Sun ’s Project Blackbox , was announced in 2006 .
We noted at the time that the Blackbox “ extends the boundaries of the data center universe , and gives additional options to managers of fast - growing enterprises . ”
It turns out that containers have developed as key weapons in the data center arms race between Google and Microsoft , which last year announced its shift to a container model .
Microsoft has yet to complete its first container data center in Chicago ,
OTHER COMMERCIAL CONTAINERS :
The number of Sikhs and Hindus in Afghanistan today is unclear .
There may be between 2000 and 3000 living there .
They continue to live in the cities and provinces of Afghanistan where they have historically been based .
Communities were mainly based in the cities , particularly Kabul , Jalalabad , Kandahar , Ghazni , and the Kunar province .
Other communities lived in Kunduz and Khost .
Before the fighting in Kabul , there were approximately eight Sikh and four Hindu temples in Kabul .
They were either destroyed or used as military or army basis .
Today there are three Gurdwaras in Kabul , but only one is structurally sound .
In Jalalabad , there are two Sikh temples and one Hindu temple , but they are not in particularly good repair .
Sikh and Hindu children have been unable to attend government schools , as they have been harassed by both teachers and pupils .
There is a Sikh school in Kabul , but it only has one teacher for a 120 students , and is run and funded by the Sikh community .
Unlike , for example , in India , the Hindu and Sikh communities are very closely integrated .
They frequently live together , and even share temples .
The situation for the two groups is very similar .
The communities have particular problems reclaiming land which has been occupied by various militia commanders , and in burning the dead .
Many Muslims regard the Sikh and Hindu practice of cremating the dead to be blasphemous , and there has been violence and difficulties when Sikh and Hindu people die .
Those Afghan Sikhs born since the mid 1970s have experienced a much more insular life than their parents and grandparents .
It is common for older Sikh and Hindu men and women to speak local Afghan languages fluently .
In the case of many younger people , they speak only Punjabi , as it has never been safe for them to attend government run schools or associate with local Muslim Afghans .
This is particularly true of younger Afghan women .
Almost all of Afghanistan 's Sikhs and Hindus have , by now , left the country .
Most of them have made their way to India , where they live as semi official refugees but have a great deal of trouble getting any form of permanent status .
Others travelled either to America or to European countries in order to try and establish themselves as refugees .
Afghan Sikhs and Hindus were generally easily identifiable .
In terms of appearance , they were often darker skinned than many Afghans , and the men , particularly the Sikhs , wore the traditional turban , did not cut their hair , and grew long beards .
The women did not tend to cover up as comprehensively as Muslim women did .
John McCormack – BishopAccountability.org Assessment and Highly Recommended Articles
Before becoming bishop of the Manchester NH diocese in 1998 , John B. McCormack worked in the Boston archdiocese , where from 1984 to 1994 , he was secretary of ministerial personnel , handling most allegations of clergy sexual abuse .
In 1993 and 1994 , while remaining in the secretarial post , he served as the archdiocese ’s first “ Delegate , ” a role created to handle all matters pertaining both to accused priests and victims .
Since the crisis of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy was exposed in January 2002 , McCormack ’s pivotal supervisory role has been revealed in a huge volume of documents .
These include extensive media coverage , newly released church files on accused priests , court depositions , and Attorney General reports from both Massachusetts and New Hampshire .
To help our readers assess McCormack ’s performance , the staff at BishopAccountability.org have gathered a substantial number of these documents .
Here are a few suggestions for exploring this archive :
* OVERVIEWS OF McCORMACK’S ROLE – Though McCormack dealt with scores of priests who were credibly accused of sexual abuse of children , there is no record of McCormack ever having reported a crime to police or prosecutors .
For overviews of McCormack ’s handling of such serial predators as Paul Shanley , John Geoghan , Joseph Birmingham , and Ronald Paquin , see : Timmins and McConnell , “ Complaints Didn't Dim Bishop 's Faith in Priests , ” Concord Monitor 6/6/02 ; “ Bishop John B. McCormack : Role in Sex Abuse Scandal Still Questioned , ” Manchester Union Leader 7/9/02 ; and Farragher and Carroll , “ Bishop Often Sided with Priests in Abuse Cases , ” Boston Globe 1/26/03 .
* McCORMACK’S OVERRIDING POLICY WAS TO KEEP ABUSES SECRET AND AVOID SCANDAL –
As the archdiocese ’s point man for all allegations of clergy sexual abuse , McCormack did not respond to repeated requests from his assistant , Sr. Catherine Mulkerrin , that they post bulletin notices in parishes where known molesters had served .
When a victim filed a lawsuit against the Rev. Robert M. Burns , known by Boston church officials to be a child abuser , McCormack helped plan a strategy to derail reporters and prevent files from being released in court .
See Robinson and Kurkjian , “ Records Show a Trail of Secrecy , Deception , ” Boston Globe , 12/4/02 .
Released church files also showed that when the Rev. Paul J. Tivnan was facing possible criminal charges , McCormack persuaded the public prosecutor to drop the case ( Rezendes and Carroll , “ Files : Church Struck Deals with Accusers , ” Boston Globe 12/20/02 . )
* McCORMACK TREATED ABUSIVE PRIESTS WITH SYMPATHY AND VICTIMS WITH SKEPTICISM – McCormack ’s solicitous handling of Paul Shanley when the admitted rapist lived in California was revealed when the church ’s file on Shanley was made public .
Read Mashberg , “ Records Show Church Coddled Problem Priest , ” Boston Herald 4/14/02 and Hirsch , “ Church Files Show N.H. Bishop McCormack 's Role in Shanley Case , ” Foster ’s Online 4/9/02 .
In contrast , McCormack repeatedly minimized complaints that children were being molested .
Examples are recounted in Pfeiffer , “ Law Aides Often Dismissed Complaints of Clergy Abuse , ” Boston Globe 4/12/02 .
McCormack even told an anguished father that there was “ no factual basis ” for fearing that Joseph Birmingham had molested his son , though the priest had finished treatment for alleged abuse of another child just three weeks earlier .
( See Associated Press , “ Bishop Assured Parent Son Not Being Molested ; Priest Was Undergoing Treatment at the Time , ” Concord Monitor 12/19/02 . )
A comprehensive look at McCormack ’s contrasting treatment of victims and priests is Farragher and Carroll , “ Bishop Often Sided with Priests in Abuse Cases , ” Boston Globe 1/26/03 .
* McCORMACK REPEATEDLY PLACED KNOWN ABUSERS IN POORLY SUPERVISED “ RESTRICTED MINISTRIES ” – This move is described as McCormack ’s “ single greatest failing ” in the careful investigative report produced by the Mass .
Attorney General .
( McCormack ’s performance is examined in pages 39 to 45 of the report . )
Revs. Ronald Paquin and Paul Mahan are examples of two priests who molested minors after having been placed in restricted ministry by McCormack .
See the account in Timmons and McConnell , “ Complaints Didn't Dim Bishop 's Faith in Priests , ” Concord Monitor 6/6/02 .
* DESPITE RECENT IMPROVEMENTS
IN NH , MCCORMACK HAS PROVED WILLING TO PLACE KNOWN ABUSERS IN MINISTRY – The Manchester diocese ’s stated policy now is to tell complainants to report incidents of sexual abuse of minors to civil authorities .
However , as recently as June 2002 , McCormack assigned to a Jaffrey NH parish a priest whom McCormack knew had paid a teenager for sex during the 1980s .
See Marchocki , “ McCormack Admits Knowing Rev. Cote Paid Teen for Sex , ” Manchester Union Leader 12/24/02 .
The article reports that McCormack did not tell the parishioners about the priest ’s past “ because he did not consider Cote a threat . ”
* CATHOLIC LAITY AND AN ESTEEMED CANON LAWYER HAVE CALLED FOR McCORMACK TO RESIGN – Laity and clergy have called for McCormack 's resignation .
Note especially NH VOTF 's excellent response to McCormack 's refusal to resign and a letter from the canon lawyer Fr. Tom Doyle , calling for resignations of NH Bishops McCormack and Christian .

On Thursday , Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins ( Gabe & Tycho ) , authors of Penny Arcade , were recognized by the Washington state legislature for their work on Child 's Play , an organization the two developed to deliver toys and games to children 's hospitals worldwide .
Since 2003 , Child 's Play has helped to raise more than $ 3.5 million in donations and partner with more than 60 children 's hospitals worldwide to raise the spirits of sick and injured kids .
Awesome job and a hearty congratulations to the Penny Arcade guys on this one ( and everyone who makes Child 's Play possible ) .
Keep up the good work !

ROME , April 6 ( Reuters ) -
Part of a university residence , a church tower and several houses collapsed in a strong earthquake that hit central Italy on Monday but it was not clear if there were any casualties , officials said .
There was no immediate word on whether anyone was inside the dormitory in the city of l'Aquila , about 100 km ( 62 miles ) east of Rome .
The quake registered 6.3 on the Richter scale and struck shortly after 3.30 a.m. ( 0130 GMT ) .
Television pictures showed rubble on a number of streets in l'Aquila and at least one modern house whose roof collapsed .
The pictures also showed the rubble from a collapsed bell tower .
Damage was also reported in a number of outlying towns and villages in the mountainous region east of Rome .
Here ’s a bunch of code I wrote , most of it about a year ago , for doing things with the graphs from the Data .
Graph module in Haskell .
The choice of functions , from among the many generally useful functions acting on graphs , comes from a specific project .
The actually functionality is pretty generic , though .
So I ’m just throwing this out there .
If someone else wanted to package it and throw it on Hackage ( likely with a different module name ) , they would be welcome to do so .
{- Module containing utility functions for operating on Data .
Graph .
-} module GraphUtil where import Data .
Graph import Data .

Tree import Data .
Array import Data .
Maybe import Data .
Function ( on ) import qualified Data .
Map as M import Data .

Allows loops and antiparallel edges , but does not allow parallel edges .
-} all Graphs n = map ( buildG ( 1,n ) ) ( subsequences [ ( a , b ) | a <- [ 1..n ] , b <- [ 1..n ] ] ) {-
Finds all cycles in a graph .
A cycle is given as a finite list of the vertices in order of occurrence , where each vertex only appears once .
The point where the cycle is broken to form a linear list is arbitrary , so each cycle is merely one representative of the equivalence class generated by the relation identifying ( v:vs ) with vs ++[ v ] .
In particular , this function chooses the representative with the lowest numbered starting vertex .
-} cycles g = concatMap cycles ' ( vertices g ) where cycles ' v = build [ ] v v build p s v = let p' = p ++ [ v ] local = [ p ' | x <- ( g!v ) , x == s ] good w = w > s && not ( w `elem` p ' ) ws = filter good ( g ! v ) extensions = concatMap ( build p ' s ) ws in local ++ extensions {- Computes a table of the number of loops at each vertex .

Tests two graphs to see if they are isomorphic .
This is a worst - case exponential algorithm , but should perform acceptably in practice on small graphs .
It uses backtracking , associating vertices one by one until it either finds a complete isomorphism , or reaches a vertex that can't be matched with a remaining vertex in the other graph .
-} isIsomorphic g1 g2 = let v1 = vertices g1 v2 = vertices g2 in ( length v1 == length v2 ) && test [ ] v1 v2 where {-
Takes the first vertex v of g1 , looks for vertices w of g2 that work " so far " , and tries to construct an isomorphism that maps v to w. -} test m [ ] [ ] =

Tests whether a given mapping v -> w for v in g1 , w in g2 works " so far " .
In order for the mapping to work , the vertices must agree on their in - degree , out - degree , and number of loops ; and already mapped adjacent vertices via in - and out - edges must correspond .
-} similar m v w = ( in1 ! v ) == ( in2 ! w ) && ( out1 ! v ) == ( out2 ! w ) && ( loop1 ! v ) == ( loop2 ! w ) && match ( ( v , w ) : m ) ( g1 ! v ) ( g2 !w ) && match ( ( v , w ) : m ) ( g1 ' ! v ) ( g2 '!w ) {-

Some global information about the graphs that can be calculated only once to save time .
This includes the degrees and number of loops at each vertex , and the transpose of the graphs ( used to find in - edges ) .
-} g1 ' = transposeG g1 g2 ' = transposeG g2 in1 = outdegree g1 ' out1 = outdegree g1 in2 = outdegree g2 ' out2 = outdegree g2 loop1 = loopdegree g1 loop2 = loopdegree g2 {- Returns the degree sequence of a given graph .
The degree sequence is a sorted sequence of tuples representing the in - degree , out - degree , and loop - degree , respectively , of each vertex in the graph .
The degree sequence has the desirable properties that it is : ( a ) a graph property ( that is , invariant under isomorphism ) ( b ) relatively cheap to compute , and ( c ) classifies non-isomorphic graphs very effectively into small groups .
-} degsequence g = sort ( zip3 ( elems ( indegree g ) ) ( elems ( outdegree g ) ) ( elems ( loopdegree g ) ) ) {-
Given a list of graphs , removes the duplicates up to isomorphism .
The implementation takes advantage of the fact that the degree sequence is the same for any pair of isomorphic graphs .
Therefore , the process maintains a map from degree sequences found so far to their respective graphs .
This removes the need to compare most sets of graphs in a normal list .
If the list contains only graphs with the same degree sequence , then this function will be very slow , as it will perform O( n ^ 2 ) isomorphism tests , each of which are worst - case exponential .
-} isonub :: [ Graph ] -> [ Graph ] isonub gs = go M.empty gs where go hs [ ] = [ ] go hs ( g:gs ) = let dseq = degsequence g poss = M.findWithDefault [ ] dseq hs in if any ( isIsomorphic g ) poss then go hs gs else g : go ( M.insert dseq ( g:poss ) hs ) gs {- Finds the shortest paths from the given vertex to any other vertex of the graph .
The paths returned are lists of vertices , so if there are parallel edges in the graph , each result may actually correspond to multiple paths .
The algorithm is essentially breadth first search , but done in bulk for each increase in depth , ensuring that all shortest paths are found for each vertex .
-} shortestPaths g v = go ( M.singleton v [ [ v ] ] ) [ v ] where go ans [ ] = M.map ( map reverse ) ans go ans ws = let new = map ( step ans ) ws next = foldl ( M.union With ( ++ ) ) ans new in go next ( M.keys next \\ M.keys ans ) step ans w = let new = filter ( not .

Computes all possible directed subforests of a given graph .
A subforest is a subgraph with the property that there is at most one edge entering any vertex .
The approach is to first choose the set of vertices , which may be any subset of the vertices of the given graph , and then choose the edge ( if any ) entering each vertex .
Parallel edges are ignored , since they would lead to isomorphic subforests .

Ticket inspectors get thumbs down .

Nearly 140 angry commuters lodged a formal complaint with the Public Transport Ombudsman from July to December last year compared with 85 complaints for the same period in 2007 .
The Ombudsman initially reported 185 complaints had been made but later confirmed a mistake had been made and the number was 138 .
Keep Australia Australian is the rallying cry of the Senate opposition leader Barnaby Joyce 's TV ads against China 's proposed $ 19.5 bn ( £ 13.9 bn ) investment in Rio Tinto , the Anglo - Australian miner .
Mr Joyce is not only the latest to join the fracas over the Rio deal , he also joins a swelling choir of concern that China is exploiting the global economic downturn to buy up the West .
Beijing 's growing shopping list is not a masterplan for political expansion but an attempt to secure the country 's supply of raw materials and avoid looming social unrest .
Mr Joyce 's concern is that the deal with Chinalco , the state - owned aluminium giant , will leave an Australian " source of wealth " in foreign hands .
" The Australian government would never be allowed to buy a mine in China , so why would we allow the Chinese government to buy and control a strategic asset in our country ? " he said .

The Middle Kingdom 's sway over commodities markets is already profound .
It was Chinese hunger for the raw materials needed to fuel its run of double - digit annual growth that sent prices through the roof .
It is the slowdown in China that has sent prices crashing and industries from mining to shipping into reverse gear .
Mr Joyce 's concerns are not restricted to Rio .
He is also campaigning against the proposal for China 's Minmetals to buy debt - laden Oz Minerals , the world 's second largest zinc miner , for A$ 2.6bn ( £ 1.2bn ) .
Neither does the acquisition trail end there .
As miners struggle , China 's investments are becoming a spree .
In early February , Zhongjin , its third - largest zinc producer , bought a controlling stake in Perilya , a medium - sized zinc and lead producer , for A$ 45.5 m .
The following week , Hunan Valin Iron & Steel picked up a 16.5 per cent stake in Fortescue , Australia 's third - largest iron ore producer , for $ 771m .
The Fortescue deal was swiftly followed by the China National Petroleum Corporation 's cash offer for Verenex Energy , a Canadian group with resources in Libya .
Then , early this month , Sinosteel bought nearly 6 per cent of Murchison , the iron ore miner , to add to its purchase of Midwest , a rival , last year .
There is no doubt that China is taking advantage of the downturn .
Jonathan Fenby , the director of China research at Trusted Sources , said : " It clearly sees a promising opportunity in the raw materials field in which it can benefit from its cash pile at a time when companies abroad need money or asset prices are cheap . "
But this is no stealth mission .
At a National Energy Administration conference in Beijing last month , government officials openly admitted they are considering creating a special fund for buying foreign oil and gas companies .
Neither are the acquisitions indiscriminate .
Reports that Chery Automobile , the local car maker , is interested in Volvo receive short shrift from experts .
" It looks as though Western firms would welcome a Chinese approach in the car industry but there is not much industrial logic on their side , " said Mr Fenby .
" China has overcapacity at home in vehicle production and its prime aim is to get the domestic industry into shape . "
China did make a brief foray into Western financial institutions , spending $ 3bn on Blackstone and $ 2.2bn on Barclays at the height of the market in 2007 .
But the credit crunch left massive paper losses on the deals , and not only did Beijing show no interest in rescuing collapsing banks but China Life recently pulled out of the bidding for the AIG 's Asian arm over worries about the quality of the business .
Robin Geffen , the managing director of Neptune Investment Management , said : " China is simply not interested in taking over Western companies , only in securing supplies of what it deems vital natural resources . "

Two gargantuan loans agreed last month in return for guaranteed delivery of oil at the market price do not look like the actions of an empire - builder .
Just days after the Minmetals deal , Sinopec stumped up a $ 10bn for Petrobras , the Brazilian oil company , in return for 100,000 barrels of oil per day ( bpd ) for the next 10 years .
The same week , China Development Bank also agreed to lend a whopping $ 15bn to Rosneft , the Russian state oil company , and another $ 10bn to Transneft , the pipeline operator , in return for 300,000 bpd delivered for two decades .
" The most significant of all the recent deals is the one with Russia , " said Mr Geffen .
" China could buy every bank in Europe with the $ 25 bn being leant to the Russians , but it chose not to . "
Chinese investment overseas is not new .
The government has spent billions of dollars on natural resources concessions in Africa in recent years , raising similar spectres of shifting geopolitical influence as are the current save of acquisitions .
But Beijing has repeatedly rejected calls for it to take a more interventionist role on the global stage and remains focused on its domestic concerns , says Mark Ashurst , the director of the Africa Research Institute .
" Only a government that came to power through rural unrest can understand the implications of lifting millions out of poverty while leaving millions more behind , " said Mr Ashurst .
" China is not interested in changing the world order , only in securing long - term , strategic concessions which will bring energy security for the industry back home .
The Communist Party is a fragile regime : providing energy , industry and jobs to its own citizens is the priority . "
Into Africa : China 's interests stretch from Angola to Sudan
China 's shopping list of international miners follows years of investment in Africa in return for the guaranteed supply of raw materials .
To the chagrin of the West , China 's pragmatic approach has proved highly successful .
The formula is simple : in return for long - term concessions for key strategic resources such as oil , gas and metals – sometimes for hundreds of years – Beijing agrees premium prices for the products and to make massive infrastructure investments .
There is no shortage of takers – China has oil interests in Angola , Sudan and Nigeria , and mining concessions across the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) and neighbouring Zambia .
As part of the package it is funding rail programmes from DRC to Dar es Salaam in Tanzania , and inland from the port of Benguela in Angola .
Alongside state infrastructure like rail and road networks , Beijing can also be prevailed upon for politically useful building programmes like hospitals .
Part of the appeal is money .
China is cash - rich and will pay whatever it takes for the energy security it craves .
It is also not at all squeamish .
When the Western banks providing Angola 's annual syndicated loans came under pressure to add transparency criteria to their terms , Chinese institutions stepped in and took over with no questions asked .
Similarly , China is widely accused of handing over tens of millions of dollars to at least one African leader in return for repudiation of Taiwan at the UN , although nothing has ever been proved .
" China will undertake these big infrastructure projects in places where nobody else will , and will get them built very much quicker than if they were relying on cumbersome development aid coming from the West , " said Mark Ashurst , the director of the Africa Research Institute .
" China has a simple proposition which is attractive to African leaders , and if sweeteners are needed then there are plenty available .
It is not particularly clean , but it is very rational . "

IF YOU want to buy an electric car , you can .
Tesla Motors , a firm based in San Carlos , California , will sell you a nifty open - top sports job for $ 109,000 .
Not cheap , admittedly , but cheap to run .
Plugged in overnight , it can be refuelled for the equivalent of 25 cents a litre of petrol .
The catch is , “ plugged in overnight ” .
Tesla 's vehicles use standard lithium - ion battery cells .
As any owner of a mobile phone or laptop computer knows , these take time to charge .
If you use 6,831 of them , as a Tesla sports car does , that time does tend to drag on .
Which is fine if you are not planning a long trip the following day , for a full charge will take you about 350 km ( 220 miles ) .
But it might cramp the style of anyone planning to bomb down from , say , Paris to Cannes , and who would therefore need to refuel on the way .
Gerbrand Ceder and Byoungwoo Kang of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology hope to change this , and thus help make the electric car a work - a - day consumer item , rather than a high - end boy 's toy .
In this week 's Nature they have published the technical details of a new battery material that will , if all goes well , take the waiting out of wanting , at least when it comes to recharging .
Broadly speaking , there are two ways of storing electrical energy in a chemical system .
One is a standard battery , in which the whole material of the electrodes acts as a storage medium .
That allows lots of energy to be squirrelled away , but makes it relatively hard to get at — and so it can be released or put back in only slowly .
The other way is called a supercapacitor .
This stores energy only at the surface of the electrode .
It is quick to charge and discharge , but cannot hold much energy .
The great prize in the battery world has thus been a material that can both store a lot and discharge rapidly , and it is this that Dr Ceder and Mr Kang think they have come up with .
Nanogobstoppers
Lithium-ion batteries , as their name suggests , work by the movement of lithium ions ( which carry a positive electric charge ) along with electrons ( which carry a negative charge ) .
Electrons are small and mobile but lithium ions are much larger and slower .
In a standard lithium - ion battery one electrode is made from a material such as lithium iron phosphate and the other from graphite .
The ions pass from the graphite to the phosphate through an intervening electrolyte while the electrons make the journey via an external circuit that allows them to do useful work .
When the battery is recharged , they go in the opposite direction .
( See videographic on how a lithium - ion battery works . )
It is the speed with which the ions can enter and leave the electrodes that governs how fast a battery can be charged and discharged .
Graphite has an open structure and is easily penetrated .
However , in the case of lithium iron phosphate and other , similar , materials , the crystal structure allows entrance and egress in only one direction .
That creates a traffic jam that slows the movement of ions down .
What Dr Ceder and Mr Kang have done is create electrodes that are made of two different materials , one of which is good at storing ions while the other is good at conducting them .
The two substances themselves are arranged in tiny spheres less than 50 billionths of a metre across .
The core of each sphere is a crystal of lithium iron phosphate .
This acts as a standard battery material .
The surface , however , is made of a glassy ( ie , non-crystalline ) form of lithium phosphate .
This lithium - phosphate glass is good at conducting lithium ions , though it cannot actually store many .
It thus acts as a supercapacitor .
The result is that any ion arriving at a sphere is quickly conducted around the surface by the supercapacitor phase until it finds its way to the right place to enter the battery phase in the core — or , if the battery in question is being charged , the other way round .
The really clever bit , though , is how the spheres are made .
They crystallise from a melt that does not have enough iron in it to become pure lithium iron phosphate , so eventually no more of that material can form as the melt cools down .
From then on the growing sphere is just lithium phosphate and , by manipulating the conditions , the researchers were able to make the coating glassy rather than crystalline .
The result is a material that , when tested in experimental batteries , was able to charge and discharge in a few seconds .
In the future , therefore , that weekend in the south of France need not be interrupted by running out of juice .

These executives — consummate insiders who enlisted when young and worked their way up — now find themselves pushing 50 just as some brutal problems are pushing back : a collapse in DVD sales , a credit crisis that has curtailed financing for new movies , a group of corporate owners determined to pull more profits from studios to compensate for hard - hit publishing and broadcast television divisions .
“ These folks were born from a place where they knew no failure — all they could ever see was up , both for the business and their careers , ” said Peter Guber , a former chairman of Sony Pictures who is now a producer and industry elder statesman .
“ Now they must confront the unsettling truth that failure is close at hand and that it ’s on their backs to make sure that does n’t happen . ”
To date , the current leaders have had to focus more intently on becoming masters of organizational behavior than rebooting businesses .
“ Consensus management is what they know , ” said Mr. Guber .
But as studios trim staff and producer deals , many are now hoping to emulate some of the entrepreneurial cowboys — David Geffen , Barry Diller and Michael Eisner come to mind — from the generation of moguls that preceded them .
Inevitably , the sudden shift has set off soul - searching among the loose network of allies and adversaries who must rewire the industry in the short span before a next Hollywood generation comes along to replace them .
They are tightening belts , lowering expectations and becoming occasionally more cutthroat , but also grappling with some unusually philosophic thoughts about a business for which they now have to fight .
Rough and tumble is not in this generation ’s DNA .
Most hail from elite universities , in contrast to predecessors like Mr. Geffen or Mr. Diller , who had no college degrees .
The co-chairmen of Universal Pictures , Marc Shmuger and David Linde , respectively attended Wesleyan and Swarthmore .
Ms. Snider has degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and the University of California , Los Angeles , school of law .
The 10th amendment says :

Ok ...
So what listed power lets them regulate home grown marijuana for personal use ?
If your answer is " the power to regulate interstate commerce , " then you missed the part about it being " home grown " for " personal use . "
Even if you somehow find a way to link homegrown weed to interstate commerce ... why did prohibition require a whole new amendment to the constitution to be legal if it falls under a virtually identical category as marijuana ?
PLEASE DONT JUST SAY WHY MARIJUANA IS BAD !!

Dinosaurs could walk the earth again within five years , says paleontologist Jack Horner .
It wo n’t happen the way it did in Jurassic Park , the novel and movie inspired in part by Horner ’s work .
No active DNA from history ’s big lizards is likely ever to be found , he says .
But birds carry dinosaur DNA .
As embryos , they sprout the beginnings of teeth , claws , and a lizard tail before certain genes cancel and redirect that growth .
Horner ’s dream these days is to bring out a chicken ’s inner dinosaur by turning off those controlling secondary genes .
He dreams , in fact , that one day in the not - too - distant future he will walk onto The Oprah Winfrey Show followed on a leash by a long - tailed , sharp - toothed “ chickenosaurus . ”
The 62 - year - old Horner is putting his money where his mouth is , said Damon Tabor in Wired .
He ’s used earnings from his role as a technical advisor for the Jurassic Park films to fund researchers at two universities .
The actual hatching of a reverse - engineered dinosaur , he claims , could be achieved for only a couple of million dollars .
Explaining how that might be done “ makes up only a small part ” of his new book , said Brian Switek in Smithsonian.com .
The great value of How to Build a Dinosaur is that it illuminates how the work of paleontologists has changed in the past few decades .
No longer are they all digging up bones in the desert .
Many are making their discoveries in laboratories through the study of evolutionary developmental biology , or “ evo-devo . ”
It turns out that embryos of living species “ hold records of the past just as the strata of the earth do . ”
The amusing Oprah scenario serves as an example of “ Horner at his best , ” said Jeff Hecht in New Scientist .
His goal is n’t to become a celebrity .
It ’s to “ make people think about how evolution works ” so that they become more comfortable with the life - enhancing advances that modern biology can achieve .
His ideas are “ provocative yet firmly grounded in science , ” and New York Times science editor James Gorman has helped Horner fashion them into a “ good read . ”
Horner promises , by the way , that his test - tube monster wo n’t mutate into a mortal threat to humanity .
“ If he mates with a chicken , you still get a chicken , ” he says .
“ It ’s not like dino­chicken will overrun the world . ”
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
The Obama administration must break up the biggest financial firms if the nation is to return to economic health , three prominent bailout skeptics told a congressional panel Tuesday .
Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz and MIT professor Simon Johnson warned the Joint Economic Committee of Congress that the current government policy of propping up troubled financial giants could impede an economic recovery .
They each said spending taxpayer dollars freely on behalf of struggling big banks risks drowning U.S. productive capacity in debt -- while handing what amounts to an enormously costly subsidy to politically powerful financial sector insiders .
If the Obama administration fails to hold troubled banks accountable for their problems , the U.S. could face a lost decade of economic growth like Japan 's in the 1990s , they said .
The third skeptic , Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City President Thomas Hoenig , said policymakers must allow troubled firms to fail rather than propping them up , a la AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) .
He said banks must be treated consistently , regardless of their size or connections , for the sake of restoring confidence to markets and normal function to the economy .
" Rather than letting the market system objectively discipline the firms through failure and stockholder loss , " Hoenig said of the current approach to bailouts , " we tend to micromanage the institutions and punish those within reach . "
The hearing comes as Congress prepares to consider an Obama administration proposal to give regulators the authority to take over systemically important institutions .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has said such a plan is crucial if the U.S. is to avoid a recurrence of the current crisis .
Meanwhile , regulators led by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve are conducting so - called stress tests on 19 big banks , in an effort to demonstrate that the banks are well capitalized .
Big bank stocks have risen sharply over the past month , amid hope that government - subsidized lending and toxic - loan disposal programs will help restore the vitality of struggling financial institutions .
Shares of the most troubled banks -- Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , which together have received hundreds of billions of dollars of federal capital and asset - guarantee aid -- were among the biggest winners in that rally .
All three panelists said they believe the Bush and Obama administrations have misspent taxpayer funds in their zeal to stabilize the financial system -- and they warned that taxpayer money will continue to circle the drain if the Obama administration does n't change course soon .
Along those lines , the International Monetary Fund estimated Tuesday that financial institution writedowns tied to toxic assets could reach $ 4 trillion globally .
Hoenig said authorities must set up a procedure that would allow big nonbank financial firms to be temporarily taken over by the government .
Regulators would then replace management , wipe out shareholders and seek to sell the cleansed institution back into private ownership .
Stiglitz , formerly an aide in the Clinton administration , said the process of briefly taking over banks then selling them back to investors would be much less costly for taxpayers .
Both he and Johnson , a former IMF chief economist , added that the structure Hoenig sketched out would be good to have now - though it would have been better before last year 's implosions at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers .
Instead , the government rescued Bear and let Lehman collapse - then got $ 700 billion from Congress that many argue was distributed willy - nilly to good and bad banks alike , as well as automakers and others .
The Lehman decision also froze credit markets and pushed AIG to the brink of insolvency .
In response , the government extended an $ 85 billion emergency loan to the insurer .
The cost of that rescue has since more than doubled .
The short - sighted responses to crises last year highlight the need to take bold steps now , Stiglitz said .
" We really now ought to draw the line and say where we want to go from here , " he said .
Huge news for real - life ray guns : Electric lasers have hit battlefield strength for the first time – paving the way for energy weapons to go to war .
In recent test - blasts , Pentagon - researchers at Northrop Grumman managed to get its 105
kilowatts of power out of their laser – past the " 100 kW threshold
[ that ] has been viewed traditionally as a proof of principle for ' weapons grade ' power levels for high - energy lasers , " Northrop 's vice president of directed energy systems , Dan Wildt , said in a statement .
That much power wo n't get you a Star Wars - style blaster .
But it should be more than enough to zap the mortars and rockets that insurgents have used to pound American bases in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The battlefield - strength breakthrough is just one part in a larger military push to finally make laser weapons a reality , after decades of unfulfilled promises .
The Army recently gave Boeing a $ 36 million contract to build a laser - equipped truck .
Raytheon is set to start test - firing a mortar - zapper of its own .
Darpa is funding a 150 kilowatt laser project that is meant to be fitted onto " tactical aircraft . "
Does that mean energy weapons are a done deal ?
Hardly .
There are still all sorts of technical issues – thermal management and miniaturization , to name two – that have to be handled first .
Then , the ray gunners have to find the money .
The National Academies figure it'll take another $ 100 million to get battlefield lasers right .
Still , clearing the 100 kilowatt hurdle is a big deal .
For the longest time , the military research community concentrated on developing chemical - powered lasers .
The ray guns produced massively powerful laser blasts .
But the noxious stuff needed to produce all that power makes the weapons all - but - impractical in a war zone .
( One ray gun took as many as eight shipping containers ' worth of chemicals and electronics to power a single blaster . )
So the Defense Department shifted gears , and poured money into electric lasers .
They 're much less hassle to operate .
And , given a steady supply of power , they should be able to fire away , almost indefinitely .
At first , these electric lasers were weak .
When the military started its Joint High Power Solid State Laser ( JHPSSL ) program in 2003 , these easy - to - maintain lasters could barely produce more than 10 kilowatts of coherent light .
Now , Northrop believes , going way past 100 kilowatts should be pretty simple .
In its lab , south of Los Angeles , Northrop combines 32 garnet crystal " modules " into a " laser amplifier chains . "
Shine light - emitting diodes into 'em , and they start the laser chain - reaction , shooting out as much as 15 kilowatts of focused light .
Combine all those beams into one , and you 've got yourself a battlefield - strength ray .
Northrop 's JHPSSL lasers used seven chains to get to 105 kilowatts .
But there 's room , at least , for an eighth .
Which means an even stronger blaster .
The next step is to start trying out the ray gun , outside of the lab .
The Army is planning to move the device to its High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility at White Sands
Missile Range .
Testing is supposed to begin by this time , next year .

Police have been given the power to hack into personal computers without a court warrant .
The Home Office is facing anger and the threat of a legal challenge after granting permission .
Ministers are also drawing up plans to allow police across the EU to collect information from computers in Britain .
The moves will fuel claims that the Government is presiding over a steady extension of the " surveillance society " threatening personal privacy .
Hacking – known as " remote searching " – has been quietly adopted by police across Britain following the development of technology to access computers ' contents at a distance .
Police say it is vital for tracking cyber- criminals and paedophiles and is used sparingly but civil liberties groups fear it is about to be vastly expanded .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Remote searching can be achieved by sending an email containing a virus to a suspect 's computer which then transmits information about email contents and web - browsing habits to a distant surveillance team .
Alternatively , " key - logging " devices can be inserted into a computer that relay details of each key hit by its owner .
Detectives can also monitor the contents of a suspect 's computer hard - drive via a wireless network .
Computer hacking has to be approved by a chief constable , who must be satisfied the action is proportionate to the crime being investigated .
Last month European ministers agreed in principle to allow police to carry out remote searches of suspects ' computers across the EU .
Details of the proposal are still being developed by the Home Office and other EU ministries , but critics last night warned it would usher in a vast expansion of police hacking operations .
Shami Chakrabarti , director of the human rights campaign group Liberty , said such a vast expansion of police powers should be regulated by a new Act of Parliament and that police should be forced to apply to a court for a warrant to hack into computers .
She said : " This is no different from breaking down someone 's door , rifling through their paperwork and seizing their computer hard drive . "

Ms Chakrabarti said the organisation believed it had strong grounds to challenge the practice both under British and European law .
Dominic Grieve , the shadow Home Secretary , said : " The exercise of such intrusive powers raises serious privacy issues .
The Government must explain how they would work in practice and what safeguards will be in place . "
A spokesman for the Association of Chief Police Officers , said police carried out 194 hacking operations in 2007 - 08 in England , Wales and Northern Ireland , including 133 in private homes , 37 in offices and 24 in hotel rooms .
The spokesman said such surveillance was regulated under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act .
" The police service in the United Kingdom will aggressively pursue serious and organised criminality , including where that takes the modern forms of hi-tech crime , " he added .
The Government faces criticism over the erosion of civil liberties on a series of fronts .
It is working on plans for a giant " big brother " database holding information about every phone call , email and internet visit made by everyone in the United Kingdom .
The first Britons will receive biometric identity cards at the end of the year , paving the way to the world 's largest identity register .
Genetic details of more than four million people are on the DNA national database , the highest proportion of any Western country .
The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that Britain 's policy of retaining samples from people never convicted of a crime – including children – breaches human rights .
Multiple annotated reads of George Orwell ’s 1984 have taught me all of the mathematical concepts this struggling prole needs to know in order to survive our pre-apocalyptic world – preemptively dubbed the “ Tin Foil Hat Era ” :
2 + 2 = 5
The proles ( i.e. 99 Percenters ) – sex , booze , Cliffsnotes , drugs , Little Debbies , televised sports , People Magazine and the lottery = 100 - percent fucked ( metaphorically speaking of course , given sex has been removed from the equation )
Proletariat – Hope = Total Anarchy *
* Imagine President Donald Trump with a Purple Crayon
Initially these concepts were immaculately conceived by God Big Brother , who impregnated the first sets of televisions , which eventually begat computers when Big Brother ’s wandering eye preyed upon a younger , prettier , albeit more promiscuous medium of its former self .
Big Brother ’s minions , the One - Percenters , know these concepts as well , which is why they stoked the Hope Machine by adding the Powerball Lottery to its fire , which is currently burning in our collective underbelly to the tune of an estimated $ 1.5 billion ( $ 930 million cash value , so not quite a billion dollar haul , unfortunately ) .
You heard me right , suckers : $ 1.5 billion — the asking price for the western half of Iowa .
( For the record : Nobody ’s asking . )
The One - Percenters also know that the lottery , like the U.S. tax code and ATM surcharges , is completely rigged in their favor .
Even so , Powerball
Fever has swept the nation as the proles push their other addictions distractions aside , hit the ATM machines , and bow and pray before the Almighty Powerball God that He will spit out the winning numbers .
Tragically , these gateway prayers lead to more dangerous , irrational behaviors and illusions of grandeur that , given the 1 in 292,000,000 odds of winning , the Almighty Powerball God will pick you ( and the IRS ) to be the Chosen One .
This would be akin to thinking that of the estimated 2.2 Christians on Earth , God picked you of all people to run for president of the United States , so you could fuck up Earth , one of his most disappointing creations — second only to Man .
Other symptoms of Powerball Fever include speaking in prime numbers , talking about the lottery in lieu of the weather or that game last night and / or filling out paperwork to run for public jester office .
Although the conspiracy theory side of my brain is convinced the lottery is rigged , the left side reminds me that I was one number away from winning the Iowa Lottery 27 years ago .
Having recently finished my two - year tour with Uncle Sam at the time , I was trying to plant my financial feet in the civilian world and recall saying , “ If I just had $ 500 dollars , I could pay all my bills , buy some new pants for work , and have money left over to splurge on libations for my friends . ”
Two days later , I hit five of the six numbers and won $ 600 .
Had I prayed to God for a “ 34 , ” I would have won $ 3.8 million .
Both of these numbers have haunted me ever since .
I took my winning ticket to the nearby Super Value grocery store on 42nd and University in Des Moines , and the customer service representative was in a state of shock when he ran my ticket .
Without missing a beat he slipped me six bennies , and I was on my way to living the dream .
I took my winnings and , as it was prophesied , I paid my bills , bought two pairs of pants for my work wardrobe and bought a keg of Milwaukee ’s Best — only the Best for my fellow proles , eh ?
I found out later that I was supposed to fill out some paperwork and pay Uncle Sam his cut , since my winnings were over $ 500 .
Note :
If you ’re reading this and work for the IRS , I already spent all my winnings .
Although I ’m still wearing the same pants as part of my teaching wardrobe .
So if you want your slice , Big Brother , come and take my pants , you Totalitarian Motherfucker !
Needless to say the right side of my brain eventually surrendered to the left , and I decided to purchase the winning ticket of Wednesday night ’s drawing .
That and I had a vivid vision while paying homage to the coffee gods at Java House .
God , dipped in black leather from head to toe , paid me a visit and said that He would give me the winning numbers if I promised to finance a campaign that removed “ In God We Trust ” from all paper money and replaced it with “ You Ungrateful Bastards Owe Me , Big Time ! ”
Me : I do n’t know , that seems like a heavy burden .
God : ( looking in to the distance )
If you only knew …if you only knew the first thing about heavy burdens …
Me : Okay…okay , what are the winning numbers ?
He looked around to make sure that none of the nearby heathens were listening in , bent down and whispered the winning numbers into my ear as I wrote them down on a napkin .
Me : 34 !?
Are you sure about that , God ?
God : Goddamn right I ’m sure .
Look at Me , I ’m God for Christ ’s sake .
In spite of the black leather attire , the left side of my brain conceded that God did indeed have a point , while the right side was overcome with giddiness after hearing God use
His own name in vain .
Priceless , it thought … priceless .
After writing the numbers down , I looked up and God had disappeared .
I noticed that the rest of my Java Cooler had also disappeared , a small penance for being a billionaire , I conceded .
Looking at the numbers on the napkin , I decided to christen my new baby , Winston , an homage to the beloved prole Winston Smith ( circa 1984 ) .
Like most hipster Millennial offspring , it ’s only fitting that Winston was immaculately conceived in a coffee shop .
Given the life expectancy of a Powerball ticket is only 3 to 4 days , I thought it best to document Winston ’s “ Terrible Twos ” stage , or midlife crisis in this case .
I also thought it would be a good idea to share this publicly , so when I DO win , people will know why I , along with Winston , may have disappeared .
Moreover , the latter served as a reminder that the drawing was two days away , and that I needed to cast my superstitious phrase into the world , just to remind God about our agreement :
“ If I just had $ 1.5 billion dollars , I could pay all my bills , buy some new pants for work , and have money left over to buy the western half of Iowa for all my friends . ”

A fresh row over MPs ' pay and perks erupted after taxpayers were asked to foot an £ 800,000 - a- year bill to bail out their gold - plated pension scheme .
Under the plans unveiled by the Leader of the Commons , Harriet Harman , the Exchequer will increase its contribution from £ 12.4 m to £ 13.2 m a year .
MPs will each have to pay an extra £ 60 a month to help fill a £ 51 m black hole in the parliamentary pension fund .
The package was published after government financial experts found a growing deficit in the pension scheme because former MPs were living longer .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Government Actuary said that taxpayer contributions to the scheme – already one of the most generous in the country – would have to increase by £ 2.1 m a year to cover the shortfall .
Ms Harman said she wanted MPs to increase their payments into the scheme from 10 per cent to 11.9 per cent – equivalent to £ 60 a month – to help limit the extra bill for the taxpayer .
Steve Webb , the Liberal Democrat pensions spokesman , branded the decision a " spectacular own goal for MPs " .
" The pensions of MPs and other well - paid public sector workers have to be brought in line with reality .
With members of the public losing their jobs and seeing their pensions plummet , MPs cannot insulate themselves from the harsh realities of the recession . "
Susie Squire , the campaign manager at the Taxpayers '
Alliance , said : " Asking for more money to plug the deficit in politicians ' gold - plated pensions is an utter disgrace .
These pensions have been a bottomless pit for too long , and continuing to pump in taxpayers ' money is no solution in the long term .
" Why should taxpayers fund politicians retiring into the lap of luxury when they have seen their own pension reduced out of recognition ?
If MPs want such a generous pension , they must pay for it out of their own salary and not simply keep dipping into the pockets of hard - working people . "
Downing Street said the situation was not " a long - term or sustainable position " .
In February , Gordon Brown called for a fundamental review of the parliamentary pension system .
The parliamentary authorities also launched a mole hunt amid claims that details of MPs ' expenses were being offered to newspapers for £ 300,000 .
A spokeswoman for the Speaker said a " thorough investigation " had been launched , indicating police could be called in if evidence of a breach in the law was found .
The Speaker told MPs he was " deeply disappointed " the expense details became public .
More than one million receipts have been scanned into computers in preparation for their publication later this year .
MPs have a month to ask for addresses and personal information to be removed before the data is released .
Pressure for reform of parliamentary allowances intensified as the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life said it was bringing forward its planned review of MPs ' pay and expenses .
Its findings will be published by the end of the year .

If comic books were jammed with Super Hero ugly chicks , guys would probably never buy them .
Slap a sexy woman in charge on the cover of an Xmen comic and there is one more reason for men to grab a copy .
Time has given guys many beautiful female super heroes to fantasize about , so the following document I present you twenty one female super heroes you most likely would n't kick out of bed .
21 . Silk Spectre
Real name : Laurie Jupiter
Laurie Jupiter is not actually the first Silk Spectre , but the second – the first being her mother , Sally .
Although quite liberal minded , Silk Spectre II did not originally want to be a superhero , but was forced down that path by her mother .
Not wanting to be a superhero did not stop Silk Spectre II from becoming well trained , however , and she has proven herself to be an extremely capable and skilled vigilante .
* Note , this is n't the best picture of Silk Spectre , but if you have seen the recent Watchmen movie you will know WHY she is listed ( hint : SHES HOT ! )
20 . She - Ra
Real Name : Princess Adora
Kidnapped by the Horde as a baby to do the Horde 's bidding , Princess Adora does not realize her birthright as She - Ra until she encounters her brother He - Man in an alternate dimension , where he was captured .
The siblings do not recognize each other , as He - Man 's mind ( and all those in his dimension home ) had been erased of her memory .
The sword that He - Man carries with him , however , draws Adora to it .
Seeing the Sorceress in the sword ( one of the only people that still hold memory of her as a child ) , Adora recognizes her heritage and frees He - Man from captivity .
Finally able to go home , Adora realizes that her rightful place is with the people she has come to know under the Horde 's rule and returns to join the cause in freeing them .
Of all the super heroes that exist , I 've seen just about all of them as Halloween costumes , but I 've never seen She - Ra .
Maybe I was more focused on the candy instead of the costumes back in the 80's to have actually noticed .
If you are a costume manufacturer out there , please make us a She - Ra costume !

by Michael Davidson
Even today , when relativism is common practice , there must be concrete opinions that I ’ve worked out , that I would fight for if it came to scraps , right ?
I am an adult , my ideas must be ready for action , this much I know , and yet I find it hard to carry conviction .
There was a time when I was younger and more virulent .
I would pique people ’s interests with words that stood for a definite cause , but now I am unaware of what it is I stood for .
I can tell you this : my ideas , whatever they were , took me to strange corners of the world .
The place is San Diego .
The year is 2003 .
I am in a Toyota Dolphin , which is an RV that can run forever as long as the spark plugs , slave cylinder , and carburetor are maintained .
Locust , the owner of the RV , is driving .
We struggle through the bulge and roll of La Jolla .
There is no destination in particular , just one of those late night drives inspired by indoor inertia .
He downshifts into second to get more torque for the uphill climb .
I hear the gearbox and wonder if we ’ll make it to the top alive .
In the passenger seat rides Rob .
His cowlick touches the roof at every hiccup .
You guys wanna smoke ?
That ’s Diego speaking .
He is the only one wearing sandals .
When no one answers , he looks at me
Morse , you wanna smoke ?
I shrug .
He knows very well that I just started drug use last weekend , when we grilled too many brats at the Padres / Astros game .
Perhaps worried that no one will take the initiative and answer , thereby forcing Diego to assume that there are in fact no takers , Locust interjects
What ’s that Diego ?
I ca n’t hear you from up here .
The Dolphin ’s pur , you know .
I was just wondering if anyone in this place wants to smoke .
Oh .
Sure .
That takes care of it .
Diego has found purpose in the back of the RV .
He digs deep in his cargo shorts and pulls out a bubbler and bag of weed .
With dexterity he picks a ripe nugget off the stem and packs the bowl .
He asks if I want to chew on the stem
Does that do anything ?
What do you mean ?
I mean , does chewing on that stem get you high ?
To reprimand my odd mixture of ignorance and innocence , he tosses the hairy stem into his mouth for himself and smiles .
Rob asks
Is that thing ready yet ?
Diego finds a yellow lighter in another cargo compartment and , in the darkness of the RV , cranks the flint and applies the tip of the flame to a corner of the packed bowl .
I watch in a sincere effort to learn .
Tonight , here in San Diego in 2003 in a Toyota Dolphin , I will hit from a bubbler for the first time .
My nervousness dilates as the paraphernalia makes its round .
Rob is second in line .
He assesses the situation and decides that the lighter is not necessary .
He sucks merrily and passes it to Locust
It ’s lit .
Locust looks at the bud to confirm this and takes his pull .
Even though they are in the front cab and I am in the back , sitting on the sofa , I can hear the water purl as each of my friends grab at happiness .
Already the Dolphin is foggy and redolent .
I pick the curtain away from the window and see an elephant wag its trunk at me .
I remember this elephant .
I found it in a boutique , sitting silently on a shelf and fashioned from marble .
This elephant was the first gift I gave to my mother on Mother ’s Day .
I was in eighth grade .
What would she think if she knew that I was in this strange corner of the world , her son ?
The miniature pipe bundled with the lighter gets to my hands via Diego
I do n’t think it ’s lit anymore .
It ’s not ?
What do I do ?
Just spark it up .
How ?
What ?
You want me to light it for you ?
It is clear that he is not trying to emasculate me .
There is no antagonism in his tone , just incredulity .
I take the lighter in my right hand and hold the bubbler in my left .
I crank the wheel to get a spark , but that ’s all I get .
I try again .
More sparks flit about in the air and then dissolve , only to remind me of the original state of the universe .
I get dizzy with Sartre ’s nausea .
I am incapable of imagining that vertiginous vacuum when there was no sound and no matter without suffering a spell of sickness .
Here .
Pride does not keep me from letting Diego come to the rescue .
I relinquish the lighter and wait for him to apply the flame .
What remains of the bowl burns a hot red .
Diego observes my reaction as I swallow the toke
That better ?
I nod , docile like a lamb , and return the bubbler
Thank you .

There 's an old joke where the first guy says , " What 's the difference between drapes and toilet paper ? "
The second guy says , " I do n't know , what ? "
Then the first guy responds , " You are not allowed in my house ! "
After watching the " expert " economists debate our financial crisis during the past year , I realize that we can modify the joke .
Today I would ask the econobloggers and op - ed writers , " What 's the difference between monetary policy and interest rates ? "
If an economist answered , " I do n't know , what ? " then he is not allowed to advise the government .
Any " expert " who confuses money and interest is eventually going to give horrible recommendations under certain conditions , as we 'll see below .
Money and Interest Are Different Things
Although the public has been desensitized into believing that a rising money supply is the same thing as lowered interest rates , these are actually quite distinct things .
In fact , the apparently obvious connection between monetary growth and interest rates is largely an accident of the way central banks developed historically .
In an economy truly based on private property , the gold miners — i.e. , the producers of new money — would have no direct connection to interest rates at all .
A decision by the gold miners to boost production would have very little direct impact on interest rates .
Central banks quite arbitrarily inject new money into the economy via the credit markets .
Let 's suppose for the sake of argument that the government should control the " money industry . "
Further suppose we are in a situation where the government determines that an injection of new money is needed to help the market snap out of its laissez - faire funk .
Even so , there is no reason the central bank needs to choose debt securities as the point of entry for new money .
This is a crucial point so let 's think it through .
Right now , when the Federal Reserve engages in " open - market operations , " Bernanke goes into the market and buys , say , $ 10 million worth of US Treasuries from a bond dealer .
How does Bernanke pay for this ?
Why , he simply writes them a check written on the Federal Reserve .
When the bond dealer deposits the $ 10 million check , his bank credits his checking account with $ 10 million .
Then the bank itself turns the check over to the Fed .
Get ready , here 's the fun part : when the Fed receives a check — written on itself — from Acme Bank , the Fed processes the check and increases Acme 's checking balance with the Fed by $ 10 million .
But there is no corresponding debit to any other checking balance !
The total amount of member - bank reserves , held on deposit with the Fed , has magically increased by $ 10 million .
As everyone who did n't skip the relevant college lecture will recall , the fractional - reserve nature of our banking system means that the injection of $ 10 million in new reserves will actually allow up to $ 100 million in new money to enter the economy .
But that pyramid effect is not what I want to focus on .
Instead , I want to focus on the fact that the Fed chooses bond dealers to be the first recipients of the new money .
That has an enormous impact on the way the economy operates .
But we do n't even see this aspect of the situation , because we have come to believe it is natural .
In fact , it is horribly unnatural and causes the business cycle itself .
Suppose that instead of entering the bond market , when Bernanke wanted to increase the money supply , he started adding SUVs to the Fed 's balance sheet .
Can you imagine how much this would disrupt the car market ?
The SUV Fed
It is not unusual for the Fed 's balance sheet to increase by $ 5 billion in a given 12 - month period .
( In this article I 'm not even going to start to deal with the astronomical increase in Fed holdings during 2008 . )
That means that in the course of a year , it is entirely possible that the Fed could go on a spending spree and bulk up with $ 5 billion in extra bonds issued by Uncle Sam .
Then , down the road , it may dump those holdings just as quickly , and not according to any predictable formula but instead largely at the whim of one man .
Now imagine if the Fed stocked up on SUVs , rather than bonds , when conducting its open market operations .
It would approach car dealerships and write checks ( backed up by the infinite supply of Fed electronic reserves stored in the Bernanke Phantom Zone ) .
Then the dealership would really sell an actual vehicle to the Fed .
A private customer who had had his eye on that particular SUV would have to find another vehicle , because the one he wanted was being loaded on a truck headed for the New York vault .
However , the customer could actually decide to postpone buying , hoping that the Fed would adopt a tight monetary policy .
In this case — when the Fed wanted to suck money back out of the economy to contain price inflation — it would dump SUVs back on the market .
When the car dealerships bought them off the auction block , they would write checks to the Fed , drawn on their commercial checking accounts , and in the process would ultimately send some of the total reserves in the banking system back to the Phantom Zone .
Although our hypothetical system would introduce extreme volatility in SUV prices , it 's still obvious that the car manufacturers would love the arrangement , so long as the government generally acted as a net purchaser of SUVs .
That is , as long as the government 's stockpile of SUVs tended to grow over time , the manufacturers would effectively receive a roundabout subsidy , even if the government never dealt directly with the manufacturers and always bought SUVs from third - party dealerships .
The actual and potential consumers of SUVs , of course , would suffer .
Not only would they pay higher prices but they would also be less certain of the availability and price of vehicles down the road , due to the sudden jumping in and out of the market by the central bank .
Bond Prices and Interest Rates
Similar distortions occur in the real world , but we do n't notice them anymore .
When the Fed " cuts interest rates , " what it 's really doing is creating money out of thin air and handing it over to bond manufacturers .
And what is a bond manufacturer ?
It 's simply a fancy term for a borrower .
The most privileged bond producer is of course the US Treasury .
Now I 'm sure it was just a pure coincidence that when the government established the Federal Reserve — the entity that in a sense controls the dollar printing press — the government required , either explicitly or implicitly , that the Fed could generally only inject that new money by buying bonds issued by the Treasury .
( This pattern has changed recently , of course . )
This ensures that whenever the Fed injects new money into the system , it pushes up the price of Treasury bonds .
Since the Treasury is selling those newly issued bonds , the Treasury obviously benefits from this .
On the other hand , private - sector buyers of Treasury and other bonds lose out .
If they had entered the market with the intention of buying a bond yielding $ 10,000 in ten years , they will now have to pay a higher price because of the Fed 's muscling into the picture with its Phantom Zone checkbook .
Another name for private - sector buyers of debt is savers .
Thus the Fed 's decision to stockpile debt instruments — rather than sport-utility vehicles — subsidizes the borrowers and penalizes the savers .
Its actions also cause people to save less or borrow more than they would have in a free bond market .
Perhaps more serious , the Fed 's behavior sets in motion the boom - bust cycle that mysteriously plagues market economies .
The Fed 's One - Two Punch to the Economy
What people often overlook is that the Fed distorts the economy in two separate ways : first , it destroys the value of the dollar by expanding the supply of dollars year after year .
But beyond raising prices in general , the Fed 's actions also cause distortions because they pull up bond prices first , so that they are temporarily higher compared to other prices .
If the Fed doubles the money supply , in the long run , that will roughly double the prices of all goods and services .
But if the Fed restricts the injection of new money into only the hands of a few privileged recipients , those people will be at a fantastic ( albeit temporary ) advantage relative to everyone else in the economy .
They will get their hands on the billions in new dollars , while prices still reflect the old reality .
The new money will then flow from sector to sector , pushing up prices as it ripples throughout the economy .
But the last people in line receiving the new influx of twenty - and hundred - dollar bills will be much poorer than others , once prices settle down .
Their paycheck was the last to rise , while they watched helplessly as more and more prices began doubling .
A Deadly Combination
Now what happens when the economy is in a situation where ( a ) it " needs " more money , and ( b ) it " needs " higher interest rates ?
( I 'm using " needs " loosely to mean " required by economic efficiency . " )
For example , maybe a country that was previously economically isolated has now joined the world market .
Its people originally traded among themselves with their own domestic currency , but now they want to use the international money .
Under a truly free money market , gold would probably be the world commodity money .
That means tons of extra gold ( in the form of bars and coins ) would flow into the developing country , to be added to the cash balances of its people .
But at the same time , because these people would recognize the immense jump in standard of living they would soon experience , they would also try to borrow against their future income .
In other words , now that their nation was open to international trade , their productivity would multiply by a factor of ten within a few years .
The switch would n't be overnight however , because it would take time for multinational companies to come in and build state - of - the - art factories , or to begin large - scale extraction of mineral resources .
From the point of view of the natives , they would realize that their average annual income would jump from , say , $ 500 to $ 5,000 in two years , where it would stay until their retirement .
In that situation , they would naturally borrow a lot of money .
Their increased demand for loans would raise interest rates , calling forth new savings from the rest of the world and rationing the available funds among other potential borrowers .
That is how a truly free market would handle a scenario where the market needs more money and higher interest rates .
The rising world price of gold would induce gold miners to boost output , while the rising price of borrowing would induce savers to boost their " output . "
There is no reason that the actions of the gold miners would conflict with the actions of the savers .
But what happens with a central bank such as our Federal Reserve ?
When it tries to increase the money supply , it necessarily has to push down interest rates , at least relative to what they otherwise would have been .
Therefore , in a scenario where people want to hold more cash and where they are in desperate need of more savings , the Fed can cater to one crisis only by exacerbating the other .
This is exactly where we stand during today 's crisis .
The tremendous uncertainty in financial markets — itself caused largely by government policies — has led everyone to seek higher cash balances .
People have no idea what their income stream will be like in 6 or 12 months , and so they are trying to expand their command of very liquid assets .
At the same time , the bursting of the housing and stock bubbles revealed that many wealthy people all over the globe had not been saving nearly as much as they thought they were .
The alarm needed to flood through the world : " Save more !
Save more !
This is an emergency !
The entire structure of capital is at risk if we do n't plug these holes soon ! "
Tragically , the setup of central banks in today 's world only allowed the governments to solve one problem .
They chose to flood the markets with money , thereby pushing interest rates down to the nonsensical rate of practically zero .
Thus , at the single most crucial time in world history for interest rates to rise sharply , they were instead pushed down to zero .
Just when extra saving is needed most critically , instead the governments of the world have caused lending itself to become almost pointless .
Conclusion
Interest rates are prices , and as such they convey real information about scarcity in the world .
People talk of financial affairs spreading into the " real economy , " as if the allocation of capital is some minor detail .
On the contrary , the capital markets — guided by interest rates — are the single most important " governor " of the " real " market economy over time .
By flooding the credit markets with money created out of thin air , the central banks of the world are interfering with humans ' attempts to communicate with each other after the housing bubble popped .
It would be as if the governments used military aircraft to jam the radios of rescue workers in a region hit by an earthquake .
The politicians and bureaucrats talk as if the members of the private sector are aloof during the crisis .
On the contrary , people the world over are concentrating on their finances more than ever .
But the governments of the world keep drowning out the signals people are trying to send to each other .
Money and interest are distinct things .
There are times when the " right " market response is an increase in the supply of money and an increase in interest rates .
Because modern central banks typically inject new money only by lowering interest rates , they make financial panics much worse .

Fish in the confines of a fish farm , Eilat , Israel ( Image : Israel Sun / Rex Features )
It ’s increasingly likely that the fish you eat was farmed not caught wild , according to the latest statistics of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization .
The group ’s two - yearly assessment of world fisheries , published today , comes with mitigated good news .
The outlook for wild ocean fish remains gloomy : 80 % of all fisheries are at or beyond their maximum yields , and over - fishing continues to climb .
Yet the amount of fish available to eat is growing faster than the human population , thanks to a boom in fish farming .

The FAO calculates that , for the first time , fish farms produce half the fish we eat , up from less than a third in 2002 .
With wild - catch fisheries maxed out , any more increases in fish production will depend on farms .
Problems in the wild ?
It is unclear from the FAO data whether fish farms are indirectly putting more pressure on wild stocks .
Many farmed fish eat fishmeal and oil , made from small species like sardines .
The FAO says the tonnage of these species consumed has trebled since 1992 , but does not say whether this is a consequence of fish farming , or because the fish are being used for other purposes .
In a parallel report , international fisheries pressure group Oceana charges that by relying on wild - caught species like sardines , which now constitute one third of world fisheries , fish farms are starving larger predators , including tuna , marine mammals and seabirds .
The FAO observes that the unrestricted competition between companies is a waste of energy : too many boats mean that fewer fish are caught per litre of boat fuel .
Meanwhile , boat owners buy more powerful , less efficient engines to beat the competition .

Taliban fighters spilling out of the Swat Valley have swept across Buner , a district 60 miles from Islamabad , as Hillary Clinton warned the situation in Pakistan now poses a " mortal threat " to the security of the world .
The US secretary of state told Congress yesterday that Pakistan faced an " existential " threat from Islamist militants .
" I think the Pakistani government is basically abdicating to the Taliban and the extremists , " she said .
Any further deterioration in the situation " poses a mortal threat to the security and safety of our country and the world " , she said .
In Buner , Taliban fighters occupied government buildings , ransacked the offices of aid agencies and ordered aid employees to leave .
Fighters brandishing guns and rocket launchers patrolled villages , forcing beleaguered local police to retreat to their stations .
Local courts have stopped functioning and judicial officials have gone on indefinite leave .
This morning the provincial government said it was deploying six platoons of paramilitaries – between 180 and 300 troops – to retrieve control of the government installations .
The turmoil in Buner , a district of about 1 million people , does not pose an immediate threat to Islamabad , which lies across a mountain range and the river Indus .
But the speed and aggression of the militant advance has stoked a sense of alarm across the country , even among normally conservative forces .
" If Taliban continue to move at this pace they will soon be knocking at the doors of Islamabad , " Maulana Fazlur Rehman , leader of the pro-Taliban Jamiat Ulema e Islam party , told the national assembly yesterday .
The Taliban could soon seize control of Tarbela Dam , a strategic reservoir , Rehman warned .
Blame for the turmoil has focused on a controversial peace deal the provincial government signed with militants in February .
Hoping to defuse the insurgency , the Awami National party - led government acceded to demands for sharia law in Swat and seven surrounding districts , known collectively as Malakand Division .
The changes were ratified by the national parliament last week with cross-party consensus .
Since then , the Taliban have moved to establish much more than judicial control .
In Mingora , the commercial hub of Swat , the police retain a low - key presence , reduced to directing traffic .
Most politicians have fled , many under death threats .
Many residents said it was not clear who was in control of the town .
In Imam Dheri , the Taliban headquarters near Mingora , a Taliban spokesman , Muslim Khan , told the Guardian their goal was the establishment of an Islamic caliphate first in Pakistan and then across the Muslim world .
" Democracy is a system for European countries .
It is not for Muslims , " he said .
" This is not just about justice .
It should be in education , health , economics .
Everything should be under sharia . "
The drive into Buner signals the next step in that strategy .
Khan said Taliban fighters were being deployed to ensure sharia law was implemented there too .
They are also muscling in on other areas .
On Wednesday , militants kidnapped a senior government official in Upper Dir , west of Swat , for a few hours before releasing him .
Defending the government , Pakistan 's ambassador to the US , Hussain Haqqani , said Islamabad was pushing for a negotiated peace just as the US had done with Iraqi militants .
" To think that that strategy somehow represents an abdication of our responsibility towards our people and towards the security of our country and the region is incorrect , " he told CNN .
Four years ago , when TreeHugger was initially launched , our mission was to drive sustainability mainstream .
We pictured a world where people were modern , hip , comfortable , and green and where air and water were clean and products were designed for disassembly .
We have grown from one measly writer ( me ) to roughly 40 from around the globe and our approach has shifted .
Where we once predominantly covered design , architecture , and fashion , today we also cover politics , energy , and transportation .
Of course , it is not just us that has changed .
Green has exploded .
It 's in every newspaper , on New York fashion runways , on chain grocery store shelves .
But it is becoming more and more obvious that the " 20 Simple Tips to Save the Planet " approach is n't going to get the job done .
I applaud anyone who makes even the smallest change in their own life – doing something is better than doing nothing .
To buy the idea that we are not facing an uphill battle – with science , governments , corporations , the clock – is naïve .
We need to start investing in quality and durability .
As advertising dollars wane and media outlets shutter , green bloggers will play an ever more important role in green journalism :
1 . As staffs are cut and environmental coverage goes down , we will be able to pick up stories the mainstream media ( MSM ) misses .
We are also great trend predictors .
2 . When the MSM gets it wrong ( like the Washington Post did with George Will recently ) , bloggers will be all over the inaccuracies , narrow view points , or missing parts of the story .
Our role is to think outside the box , and make sure all sides of a story are represented .
As print entities such as Plenty , Elephant , and The Green Guide fold while mega media outlets such as CNN slash their science and environmental reporting teams , it is up to us blogs now more than ever to fill in the gaps .
Technology such as Twitter and Digg – allows us to be the modern town crier , affordably .
We are on a story and off it again before TV producers can ever get their release forms signed .
What is important to us at Treehugger and Planet Green – and to all blogs that want to be successful – is to remain nimble ; to be able to react quickly , to publish effortlessly , and to remain free to speak and be transparent .
" Professionalism " for blogs is n't the same thing as it is for printed media .
We will always have typos ( sorry boss ) and some not - perfectly resolved theories before we hit the publish button .
Yes , we will increase our knowledge of SEO , format our posts better , and send more writers to do on - the - ground reporting , and bring in bigger ad deals , but we will also remain down - and - dirty in the sense that being first to net will always appeal to us over perfectly produced videos .
We 'll take the Flip camera if it means we can get our interview with Nancy Pelosi up sooner than the Today Show .
Anecdotally speaking , the audience for green content appears to still be growing , even as budgets for green media outlets are cut .
Why green blogs matter
Climate change is arguably the most pressing issue of our time .
As the burgeoning economies of China and India play catch - up to the rest of the world 's middle class , it is imperative that we , the global population , figure out a way to live that meshes with what Earth 's resources can support .
But we can do better than that .
Because what is the point of living in a world where we only meet the bare necessities for life ?
What we must do is to challenge humankind to fulfil our potential .
To not just live in a world where the water is clean enough to drink , but to participate in a system where water is plentiful , clean , and life within it thrives .
At our very core , TreeHugger and Planet Green strives for a more intelligent way of being .
Let 's emerge from this crumbling era of greed and materialism and recognise that shopping and money and stuff is n't what makes us happy .
Environmentalism is not a moral issue or an ethical obligation , it is the best shot we 've got for increasing our collective intelligence as a species .
It is a chance to rebuild economies based on the triple bottom line .
Let 's make a profit , but let 's make it considering all costs , not at any cost .
Let 's use the hive mind to recognise the interconnectedness of all things and to understand the true cost and value of everything we create or destroy .
Our future cannot be measured only in dollars in cents , it must also be measured by standards of liberty , happiness , and health .
This is what the future of green blogging is going to show you .

I asked myself if this was a bad thing , then I realized it is still the same message .
If you do not like it , I am sorry .
This is AWESOME to me .
" We the People " Who Prefer Deflation
Patrick J. Buchanan , writing at amconmag.com , asks “ Should We Kill the Fed ? ” which is such a good idea that I herewith volunteer to forthwith do the job as soon as my embarrassingly huge salary and benefit package is finalized .
My plan is to immediately fire them all , blackballing them so that none of them ever again work , or volunteer at any business connected , even remotely , with economics or monetary policy , whereupon I would then burn the Federal Reserve place to the ground , letting the burned - out ashes remain there forever as a fabulous - yet - graphic reminder to future Americans as to what the hell will happen when you ignore your own Constitution ’s requirement that money be gold , and then compound your laughable folly by letting an evil institution like the Federal Reserve create too much money and credit out of a fiat currency , which causes inflation in prices , and especially for the horrifying purpose of allowing the federal government to constantly deficit - spend and grow , which causes flammable distortions in the economy as it is naturally skewed toward selling what government is paying for .
Actually , this sacred “ Place of Burned - Out Ashes ” idea is a perfect metaphor for the results of having a fiat currency , especially in the hands of a central bank that has no scruples or real understanding of economics , and as such , I was going to nominate myself for several major awards , one of them being a Nobel Prize Humanitarian Award ( which I understand comes with a huge wad of cash as part of the prize , which would come in real handy right now , I gotta tell ya ! ) for , “ Doing the most to help mankind by ridding the world of the horrors stemming from fiat currencies and the moronic bastards that abuse this worthless paper money to their own , irretrievably disgusting , advantage . ”
Then there ’s Time Magazine to award me the cover as “ Man of the Year ” , and maybe a guest spot on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart , where my plan is to ask him how much gold he has , and when he admits he does n’t have any , then I ’ll loudly expose him for being a moron , too !
Hahaha !
I ’ll be famous !
And then , when the producers of the show stand transfixed in surprise at this unexpected turn of events , I will leap atop the table and declare , “ America demands that you fire this Jon Stewart guy and hire me , The Mogambo , to do his job , at an even bigger salary and benefit package than he had , since I seem to be the only freaking guy around here who knows what in the hell is going on ! ”
But this is not another Dream Of The Mogambo ( DOTM ) that never seems to work out , my spirit crushed and destroyed like the buying power of a fiat currency under the hobnail boot of a spendthrift , moronic , socialist Congress and an insane Federal Reserve which has completely failed in its Congressionally chartered mandate to provide “ price stability ” , as the dollar has lost 97 % of its buying power since the Fed took over in 1913 !
Nice going , dorks !
And now we have the damned chairman of the Federal Reserve , Ben Bernanke , consistently advocating a bizarre “ inflation target ” of 2 % , whereby he will use monetary policy to get a minimum rise in prices of at least 2 % a year !
Insane !
This is n’t price stability !
This is absolute insanity !
All of this Fed - supplied inflation in the money supply will – guaranteed !
– cause more inflation in prices , which is perversely just what the Fed and Congress want .
I say “ perversely ” because inflation is the one thing that we , the people , do NOT want .
We , the people , like the idea of a deflation where prices go down , or at least no inflation in prices !
But this dreaded deflation in prices means capital losses for the Fed , Congress and their rich friends , capital gains losses for them and their rich friends , and losses of tax revenue to the government , which is also mostly run by them and their rich friends for the benefit of themselves and their rich friends .
Inflation , on the other hand , means higher prices , higher capital gains and higher tax revenues for them and their friends , all at the expense of someone else : the taxpayer / consumer , which is , at last count , you and me .
What a scam !
The big problem , of course , is that everything already has an inflated price , as Mark Faber of GloomBoomDoom.com writes , “ What Mr. Greenspan and Mr. Bernanke have achieved is historically quite unique .
They have managed to create a bubble in everything , everywhere in the world : in real estate , equities , commodities , art , worthless collectibles ; even bond prices continued to rise as interest rates fell due to loose monetary policy ” which is not to even mention the humongous size of government itself , and the cost of compliance with all the regulations of the government , all of which show up in the higher prices that people have to pay , which is one of my Particular Mogambo Peeves ( PMP ) .
On the other hand , I should cheer up , as Mr. Buchanan has given me the idea to finally listen to the voices in my head that say , “ You ’re fine !
You do n’t need medications !
Stop taking them and then burn !
Burn everything ! ”
The lesson seems to be , I guess , that I should apply their “ burn everything ! ” suggestion to the Fed , a mission made more imperative when he notes that in the period around 1930 ( the start of the Great Depression ) , prices had risen so high ( thanks to the Federal Reserve creating the excess money and credit that produced the Roaring Twenties ) that , now that the boom was ending with record amounts of debt , “ prices were simply returning to where they belonged in a free market , the first step in any cure . ”
He says that FDR , on the other hand , “ mistook the consequences of the Depression – falling prices – for the cause of the depression .
Terrified of the bogeyman that causes Ben Bernanke sleepless nights – deflation , falling prices – FDR ordered crops destroyed , pigs slaughtered , and business cartels to cut production and fix prices . ”
This was , admittedly , bad news for a lot of people back then , but that was more than 70 years ago , and now they are mostly all dead , and none of them left you so much as a dime in their will .
So to hell with them !
Shifting focus to “ us ” in general and “ me ” in particular , I gather that we may soon envy how easy they had it during the Great Depression , as “ Obama is repeating the failed policies of Hoover and FDR , by refusing to let prices fall ” which he does by “ intervention to prop up housing prices and Bernanke with his gushers of money ” which are all being used badly , as the staggering mountains of bailout money going to “ bankrupt banks and businesses are creating a new bubble that will burst even more spectacularly . ”
Whew !
Then without a note of sarcasm or hint of irony , he hints at the expensive futility of it all with the brilliant summary : “ Now the money supply is again expanding , to rescue us from a crisis created by the previous expansion . ”
I note with satisfaction that , as I recall , the last “ monetary expansion ” of Alan Greenspan ( which has now been completely eclipsed by Bernanke in cahoots with the Treasury Department ) saw gold rise from a low of about $ 260 an ounce to over $ 1,000 .
With a little childishly linear extrapolation , a little history , a little Austrian school of economics , and an awesome abundance of Sheer Mogambo Arrogance ( SMA ) , I gotta tell ya , if you ai n’t buying gold , then you are betting everything you have , or are going to have , on something succeeding that has never succeeded , no matter how many people tried to make it succeed , in all of history .
Whereas the guys owning gold have won every long - term bet against fiat currencies in all of history !
Whee !
This investing stuff is easy !
This week , researchers and scientists at UCLA are doing something unusual :
They are organizing a demonstration against the violent tactics of certain animal rights groups .
This week , people in labs across the country are saying :
It 's about time .
--
It 's about time that people came out of their labs and off the bench and took a public stand , rather than relying upon trade groups and animal providers to make the case for them
--
It 's about time that science generated its own leaders to pro-actively make the case for animal testing , rather than rely on the usual ( and rather suspect ) cast of pharmaceutical companies and toxicology labs
--
It 's about time that independent scientists put a human face on the very human targets of animal terrorism -- terrorism that has in just the past year resulted in a number of fire bombings of university researchers .
-- And , it 's about time to respond forthrightly -- and with the best data they 've got -- to the legitimate concerns raised by more legitimate animal welfare organizations .
Bravo to UCLA for leading the way .
The question now :
What 's next ?
One answer : Researchers and their test animals must get closer to one another .
Since only one side of the party has a choice , that means that researchers must reconnect with the animal - - both for the sake of better animal husbandry and better science .
Although the great emotional fuss at UCLA and elsewhere concerns primates , the bulk of biomedical work today uses mice and rats , with a growing number of amphibians and fish joining the ranks as well .
Because these are small , relatively inexpensive and fairly well characterized , they are used and killed in great numbers .
One consequence of that is that they occupy a fairly abstract realm , far from the empathogenic profile projected by primates .
It 's a perfectly understandable human inclination , but it comes with a cost .
Ed Masoro , the retired University of Texas pioneer in mouse and rat metabolism , once explained the conundrum this way : " It used to be we had animals .
Today we have models .
and what 's more we have transgenic models -- models that are created solely for their mutant qualities -- for , say , testing a thesis about what causes inflammation .
That 's fine , but what I find you often up with are grad students and young post docs who perfectly understand how to propose an experiment using a transgenic mouse , say , an APOE knockout to test a heart drug , but who at the same time have almost no idea about the physiology of the underlying animal .
They are playing with the transgenic novelty without enough consideration of the basic animal . "
As Masoro explained , that can have an obvious downside when intepreting results .
It may also at least partly explain why , to date , their have been no new breakthrough drugs created with transgenics .
( Gleevac was discovered with ordinary black - 6 mice . )
There is another reason for researchers get a little emotionally closer to their subjects : the growing body of literature showing that mice and rats possess a sense of empathy for one another , something long thought the exclusive domain of primates .
Designers of animal tests must learn to calulate - in the added stress of confined housing on an animal that may be more sensative to neural tweaking than they thought .
At a conference a the Jackson Laboratories last year , an NIH department head told a group of neurobiologists that " the average researcher today has no clue about how to adjust for these new insights . "
And so the science itself may someday be called into question .
None of this diminishes the importance and need for this week 's demonstrations .
Rather , it points to the next part of the march : Retaking the high ground when it comes to animal welfare .
Here are a few suggestions :
-- Make the transcripts of the Institutional Animal Use and Care Commitee , or IACUC , available online .
These documents , which show how the institution handles specific cases of animal misuse or abuse , are supposed to be public , but one usually has to go though a lengthy Freedom of Information Act request to get them .
It is also complicated because PETA and the Animal Liberation Front have tried to use the access provision to gain physical entry to these important meetings ; their ends are notoriously intimidating and nefarious .
One way to get the information out without endangering anyone is to redact all names from the transcripts -- something for which any sophomore in high school could write a program .
Then post them for all to see .
If you are not doing anything wrong , you have nothing to hide .
Strike one from the animal rights arsenal of polemic .
-- Quit using words like " model " for animal and " sacrifice " for kill .
Everyone knows what these words mean .
Using them is dishonest and instills distrust .
Instead follow the very explicit guidlines laid down by the American Association for Laboratory Animal Science , or other organizations .
Get over it .
-- Make economic transparency your byword :
There is nothing legally wrong with sponsored pharmaceutical research , provided it is done with approval by the right Institutional Review Board , or IRB .
But try finding that out through normal channels and one finds oneself in a maze of institutional baloney - speak and buck - passing .
On every animal experiment posted on the ( above ) IACUC transcripts , notate the name of the sponsor .
Transparency eviscerates conspiracy -- the first law of honest spin .
-- Take the high road on alternative testing .
Everyone pays lip service to this NIH mission statement , but no one does it systematically .
( At UCLA the effort seems limited to one internet site with tags to other internet sites . )
Instead , large institutions should set up independent offices of alternative testing , and share that data with smaller institutions .
The downside would be minimal , the upside could be huge savings in cage - cleaning fees and other expenses .
-- Lastly , do some non-crisis outreach :
Try something simple at first , say , taking a few animals to local high school biology classes and discussing the moral and ethical issues headfirst .
More : leave a few mice behind , for observation and continued discussion .
None of these actions , of course , will do anything to convince some ALF goon from blowing up another mailbox .
But they may go a long way toward winning over the general public , and make recruiting the next generation of fanatics a lot harder .

The obvious and generally correct answer would be that the reflected image would be 2,000 years old when the astronomer looked at it ; he would be looking into the past .
And we 'll ignore the technical issues of such a telescope and mirror .
An important factor , though , is how long the mirror has been there .
If the mirror is less than 1,000 years old , then the observer could n't see the mirror at all , nor anything reflected in it .
The light traveling from the mirror towards Earth would not have reached the Earth yet , so the presence of the mirror would be undetectable .
If the mirror is 1,000 years old or older , then the observer would see the reflected Earth of 2,000 years prior .
It might seem like you 'd have to wait 2,000 years to see the Earth 's reflection ( 1,000 years to get there , 1,000 years to come back ) , but whether the mirror was there or not , the photons leaving Earth are already streaming out into space .
The moment the mirror is put in place , it begins reflecting that light , and the image , back towards the Earth .
The image that reaches the mirror is already 1,000 years old , and is immediately turned around by the reflection , so it spends another 1,000 years traveling back towards Earth where it can be observed by the astronomer .
So by putting a mirror 1,000 light years away , you at first see nothing , having to wait for 1,000 years for the light from the mirror to reach Earth , at which point you see Earth 2,000 years previously .
It would be another 2,000 years before someone could see the original observer 's reflection in the mirror ( 1,000 years for that image to get to the mirror , another 1,000 for the return trip ) .
But if a telescope was pointed at the spot where the mirror WOULD be , 1,000 years before the mirror got there , then the first images you would see in the mirror would be a person looking " at " the mirror ( which would be visible 1,000 years after the mirror is put in place , since it has to make the return trip ) .
If you start looking at the spot the mirror will be at more than 1,000 years early , though , anything before 1,000 years early wo n't be seen because the image will have passed the mirror before it can reflect it back .
So , brief summary ...
You can't see the mirror until 1,000 years after it is placed .
Once you can see the mirror , the image you see in it will be 2,000 years old .
A greenhouse to grow mustard flowers will piggyback on a lunar lander being developed by Odyssey Moon , a competitor in the Google Lunar X Prize contest ( Illustration : Paragon Space Development )
A firm that has designed habitats for plants and animals living in microgravity now hopes to grow the first flowers on the moon , the company ’s founders announced on Friday .
Engineering firm Paragon Space Development plans to build a greenhouse to fly to the moon .
It is set to travel on a lunar lander designed by Odyssey Moon , a competitor for the Google Lunar X Prize , a $ 30 million contest to send an unmanned lunar rover to the moon .
The greenhouse will be used to incubate fast - growing mustard seeds on the lunar surface , in the hopes of producing flowering plants and an iconic image that could be as thrilling as the Apollo images of Earth - rise over the lunar surface .
“ We want there to be a great inspirational picture , ” says Paragon CEO Taber MacCallum , who was one of the inhabitants of Biosphere 2 , a greenhouse - like enclosure that housed eight inhabitants for two years in the early 1990s .

Lunar colonies
A photograph of flowers on the moon is expected to stir up enthusiasm for spaceflight , but the team also hopes the greenhouse will be the first step in sustainable development of the lunar surface .
“ We ’re sending the mustard first and hot dogs need to follow , ” jokes Odyssey Moon founder Bob Richards .
“ Hopefully these will be the precursors to the greenhouses you would need to live on the moon . ”
Building a greenhouse that can grow plants on the moon and be transparent enough to produce dramatic photographs will not be easy .
“ We have a very tricky requirement set , ” says Paragon co-founder Jane Poynter .
Harsh conditions
The prototype unveiled on Friday is a metal - reinforced glass dome that is some 9 centimetres in diameter and 30 centimetres high , enough space to grow roughly six plants .
But the enclosure will need to be modified to protect plants from the vagaries of space radiation and extremes in temperature on the lunar surface , which can range from a frigid - 170 °C to just above 100 °C .
To avoid the cold of the lunar night , which lasts for 14 Earth days , the team decided to send up a fast - growing member of the mustard family .
The mustard plant can grow from seed to flower over the course of a single lunar day , or two Earth weeks .
But a number of details still need to be worked out .
It is not clear how the seeds themselves will be planted .
Because ordinary soil is easily jostled , the team is considering using a stickier substrate , like seaweed - derived agar , to grow the plants .
A time to plant
Timing is also key .
If the seeds are embedded in the agar on the launch pad , they will already be well on the way to flowering by the time they reach the lunar surface , MacCallum says .
So the team may have to devise a way to hydrate the seeds after the lander has touched down on the moon .
The launch date for the greenhouse has not yet been set .
To win the Lunar X Prize , Odyssey Moon must be the first team to landed a robotic probe on the moon , drive a rover 500 metres , and send back pictures by 2014 .
Odyssey Moon aims to launch its lander and rover by the end of 2011 to win the $ 20 million first prize , which will be reduced to $ 15 million in 2013 .
But the team ’s timeline may slip , Richards says .
“ We ’re not in a race .
We ’re trying to come up with a viable commercial enterprise so we can start to populate the moon with more and more missions , ” he told New Scientist .
Influenza patients between 10 and 17 who took Tamiflu were 54 per cent more likely to exhibit serious abnormal behaviour than those who did not take the antiflu drug , a final report from a Japanese Health , Labour and Welfare Ministry research team , said .
The team , led by Yoshio Hirota , a professor at Osaka City University , studied the cases of about 10,000 children under 18 who had been diagnosed with influenza since 2006 .
It will soon submit the report to a safety research committee of the ministry 's Pharmaceutical Affairs and Food Sanitation Council .
" The link with Tamiflu can't be ruled out , " the report said .
" New research should be carried out , focusing on serious abnormal behaviour . "
The ministry suspended the use , in principle , of the drug by 10 - to 19 - year - olds in 2007 after a number of children behaved abnormally after taking it .
Examples of such behaviour include one child who started to hop after taking the drug and another who tried to jump from a balcony .
The new findings make it unlikely the ministry will lift the ban .

Advertisement Cameras have revealed how elephants are able to get a drink of fresh water when faced with a stagnant waterhole .
A BBC team discovered that the tusked giants use their trunks to delicately siphon off clean liquid that has settled at the top of the dirty pool .
The footage shows how the elephants move incredibly slowly to avoid stirring up any sediment .
The Natural History Unit team said this was the first time that they had seen this resourceful behaviour .
However much we think we know about elephants , they always surprise us with some new and intelligent piece of behaviour
Mike Holding
The film forms part of Nature 's Great Events : The Great Flood , which follows the annual flooding of Botswana 's Okavango Delta , where , for a limited time , the surrounding desert is transformed into a lush wetland .
' Timely reminder '
The new behaviour was recorded in the Kalahari Desert just before the arrival of the flood ; temperatures during the dry season can soar above 50C .
The BBC team waited by a waterhole - a lifeline for animals living on this parched terrain - to film the elephants as they came to drink .
The Okavango Delta floods each year Wildlife cameraman Mike Holding said : " Thirsty elephants usually rush head - long into water and splash with abandon , but this group did something I had never seen before - they approached the pool quietly and stepped in very slowly , making as little disturbance as possible .
" And then , remarkably , one after another , the elephants began to carefully sweep their trunk tips across the surface , delicately siphoning the few centimetres of clear liquid from the mud below . "
The film - maker says he has never seen the elephants use their trunks in this way before .
He said : " I have spent countless days in the company of elephants , and I believe this was a timely reminder that however much we think we know about elephants , they always surprise us with some new and intelligent piece of behaviour . "
Nature 's Great Events : The Great Flood is on Wednesday 11 March on BBC One at 2100 GMT and is repeated on Sunday at 1800 GMT

Breast Augmentation : Costs Breast Implants Cost from $ 2,250
With Financing $ 70 per month Index : Overview and Pre -Op - Procedures and Techniques - Recovery Women with small or underdeveloped breasts who wish to enhance their appearance may choose to have a procedure called breast augmentation or mammoplasty .
Breast augmentation costs vary greatly from surgeon to surgeon .
Understanding the different techniques involved will help you bugdet for breast augmentation surgery better .
A fuller body contour can be safely achieved through the placement of implants directly under the breast tissue or beneath the chest wall muscle .
Implants that are filled with saline or salt - water , silicone or gel can be used for breast augmentation procedures .
Small incisions are made so that the implant can be inserted .
These small incisions may be made in the crease under the breast or under the nipple .
The implant is then filled to achieve the desired size and shape of the breast .
The surgery can be performed as an outpatient under general anesthesia or ambulatory ( local anesthesia ) and takes approximately 2 - 3 hours to complete .
Most patients can resume to normal activities within 5 - 6 days following surgery .
Sutures are removed in 7 to ten days and your surgeon may recommend a surgical support bra .
Exercise and other strenuous activities may be resumed in about one month .
Anesthesia : General or local with Sedation Location : Hospital Minimum Stay : 10 days
At the initial visit , your doctor will likely ask you to describe in detail what you would like improved .
Be specific about what you would like done .
If your surgeon fully understands your expectations , he 'll be able to determine whether your goals are realistic .
Your surgeon will examine your breasts .
He will talk to you about the size you want your breasts to be and other considerations involved with breast augmentation .
Discuss with your surgeon : Breast Implant shape : round or teardrop
Breast Implant surface : smooth or textured
Breast Implant size and volume : cup size / 210 ml -500 ml
Breast Implant placement : above or below the muscle
Breast Implant Incision site : armpit , areola , breast or belly button See Breast Augmentation Procedures / Techniques for detailed comparisons of these options .
You are at increased risk for complications if you have diabetes , poor circulation , heart , lung or liver disease , smoke , have a family history of blood clots , take certain medications , etc .
You 'll want to discuss your medical history thoroughly with your physician .
Breast Surgery Pre-op Preparation Before Breast Surgery :
If you smoke , quit smoking for at least 2 weeks pre-op ( and anticipate no smoking for the recovery , smoking greatly increases your risk of complications )
Do not take aspirin or anti-inflammatory medications for two weeks
Your SSI personal assistant will help you fill prescriptions ( especially pain medications and antibiotics ) before surgery
Set up recovery area : lots of pillows , books , magazines , journal , stationery , T.V. , remote control , videos , favorite CDs
Black out windows so you can rest during the day
Dietary Needs : Consider quick snacks : Protein shakes , soup , applesauce , jell - O , frozen dinners , yogurt , oatmeal , cottage cheese , juice ( purchase flexible straws for easier drinking )
Be sure to have adequate protein - the body needs it for proper healing
Talk to your doctor about low - sodium foods to reduce swelling
Prepare Icepacks ( can also use packs of frozen veggies or fruit , gel packs , etc / ) to reduce post - op swelling
Moisturizers , scar reducing creams and petroleum jelly for incisions
Laxatives ( pain medications are often binding )
Eye Drops ( after any surgery , eyes can be dry )
Consider hand - held shower head and bathroom chair
On the day of surgery , wear loose clothing which will be easy to get off and on after operation ( a shirt that buttons in front )
Follow your physician 's directions carefully regarding medications , eating & drinking .

Many of my friends say that there is no loss of sensitivity in the nipple after their breast implants , but is there a higher risk of losing sensitivity if it put in through the nipple .
Marcy D.- Minnesota SSI_Answer
Loss of sensation in nipples
after breast augmentation
Marcy , this is a very important question and many women have the same concern of having loss of sensation in nipples after breast augmentation .
After discussing this with a couple plastic surgeons the general consensus was that many of the patients had absolutely no loss of sensation but this is still a risk and could be a slightly higher risk if you decided to have the implant put in through the nipple .
Their advice is that if this is a major concern talk to your doctor about the different techniques used .

Sharleen - New York SSI_Answer Breast augmentation
pricing in new york Sharleen , from what I have discovered New York and Texas are the two most expensive places in the United States to have any type of Plastic or Cosmetic surgery .
Why ?
I think there are a couple factors .
One is the hospitals or surgical facilities , another is mal practice insurance is extremely high in these states and finally there is a lot of demand for plastic surgery in these states .

Tory , yes I know exactly what you mean .
Medical tourism has been around for a very long time and hundreds of thousands of people travel every year to receive medical treatments but that does n't mean that it is right for everyone .
Make sure you feel comfortable with your surgeon and do n't base your decision solely on cost .
This is an important decision that will stay with you for the rest of your life .

Breast Implants Info
Amazon , the world ’s largest online retailer , has lifted most of the delivery restrictions it previously applied to shoppers in Ireland .
Since last week , the company is shipping electronics and a wide variety of other goods to Irish customers for the first time in three years .
This follows a company decision to implement the WEEE ( Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment ) directive on waste recycling of electronics products by collecting the levy due to the Government here .
An Amazon spokesman confirmed to The Irish Times that the company had decided to comply with the directive so as to make its products available to the widest range of customers .
The company says it will now take back old electrical equipment on a like - for - like basis , free of charge .
Irish customers are being advised to bring such used products to one of four recycling centres in Dublin , Cork , Galway and Kilkenny .
The lifting of restrictions applies to goods sold by amazon.co.uk directly but not to third party resellers who use the Amazon website .
Previously , amazon.co.uk ’s customers in Ireland could purchase only books , music , DVDs and computer games .
However , a restriction on delivery of heavy goods weighing over 30 kg remains in place , and orders for mobile phones and light - bulbs will not be taken from Irish customers either .
The prices on the amazon.co.uk site list British Vat at 15 per cent but Irish customers get charged the Irish rate of 21.5 per cent at checkout .
Amazon stopped delivering electrical goods to Ireland in 2006 after a row over the implementation of the WEEE directive .
The company claimed it was being asked to pay WEEE waste tariffs for goods on which the producers had already paid equivalent tariffs .
Some other leading online retailers placed similar restrictions on Irish customers while others freely delivered all products to the Republic .
Amazon ’s change of heart is likely to prove a major boost for online commerce here , even if its dominance of the market is less marked than before .
Imitation is the sincerest form of frustration flattery .
Kotaku and 1 Up seemed to have recently received the memo we sent out last week about the next PSP , tentatively named “ PSP Go ” .
The funny thing is , neither site bothered to cite sources for their information , though Kotaku claims they were tipped off by “ PJ and Mr. Wednesday ” .
Evidently Professor Plum and Colonel Mustard had the day off .
While we here at PlayStation LifeStyle do not own the news , we cannot help but feel that some of this information has been inspired by us .
Perhaps even via the conduit of the mysterious PJ and Mr. Wednesday .
But at least Kotaku admitted to some assistance ; 1UP ’s article on the other hand seems to have materialized out of thin air .
They even went as far as to provide a piss - poor rendition of our mockup .
For an encore , it seems that N4G has a new policy of allowing week old news , so long as you have the Alexa balls to back it up .
But at least you , the astute readers of the internet , know what ’s going on .
That ’s what matters .
Remember , when it comes to breaking PlayStation news , you can read it here today … or next week at 1 Up and Kotaku .
See ya at E3 guys . 🙂
The policy followed swearing by Bono at the 2003 Golden Globes
The US government 's policy of fining broadcasters over the use of even a single swear word on live TV is justified , the Supreme Court has ruled .
The " fleeting expletives " policy , introduced in 2004 , was on hold after a legal challenge by TV company Fox .
The Federal Communications Commission introduced the rule after Bono swore at the 2003 Golden Globes .
It previously had a " one free expletive " rule .
Justice Antonin Scalia said the new policy had been " entirely rational " .
Fox 's legal challenge stemmed from a 2006 FCC ruling that the network had violated decency during its broadcast of the Billboard Music Awards at which celebrities had sworn .
Even when used as an expletive , the F - word 's power to insult and offend derives from its sexual meaning
Justice Antonin Scalia
The network , together with ABC , NBC and CBS , legally challenged the FCC policy by arguing that the decency standard was unclear and undermined free speech protections .
The policy was put on hold after a New York appeals court ruled in favour of Fox , saying the FCC had not adequately explained the change and that it was arbitrary and vague .
' Rational ' But , on Tuesday , the Supreme Court voted by five to four , overturning the ruling stating the policy was " neither arbitrary nor capricious " .
" The agency 's reasons for expanding its enforcement activity , moreover , were entirely rational , " Justice Scalia said .
The FCC had changed its policy on fleeting expletives that denote " sexual or excretory activities " as part of a crackdown on indecency on TV .
" Even when used as an expletive , the F - word 's power to insult and offend derives from its sexual meaning , " Justice Scalia added .
The Supreme Court justices said the reinstated policy may now go before a federal appeals court to judge whether it breached free speech laws .

Firefox users love their tabbed browsing capability , but if you leave tabs unchecked they can get completely out of control .
For those of you who feel lost in a sea of tabs , there are numerous ways to manage them ;

Tab Display & Placement
Chromin Frame -
If you prefer the way Google Chrome places tabs at the top of the window , this add - on will aid you in recreating that same placement .

Feel more comfortable with a tree hierarchical system for your tabs ?
Tree Style Tab does just this by placing the tabs in a sidebar , and attaching new tabs to each tree as you follow links from page to page .
This is a great add - on for designers who need to see how a site they wish to duplicate is structured , or for those checking out a site they 've designed to see how it flows .
VertTabbar - VertTabbar places your tabs in a vertical menu located on either the right or left hand side of your browser .
The preferences allow you to determine the width , position of the closure button , alignment of the text and more .

Tab Management

The name of this add - on pretty much says it all as it will allow you to quickly double click on a tab to close it .

Tab Kit allows you to have multiple rows of tabs as well as give them colors so they are easy to distinguish .
You can also put them into groups , move them to the sidebar , duplicate tabs and a host of other controls , making this a great solution for your all - in - one tab manager .
Tabs Menu -
This add - on gives you a new listing in the toolbar that will show you the titles of all your tabs in a vertical descending menu .
Great if you have a lot of tabs open as the names get smaller with each new tab .

For example , as each tab loads , you see a progress bar contained inside of the tab header so you can view its progress .

This is the perfect add - on for intensive research .

LastTab - Ctrl - Tab navigation is altered with this add - on that allows you to get to the most recently opened tabs first , and also adds a drop down menu for mouse navigation through your tabs .

Unlike other scrolling add - ons , this one can be used from anywhere in the browser window since it requires the right - click to work .
Tab Wheel Scroll -
This add - on has one simple duty , and that is to place your mouse in the tab bar and then use your scroll wheel to move back and forth amongst the tabs to select the one you want to switch to .
Wonderful extension for those that have numerous tabs open at any given time .
Tab Visualization
Firefox Showcase - The Firefox Showcase add - on gives you the ability to manage your tabs as thumbnails in a window , tab or sidebar .
Each thumbnailed tab also receives a label , the ability to drag - and - drop rearrangement , and more .
A great idea for students doing research that need to use multiple sources .
FishEyeTabs -
This particular tool will magnify a tab for easier reading when you have too many tabs open and the labels have gotten too small for you to read .
FoxTab - FoxTab provides you with five graphical interfaces for displaying your tabs so that you can browse through them without just having to stare at the names along the top and hope you remember what the site is about .
This extension could be especially useful to web designers as you can easily have multiple screenshots displayed at once depending on the configuration you choose .

Once the thumbnails are open , you can close any of them or multiple tabs at once .
Tab Popup - Tab Popup allows you to simply roll your mouse over a tab to see a preview of what it contains .
Since the previews are larger than a standard thumbnail , Tab Popup is great for people who need to have lots of tabs open for research .
Tab Preview -
This popup preview lets you set options such as how long after mouseover it should display the preview , the size of the thumbnail and where it should be displayed .
Tab Sidebar -
As the name suggests , Tab Sidebar moves your tabs to the sidebar , hiding the original tabs menu .
The most noticeable difference with this new placement is that you get a thumbnail preview of each tab in the sidebar for easier browsing .
Other features include updating thumbnails , navigation for each tab , drag - and - drop movement of the tabs and more .
Tab Slideshow - Tab Slideshow will begin scrolling through all of your open tabs after an amount of time that you set .
While this might not be the most useful add - on , it could be a fun screensaver while you 're on a phone call .
Miscellaneous Tools
Basics -
The name says it all with this add - on that only has one basic feature , moving the " New Tab " button from the right side of the tab bar to the left .
This makes sense since we English speakers are used to moving across screen from left to right .
Morning Coffee -
While there are other extensions that let you save tabs to open each time you start Firefox , Morning Coffee allows you to setup which tabs open automatically according to which day of the week it is .
The example they give is the web comic Penny Arcade that updates Monday , Wednesday and Friday , so there 's no need to open that site on Tuesday and Thursday , and that 's no problem for this handy application .
This is absolutely perfect for the Internet addicted amongst us , which is pretty much all of us .
Page Title Eraser - With Page Title Eraser , you are able to completely erase the title of the tab from your window so it just appears untitled in your browser .
You can also use it to rename a title if you choose to do so , making it impossible for anyone to look over your shoulder and get an idea of what you 're looking at .
Send Tab URLs -
This extension will allow you to copy the URLs of all your currently open tabs to the clipboard or directly to an email program .
If you plan to send the list to email , it can only be 30 addresses long , but the clipboard allows for unlimited addresses .
This is the perfect tool for people who need to cite the resources they use for projects .
Tab History -
Whenever you open a new tab , it opens up with no history , but with Tab History all of your new tabs retain the browsing history of their " parent " tab .
This is especially handy if you are splintering off tabs from the same site over and over to explore different parts of the site .
Tab URL Copier -
This add - on provides you with a new choice in your right - click context menu that allows you to copy the URLs of all your open tabs to the clipboard so that you can email them or simply keep track of them for any research you may be doing .
TabRenamizer -
Ever had sites open in a tab that you would rather not have your boss or family know you are looking at ?
Even if you have another tab in the foreground , the name of the site still appears on the other tab , but with TabRenamizer you rename a tab to anything of your choosing .
Great tool for anyone that needs to conceal a site they may not want others to know they are browsing .
More Firefox resources from Mashable :
( Entertainment Weekly ) --
In the first truly shocking box office result of the year , " Fast & Furious " sped away from expectations to gross a humongous $ 72.5 million , according to early estimates from Media by Numbers .
Paul Walker stars in " Fast & Furious , " which exceeded expectations after taking in $ 72.5 million .
That result is effectively double what most industry observers had predicted for the debut of the fourth feature in Vin Diesel 's car franchise , and it left in the dust a number of notable records :
- Best April opening ever , beating " Anger Management 's " $ 42.2 million .
- Best Universal Pictures opening ever ( three - day ) , beating " The Lost World : Jurassic Park 's " $ 72.1 million .
- Best F&F franchise opening ever , beating " 2 Fast 2 Furious ' " $ 50.5 million .
- Best opening yet in 2009 , easily beating the bows of the more - buzzed - about " Monsters vs. Aliens " ( $ 59.3 million ) and " Watchmen " ( $ 55.2 million ) .
- Best opening ever for stars Diesel , Paul Walker , Michelle Rodriguez , and Jordana Brewster , as well as for director Justin Lin .
Oh , and let 's not forget that it was the best opening ever for a car - themed movie !
( Beating " Cars ' " $ 60.1 million . )
This outcome is impressive , indeed , something that has caught Hollywood by surprise and has the potential to really change things up -- like when summer - esque blockbusters are released ( rarely does one open so early in the year ) and like , you know , what everyone thinks of Vin Diesel .
Do n't Miss EW.com : Box office top 10
The film did it all on the strength of a solid A- CinemaScore review from an audience that was 57 percent male and 59 percent over age 25 .
Like the jaw - dropping early - year debuts of " The Passion of the Christ " and " 300 " before it , this is a history - making premiere that you may well be hearing about for a long time to come .
So , yeah , I almost forgot to mention : " Fast & Furious " was the No. 1 movie at the box office this weekend .
Coming in strong at No. 2 was " Monsters vs. Aliens , " which dropped a respectable 44 percent to earn $ 33.5 million .
In 10 days , the 3 - D extravaganza has banked $ 105.7 million .
" The Haunting in Connecticut " ( No. 3 with $ 9.6 million ) , " Knowing " ( No. 4 with $ 8.1 million ) , and " I Love You , Man " ( No. 5 with $ 7.9 million ) rounded out the top five .
And the weekend 's other big new release , " Adventureland , " struggled with $ 6 million at No. 6 .
Overall , the box office was up a monstrous 68 percent from the same frame a year ago , when holdover 21 outplayed a number of weak new movies , none of which had Vin Diesel ... whom you 're going to start hearing a lot about , once again .

He took them to McDonald 's and Canada 's Wonderland .
He gave them marijuana to smoke .
He earned a reputation for being " cool " because he bought them alcohol and cigarettes .
One girl even thought he had a good heart – if you got past his appetite for sex with children .
Another said he told her he loved her , and promised that each incident of abuse was the last .
Over 14 years , Michael Ross Stratton befriended the daughters of acquaintances , friends and visitors to his Whitby home , then sexually abused them .
His video camera was never far away .
Yesterday , with his legs in chains and wavy hair in a ponytail , Stratton , 41 , pleaded guilty to 13 counts of sexual abuse and child pornography .
The details of his crimes involving nine victims , aged about 6 to 17 , were read from an agreed statement of facts in Whitby court .
Three of his victims , now adults , wiped their eyes with tissues during the daylong hearing in the Ontario Court of Justice .
Stratton , who appeared in court clean - shaven and wearing a blue sweater , targeted girls for oral sex , fondling and in at least one case , sexual intercourse .
Sixty videotapes seized by police after his arrest in June 2006 contained 25 hours of abuse .
Police also found more than 2,000 images of child pornography on his computer .
Some of the assaults took place while the children were sleeping .
If they woke up , Stratton would convince them that what he was doing was okay , or threaten them not to tell anyone , according to the facts read by Crown attorney Kent Saliwonchyk .
The stocky elevator company mechanic sometimes used bribery or rewards for letting him do what he wanted to , but the rewards did n't always materialize , Saliwonchyk said .
Stratton 's youngest victim , believed to be about 6 in the videotape of her abuse in 2001 , still has not been identified .
The assaults happened between 1992 and 2006 in the semi-detached bungalow on Rosedale Dr. in Whitby where Stratton lived until his arrest .
He was in a common - law relationship until 1991 and has a son .
Seasoned Durham Region police investigators called it the worst case of child exploitation they had seen .
One officer was taken off the investigation when he became ill after viewing the videotapes depicting children being sexually abused , a detective said at the time .
The situation came to light when police were investigating the case of a distraught young woman who was threatening suicide in Ajax .
She told them Stratton had abused her for three years after befriending her when she was kicked out of her own home , according to the summary of facts .
In many cases , victims were abused numerous times over several years .
Stratton originally faced 285 charges , including sexual assault , making child pornography and forcible confinement .
But charges were grouped together for each victim to make the case more " manageable , " Saliwonchyk told Justice Paul Bellefontaine .
One victim , who was abused over eight years , told police Stratton " had a weird side " and enjoyed drugs and pornography .
She tried to get him to go for counselling but he refused to return after one session .
Another girl said Stratton kept a video camera on the wall unit beside his bed .
He sometimes taped himself during incidents .

The teenager whom he professed to love endured a few years of different forms of sexual abuse , constantly hoping it would end .
" It was always supposed to stop after the next birthday or Christmas or New Year 's , but it didn't , " Saliwonchyk said .
The case continues today .

All very valid questions we need to ask before we pour some over our cereal in the morning for ourselves or our children .
Farmers inject their cattle with BST and yield 10 % more milk from the same herd .
A single 500 mg dose is given every 14 days , beginning the ninth week of lactation .
It is injected into the tailhead or behind the shoulder area of the cow .
The leading company in BST production is Monsanto .
The Monsanto scientists took a cow ’s growth hormone and altered it with E. coli bacteria .
Monsanto marketed it under the brand name Posilac .
It is also called recombinant bovine growth hormone ( rbGH ) or recombinant bovine somatotropin ( rbST ) .
But cows often get sick and die young .
Approved in the United States in 1993 , by 2002 rbGH was used on 22 % of the nation ’s dairy cows .
It is banned in the European Union , Canada , Australia , New Zealand , and Japan .
Bovine Growth Hormone ( rBGH ) has been reliably linked to health problems that cause extreme suffering to cows , including mastitis , a painful inflammation of the udder .
In scientific and public health terms , data continues to pile up that significantly increased levels of the human growth hormone factor IGF - 1 in genetically engineered milk and dairy products constitute a serious human health risk for increased breast and colon cancer .
In addition , scientific studies have recently been brought to the attention of the World Health Organization that injecting mammals with genetically engineered growth hormones very likely increases their susceptibility to deadly , incurable brain - wasting diseases such as BSE , commonly known as Mad Cow Disease , or its human variant , Creutzfeld - Jakob Disease .
Here is why Drugged Milk is dangerous , and how corporate manipulation , bad science , and political collusion pushed it into our food supply .
• An FDA scientist who demanded more safety studies on rbGH , but was fired for holding up its approval .
• A FOX TV investigative reporter whose news series linking rbGH to cancer was canceled after the station received letters from Monsanto ’s attorney threatening “ dire consequences for Fox News . ”
• Canadian government scientists who wrote a scathing critique of the FDA ’s flawed and biased evaluation of rbGH , and then testified about political pressure , stolen evidence , and an alleged bribe offer from Monsanto .
• Rigged research from the drug ’s maker , meticulously designed to cover up health problems .
• A scientist who did rbGH research for Monsanto , and then became the drug ’s lead reviewer at the FDA .
• Michael Taylor , Monsanto ’s former attorney , who was in charge of FDA policy when rbGH was approved .
He later became Monsanto ’s vice president .
Part 2 – Your milk on drugs !
“ The whole rbGH thing represents fundamental flaws in the regulatory process .
. . .
It was bad science and bad regulation . ”
This was the conclusion of former FDA veterinarian Richard Burroughs , who was a lead reviewer in the approval process of recombinant bovine growth hormone ( rbGH ) for nearly five years .
The drug “ was approved prematurely without adequate information , ” says Burroughs , whose life and career became a casualty in a perfect storm of industry manipulation and political collusion .
As the only member of the FDA team who had dairy herd experience , Burroughs wrote the original protocols for evaluating the safety of rbGH on cows .
The FDA did n’t conduct the tests themselves .
It was always the drug ’s maker who performed the studies and reported the results .
But according to Burroughs , they “ would come in and try to negotiate the protocols to water them down . ”
And when they ultimately presented their findings , Burroughs was shocked to discover , “ They just went out and skewed the data . ”
Furthermore , relying on a summary of a study , rather than on detailed
data from the study , would violate FDA ’s published procedures .
A normal study is for two years when determining if a drug is carcinogenic .
Monsanto only tested the rats for 28 or 90 days .
If the FDA had looked at the detailed data this would have stood out .
In its 1990 SCIENCE article , FDA said that “ the FDA requires the
pharmaceutical companies to submit all studies they conducted on their products ” and said , “ The companies also submit the raw data from all safety studies that will form the basis of the approval of the product ; …. ” [ 2,pg.876 ]
Furthermore , FDA explained that , “ If the initial toxicity study demonstrates that the protein [ such as rBGH ] is indeed orally active , additional testing may be required . ” [ 2,pg.876 ]
Thus if FDA had known in 1990 that Monsanto ’s rat feeding study had indicated that rBGH was orally active in rats , additional testing could have been required before a decision was made to approve or disapprove the genetically - engineered drug .
The only way to be safe is to buy organic milk , until they stop injecting cows with Bovine Growth Hormones .
You ’ve backed up all files in your harddisk , thanks to Mozy , DropBox , SugarSync , or Carbonite .
But there are some things that you ’re yet to backup .
What are they , you ask ?
Let ’s check them out one by one :
# 1 : Your Blog
You started a blog some time ago and now it ’s grown into a big community of sorts .
Your life without your blog would be a nightmare .
It ’s always good to have a backup of your blog so that in the worst case scenario , you can safely restore the contents of the blog and start writing again as if nothing happened !
If you ’re on WordPress , WP DB Backup is the only plugin you ’ll ever need to do a regular backup of your blog .
You can install the plugin and tell it to send automatic backups of your blog to your email inbox .
Install .
Configure .
Forget .
Just as easy as that .
Pro Blog Design has a complete guide on how you can go about doing it .
If you ’re blogging using other platforms , check out this post that lists some good apps that can backup your blog .
# 2 : Your Gmail
Most of you reading this should be using Gmail .
And I ’m sure with the amount of storage that Gmail provides , you ’ll never feel like deleting emails .
So what if Google locks you up one day and that is the day when you desperately need to have a look at an email you sent ?
You would n’t worry much if you had used Gmail Backup .
The program works on Windows , Mac and Linux and it ’s not just limited to backing up Gmail messages , but can also restore them to another account .
You gotta have POP / IMAP enabled for your account for this to work .
This tool is being continuously developed as you can see on their site , and there are niggles that are being ironed out periodically .
You need to give your Gmail ID and password and so use it at your own risk .
# 3 : Your Mobile Phone
Perhaps the most indispensable gadget is your mobile phone .
With hundreds of contacts , heaps of text messages , and more importantly , your calendar , you should have gotten it all backed up .
No hassles if you ’ve got a Nokia mobile phone because the Nokia PC Suite makes the backup process a piece of cake â€ “ a step - by - step guide is here is for your reference .
If you want to put it up in the cloud , you can use either Mobical or Zyb .
While both of these tools can allow you to backup contacts and other data and even modify them , Zyb adds a social layer to the entire thing by showing updates from your contacts on social networks .
# 4 : Your PC Drivers
As I mentioned in my Windows Freeware Utilities post , it ’s absolutely essential that you have a backup of all hardware drivers on your PC .
It ’d be a nightmare not to have them backed up , because if you ’ve reinstalled Windows , you absolutely need to have a driver backup that has to be restored to keep all your hardware working properly .
DriverMax comes handy here , because it can scour your hard disk for all driver files and save them all together in a folder or as a compressed .zip file for later retrieval .
It can also update your drivers automatically .
Another tool worth trying is DriverScanner from Uniblue .
Although its main purpose is to scan and update outdated drivers , it does give you options to back them up .
It has won several accolades as well .
The catch : You ’ll have to pay to use it .
# 5 . Your Windows OS Settings
Despite the shiny new hardware and the blazing speed of your new PC , it still seems alien to you because you ’re missing the customization that you did your old PC .
The Files and Settings Transfer Wizard is buried under the Accessories > System Tools in your Windows Start Menu can be used to backup and transfer settings like IE Options , Display , Sound Properties and many other settings .
The Wizard can also be used to back up fonts and file type associations .
# 6 . Your Bookmarks
As you frequently scour and research using the internet , you tend to accumulate bookmarks in your browser .
But when you ’re on a cyber cafe you ca n’t get your bookmarks right ?
That ’s when Xmarks ( formerly , Foxmarks ) comes in handy .
It ’s a must have if you frequently work with multiple computers .
All you need to do is install the Foxmarks addon for Firefox / IE / Safari and create an account there .
Your bookmarks are immediately backed up and can be restored later .
It ’s primarily a sync tool so it does let you sync your bookmarks with multiple PCs .
They can even be accessed via your mobile .
Supreme Court Upholds HUGE Punitive Damages Against Tobacco Company !
If you 're a company that makes its living by killing people , you suppressed your own research that proves your product is addictive , while deliberately making it even more addictive , and were so sick and sinister as to target your ads at kids , so you could get them hooked before they were mature enough to make sensible decisions about their lives - well , you may have a problem .
Finally .
According to the Associated Press :
The Supreme Court today threw out a cigarette maker 's appeal of a $ 79.5 million award to a Portland smoker 's widow , ending a 10 - year legal fight to keep her from collecting .
In a one - sentence order , the court left in place a ruling by the Oregon Supreme Court in favor of Mayola Williams of Northeast Portland .
The state court has repeatedly upheld a verdict against Altria Group Inc. 's Philip Morris USA in a fraud trial in 1999 .
The judgment has grown to more than $ 155 million with interest , and Williams stands to collect between $ 60 million and $ 65 million , before taxes and payments to her lawyers , said Robert Peck , her Washington - based lawyer .
The official actual damages were only $ 80,000 , so these huge punitive damages are the real key - particularly from a Court that is generally antipathetic to large amounts of punitive damages .
The plaintiff 's attorney , Robert Peck , makes it clear :
Peck said the court has signaled a willingness to allow large awards in certain circumstances .
" I think we can take from this long tale that if the behavior is sufficiently reprehensible , then larger awards are merited , " Peck said .
Reprehensible .
In the article 's description of the appeals process , we find this :
Next , the Oregon Supreme Court upheld the punitive damages , citing " extraordinarily reprehensible " conduct by Philip Morris officials .
Extraordinarily reprehensible .
Sounds good to me .
And let more lawsuits follow !
No mercy for mass murderers !
" That would go very handy , I would say , with the release of the report , definitely , because it has done great damage to my reputation , not only in Australia , but back in India and throughout the world . "
Dr Haneef said he did not feel enmity towards any person or agency in Australia .
He was grateful to God , his lawyers and Mr Clarke and his team , " who have done very hard work … and have given me a clean sheet " .
He said his main priority now was to continue his medical work and care for his family .
Mr Clarke singled out for the strongest criticism the Brisbane - based representative of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions , Clive Porritt , and Australian Federal Police Commander Ramzi Jabbour , who contributed most to the decision to charge Dr Haneef without sufficient evidence .
The report found that both were dedicated officers but Commander Jabbour had lost his objectivity and was unable to see that the evidence police collected amounted to very little .
Against the advice of his superiors , Mr Porritt wrongly advised the police to charge Dr Haneef , Mr Clarke concluded .
No action will be taken against AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty or other agency heads .
But the AFP will come under the supervision of a parliamentary committee and aspects of its operations will be overseen by the intelligence watchdog , the Inspector - General of Intelligence and Security .
Dr Haneef 's second cousin , Kafeel Ahmed , died in a failed car bomb attack in Glasgow in June 2007 - but Mr Clarke said he could find no evidence that Dr Haneef was involved in that plot , which triggered his arrest , or that he even knew about it .
But Mr Clarke also said he found no evidence of corruption or politicisation of the federal police .
And while he found no evidence that then immigration minister Kevin Andrews was involved in any impropriety or conspiracy , Mr Clarke said his decision to cancel Dr Haneef 's visa was " mystifying " .
In Brisbane , Dr Haneef 's lawyer , Stephen Keim , said the affair was a disaster .
Mr Andrews yesterday declined to apologise .
" The Australian people expected me to act , " Mr Andrews said .
" I had the courage to do so . "
Mr Clarke made 10 recommendations to improve procedures and prevent a repeat of the affair .
The Government accepted them all .
Attorney - General Robert McClelland released simultaneously a range of measures to improve counter - terrorism laws .
They are based on reviews of the laws carried out in 2006 but not acted on .
Mr McClelland said mistakes were made from officer level to the highest level and political leaders and agency heads must accept responsibility .
" But we have full confidence in all agency heads , " he said .
None of those heads will roll .
Asked if the Government owed Dr Haneef an apology , Mr McClelland said it was up to former members of the Howard government to apologise .
But shadow attorney - general George Brandis - who labelled the inquiry a political stunt - said Prime Minister Kevin Rudd should apologise to Mr Andrews .
Maurice Blackburn Lawyers chairman Bernard Murphy said his firm was " very confident " about securing compensation and would approach the Rudd Government about damages to Dr Haneef .
Mr Murphy said Mr Andrews ' claim that the Clarke report had vindicated him was a joke , and that the report proved the AFP 's investigation was an " organisational disaster " .
Prominent lawyer David Galbally , QC , said : " I think he would have very good grounds to sue the Government , because I think what the Government did was unlawful and that 's why it 's not going to publish the full details of the report .
" Allegations were made that he was in communication with terrorists in England and there was no evidence to support it .
There is no question his detention was unlawful and he ought to be compensated . "
Tim Tobin , QC , said proving bad faith on the part of authorities could be difficult , but assessing the damage to Dr Haneef 's good name would be straightforward .
" You 're probably looking at overall damages of $ 500,000 , plus punitive damages of up to a further $ 100,000 , " he said .
The AFP declined to say whether action was being taken against Commander Jabbour .
Loading A spokeswoman for the Commonwealth DPP would not say if Mr Porritt would be disciplined .
The AFP said it would ensure all of the report 's recommendations were implemented .

Different ways of seeing stats
Numbers used to be cold , hard and clinical - a clincher in any argument .
Now look at them : fluffy , soft and left meaningless by woolly - headed thinking , says Michael Blastland in his regular column .
Numbers lack warmth .
Cold as last year 's love , they sit counting their fingers .
Think of numbers and what do you see ?
Dust and ledgers and the yellow fingers of a parched accountant .
No longer .
Numbers have had the mother of makeovers .
No ordinary scrubbing up , shiny PR or new logo , this transformation is complete : they have turned into their opposite .
Once they stood aloof .
Now they gush .
Now you can't shut them up for heart - felt passion .
They cry and cheer and sneer and shout .
Formerly a counterweight to emotion , they are often now nothing but .
The one thing they do n't do is count .
A number in the news is no longer a cold fact , it is a killer fact , with all the murderous zeal that word implies .
Journalists everywhere know the meaning of the phrase , the dagger of detail that runs the opposition through : the 23 % up !
The £ 16 m wasted !
The 140,000 children !
' 5.0 , 50 ... how many fingers am I holding up ? "
For an example , try 271 .
I have it on reliable authority that this is the percentage increase in the money supply in the US in five months .
There , he 's gone cold on me again , you 're thinking .
But stay a moment .
This is the killer fact in a piece by a smart , famous former senior advisor to President Clinton .
The point is obvious .
The economy is in weirdness overdrive , things are out of control , cash is flooding through nook and cranny , but barely a cent is spent .
Feel the peril .
271 % !
This was no typo .
That the writer really believed the magnitude is apparent when he says that 271 % is nearly three times higher .
But mull that number .
Let it count its fingers a while .
This is actually an increase of nearly four times ( £ 100 increased by 271 % is £ 371 .
A 300 % increase is four times bigger , not three ) .
Imagine nearly four times as many dollars in five months .
Four times , seriously ?
What would your salary look like x4 ?
Or GDP ?
The actual number in the US statistics was 27.1 % .
He had moved the decimal point .
This is wrong with bells on , but with no evidence of any reflection on the absurdity .
I have a number therefore I need not think .
A moment for the number to do what numbers are supposed to do , to count and take seriously the counting , must suggest - must n't it ?
- that an increase in the money supply of 271 % in five months might be credible in a basket - case inflationary hell but not in America .
Perilous age ?
My favourite example of this tendency is the heavyweight newspaper report that an increase in retirement age for men from 65 to 67 would mean one in five who formerly lived long enough to claim a pension would now die before they were eligible .
This column aspires to sobriety .
The facts might be shocking , the tone will not .
Today is an exception .
One in five ?
Twenty per cent of men die in the space of two years ?
They'd be turning up their toes all over the golf course , 100,000 of them more than usual .
Being 65 would be more dangerous than the front line in Afghanistan .
This column aspires to sobriety .
The facts might be shocking , the tone will not .
Today is an exception .
Today , I 'll be frank , the column is like its subject - a great Neanderthal grunt .
It will , from time to time , no doubt be wrong too .
But these do n't feel like mistakes , they feel like a reality - check failure , a breathless dash into print without passing the corner shop of normal life , all because the number appears to fit the mood .
So 271 does n't mean 271 , it means " wow ! "
The word " million " ' likewise lost its currency years ago .
" Billions " might go the same way .
As with cliches , so with figures , inflationary use means they buy you less impact .
Debts used to be bad , now they 're toxic , regardless of whether they might make a good return .
A plain old bad debt will never sound as problematic again .
A billion will seldom sound so large .
Numbers become , in other words , the very thing numbers are supposed not to be : fur balls of undigested intellectual gunk .
Writers who use them this way might as well say : " The government admits the figure is , like , you know , cor! oooooh ! "
How big is huge ?
Or here 's an idea .
Why not replace figures with emoticons - a smiley or a frown ?
These numbers do not measure .
They are arrows pointing limply , like vague adjectives , fuzzy conveyors of warmth or fear that beam at you with pride , or scowl with cynicism , expressive of how the writer feels but not of the world he or she claims to feel about .
Is the end nigh , if your colleagues present you with one of these ?
Is this a scandal ?
Not really .
Our treatment of numbers is not like our treatment of the old .
It 's hard , except in rare cases , to be outraged by abused statistics .
And in truth there 's nothing new here .
But we'd do well to remember that numbers often represent people .
To be careless of how we describe them in figures is to be careless of the truth about them , which in turn is not to care .
In a new book about energy , Professor David MacKay sees a problem in another subject many care about : the environment .
He notes a news report about CO2 - reducing LED traffic lights .
The energy savings , the report said , could be " huge " .
Here are adjectives as if they were numbers .
" Huge " being how big , exactly ?
Professor MacKay found that traffic lights account for about 0.03 % of UK energy consumption .
Let 's say the huge savings cut that by a third .
That 's 1/10,000th of the total .
One response is that every little helps .
Mr MacKay replies that every big helps rather more - but it's no good being dim to the distinction .
How do we get away with it ?
In the first case because we have a number - and that beats thinking any time ; in the second because we do n't - and so elide the evidence entirely .
Numbers are often used without a sense of proportion .
Proportion is often invoked without a sense of the numbers .
But is n't proportion what numbers are for ?
Perhaps it 's time to take out some of the heat .
Below is a selection of your comments .
I 've always felt that " billion " should be replaced ( in the US ) with " thousand million . "
More money , more words .
Not that anyone has taken up my suggestion ...
Chris , Kansas City , Missouri USA
As for replacing figures with emoticons - I recently encouraged the amendment of a presentation that had " meaningless " figures ( i.e. meaningless except to technical experts ) to have smiley faces next to good figures , average faces for average , and sad or angry faces for bad and very bad figures .
The original figures were left in for reference and transparency ( well , for anyone who would know what they meant ) , but the interpretation was very useful for those who would not know whether a given figure was good or bad .
My aim was not propaganda ( besides , there was the risk of being patronising ) but rather to just provide a genuinely useful interpretation of technical figures .
Conal , Ireland
As a physicist we get trained from the start that every number must have scale and comparison - something that you rarely see in the media .
Pet favourite of mine is the standard of quoting percentages on values where the population is less than 100 ( ie action X up 50 % year on year - when last year it occurred twice and this year three times ) .
Sam , London
The classic misuse of numbers for sensational effect is in the phrase " children as young as ... " .
It tells you nothing meaningful except they 've managed to find one child of that age .
All the others could be any higher age .
The BBC is as guilty of this as anyone .
Colin McKenzie , London UK
I think that the increasing abuse of numbers by the press over the past 10 years to perpetrate their profitable new form of " shock - and - awe " journalism has been atrocious .
One in five people does this !
80 % of people do n't know that !
No context , no further investigation , and certainly no counter - point to the main story : today 's reporter often seems to just grab a number , jump to a conclusion , and then embark on a page of sensationalisation , in the knowledge that the unthinking masses will buy their paper / magazine / whatever just to find out how bad it really is .
Adam the accountant , Edinburgh Proportion and context , this has been the missing element all throughout this ' downturn ' in the economy .
The press have helped whip up the public into an ill - informed frenzy due to the lack of proportion and context for which they report a lot of these numbers which has scared us into recession .
Mark Johnson , Leeds , England
As an example of numbers that are often used without a sense of proportion , take the substantial budget deficit the UK government will run in the coming year .
The actual numbers in billions of pounds will sound alarming - and they are .
But as a percentage of our national income , the new borrowing will be around 10 % - and in more " normal " recessions such as the early 1990s recession , the proportion reached 6 % of GDP .
And we survived that and even prospered in the years thereafter .
So OK , debt as a proportion of GDP will be higher than for decades ; but dangerously higher ?
That 's a question we can discuss , but it 's better to discuss the relative proportions than merely to talk of the absolute figure .
The other example where proportion is used without a sense of the numbers is in the latest medical research .
" If you eat this food or drink this drink , your chances of falling prey to some terminal illness is increased x % . "
But what were the chances of falling prey to that particular illness ?
Often very low .
To get a sense of the actual risk , ask the researcher what the average life expectancy for the group in question would be if they followed the researcher 's advice , and what it would be if they did n't .
We might find out that the difference would be a matter of months , rather than years - in other words , the increased risk is hardly worth worrying about .

ST . PETERSBURG , Fla . --
There was nothing funny about the circumstances that forced Yankees jack - of - all - trades Nick Swisher to take the mound in a 15 - 5 loss to the Rays .
And there wo n't be anything funny about the tough call facing the Yankees , as they decide whether the bullpen has been taxed enough to warrant a minor - league call - up .
But as Swisher stood on the mound in Monday 's blowout , he could hardly hide his smile .
The act itself -- Swisher trying get big league hitters out -- was pretty amusing .
" At that point in time it 's like , alright , it is kind of funny , " said Swisher , who hit a home run earlier in the game .
" You have to find something positive , something to laugh about maybe after the game . "
In becoming the first Yankee position player to pitch in a game since Wade Boggs threw a ton of knuckleballs against the Angels in 1997 , Swisher brought a little levity on a night in which nearly everything went wrong .
" You get a chuckle out of it just because it 's him , and he's not going to stop talking about it , " Yankees captain Derek Jeter said .
As he pitched , Swisher occasionally dropped down sidearm and shook off signs that were n't even there .
Swisher 's four - seam fastball cracked 80 mph .
Once .
" When am I ever going to get the chance to do that again ? " said Swisher , who last pitched as a high school freshman .
" Probably never . "
Video highlights of Nick Swisher 's relief appearance for the Yankees .
After allowing the first two baserunners to reach , Swisher retired the next three in a row , giving the left - handed Swisher the only scoreless inning out of the Yankees bullpen .
Not only did Swisher homer earlier in the game , but he also recorded a strikeout .
He kept the ball .
But the humor escaped catcher Jorge Posada , who was still irked by the laughing after the loss .
" Nobody was laughing , " Posada said .
" I think it was embarrassing .
It 's one of those days where everything went for them and nothing went for us . "
What 's the point of running a university computer lab when all the students bring laptops anyway ?
That 's a question that schools have been asking themselves as computer ownership rates among incoming freshmen routinely top 90 percent .
Schools like the University of Virginia have concluded that the time has come to dismantle the community computer labs and put that money to more productive uses .
According to the school 's Information Technology & Communication department , 3,117 freshmen enrolled in 2007 , and 3,113 of them owned their own computer .
Nearly all of the machines were laptops , with 72 percent running Windows and 26 percent running Mac OS X ( six hardy souls ran Linux ) .
Compared to a decade ago , the increase in student computing hardware is little short of amazing .
In 1997 , 74 percent of incoming freshmen owned computers , but only 16 percent of these machines were laptops .
The Windows chokehold on operating systems looked complete , appearing on 93.4 percent of all machines and leaving only 6.6 percent for the Mac .
Source : University of Virginia
Given these numbers , the school began to suspect that its labs might not be necessary , even though usage remained high .
When it surveyed the programs actually launched on lab computers in 2008 , it found that 95 of the time students spent in the lab was spent running " free " software like Firefox , Internet Explorer , Adobe Acrobat Reader , or Microsoft Office ( the school has a campus license for Office and students can install free $ 10 copies on their machines ) .
Expensive but niche programs like SPSS — the bane of social science students everywhere — were used only 5 percent of the time .
With labs closing down , the university hopes to save some cash .
School vice president James Hilton told The Chronicle of Higher Education that it cost about $ 300,000 to run the campus computer labs each year , but the amount that the school actually saves will depend on how much it costs to provide alternative access to things like community printers and niche software .
To make specialized software available to students , the school says it will " convene a community to jointly review potential software delivery solutions . "
Its ideas so far all appear to revolve around accessing specialized tools over the network , possibly through " software streaming " or some form of remote connection to dedicated machines .
The change also does n't mean that the university gets to reclaim all that physical space from the labs .
As the university 's explanatory document notes , " ITC understands that students need collaborative space where they can bring their laptops and mobile devices to conduct group work , especially as the curriculum becomes increasingly team - and project - based . "
As for supporting this hugely diverse range of hardware that students will schlep to campus , the mind boggles at the tech support nightmares that will soon plague the dreams of IT workers .
And it . is .
AWESOME !
Enjoy !

March 16 , 2009
CHARLOTTE , N.C. -- Over 100 teachers , teachers ' assistants and their supporters rallied in Marshall Park here March 10 to protest a plan of the Charlotte - Mecklenburg Schools ( CMS ) board to cut hundreds of jobs .
Teachers were outraged at local media reports that , due to a predicted budget shortfall of $ 87 million , Superintendent Peter Gorman wants to cut all teachers with less than five years experience .
This could amount to a third of the system 's 9,000 teachers losing their jobs .
The rally was led by the Charlotte - Mecklenburg Association of Educators ( CMAE ) , the local affiliate of North Carolina Association of Educators and the National Education Association .
The demand was clear : absolutely no layoffs for teachers , teachers ' assistants or assistant principals .
The board should look much harder for administrative cuts , including the jobs duplicated in the seven obscure " Learning Communities " -- new off - site facilities , some of which reportedly cost over $ 7 million a year .
Also , $ 56 million in stimulus bill money has been earmarked for CMS schools -- which President Barack Obama has repeatedly said should be for paying teachers .
This stimulus money is not being factored into the decision to cut jobs .
CMAE President Mary McCray and Vice President Dennis Townsend gave rousing speeches .
Townsend , who has been a CMS high school teacher for 21 years , opened his call to action by saying , " Today , I feel like we should be in Erickson Stadium .
You know why ?
Because I feel like a political football , and Peter Gorman is the quarterback .
We are constantly getting kicked and tossed around .
They are using fear and uncertainty to keep us from standing up for ourselves . "
Townsend was referring to the trend in CMS - - common to many other workplaces -- in which mysterious rumors about job cuts are circulated to paralyze employees and keep them from organizing .
Rally attendees heard from other furious teachers , parents , City Councilor Vilma Leake and school board member Ken Gjertsen , who announced that he would vote against the measure .
The park was filled with signs that read " Save Our Schools , " " No to Cuts " and " Prune the Top . "
After the rally , protesters stood along a thoroughfare in downtown Charlotte , receiving plenty of supporting honks from passersby during rush hour .
Then , more than a hundred protesters marched across the street and into the government building , where the school board was scheduled to vote on the plan during a public session .
As the auditorium grew full to capacity , Gorman and the board discussed the measure behind closed doors .
In the public session , over a dozen impassioned parents and teachers addressed the board .
" I know somebody has to lose their job -- I do n't discount that -- but I say do n't balance the budget on the backs of the classroom , " CMAE President McCray said .
Plenty of creative cost - cutting alternatives were presented to the board , such as voluntary furlough , less investment in superfluous classroom technology , closing the $ 7 million dollar " Learning Communities " and cutting jobs in the administration .
The assembly erupted into applause for each of their speakers .
This display of solidarity , however , did not suit board member Larry Gauvreau , who demanded silence and sneered that if every speaker were applauded , " We 'll be here all night . "
His exhibition of hostility toward the assembly prompted immediate cries of " You 're wasting time right now ! "
" This is our town ! " and " Make eye contact with us when we talk to you ! "
During the session , Superintendent Gorman nonchalantly stated that there had been a miscommunication .
There was a motion to cut jobs , but only about 500 jobs , and the cuts would be based on performance -- not experience .
An e-mail had been sent out just before the session , he said , explaining everything .
Gorman did not address how the Charlotte Observer had received information about more far - reaching job cuts , which it had published on its front page .
When asked about the $ 56 million in stimulus money earmarked for CMS , Gorman said he " did n't want to count on that . "
When the president and Congress gives you $ 56 million for education , with the explicit priority of paying public school teachers , you have no justification to start laying off teachers .
Ultimately , the plan was approved by a 7 - 2 majority .
It was opposed by board members Kaye McGarry and Ken Gjertsen .
" There 's always a choice , " Gjertsen said .
" But we 've decided it 's inevitable . "
Protesters gather in London 's financial district on Wednesday ahead of the G20 summit .
( ( Tom Parry / CBC ) )
A man has been found dead at the G20 protest in England as thousands of protesters rallied ahead of the economic summit in London 's financial district .
The man collapsed on the street near the Bank of England , London 's Metropolitan police said .
Police did not give a possible cause of death .
Officials estimated that at least 4,000 people jammed into the area , with some chanting " Abolish Money " as they marched down the clogged streets .
Meanwhile , climate change activists pitched tents and organized sit-ins in front of buildings and anti-war campaigners held other rallies .
Photos from the protests showed some demonstrators with bloodied faces and police said several officers were injured .
The demonstrators are vying for the attention of leaders of the G20 countries — including Prime Minister Stephen Harper and U.S. President Barack Obama — who are set to meet at one - day summit in London Thursday .
The leaders ' main focus is expected to be the global economic downturn .

British Prime Minister Gordon Brown consulted with Obama ahead of the meeting and urged member countries to act with urgency to come up with a plan to combat the financial crisis .
Other leaders are scheduled to attend a formal dinner on Wednesday night before participating in the Thursday meetings .
Police have closed off all roads leading into the financial district and are n't allowing any more demonstrators to enter or leave the area .
Leave for all city police officers has been cancelled and streets were lined with hundreds of officers .
Most are carrying riot shields while others are on horseback .
A few of the protests turned violent — one band of demonstrators smashed windows of the Royal Bank of Scotland , scrawled the word " thieves " on the outside and stormed into the building .

Ann MacMillan said some people were seen running from the bank carrying computers .
Rescued by the government in October , banks have become a lightning rod for public anger over banker excess blamed for the economic crisis .
Our streets , our banks , say protesters
Protesters hurled paint bombs and bottles , chanting : " These streets , our streets !
These banks , our banks ! "

Some demonstrators have dubbed the summit protests as " Financial Fool 's Day . "
MacMillan described the mood at the rally as " very antagonistic . "
Police officials reported that several officers had been injured during the rally , although they did say the mood had calmed later in the afternoon .
At least 14 people were arrested in connection with the demonstrations .
Some police officers were pelted with eggs and fruit .
" There have been a number of missiles thrown at officers and a number of surges at the police cordons and increasing levels of violence towards police , " a statement from police noted .
Images from the scene showed police waving batons , dispersing clouds of tear gas and pepper spray , with some protesters left with bloodied heads .
Officials said the security operation to contain the protest was one of the biggest in Britain 's history and was aimed at protecting businesses , the Bank of England , the London Stock Exchange and other financial institutions in the city .
John Rees , the organizer of an anti-war protest , told CBC News the demonstration he was involved in was " entirely peaceful , " as were the actions of most protesters .
" The media have been talking up some of the more violent elements in this and the police have been doing the same thing , " he said .
" So I think that 's regrettable , certainly but I do understand why people are very , very angry about these issues .
" There 's a great deal of talk about a few windows going in today but there 's a great deal more violence going on in the system when you think about the hundreds of people — thousands of people now — who have died in Afghanistan . "
Bankers warned ahead of rally
Marina Pepper , a British activist who helped organize the protest , said the clashes with police escalated after the area was cordoned off .
" I think when people get frustrated and they 're not allowed to go about their business … temperatures start to run high , " Pepper said .
Police closed off the financial district as protests mounted on Wednesday .
( ( Tom Parry / CBC ) )
Demonstrators hoisted effigies of the " four horsemen of the apocalypse , " earlier on Wednesday representing war , climate chaos , financial crimes and homelessness .
" Capitalism is n't in crisis — capitalism is the crisis , " Pepper said .
" The profits of a few people making lots of money is seen as more important than the needs of people all around the world . "
Bankers were warned not to wear pinstripe suits on Wednesday and many opted for casual clothes or stayed home .
But some financial workers taunted protesters from the upper level windows of buildings in the area and waved £ 10 notes at them .
" It seems like everything is in a mess , " said protester Steve Johnson , 49 , an unemployed construction worker .
" You get bankers getting massive bonuses , and the MPs are lining their own pockets . "
3:16 Bible Texts Illuminated
The text found in chapter 3 , verse 16 , of most books in the Bible is a typical verse with no special distinction .
But when Knuth examined what leading scholars throughout the centuries have written about those verses , he found that there is a fascinating story to be learned in every case , full of historical and spiritual insights .
This book presents jargon - free introductions to each book of the Bible and in - depth analyses of what people from many different religious persuasions have said about the texts found in chapter 3 , verse 16 , together with 60 original illustrations by many of the world 's leading calligraphers .
The result is a grand tour of the Bible -- from Genesis 3:16 to Revelation 3:16 -- a treat for the mind , the eyes , and the spirit .
French translation by Denis Serre , Bible 3.16 en lumière ( Paris : Bayard Editions , 2017 ) , 416 pages , ISBN 9782227491687 .
Some have called Knuth 's approach ``the way of the cross section . ''

`` This book is ingenious , provocative , and wonderfully informative .
A more imaginative and effective passageway into the Bible I have yet to see .
Jews and Christians of all stripes --- in fact , nonbelievers too --- will read 3:16 with profit and delight . ''
-- William Sloane Coffin , Minister Emeritus , Riverside Church , New York City
`` It is difficult to think that a totally new approach to the Bible could be found --- at least one that is sane .
Donald Knuth has found one , and produced a book that is physically beautiful and intellectually and spiritually stimulating . ''
-- Raymond E. Brown , Professor Emeritus , Union Theological Seminary
``Around fifty - nine 3:16 verses that provide Donald Knuth with a whimsical sampling of the Bible 's fifty - nine books , he has woven an elaborate tapestry of biblical commentary .
Whether you are a Christian or a non-Christian , this commentary , drawing on Knuth 's astonishing knowledge of biblical history and criticism , is sure to enrich your understanding of both testaments . ''

The artwork for this book became the basis of a traveling exhibition of calligraphy , supported in part by the National Endowment for the Arts .
The exhibit was shown at 26 sites in America and Europe during 1990 -- 1995 , ranging from the University of Alberta in Edmonton and the National Cathedral in Washington DC to the Guinness Hop Store in Dublin and the Museo della Stampa in Torino .
It is now permanently housed in the Harrison Collection of Calligraphy at San Francisco Public Library .
After further study , I realized that my published translation of John 3:16 was not the best possible , so I prepared a new translation that reflects more accurately the conventions and style of the original author .
Hermann Zapf presented me with a calligraphic rendition of the new translation for display in my home , on my birthday in 1996 .
I am pleased to share this artwork by making the PostScript file john316.eps.gz ( 75140 bytes ) freely available .
( Also in Acrobat form . )
Laserprinted output cannot compare with the beauty and sparkle of Hermann 's original , of course , but it helps the viewer imagine what the original might be like .
Note to book binders : I have a nearly complete set of unbound signatures of this book ( unfortunately lacking pages 125 - - 140 ) , for somebody who wants to make a handbound copy .

O.J. Simpson ’s off the list , but singer Dionne Warwick , actor Burt Reynolds , actor - comedian Sinbad and a prominent Los Angeles developer still make this year ’s roll of California taxpayers with the largest delinquent income tax bills .
This year ’s ranking includes 250 names .
A few are famous or local notables , but most are low - profile individuals and businesses .
Together they owe $ 143 million in back taxes , said Franchise Tax Board spokesman John Barrett .
State Controller John Chiang , who also is chairman of the Franchise Tax Board , said the annual list , intended to pressure those with large bills to pay up , represents only a fraction of the $ 6.5 billion in personal income taxes that go unpaid each year .
Simpson was on last year ’s list , with a bill of $ 1.5 million .
The onetime football great and actor was taken off this year ’s list after being sentenced to at least nine years -- and possibly up to 33 years -- in prison in Nevada for his role in robbing a pair of memorabilia dealers .

Barrett declined to comment on details of individual tax cases , and Simpson ’s attorney could not be reached .
In addition to paying the taxes , names can be removed for several reasons , including filing bankruptcy and arranging installment payments .
Names also can be removed when officials deem the debt uncollectable .
The 2009 list includes Warwick , who owes $ 2.18 million , and Reynolds , who owes $ 225,000 .
Both of the obligations date to the 1990s , according to the board .
Warwick ’s publicist , Kevin Sasaki , said in an e-mail that the singer has cooperated with the tax board and that a payment arrangement is “ already in motion . ”

A representative for Reynolds could not be reached for comment .
Sinbad , listed as Sinbad Adkins , of Oak Park , Ill. , owes $ 2.5 million on a tax lien first filed in 2001 .
His publicist said he had no comment .
Also continuing on the list is Christopher Hammond , a developer and political fundraiser who successfully built low - income housing in Los Angeles .
But Hammond ran into financial and legal problems on a large , city - subsidized shopping center project near Baldwin Hills .

Two years ago , when the list showed him owing $ 231,000 , Hammond told The Times that he had made $ 90,000 in payments and arranged to be taken off the list .
Now he owes $ 504,000 , according to the state .
Hammond could not be reached for comment .

The plot of this movie , like smoke , drifts and swirls ethereally .
Characters and subplots are deftly woven into a tapestry of stories and pictures which only slowly emerges to our view .
This movie tries to convince us that reality does n't matter so much as aesthetic satisfaction .
In Auggie Wren 's ( Harvey Keitel's ) New York City smoke shop , day by day passes , seemingly unchanging until he teaches us to notice the little details of life .
Paul Benjamin ( William Hurt ) , a disheartened and broken writer , has a brush with death that is pivotal and sets up an unlikely series of events that afford him a novel glimpse into the life on the street which he saw , but did not truly perceive , every day .
Finally , it 's Auggie 's turn to spin a tale .

Solar power system
The idea of harnessing solar power from space has been around for a while ; Asimov included it in at least two of his stories that I remember - but may finally be a reality come 2016 .
California ’s biggest energy utility announced a deal Monday to purchase 200 megawatts of electricity from a startup company , Solaren , that plans to beam the power down to Earth from outer space , beginning in 2016 .
Solaren would generate the power using solar panels in Earth orbit and convert it to radio - frequency transmissions that would be beamed down to a receiving station in Fresno , PG&E said .
From there , the energy would be converted into electricity and fed into PG&E ’s power grid .
There ’s no risk to PG&E because they ’re not investing anything into the company , just agreeing to buy power at a certain rate if the space power does come through by 2016 .

HONG KONG  President Ma Ying - jeou of Taiwan announced Wednesday that Chinese officials had dropped their objections to Taiwan ’s participation as an observer at a United Nations body , a step forward in Taiwan ’s effort to win greater international recognition .
China strongly hinted that it was prepared to let Taiwan participate in the World Health Assembly , the decision - making body of the World Health Organization .
But Beijing stopped short of explicitly saying that it had accepted a Taiwanese presence at a gathering of the assembly next month .
Mao Qunan , the spokesman for China ’s Health Ministry , said in a statement that the World Health Organization had invited Taiwan to participate next month , adding that “ the current arrangement reflects our overall concern and good will toward Taiwan compatriots , and this promotes the cross - strait relationship and the peaceful development of relations . ”
The World Health Organization , preoccupied with the global spread of a new strain of influenza , had no immediate comment on Wednesday .
Taiwan made its participation more palatable to the mainland by agreeing to use the name “ Chinese Taipei ” instead of its legal name , the Republic of China , or the name by which it is best known , Taiwan .
Over the weekend , some bloggers who discovered a chip inside the iPod Shuffle 's earbuds speculated that Apple was crippling its latest media player to work only with certain headphones .
While to an extent it 's true — that the Shuffle only fully works with particular headphones — you actually can use any headphones in a pinch .
First things first , let 's make something clear :
The iPod Shuffle 's hardware does not contain a physical button , apart from the switch ( shown above ) that turns the Shuffle off or on .
Apple instead installed a three - button controller on the wire leading to the included earbuds ; you squeeze this controller to adjust the volume and to skip forward or back through your playlist .
You can use any standard headphones to listen to music on the Shuffle , provided you 've got a 1/8 " plug .
Gadget Lab's Danny Dumas tested the iPod Shuffle with a half - dozen brands of headphones in the newsroom , including both iPhone - compatible ( four - lead ) and standard ( three - lead ) .
Here 's what we 've discovered :
You can listen to music with any pair of headphones .
Just plug them in and turn on the Shuffle .
To control the volume or skip forward and backward in the playlist , you need Shuffle - compatible headphones — the kind with the volume and skip controls embedded in the wire .
That 's it .
There 's no digital rights - management or copy protection involved .
Apple 's new earbuds contain a chip that enables them to work with the iPod Shuffle 's controller mechanism .
Third - party manufacturers must communicate with Apple if they want to integrate that chip in their headphones .
Manufacturers must also pay a licensing fee if they wish to display an Apple logo or a message on the packaging stating their headphone controllers work with the Shuffle .
But that is n't so unusual .
If you look at other iPods , you 'll realize they feature the same dock connector for charging and utilizing accessories .
Accessory manufacturers pay a licensing fee to state on their packaging that their gadgets work with iPods .
Some chose not to pay that fee , causing confusion in the market , so Apple started " Made for iPod " and " Made for iPhone " programs to label which products were Apple - certified .
In theory , manufacturers will likely be able to reverse - engineer the Shuffle 's controller chip , opt not to pay a licensing fee and cross their fingers that Apple wo n't take legal action .
Apple told BoingBoing Gadgets that the chip does not contain encryption or authentication capabilities , a statement that has been backed up by iPod accessory maker V - Moda .
Long story short , Apple simply made a chip that works for its product , and third - party manufacturers must communicate with the company to put that chip in their headphones , too .

This is " Much ado about nothing , " as tech analyst Michael Gartenberg told Wired.com on the phone .

Nadler on torture investigations : ' There ca n't be a compromise '
One of the leading voices in Congress for investigating former Bush Administration officials said the impeachment of Judge Jay Bybee would n't quiet the calls for prosecution .
John Podesta 's letter to John Conyers today calling for impeachment marked the shift of a close White House ally away from calls not to look backward and toward taking action , though action short of an investigation by a commission or by a special prosecutor ; some have speculated that it was a compromise effort to satisfy some Democrats ' calls for justice without bogging down the White House agenda .
" That 's nice , but I do n't think one thing has anything to do with the other , " said New York Rep. Jerry Nadler , who has pushed both for Bybee 's impeachment and for a Justice Department investigation , in response to Podesta 's letter .
He dismissed the notion that " Bybee 's impeachment should take care of everything . "
" It 's not a question of a sacrificial lamb , " said Nadler , who sits on the House Judiciary Committee , to whose chairman Podesta addressed his letter , and chairs its Constitution subcommittee .
" I think in the due course of events he probbaly ought to be impeached , " Nadler said , citing a forthcoming report from Justice 's Office of Professional Responsibility .
Nadler also dismissed the notion that the Obama Administration -- which at first seemed determined to move rapidly beyond alleged Bush Administration crimes -- could have controlled the torture story .
" I do n't think it is controllable .
I do n't think it was ever controllable .
The law is what the law is , " he said .
" You 've got to follow where the facts lead .
They may very well wind up with Dick Cheney .
They may wind up with Rumsfeld . "
" There can't be a compromise -- you have to follow the law , " he said .
" If the facts say that some former high - ranking official should be prosecuted , the fact people will get angry should be irrelevant . "
" If we do not investigate the torture that is clear that it occured , and if the evidence is there prosecute , not only are we disobeying the law , not only are we being immoral , but we are inviting torture of our people in the future , " he said .
" I 've heard all the discussion -- ' Could this hurt the administration ?
Could this hurt the Democrats ? '
All that is secondary . "
New York State is largely repealing the infamous drug laws that served as ground zero for a prison - sentencing craze that swept North America and is now discredited .
Governor David Paterson announced a deal with state legislators yesterday to remove many of the " mandatory minimum " sentences imposed for low - level drug crimes by the 1970s - era legislation , known as the Rockefeller drug laws .
After 35 years of stuffing prisons with minor drug felons , state legislators have judged the law 's mandatory sentencing provisions as expensive and ineffective .
It 's part of a reassessment of " tough on crime and sentencing " laws taking place across the United States , which has the highest incarceration rate in the developed world .
Canada , ironically , is bucking that trend .
" Canadian policy - makers have picked up the cudgel of minimum mandatory sentences at the same time as Americans are trying to extricate themselves from them because they have proven to be so destructive , " says Craig Jones , director of the John Howard Society , which reintegrates inmates in the community .
Canada 's Conservative government last year increased the minimum prison time judges must impose for gun crimes .
Last month , it reintroduced a bill that imposed minimum sentences for a long list of drug crimes .
It includes a six - month sentence for someone caught growing even one marijuana plant for trafficking .
The toughest minimum sentence under the proposed drug law is three years for anyone creating a public safety hazard in a residential area by producing Schedule 1 drugs – such as cocaine , heroine or methamphetamine .
In another move being sold as " tough on crime , " Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan touted yesterday in Toronto his government 's plans to stop judges from calculating a " two - for - one " sentencing credit for time that prisoners spend in pre-trial custody .
Experts are almost unanimous in denouncing the mandatory prison sentences as a recipe for swelling an already crowded prison system without reducing crime .
" The question is , ' How do we get the biggest bang for our buck ? ' " Anthony Doob , a University of Toronto criminologist said yesterday .
" I would have thought these days the thing to do is use scarce resources effectively . "
University of Ottawa criminologist Irvin Waller said the money would be better spent on outreach programs that target youth at risk , helping them to stay in school or training them for jobs .
Justice Minister Rob Nicholson 's office did not respond to a request for an interview .
In a statement last month , Nicholson described the drug laws as a " measured response " that would jail those who sell or produce drugs , but allow a suspended or reduced sentence for addicts who accept treatment .
In the U.S. , the Rockefeller drug laws spawned minimum mandatory sentences for all kinds of crimes .
They resulted in a quadrupling of the inmate population between 1973 and the early 1990s across the country .
Yet studies indicate that the incarceration explosion – 2.2 million inmates in 2007 and $ 49 billion ( U.S. ) in prison costs – has done little to reduce crime .
The recession is forcing a growing number of states to rein in prison budgets .
Some , like Kansas and Colorado , are closing prisons .
Michigan , which spends more on incarceration than higher education , has eased its mandatory - minimum sentencing laws .
New Jersey is replacing jail time with community programs .
Others are making it easier to get parole .

The proposed changes to New York 's drug laws , named for former governor Nelson Rockefeller , will hasten the national move away from decades of high - incarceration policies , said Marc Mauer , executive director of the Washington - based Sentencing Project .
" The experience with mandatory minimums is that it sweeps up a whole lower level of offenders and just a relative handful of higher ones .
It 's overkill , " Mauer said .
" Unless we address the demand for drugs , we 're just recycling people through the prisons . "
President Obama 's push to correct the abuses of the credit - card industry will have one inevitable effect :
Fewer people will carry plastic .
This wo n't hit the wealthy or most of the people who pay their credit - card bill in full each month .
It will affect poor people – and those at risk of falling into poverty – who use the cards as an easy way to borrow .
Credit slashing
The trend is already under way .
If credit - card companies are n't slashing the credit limits of their customers , they 're closing their accounts or charging big fees .
( Click here to see how even the financial crisis is pushing up rates . )
But with losses still rising and Congress on the verge of capping fees and delaying interest rate hikes , those companies are n't keen to take on big new risks .
And if companies can't charge highly indebted people ridiculously high fees to make up for those risks , then business logic would suggests the companies are n't likely to keep them on as customers .
The result ?
The intriguing question is :
Is that bad or good ?
For decades , the argument against regulating high credit - card fees was that it would force poor people to use even more expensive forms of credit , such as payday loans .
But that reasoning is oversimplified , at best , according to a study [ pdf ] this year by Angela Littwin , a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin .
When she interviewed poor people , she found that some two - thirds of them said credit cards “ tempted ” them to spend more .
Plus , when faced with the prospect of having no credit card , they offered several alternatives , including the ability to set their own credit limits so they would n't overspend .
Bill of rights
That is precisely one of the provisions of the " Credit Cardholders ’ Bill of Rights " legislation now before the US House .
The bill also prevents companies from forcing cardholders to pay off their low - cost debt before their high - cost debt – a point of great frustration for some of our readers like Andy ( click here for his comment ) .
The House bill would apportion payments to the debt instead .
( See a summary of the bill here . )
Perhaps the bill would narrow the yawning gap in the current business model where high - income people get no - fee reward cards with low interest rates while indebted low - income folks are stuck with high - fee , high - interest cards that can make life even more difficult .
" We think it 's been out of balance , " President Obama said Thursday of the industry , after meeting with credit - card company executives .
" We think we need to create a new equilibrium . "
That equilibrium , however , could also mean higher fees and interest rates for middle - and high - income cardholders .
Most job listings ask for a certain number of years of experience .
Either in a particular technology or in the industry .
This presumes that the developer learned each year .
I read a quote about whether the candidate has five years of experience or the same year of experience five times .
I do n’t remember where this came from , but I think it clearly expressed an important point – that we ca n’t just measure years .
Upon re-reading the “ Software Craftsmanship “ , I came across the concept / phrase “ perpetual novice . ”
This is exactly the idea .
If one never picks up best practices and software development habits , all that time could be spent repeating inefficient ways of doing things .
I ’ve seen this upon interviewing as well .
Some people with “ X years experience coding Java ” look like they can’t code their way out of a paper bag .
I ’m thinking this is related to the “ perpetual novice ” concept .
These people figure out everything from scratch and repeatedly solve problems the industry has surpassed .
What ’s dangerous is that such developers do n’t consider themselves novices anymore .
Someone new to the field or right out of college realizes they are a novice .
They ask questions and realize there is much to learn .
“ Perpetual novices ” think they know quite a bit and are less likely to ask a more experienced person .
And worse is when the real novices learn from perpetual novices – the opportunity to learn better ways is lost and the cycle continues !
Have you encountered any perpetual novices in your career ?
What do you think makes them stand out ?

March 19 , 2009 -- Malaysiakini -- Poor PSM ( Parti Sosialis Malaysia , Malaysian Socialist Party ) !
Obstacles after obstacles the Parti Socialis Malaysia has had to face before it could be officially recognised as a political party .
The latest hitch is expected to make its recognition more elusive -- the authorities are now saying that the party ’s logo , a white - coloured clenched fist against a red backdrop , has “ connotations of violence ” and is “ morally unsuitable ” .
This issue of a ``violent logo '' has never been brought up in the PSM 's decade - long tussle for registraion with Registrar of Societies ( ROS ) .
Prior to this , the PSM was also denied registration from 1998 to 2008 as it was regarded as a threat to ``national security ' ' .
On March 19 , PSM leaders submitted a memorandum to Election Commission ( EC ) chairperson Abdul Aziz bin Mohd Yusof to appeal for registration .
According to the memorandum , the party was finally approved by the Home Ministry on August 19 , 2008 , and registered by the ROS in accordance with the Societies Act 1966 .
On September 18 , 2008 , PSM leaders submitted copies of their registration certificate , party constitution , organisation chart and coloured party logo as required by the EC in order to register as a political party .
When the party did not receive a response from the EC , the documents were re-sent .
On January 3 , 2009 , the party was informed that its registration was still being processed by the Home Ministry .
On February 13 , the EC announced that the registration has been rejected because its logo is " morally unsuitable " and " has connotations of violence " .
The commission also stated that it has the discretion to approve or reject the registration of political parties according to the Election Act 1958 .
EC ’s role questioned
The PSM has since questioned the commission ’s decision , noting that “ the Home Ministry and ROS should be the main authorities in determining the legitimacy of political parties ” .
“ The role of the EC is purely administrative and it should not interfere with decisions that have been approved by the Home Ministry and ROS .
Secondly , the reason given for PSM ’s 10 - year denial to registration by the Home Ministry was that the party posed a threat to national security .
“ In the case of PSM versus the Home Ministry , the Court of Appeal had since held that the party did not pose any security threats to the country .
“ However , the party logo was never brought up by the prosecution throughout the duration of its litigation .
“ Thirdly , the party has never received any complaints from the public with regards to its ‘ violent imagery ’ . "
The memorandum also stated that if a fist could be interpreted as a symbol of aggression , so could a keris or a rocket .
In addition , it stated that the fist was a popular symbol used by socialists and socialist organisations all over the world .
According to Wikipedia , " The raised fist may represent union , as ‘ many weak fingers can come together to create a strong fist ’ , and is also used to express solidarity , generally with oppressed peoples .
This symbolism may have sprung from usage by trade unions . "
In addition , the PSM stated that because of the non-registration of the party , its members have not been able to contest in the up - coming elections .
The party viewed this situation as a form of status discrimination that infringed upon the democratic rights of the party as enshrined in the federal constitution .
Lastly , the memorandum noted , " If truly , the symbol of PSM is perceived to be immoral and violent , then the people of Malaysia will reject it through their votes .
``However , that decision should be made by the voters and not the Election Commission . "
The PSM , led by Selangor state assemblyperson Dr Nasir Hashim ( left ) , was founded in 1998 and is the only socialist party in Malaysia .
The party also has a member in the national parliament in Dr D. Jeyakumar , who represents Sungai Siput .
The two seats were won on PKR tickets in last year ’s general election .
What is in a symbol ?
PSM heads to another long battle !
March 24 , 2009 -- PSM --
It appears as if the Malaysian government made a mistake by giving the PSM a license in August last year and after realising this mistake , it went on to use the “ independent ” Election Commission ( EC ) to deny the PSM the use its symbol for the election .
The decision by the EC to refer the PSM logo issue back to the Registrar of Societies ( ROS ) , which had earlier given approval to the symbol tantamount to rejecting the PSM 's right to stand for election .
The Parti Sosialis Malaysia ( PSM ) will go into history as the party which took the most number of years to get registered as well as being the most scrutinised .
The PSM 's struggle has taken many fronts from letter writing to street demonstrations , from negotiations to court battles , and now back to the battleground .
Dr Nasir Hashim .
The PSM started to use the fist symbol in 1998 when the party first applied for registration .
We have been using it openly since the first election we stood in under the Democratic Action Party ( DAP ) banner in 1999 , as well as in all our publications , car stickers , flags and T - shirts .
The PSM chose the logo after looking at several symbols .
The fist used currently is also used by many socialists all over the world .
The party symbol has been very popular and has since been used by many groups as a symbol of struggle and people 's power .
“ Just let us move on . ”
This was the angry tone which Dr Nasir Hashim told deputy secretary Datuk Noordin Bin Che Ngah when submitting a memorandum to the ROS on March 19 , 2009 .
It is now six months since the PSM applied to be registered by the EC .
One may think that since the PSM got its party registration , then it would be now smooth sailing .
On September 18 , 2008 , PSM had submitted copies of its registration certificate , party constitution , organisation chart and party logo as required by the EC in order to register as a political party for the election .
When the party did not receive any response from the EC , the documents were re-sent .
It was during this period that we got some dismal reason from one of the EC officials , who said that the reason cannot be revealed because it is deemed an official secret .
A letter from the EC replying to our follow - up letter created more questions than answers .
The EC letter said that the EC was awaiting approval from the ROS .
This prompted the PSM to send a legal letter .
The PSM ’s lawyer Comrade Ragu Kesavan send a letter questioning the EC ’s reasoning .
Only then did the EC , in its letter on February 13 , say that the EC had rejected the PSM logo because it is “ morally unsuitable ” and “ has connotations of violence ” .
The commission also stated that it has the discretion to approve or reject the registration of political parties according to the Election Act 1958 .
The EC 's reasons for rejection of the PSM ’s logo has created much amusement in the blogs .
Many made the comparison with the “ keris ” ( dagger ) and the fist .
The PSM in its memorandum also raised the issue of the keris as well as of the rocket .
In today ’s world , rockets are seen as offensive weapons used by the terrorists .
Besides the above blatant discrimination , there are other serious issues to be considered .
The Home Ministry ( HM ) and the ROS are the main authorities in determining the legitimacy of political parties and they have approved the PSM registration , including the PSM symbol .
Hence it is very unfair for the EC to refer this back to the ROS .
Besides that , in the ten years the Home Ministry had fought against giving the PSM its registration , it had never used the logo as a reason .
Today it seems there is yet another reason to deny the PSM ’s political future .
Finally , PSM has always stated that the fate of the PSM must be determined by the Malaysian people and not the EC .
If the PSM logo is perceived to be ``immoral '' and ``violent '' , then the people of Malaysia will reject it through their votes .
However , that decision should be made by the voters and not the Election Commission .
Malaysian socialists warn of return to Mahathir - style repression
By Peter Boyle
March 28 , 2009 --
“ As present deputy PM Najib Razak plans to takeover the prime ministership on April 2 , there seems to be a pattern of growing repression ” , warned Socialist Party of Malaysia ( PSM ) secretary general S. Arutchelvan .
“ The dark ages of [ former PM ]
Mahathir are returning with incidents such as the one - year suspension from parliament of opposition MP Gobind Singh Deo , the three - month ban of two popular opposition newspapers , recent police attacks on opposition public assemblies , the referring of sodomy charges against opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim to the High Court [ and ] the setting up of a new ‘ anti- corruption agency ’ to investigate opposition leaders . ”
Another example , S. Arutchelvan warned , was the rejection of the PSM ’s party symbol — a red clenched fist .
On March 23 , riot police used a water cannon and tear gas to attack a 5000 - strong public meeting of opposition People ’s Justice Party ( PKR ) supporters in Sungei Patani .
PSM deputy chairperson M. Saraswathy told Green Left Weekly that the increasingly unpopular National Front ( BN ) government were “ resorting to more dirty , more lawless and more devious means to hold onto power at any cost ” .
“ The March 2008 political tsunami that swept the PR [ the People ’s Front opposition coalition ] into power in five states was the result of an unprecedented level of disenchantment with the BN ’s 50 - year rule .
“ The neoliberal policies of the government made the lives of the majority miserable .
All the welfare state projects were rolled back one by one , resulting in rising prices of basic services while real wages dropped .
“ Now the current economic crisis is pushing people into greater hardship and further angering them ” , Saraswathy told GLW .
“ People have little faith that the federal government ’s hefty stimulus packages will benefit them . ”
In February , the BN regained controlled of one of five state governments won by opposition parties in the 2008 elections through dirty tactics .
“ The PR had a narrow three - seat majority in the state assembly but the BN wrested away three seats from the PR by using back door tactics ” , Saraswathy explained .
`` They bought over two PKR state assembly members who were facing corruption charges , and went on to pay a hefty sum of money to a [ Democratic Action Party ] state assemblywoman who was the deputy speaker .
The BN used the Perak monarchy to aid and abet in their unlawful power grab .
The Perak Sultan , who has large vested financial interests , removed the opposition government . ”
Saraswathy said that the PSM continued to “ put forward socialist arguments , analysis , perspectives and proposals , making our one MP stand apart from the rest ” .
These include “ a retrenchment fund , land for farming , food stamps , freezing of housing loan repayments ” , he said .
“ A number of these demands were carried to the public in a nation - wide bicycle campaign that made history .
The PSM ’s cyclists , who faced police harassment as they made their way around the country , finally entered parliament and handed over a memorandum .
“ This has never happened before , and was only made possible because of our MP .
It succeeded in highlighting the demands of the campaign to a large number of people . ''
“ We believe change comes through people ’s power ” , Saraswathy said .
“ We still have a long way to go in the struggle .
But our election victories have had a great impact on the party ’s development .
Having a vocal state assembly member in Selangor and a federal parliamentarian have been very good propaganda platforms for the party and enabled us to demonstrate to people what socialists stand for .
“ Party policies and actions in PSM constituencies , such as yearly asset declarations , formation of People ’s Consultative Councils at the constituency level , and the practice of a different culture of politics — all this has had great appeal and has contributed to the likelihood of PSM becoming a third force on the Malaysian political scene . ”

After two years and reports of roughly $ 100 million spent , Conde Nast has shuttered Portfolio , its upscale business glossy .
As the magazine folds , executives will cite the sinking ad market , which of course is partly to blame .
But Portfolio , which had the financial backing from Si Newhouse to hire just about anyone in business journalism , never really caught on , or had a strong sense of urgency -- that 's despite having the advantage of being a business magazine amidst financial collapse .
( The Dov Charney cover is just one example of questionable leadership atop the masthead ) .
As I reported for the NY Observer , staffers doubted Joanne Lipman 's stewardship of the magazine both before and after the April 2007 launch .
The magazine launch was largely panned among media watchers , and rumors swirled about Lipman 's job throughout Portfolio 's short existence .
While flush with cash , Portfolio tapped Matt Cooper as the magazine 's Washington editor a few years back , but never maintained a large presence in the capitol .
( Cooper still has a gig with TPM , although in a reduced capacity ) .
Investigative reporter Doug Frantz was laid off in November as the magazine tried scaling back , and later headed to Kerry 's Foreign Relations Committee .
Cooper 's response on Twitter : " Well , it was fun while it lasted . "

Just recently the police in Hungary conducted raids on various torrent and warez sites , but few will have sympathy for those arrested .
The site operators charged users for access via premium SMS , many of them unsuspecting kids .
The police seized an impressive amount of equipment and also took some impressive photographs .
In 2007 the US planned to put a federal prosecutor in Budapest , Hungary , to “ assist in the coordination of the enforcement of intellectual property laws ” .
Almost immediately action was taken against some BitTorrent and warez sites operating in the country .
In 2008 it was recommended in an International Intellectual Property Alliance report that Hungary should remain on a piracy ‘ watch list ’ for that year .
The reasons were wide and varied , but included were problems related to widespread ‘ pay to leech ’ torrent sites , and pay for access warez sites .
“ It is difficult to energize police and customs officials to investigate Internet cases because Hungarian court decisions are not a deterrent , ” said the report .
The authorities , undeterred by the lack of a court deterrent , have been involved in various raids and site closures ever since , and this year is no different .
In mid April , Hungarian police carried out raids on four BitTorrent trackers including Bitlove , BitMusic and Indep – and shut them down .
In the same operation they closed down warez sites and a significant source of spam .
The police arrested up to ten individuals , eventually detaining six for further questioning .
The reason that police were able to move so forcefully against these sites is because they were operated on a purely commercial basis .
Unlike most regular torrent sites or warez blogs , users paid for access via premium SMS .
The operators were pretty unpopular in the ‘ regular ’ BitTorrent community too , having had conflict with other sites .
Over 40 servers were confiscated in the end , filled with 250 TB of data .
Here are the police photos from the raid , and remember folks ; paying for warez is like paying for oxygen , it ’s unnecessary and it gives decent pirates a bad name ;)

I am frankly disappointed with C++0 x futures .
They lack a major feature –composability .
It ’s like having Booleans without OR or AND .
But let me first explain what futures are and how they ’re implemented in C++0 x .
What is a future ?
In a nutshell , a future is an asynchronous function call .
You call a function , but do n’t wait until it completes –the body of the function executes in a separate thread .
Instead you get a future , a promise to deliver the result at some later point in time .
Only when your program desperately needs that value , do you synchronize on the future .
If the calculation has n’t been completed by then , you block until it has .
Otherwise you get the result of the calculation .
C++0 x futures
C++ splits the implementation of futures into a set of small blocks–it almost creates an assembly language of futures .
Here are the primitives .
- promise
A promise is a vehicle for passing the return value ( or an exception ) from the thread executing a function to the thread that cashes in on the function future .
The function ( or a callable object ) that is executed in a separate thread must have access to the promise , and it explicitly sets the return value .
You can think of a promise as a primitive channel ; the function in this case is the sender .
The equivalent of the “ send ” method is called promise : : set_value ( to pass an exception to the caller , the callee can call promise : : set_exception .
There is no corresponding “ receive ” method –the receiving is abstracted into the future object .
Here ’s some code that illustrates the use of promise .
Notice how the function to be called asynchronously must be aware of the promise .
void asyncFun( promise < int > intPromise ) { int result ; try { // calculate the result intPromise.set_value ( result ) ; } catch ( MyException e ) { intPromise.set_exception(std::copy_exception(e ) ) ; } }
The calling thread creates the promise and passes it to the worker thread executing asyncFun ( I ’ll show the details later ) .
- future
A future is the synchronization object constructed around the receiving end of the promise channel .
The calling thread obtains a future using promise : : get_future .
The most important method of the future is get .
If the result is not ready , get will block .
When get completes , it either returns a value or throws an exception .
The return value or the exception has been set by the called function through the promise associated with the future ( see above ) .
get can also be split into its more basic parts : wait , optionally followed by has_value ( or has_exception ) and the call to get , which is guaranteed not to block .
The advantage of the latter approach is that one can use versions of wait , wait_for and wait_until , that set timeouts .
There is also an asynchronous method , is_ready , that can be used for polling rather than blocking .
There are two separate implementations of future : regular future ( which used to be called unique_future in Draft Standard ) that works like a unique_ptr as far as passing values goes , and shared_future that works more like shared_ptr .
For instance , the method get of future cannot be called twice because it transfers the ownership of the result .
Here ’s an example how a future could be used in the caller ’s code :
promise <int > intPromise ; future < int > intFuture = intPromise.get_future ( ) ; std:: thread t( asyncFun , std::move(intPromise ) ) ; // do some other stuff int result = intFuture.
get ( ) ; // may throw MyException
- packaged_task
In most cases the use of promises can be hidden from the programmer .
There is a template class , packaged_task that takes any function ( or callable object ) and instruments it for use with futures .
In essence , it creates a promise and calls the function from inside a try / catch block .
If the function returns , packaged_task puts the value in the promise , otherwise it sets the exception .
A packaged_task is a callable object ( has the function call operator ( ) defined ) can be passed directly to a thread .
Here ’s a more complete example :
vector < int > primesUpTo( int n ) ; int main ( ) { packaged_task < vector < int >( int ) > task ( &primesUpTo ) ; future < vector < int >> fut = task.get_future ( ) ; thread t( move ( task ) , 100 ) ; t.detach ( ) ; // do some other work while the primes are computing vector < int > primes = fut.get ( ) ; // print primes return 0 ; }
Composability
So far so good .
The creation of futures might be a bit verbose in C++ , but it can be easily adapted to concrete environments .
The futures standard library should be treated as a set of primitive building blocks from which to build higher abstractions .
Notice how C++ separated the channel ( promise ) from the synchronization mechanism ( future ) ; and thread creation from communication and synchronization .
You may , for instance , use futures with thread pools or create threads on the spot .
What was omitted from the standard , however , was the ability to compose futures .
Suppose you start several threads to perform calculations or retrieve data in parallel .
You want to communicate with those threads using futures .
And here ’s the problem : you may block on any individual future but not on all of them .
While you are blocked on one , other futures might become ready .
Instead of spending your precious time servicing those other futures , you might be blocked on the most time - consuming one .
The only option to process futures in order of completion is by polling ( calling is_ready on consecutive futures in a loop ) and burning the processor .
The need for composability of synchronization events has been widely recognized .
Windows has WaitForMultipleObjects , Unix has select , and several higher order languages have explicit constructs that serve the same purpose .
But that ’s a topic for my next installment .
Acknowledgments
I ’d like to thank Anthony Williams for helpful comments .
Among other things , he is the author of one of the futures proposals for Boost .
A stripped down version of it will become part of the threadpool library .
Unfortunately , the stripping got rid of composability features .
Anyone who knows me knows that I , in private , consider myself a bit of a " foodie . "
I 've gone to a few conventions , written a few pieces for magazines , travelled the country , and above all , enjoyed myself every single time .
This trip was different , though .
I had never been specifically invited to go somewhere for a single dish , much less even specifically invited to a single restaurant !
A friend of mine , who I 've known through the SA Forums for well on 4 or 5 years now , invited me to mainland China to try something half - controversial , half - impractical , half - insane , and entirely delicious .
He wanted me to try his restaurant 's off - the - menu special :
An entire poached Chihuahua .
Before you fire up that email client , let me assure you of a few things :
1 ) I am aware that in Western culture , the thought of eating such a friendly animal is unheard of .
I have chosen to omit the photographs I had taken for this reason .
Society 's perception of certain animals is not the same all around the world , and I would appreciate it if we could all keep an open mind .
2 ) Chihuahuas are among the least intelligent breeds of dog and can be thought of as having a rodent - like , or at best , an ostrich - like intelligence level .
3 ) The animal was treated humanely throughout its life , and dispatched painlessly and quickly .
The head chef explained to us the procedure , which involved tying a plastic bag over its head and slapping it gently on the rump , which caused it to blissfully run around the room to the point of exhaustion and collapse .
Its tail was wagging until it lost consciousness .
That said , I arrived one Thursday evening at my friend 's small alleyway restaurant , where we met in person for the first time ( which is always surreal ) and , after a few drinks , we ordered the delicacy .
It took about 45 - 60 minutes to reach our table , but when it did , it stole the show .
Imagine , an enormous decorative porcelain tray that was probably older than everyone in the room combined .
It had its share of dings and chips , and you could tell just by the esteem surrounding it that it was only used for special occasions .
Any remaining trepidation melted away instantly , and the sweet meat smell filling the room went from being this uncertain , slightly scary odor to supper .
The head chef himself removed the lid , and I was shocked by what I saw .
A perfectly poached Chihuahua , lying on its side , resting in a delicate reddish sauce , with a perfectly browned , crispy , seared skin .
My friend explained that it had been poached in red wine using a method that can be best described as a modified coq au vin .
I described it as " coq au delicious " which was met with some unusually raucous laughter .
I have n't quite grasped the Chinese sense of humor at this point , I suppose .
The skin that had not browned turned a translucent shade of tan , something ilke a game hen or chicken , with surprisingly little meat on the torso .
It quickly became clear that we would be eating primarily from the legs , rump , head , and neck areas , and possibly into the torso for some organ meats .
Before I realized that , though , I was being stared at by everyone around me .
Hindsight 20 - 20 , I now understand that they were probably waiting for my OK to put it down at the table , waiting for an indication of my satisfaction with how the dish was prepared .
I mistook it as everyone waiting on me to begin carving the animal ( a little of that country Thanksgiving upbringing showing , I guess ) so I grabbed the largest knife at the table and sloppily made a cut into the abdomen of the animal , releasing a bit of built - up gaseous pressure that smelled faintly of slim jims and car exhaust .
We all laughed , and pressure of another kind -- a kind of cultural one , was relieved as well .
The family explained that they believed a well - treated animal will taste better than one abused or neglected .
This particular animal had been raised for over three years by the chef himself and his family , who massaged it thrice weekly with a mixture of soy sauce and chicken broth , and fed it only rice and grass .
Digging in , I found the meat itself was just the slightest tad gamey but very natural .
It does n't taste at all like the processed , corn - fed meats we 're accustomed to back home .
It tastes ... well , real .
You could tell that in your mouth was an animal , not a previously - frozen burger patty , and not a chicken breast you got with a coupon at the store .
Here we had real food cooked by real people backed by real tradition .
The somewhat stringy meat of the thighs we were eating got caught in our teeth , and one of the waitresses showed us a trick .
Its claws , weakened by the slow cooking process , snap off , and can be used as toothpicks in a pinch .
I still have a few in my wallet .
Reusable , natural toothpicks .
Ca n't get much greener than that !
Moving on , one of the guys motioned toward the open cut on the abdomen from earlier .
I explored a bit with the knife and found a gland that appeared to be about the size of a baseball and very veiny .
This was the stomach , and , for my enjoyment , they fed the beast a mixture of breadcrumbs and spices about an hour prior to its cleaning .
Inside I found what amounted to a pleasant wad ( for lack of a better word ) of stuffing not terribly unlike something we'd have on the holidays .
At the encouragement of the others at the table , I popped the entire thing into my mouth and chewed for about a minute before it separated and was swallowable .
There was a starchiness and a light acidity that I found pleasant , but overall it was a bit too gingery for my taste .

A Colorado company that approved a make - believe clinical trial run by doctors who did not exist got a dose of reality on Tuesday .
Under pressure from the Food and Drug Administration , the company agreed to temporarily suspend approving federally regulated medical studies or enrolling new patients in ones currently under way .
The agreement by the company , Coast Independent Review Board of Colorado Springs , could have an impact on its future operations .
It may also affect some of 300 active studies involving human patients that Coast currently oversees on behalf of makers of drugs or medical devices .
Coast said last month that it planned to overhaul its procedures , a theme it emphasized in a statement released Tuesday .
“ Coast I.R.B. is changing everything , said the company ’s chief executive Dan Dueber .
“ We are revamping every aspect of the company . ”

Me : The Asian guy you would never dream of giving a second glance .
Hi !
I ’m so sad that you were offended by my very presence at your favorite boutique coffee shop .
Seriously , I was just there to do some work and maybe a bit of reading – I did n’t mean to draw attention to the fact that you too , are also Asian .
I was just looking for a quiet place to sit , and the seat by you just happened to be open .
It ’s not like peed all over you , put my arm around your shoulder , and screamed to all the other patrons in a heavy Chinese accent , “ She mine !
You all stay away ! ” After I sat down and pulled out Said ’s Orientalism ( no joke ) , you , in all of your ignorant glory , proceeded to loudly flirt with the nearest non-Asian man with a pulse to dissuade any romantic overtures from me .
Lady , I already know you only date white guys ; you do n’t even have to open your mouth .
Ever since Chad took you out back in high school and made you the envy of all homecoming , you ’ve understood the magical power of white boys .
Your parents balked until they saw how well Chet treated you and made you so so so happy .
You tell yourself you do n’t see color lines , and that you ’re ending racism by only dating white guys – and you give yourself a little pat on the back every night before dreaming of waking up with beautiful blonde hair .
You ’ve even thrown in a black guy or two , just to get back at daddy .
Asian guys ?
Like , gag me with a spoon !
Hey , I applaud you .
You ’re totally progressive .
Never mind all that bukakke stuff Jeremy keeps wanting to do ( I wonder where he gets these ideas ? ) .
No need to worry about Scotty ’s browser history pointing to asianteensluts.com .
Totally normal !
What red - blooded American man does n’t want to bang a Japanese high school girl ?
Honestly , if I were in your stilettos , I ’d do the same thing .
If white girls were all over me ‘ cause of my nice , smooth skin , my mad computer skills and wispy peach fuzz , I ’d ride that white stallion to all glory .
But since I ’m 6 ’ 2 ” , 200 lbs. with 4 % body fat and a PhD , I guess I ’ll have to settle for one of our more racist Asian sistahs .
Let ’s see , a U.S. court successfully convicted the son of the brutal former president of Liberia , Charles Taylor , of torturing his father ’s political opponents .
But we ’re going to leave it to a Spanish judge to go after our own Torquemadas ?
A Spanish court has targeted former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales as well former Justice Department lawyers John Yoo and Jay Bybee — who is now a federal appellate judge — along with three other administration lawyers , in an investigation into the torture of five Spanish residents who were prisoners at Guantanamo .
But this is our job , not Spain’s .
This is our unfinished business .
The Bush administration ’s Torture Nation should not be shielded by President Obama ’s desire to move forward .
Our current president , who used as an applause line during his European tour how we ’ve now " prohibited — without exception or equivocation — any use of torture , " has some mopping up to do .
It takes no more convincing than reading the sickening descriptions of what we did to the 14 so - called high - value detainees in the leaked report of the International Committee of the Red Cross .
But it should be remembered that we inflicted these brutalities — beatings , exposure to frigid temperatures , being shackled with arms overhead or shoehorned into tiny boxes , being denied sleep and kept naked — on hundreds of others , many of whom were never a threat and have since been released .
That is , if they were n’t among the 108 detainees who died in our hands , a figure offered last year by Lawrence Wilkerson , former chief of staff to Colin Powell .
A full accounting of what we did and upon whose orders is essential for a number of reasons .
First , by refusing to keep the Bush era ’s dirty little secrets , Obama fulfills his commitment to transparency in government .
Second , doing so will vet the claims of former Vice President Dick Cheney , who continues to say that abusive interrogations were effective , when others equally knowledgeable say they were counterproductive .
And third , it is a moral imperative , necessary for us to regain our posture as an international standard bearer .
As Sen. Patrick Leahy said in proposing a nonpartisan truth commission ( an idea that went nowhere ) , " We can not turn the page until we have read the page . "
One place for the Obama administration to start is in the release of three memos authorizing harsh interrogation techniques issued by the Office of Legal Counsel inside the Bush Justice Department in 2005 .
A federal court has just granted the administration an extension to April 16 — the fourth one — to either make the memos public or give a valid reason for their continued secrecy .
There is no good cause to hold back these documents , since at this point the CIA ’s handiwork is well known .
But the pending release is causing a storm of protest from those with reasons to keep them quiet .
Newsweek and Harper ‘s Scott Horton are reporting that Attorney General Eric Holder wants to disclose the memos but there is intense pushback from intelligence officials and Republicans in Congress .
Horton writes in his blog
The Daily Beast that Republican senators are essentially threatening to shut down the business of the Senate if the torture memos are made public .
The memos are apparently ugly things in the extreme and will demonstrate the duplicity of the Bush administration .
The Bush Justice Department had made a big showing of repudiating a 2002 memo written by Bybee and Yoo that approved painful interrogation techniques as consistent with American law .
But in 2005 , under the sycophant Gonzales , secret memos again unleashed the CIA .
The legal opinions gave cover to agency operatives to use their harshest physical and psychological tactics on prisoners in combination .
This shame will not be assuaged until it is confronted .
Let those with dirty hands within the intelligence community and Republican apologists in Congress fulminate all they want .
President Obama needs to ignore the noise .
The American people have a right to know what was done in our name and under whose authority .
Spain should not be doing our work for us .

The myth - tormented imagination of the poet Yeats soared over the western horizon to a dream world of blissful islands , the Islands of the Blest , the Country of the Young .
For Darwin and his heirs , the Galapagos islands , 600 miles over the western horizon from South America , are the Islands of the Blest .
It 's controversial whether Darwin 's visit to that remarkable archipelago really was the seminal experience of his life , but it should have been .
If you were to set aside a few million years to design the ideal natural experiment to give the game away about evolution and spark the idea in the mind of a travelling naturalist , Galapagos is exactly what you would dream up .
Imagination could not outperform this reality .
The key to the Galapagos islands is that they are young .
All are volcanic , and none has ever been in contact with the mainland , so every endemic animal and plant has evolved there in extremely recent times .
On the evolutionary timescale , Galapagos is the Country of the Young .
Even the oldest of the islands ( Espanola near the eastern end of the archipelago ) is only just over three million years old , while the youngest ( Fernandina , in the west ) is probably less than half a million .
It is no accident that the islands get younger as you move from south - east to north - west .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The ( also very young ) theory of plate tectonics makes all clear .
The Nazca plate is moving , with a somewhat jerky and erratic course , in a south - easterly direction towards South America , where it is slowly being subducted under the continental shelf .
As it moves , it passes over a volcanic " hot spot " , which periodically punches through to raise a new volcano : in some cases a new island .
Some of the islands have but a single large volcano .
Isabela , the largest island , is a chain of five .
Old islands are those that have been carried furthest away from the hot spot .
Young ones , such as Fernandina and Isabela , are closest to the hot spot today : indeed , Fernandina is right above it .
On the oldest island , Espanola , the single volcano is the last survivor of a previously larger island .
There were even older islands that have now sunk out of sight altogether , as the plate inches its way under South America .
The Nazca plate , with its volcanic hot spot underneath , serves as a conveyor belt for the manufacture and subsequent destruction of islands .
We know that every single animal and plant in the archipelago arrived recently – by geological standards , not by human standards , of course .
You cannot say the same of Madagascar or New Zealand , which are fragments of the ancient continent of Gondwana .
The faunas and floras of these primeval islands are a complicated mixture of Gondwanan originals together with the descendants of immigrants , which have had many tens of millions of years to go their separate evolutionary ways .
Galapagos evolutions are not all as young as might be suggested by the approximately three million years of the oldest extant islands .
This is because their evolutionary radiation could have begun on the now - sunk older islands .
But the maximum time available for the unique Galapagos fauna to have evolved is still very short .
Continents and older islands like Madagascar have become palimpsests of history , the clarity of the story ravaged and distorted by time and repeated invasions of immigrants .
But in Galapagos , we are privileged to see evolution in its burgeoning youth .
A young archipelago like Galapagos is a natural laboratory of evolution , a bustling workshop for the manufacture of new species , again as if on a conveyor belt .
Speciation is the name we give to the divergence of one ancestral species into two : Darwin's " origin of species " .
For speciation to occur , there must be some initial separation – otherwise sexual cross - breeding will continually mix the gene pool of the original species with that of the budding new species , and prevent them from diverging .
Sometimes the barrier is imposed from without , as when an earthquake , say , changes the course of a river so that it bisects the range of a previously united species .
At other times the barrier is already there , wide enough to be difficult to cross but not totally impossible .
This means that crossings occur just often enough to initiate speciation , but not so often as to allow enough sexual mixing ( " gene flow " ) to stop the species diverging .
Archipelagos are speciation factories , and Galapagos is the pick of the bunch .
Speciation requires an optimal spacing of islands , not too far and not too close .
The actual magnitude of the optimal distance will depend on the mobility of the animals concerned .
To a wide - ranging bird like a tropicbird , the whole archipelago might as well be a single continent .
To a Galapagos finch , the 600 - mile distance to the mainland constitutes a major barrier , which was bridged perhaps only once .
The distances between individual islands – of the order of tens of miles rather than hundreds – are just small enough to allow occasional island - hops , but too large to allow gene swamping .
These are ideal conditions for speciation .
Galapagos might have been designed for the origin of species .
Darwin , in The Voyage of the Beagle , enunciated the principle in a dawning of recognition : " Seeing this gradation and diversity of structure in one small , intimately related group of birds , one might really fancy that from an original paucity of birds in this archipelago , one species had been taken and modified for different ends . "
Darwin was here speaking of the finches that now bear his name , but he was first alerted to the principle by the Floreana mockingbird .
He had already noticed , on San Cristobal , that the local mockingbirds resembled those on the mainland but were nevertheless different .
The next island the Beagle visited was Floreana , and that was where Darwin 's penny dropped .
The Floreana mockingbird was different again .
And then other islands turned out to have their own species of mockingbird .
The same is true of the giant tortoises , of the lava lizards , and of many of the plant species .
But the Floreana mockingbird was Darwin 's epiphany .
It is of great significance in the history of ideas , and it is at present one of the most endangered species in the world .
The extinction of any species is a tragedy .
The plight of the Floreana mockingbird – inspiration of Darwin 's youth – moved the actress and artist Lalla Ward to accede to the Gerald Durrell Foundation 's suggestion that she should prepare a special exhibition on the theme of , and in aid of , Galapagos wildlife .
Lalla Ward 's exhibition is at the Chris Beetles Gallery , 8 - 10 Ryder Street , London SW1 , 10.30 am - 5.30 pm , 21 - 28 March ( except Sunday ) .
Pictures are for sale in aid of the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust 's campaign for the Floreana mockingbird and other wildlife of Galapagos .

In this Wednesday , April 1 , 2009 photo , a prototype satellite phone is shown at the TerreStar booth at the International CTIA Wireless show in Las Vegas .
SkyTerra and TerreStar say their new satellites , combined with advances in chip technology , can take satellite telephony from being a niche to the mainstream _ something you 'd buy in an AT&T store .

( AP ) --
The vast , thinly populated expanses of the country that still lack cell phone coverage could be getting an interesting option next year : ordinary - looking cell phones that connect to a satellite when there 's no cell tower around .
In June , a rocket is scheduled to lift the largest commercial satellite yet into space .
In orbit 22,000 miles above the Earth , the satellite will unfurl an umbrella of gold mesh 60 feet across and aim it at the U.S.
That gigantic antenna will let the satellite pick up signals from phones that are not much larger than regular cell phones .
That satellite , from TerreStar Corp. , is due to be followed by two similar , even larger ones from SkyTerra Communications Inc. next year .
SkyTerra puts the cost of its satellites at $ 1.2 billion .
On the face of it , these are bold moves , especially considering that the satellite phone business has been troubled .
Most famously , two companies with grand projects for worldwide satellite phone coverage , Iridium and Globalstar , filed for bankruptcy at the beginning of the decade , wiping out billions in investor capital .
But the background to the new launches is more complicated , and analysts say the business models of TerreStar and SkyTerra ultimately might rely more on the companies becoming acquisition targets for conventional wireless carriers .
There 's plenty of competition in satellite phones , even though it 's a niche market .
Iridium and Globalstar are still in operation , providing last - resort communications for the military , forest wardens and others who can afford to buy dedicated , bulky satellite handsets for $ 1,000 and up .
Inmarsat offers a third alternative .
Even so , SkyTerra and TerreStar say their new satellites , combined with advances in chip technology , can take " satphones " into the mainstream - devices you 'd buy in an AT&T store .
The ability to call via satellite will be marketed as " an insurance policy or peace - of - mind feature , " said SkyTerra spokesman Tom Surface .
The first handsets for TerreStar 's satellite would cost about $ 700 , said TerreStar chief executive Jeff Epstein .
At a cell phone trade show here last week , the company displayed a prototype built by small Finnish company , Elektrobit .
The phone has a QWERTY keyboard and runs Windows Mobile software , making it similar to many BlackBerry - style , e-mail - oriented phones for corporate use , but a bit thicker .
Unlike Iridium and Globalstar phones , there 's no protruding antenna .
" This way , you take your BlackBerry and you replace it with that device , " Epstein said .
Both companies indicate that calling over a satellite will cost less than $ 1 per minute , the approximate price of Iridium calls .
TerreStar also has a roaming agreement with AT&T Inc. for calls that do n't go through the satellite , and expects the combined satellite and ground system to be working before the end of this year .
However , neither TerreStar or SkyTerra will replicate Iridium 's worldwide coverage .
The phones will work in North America only .
Nor will they be getting away from a significant limitation of satellite phones :
The handsets need to be in clear view of a satellite .
In other words , the satellite service will work only outdoors , and a hill , tree or building obscuring the southern sky can be a problem , especially if you 're far north .
Given these limitations , and the steady expansion of ground - based networks , is there really a mass demand for satellite phones ?
Satellite analyst and consultant Tim Farrar at TMF Associates is skeptical .
He believes the number of people interested in satellite calling , even if just for emergencies , is small compared to the overall cell phone market .
" They need hundreds of thousands and more likely millions of users of these handsets to make it into the mainstream , " he said .
" You have to gain an awful lot of momentum before manufacturers will consider it worthwhile to build this into their handsets . "
Farrar thinks marketing will be a challenge too .
For mainstream adoption , sales representatives at cell phone stores would have to get customers to accept that the satellite connectivity would work only outdoors .
" Last time around , people tried out Iridium phones , and thought ` What use is this to me if I have to go out and stand in the middle of a field to make a call ? ' " he said .
Given these obstacles , Farrar believes the value of SkyTerra and TerreStar is in their spectrum holdings .
The companies have permission from the Federal Communications Commission to use slices of the airwaves for both satellite and ground - based networks , as long as they have a satellite in orbit .
The government hoped that such hybrid space - terrestrial licenses would encourage companies to provide emergency satellite coverage when cell towers are knocked out by disasters like Hurricane Katrina .
For now SkyTerra and TerreStar are n't using their spectrum for ground - based communications .
Eventually , the companies could try to put the airwaves to use with their own cell towers on the ground - or they could use that spectrum to entice a carrier like AT&T or Verizon Wireless .
Those companies would normally have to pay billions for spectrum with nationwide coverage , but they might find that snapping up one of these satellite companies is a cheaper way to get that access , said Armand Musey , a satellite consultant .
Investors are n't optimistic : Terrestar , which is listed on the Nasdaq , has a market capitalization of $ 72 million , which is paltry compared to the cost of its satellite system .
SkyTerra is privately held .
" There certainly is not a market for having all of these companies - TerreStar , SkyTerra , Inmarsat , Iridium - all operating satellite - only , " Musey said .
" The market is just not that big . "

Donations ?
Awareness ?
Determine your goals and remember to keep them handy as you progress .
This goes hand in hand with # 3 .
Get specific about the return on investment you are expecting .
If you want donations , what 's the amount ?
If you are looking for new supporters , how many ?
There are multiple social media tools out there .
It 's important to determine which ones work for you .
Signing up for everything is n't going to be the best use of your time .
Developing a strategy for your social media activity is extremely important .
You need to determine what content you want to create and where you want to put it .
What 's your method for analysis ?
It 's important to track what you do on social media tools so you can examine whether you are achieving the ROI that you want .
Who 's writing the content for your social media sites ?
Is it the same person who 's posting them ?
Are there more than one person contributing ?
Hashing this out ahead of time will make the process flow much smoother .

There are so many frustrating elements about this New York Times article on dating violence and teenage girls that one is not even sure where to begin .
But let 's give it a whirl , shall we ?
The wrongness begins with the title , " Teenage Girls Stand By Their Man , " which , in itself , sets the tone for the entire article , which seems to paint " teenage girls " as immature , uneducated , and clueless when it comes to dealing with potential violence inflicted upon them by their " men . "
The " men , " by the way , are barely spoken of at all , as if they have no place in this story , as if they are not a piece of this increasingly difficult puzzle .
The piece , by Jan Hoffman , centers around the reaction many young women are having toward the Rihanna / Chris Brown incident , wherein many high school girls are blaming Rihanna for her actions and defending Brown , something we 've discussed before .
Oh , and it 's published in the " Fashion and Style " section of the Times , because nothing says " Fashion and Style " like violence against women , right ?

Teenagers Claim
It 's " Rihanna 's Fault " A reader tipped us to this Chicago Tribune article , wherein teenage girls claim that not only are …
Read more
" On blogs and social networking sites , teenagers are having an e-shouting match about this highly publicized episode - perhaps the first time their generation has been compelled to think aloud about dating violence , Hoffman writes , " And what may be surprising is the level of support for Mr. Brown .
While thousands of teenagers have certainly turned on Mr. Brown , many others - regardless of race or gender - defend him , often at Rihanna 's expense . "
Advertisement
While this is a true and horrifying phenomenon , the notion that girls are perpetuating this cycle by being so quick to forgive is a bit unfair .
Marcyliena Morgan , director of Harvard 's hip - hop archive , claims that she 's not surprised that boys are quick to forgive Chris Brown , " But it 's the girls !
Where have we gone wrong here ? "
Perhaps " we 've gone wrong " by being so apathetic towards the reaction of young men here .
If it 's not surprising that boys are quick to forgive Brown , does n't that signal a problem ?
Why is it only the girls who are expected to be outraged , horrified , and willing to take a stand against dating violence ?

As Melissa McEwan of Shakesville writes , " Where have we gone wrong with girls ?
The same place we 've gone wrong with boys :
Not providing them alternative narratives , that 's where .
It does n't do girls any fucking good if we just throw up our hands and say , " Well , of course boys excuse rape and violence against women , " and take that as read , so we can move on and wonder what 's wrong with the girls .
Talk about victim - blaming . "
Jill at Feministe , however , points out that the article makes a good point about the way young girls tend to be blaming Rihanna as a means to continue their harmless crushes on Brown , who , prior to this incident , had a squeaky clean public image as the type of boyfriend who would never , ever hurt you .
" The victim - blaming in high - profile intimate partner violence cases reads to me a lot like self - defensive victim - blaming in sexual assault cases :
If you can pin the responsibility for the violence on something the woman did , you can live without the fear that someone might harm you in a similar way . "
As Hoffman writes , " After all , sweet Chris Breezy - his nickname - even appeared in a music video with Elmo of " Sesame Street . "
Acknowledging his attack would make them feel vulnerable :
How could they have a crush on someone who could do that ?
It was less terrifying to blame Rihanna . "

Perhaps the fault lies in the fact that attempting to open girls ' eyes to the true horrors of dating violence without expecting the same participation from boys is simply going to lead to a one - sided viewpoint that many young women will have a difficult time sticking to , especially when the society that surrounds them seems to agree that boys , as always , will be boys .
It 's a bit difficult to stand up for one 's self when the system in place argues that girls should be appalled by violence , and boys should be forgiven for it .

The new knife design is less likely to inflict a serious wound , the council says
A new design of kitchen knife could " significantly reduce " deaths and injuries from stabbings , Staffordshire County Council has said .
The knife , commissioned by county trading standards , was unveiled with a report on reducing knife crime .
The knife is fully functional in the kitchen but requires nine times more force to be used in order to inflict a serious wound , the council said .
The council is to present its recommendations to the Home Office .
Many knife crimes are committed using ordinary kitchen knives , the council said .
Student killed
Councillor Carol Dean , cabinet member for safer and stronger communities , said : " We can certainly make it more difficult for people to inflict serious injuries and commit knife crime through the introduction of a safer knife and our other recommendations . "
The new knife was designed by the Cutlery and Allied Trades Research Association ( Catra ) .
The council 's report calls for more work with manufacturers and retailers to introduce other " safety knives " to replace the traditional long - pointed ones , to help save lives nationally .
Recommendations in Getting to the Point , Preventing Knife Crime , also call for more training for retailers of knives and for their online sale to be banned .
The new design was backed by the campaign group , Mothers Against Knives .
Some friends and family of Luke Campbell , a 20 - year - old student stabbed to death in Boscombe , Bournemouth , were also at the launch .

I can't put my finger on why .
My guess is there 's something foreign about CC covers , and all those look like Eastern European releases or something .

Preface
Laughter : An Essay on the Meaning of Comic

Authorised Translation by Cloudesley Brereton L. es L. ( Paris ) , M.A. ( Cantab ) and Fred Rothwell b.a. ( London )
What does laughter mean ?
What is the basal element in the laughable ?
What common ground can we find between the grimace of a merry - andrew , a play upon words , an equivocal situation in a burlesque and a scene of high comedy ?
What method of distillation will yield us invariably the same essence from which so many different products borrow either their obtrusive odour or their delicate perfume ?
The greatest of thinkers , from Aristotle downwards , have tackled this little problem , which has a knack of baffling every effort , of slipping away and escaping only to bob up again , a pert challenge flung at philosophic speculation .
Our excuse for attacking the problem in our turn must lie in the fact that we shall not aim at imprisoning the comic spirit within a definition .
We regard it , above all , as a living thing .
However trivial it may be , we shall treat it with the respect due to life .
We shall confine ourselves to watching it grow and expand .
Passing by imperceptible gradations from one form to another , it will be seen to achieve the strangest metamorphoses .
We shall disdain nothing we have seen .
Maybe we may gain from this prolonged contact , for the matter of that , something more flexible than an abstract definition , -- a practical , intimate acquaintance , such as springs from a long companionship .
And maybe we may also find that , unintentionally , we have made an acquaintance that is useful .
For the comic spirit has a logic of its own , even in its wildest eccentricities .
It has a method in its madness .
It dreams , I admit , but it conjures up , in its dreams , visions that are at once accepted and understood by the whole of a social group .
Can it then fail to throw light for us on the way that human imagination works , and more particularly social , collective , and popular imagination ?
Begotten of real life and akin to art , should it not also have something of its own to tell us about art and life ?
At the outset we shall put forward three observations which we look upon as fundamental .
They have less bearing on the actually comic than on the field within which it must be sought .

As I ’m writing this ( 13:40 UT ) a newly - discovered asteroid , 2009 DD45 , is flying past Earth at only 74,800 km ( 46,478.5 miles or 0.000482 AU ) away .
That ’s only about twice the height of a typical geostationary communications satellite , and well inside the moon ’s orbit .
According to Spaceweather.com , the 30 - to 40 - meter wide space rock is similar in size to the Tunguska impactor of 1908 , but this time there is no danger of a collision .
At closest approach on March 2nd , ( which just occurred ) 2009 DD45 will speed through the constellation Virgo shining as brightly as an 11th magnitude star .
So if you ’re in the Pacific region like Hawaii or Tahiti , go out and take a look !
But this rock is moving fairly fast , and by tonight , it will only be 13th magnitude , and fading fast .
UPDATE : Below see video of 2009 DD45 as seen from Australia :
( thanks to Aaron Slack for the heads up on the video )
The asteroid was only discovered three days ago by the prolific asteroid hunter Robert McNaught at Siding Spring Observatory in Australia , when the space rock was already within 2,414,016 km ( 1½ million miles ) of Earth and closing fast .
If you want to try and track it , here ’s the ephemeris information from the Minor Planet Center .
The MPC also has an interesting list of the closest approaches to Earth by other minor planets .

Pentagon officials have inspected several military bases in the United States that could potentially replace the detention center at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba , if President - elect Barack Obama fulfills his pledge to close the camp there .
The sites visited included Fort Leavenworth , Kan. , and Camp Pendleton , Calif. , military sources said .
The visits were part of a formal review of military bases and prisons initiated several weeks ago in response to public statements by Mr. Obama .
The study , which military officials described as preliminary , has already drawn criticism from Republican legislators who oppose the closing of the Guantánamo Bay center and fear that the relocation of terrorism suspects to their districts could attract terrorist violence .
“ The department is examining any number of options and what it would take to implement such a decision if it were made , ” said Cynthia Smith , a spokeswoman for Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates .
Mr. Gates has also said the Guantánamo center should be closed .
A Pentagon official with knowledge of the review , speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter , said the military was also considering federal prisons but would not say whether any Bureau of Prisons facilities had been physically inspected .
The Justice Department was not involved in any such review of prisons , a spokesman , Dean Boyd , said , but he noted that agency officials were having discussions with the Obama transition team about national security matters , including the future of the Guantánamo center .
Liberal Senator Romeo Dallaire has taken his battle for the repatriation of Canada 's sole Guantanamo detainee , Omar Khadr , south of the border , hoping U.S. president - elect Barack Obama will offer to release the young man .
The retired general 's lobbying efforts came on the same day that Obama advisers say the incoming president is prepared to issue an order to close the U.S. detention facility in Cuba .
Omar Khadr is shown here at 15 , not long before he was captured by U.S. forces in July 2002 .
( ( Canadian Press ) )
Dallaire is in Washington with a group of human rights activists hoping to put Khadr 's case at the top of the incoming president 's agenda .
" The reason I 'm down here is because I 've gotten nowhere with the Canadian government , " said Dallaire .
" If the Canadians do n't want to ask for him as other countries have done , then maybe the solution is that the Americans offer him to the Canadians . "
Khadr has been held at the U.S. navy base at Cuba 's Guantanamo Bay since shortly after his arrest in 2002 at age 15 on suspicion of killing a U.S. medic .
His military trial is set to begin Jan. 26 , six days after Obama 's inauguration , but activists are hoping to avoid the controversial process and see the 22 - year - old returned home .
Dallaire said Obama should put a stay of proceedings on the trials of Guantanamo detainees , then begin talks with the Canadian government to work out a process to return the Toronto - born Khadr home for rehabilitation and re-integration .
Early shutdown of Cuban facility ' a challenge ' : Obama
The retired general said he 's hopeful the new U.S. administration might demonstrate some flexibility on the issue .
" If we take Omar Khadr back , we take one of [ Obama 's ] problems away .
I mean , we alleviate the situation for him where he does n't have to look at a case of a Canadian child soldier being prosecuted in a process that is considered to be inappropriate , " said Dallaire .
Obama has called for the closure of the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay and voiced opposition to the law signed by President George W. Bush that allows the military commission to try those accused of war crimes .
In an interview with ABC aired Sunday , Obama said that shutting down the facility within his first 100 days in office would be " more difficult than I think a lot of people realize . "
But on Monday , the Associated Press quoted unnamed advisers as saying Obama plans to order the closing of the military prison as one of his first acts after taking office , possibly on his first day .
Obama has repeatedly said he plans to close the prison and deal with the 250 detainees constitutionally .
Harper 's lack of action ' unstatesmanlike '
At a news conference , Dallaire said he has received no help from the Canadian government in his attempts to aid Khadr , and suggested Prime Minister Stephen Harper 's lack of action in the case was " unstatesmanlike . "
Harper has remained firm in his position not to intervene in Khadr 's case , saying a judicial process is underway .
At a news conference in Surrey , B.C. , he cautioned that one should n't conclude that closure of Guantanamo will change things for Khadr .
" I do n't think you can necessarily leap to the conclusion that that will affect people who have in fact been charged and are facing legal process , " he said .
" We do n't know the answer to the question .
We 'll be working with the incoming [ Obama ] administration to figure out what their policies will be in those particular cases . "
The Toronto Star reported on Monday that documents obtained through access to information requests show a rift between the prime minister 's public stance on the Khadr case and that of federal lawyers .
The newspaper said the documents showed that the lawyers repeatedly raised concerns about Khadr 's prosecution in the U.S. because he was only 15 years old when captured .
Dallaire noted that Canada has ratified the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child , an international law saying children under 18 years old involved in armed conflict should be rehabilitated rather than prosecuted .
The retired general said Canada should adhere to the convention , and he's now looking at ways Canada 's laws could be amended to require politicians to do so .
" Bringing Khadr back will be an exercise in learning how to handle such a situation of a child being used as a soldier in a conflict and what we should do , " said Dallaire .
" I think we gain by learning how to handle this case because it may not be the last [ such ] case in Canadian law , " said Dallaire .
Khadr was taken into custody after an hours - long firefight in Afghanistan near the Pakistan border for allegedly lobbing the grenade that killed American army medic Sgt. Christopher Speer during the battle .
He is the only Western citizen still imprisoned at the detention facility at Guantanamo , which was set up following the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
Computer engineers at Washington University in St. Louis are bringing the minimalist approach to medical care and computing by coupling USB - based ultrasound probe technology with a smartphone , enabling a compact , mobile computational platform and a medical imaging device that fits in the palm of a hand .
William D. Richard , Ph.D. , WUSTL associate professor of computer science and engineering , and David Zar , research associate in computer science and engineering , have made commercial USB ultrasound probes compatible with Microsoft Windows mobile - based smartphones , thanks to a $ 100,000 grant Microsoft awarded the two in 2008 .
In order to make commercial USB ultrasound probes work with smartphones , the researchers had to optimize every aspect of probe design and operation , from power consumption and data transfer rate to image formation algorithms .
As a result , it is now possible to build smartphone - compatible USB ultrasound probes for imaging the kidney , liver , bladder and eyes , endocavity probes for prostate and uterine screenings and biopsies , and vascular probes for imaging veins and arteries for starting IVs and central lines .
Both medicine and global computer use will never be the same .
" You can carry around a probe and cell phone and image on the fly now , " said Richard .
" Imagine having these smartphones in ambulances and emergency rooms .
On a larger scale , this kind of cell phone is a complete computer that runs Windows .
It could become the essential computer of the Developing World , where trained medical personnel are scarce , but most of the population , as much as 90 percent , have access to a cell phone tower . "
" Twenty - first century medicine is defined by medical imaging , " said Zar .
" Yet 70 percent of the world 's population has no access to medical imaging .
It 's hard to take an MRI or CT scanner to a rural community without power . "
Shrinking the electronics over 25 years
Zar said the vision of the new system is to train people in remote areas of the developing world on the basics of gathering data with the phones and sending it to a centralized unit many miles , or half a world away where specialists can analyze the image and make a diagnosis .
Zar wrote the phone software and firmware for the probes ; Richard came up with the low - power probe electronics design .
He began working on ultrasound system designs 25 years ago , and in that span he has shrunk the electronics from cabinet - sized to a tiny circuit board one inch by three inches .
A typical , portable ultrasound device may cost as much as $ 30,000 .
Some of these USB - based probes sell for less than $ 2,000 with the goal of a price tag as low as $ 500 .

Another promising application is for caregivers of patients with Duchene 's Muscular Dystrophy .
A degenerative disease that often strikes young boys and robs them of their lives by their late 20s , DMD is a degenerative disease for which there is no cure .
The leading treatment to slow its progression is a daily dose of steroids .
Patients often experience some side effects from steroids , which are dose related .
These side effects include behavioral problems and weight gain .
Researchers now know that physical changes in muscle tissue can indicate the efficacy of the steroids .
Measuring these changes in muscle can be accomplished with ultrasound and may allow researchers to optimize steroid dosing to maximize efficacy while minimizing side effects .
" The idea is that caregivers , who otherwise have to transport a young person , often wheelchair bound , to a hospital or clinic on a regular basis for examination , can be trained to do ultrasound to track muscle condition , " Zar said .
" This could lower the dosage to the least effective amount to further increase quality of life of the patient and the caregiver and hopefully extend life .
We 're really excited about this application .
The caregiver would only have to do a one - minute scan , transfer the data captured to the clinic , and the results would come back to the caregiver .
A group at the WUSTL Medical School studying Duchene 's Muscular Dystrophy is very interested in our devices and hopes they can incorporate them into their research plans . "
Field trials in the Third World
Richard and Zar have discussed a potential collaboration with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology about integrating their probe - smartphone concept into a suite of field trials for medical applications in developing countries .
" We 're at the point of wanting to leverage what we 've done with this technology and find as many applications as possible , " Richard said .
One such application could find its way to the military .
Medics could quickly diagnose wounded soldiers with the small , portable probe and phone to detect quickly the site of shrapnel wounds in order to make the decision of transporting the soldier or treating him elsewhere on the field .
Richard and Zar demonstrated a fully functional smartphone - compatible USB ultrasound probe at Microsoft Research Techfest 2009 in February , and Zar presented the technology at the 2009 World Health Care Congress in Washington , D.C. , April 14 - 16 .

The thing I like most about these silver plated Transformers cufflinks is the bipartisan approach they take .
Let ’s face it , the war over Cybertron is n’t going to stop until both sides , the Autobots and the Decepticons , come to some peaceful agreement .
And seeing people walk around with just a single logo on their hoodie or t- shirt , showing support for one side over the other , does not help the healing process .
These cufflinks however feature the logos of both factions , and tell the world that you ’re tired of all the fighting and action - packed battle sequences , and just want to see both sides start working together … to take down those G.I .
Joe jerks !!
The cufflinks are available from finkstudio’s shop on Etsy for just $ 20 .

Philips Electronics and other companies researching future display technologies got together this week at the Big Sight lighting fair in Tokyo to unveil cool new OLED prototypes , including the latest builds of transparent displays .
Philips Research mainly used the event to show its recently announced OLED light display grid , the Lumiblade , a basic , super - bright lamp slab that had previous problems with ' luminance variability . '
Apparently , that 's been worked out ( the lamps light up evenly ) and they should start being sold by the end of the year in Europe , most likely for businesses .
But Philips reps apparently had to start talking up its transparent screens ( above ) , since The Research Institute for Organic Electronics ( RIOE ) stole the show with its own transparent screen window display .
The screens , measured at 70 - 75 % of transparency , provide owners with the ability to let light in during the day and then use them as image panels at night .
RIOE has n't officially revealed its secret sauce behind the transparency , but it should follow the process of its other OLED screens .
Mainly , they place an organic EL device layer on a glass substrate and then use heat and ' radiating functions , ' a voltage type , generating an energy reaction that lights the panels .
RIOE also showed a bright OLED that consumes only 15 watts for hours at a time , perfect for saving some money and electricity .
Last year , Sony and the Max - Planck - Institute in Germany created some of the first transparent displays that rendered moving images , and they did it through the chemical process of photoexcitation .
That reaction is caused when rapid - fire lasers excite photosensitive chemicals embedded in a polycarbonate transparent sheet .
As for Philips , they also have n't revealed exactly how they 've created their own transparent displays , though it 's obvious from the previous examples that an organic polymer layering process is likely used .
For now , none of these prototypes have a price and most ( except the Lumiblade ) wo n't be available for another 3 - 5 years .
Check out the RIOE OLED layer process after the jump .

The London Telegraph is continuing to run a crude propaganda piece in it ’s arts and culture section that depicts nuclear attacks on major cities , the formation of a world government , and a police state crackdown on citizens complete with concentration camps and the implementation of martial law .
As we revealed in our original article , the first installment of the gallery entitled “ Operation Blackjack ” featured on a section of the Telegraph website dedicated to art , culture , film and music but seemingly held no artistic credence whatsoever , comprising merely of a series of crude pictures designed to instill fear into the viewer .
Part 2 , which we covered in a second article , cannot even be considered to have a plot , it just shows a series of major cities being nuked and then amateurish photo - shopped images of Nazi - style symbols on flags and police uniforms .
Now a third installment of the baffling piece depicts the fallout of nuclear attacks on London , New York City , Washington DC , Toronto , Mexico City , Portland , and Los Angeles .
This time the piece has been photoshopped in the style of a comic book , perhaps in a poor attempt to give it the impression that it has some artistic merit .
The Telegraph received a great deal of complaints after our first two articles .
One of the first images shows a map marked “ Teardrop – Eyes only ” which features the flag of the newly formed “ Union of North America ” ( UNA ) – a new government composed of America , Canada , Mexico and Britain .
Some men in suits , presumably representatives of the “ UNA ” are looking at map and “ the glasseye reports ” , which constitute the scale of destruction wrought on the attacked cities .
These men seem to be pleased with situation stating “ this has exceeded our wildest expectations ” and calling for “ phase 2 ″ .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Clearly from this we are supposed to deduce that these men , representatives of the new world government , are somehow involved in the events that have taken place , despite the fact that we were told religious extremist terrorists were the culprits .
The next set of images depict an announcement by the UNA to citizens everywhere that the union has begun carrying out military attacks on China , Syria and Iran , who are now apparently somehow also to blame for the earlier nuclear attacks .
Several more images show a state of martial law has been implemented and that concentration camps have been set up to hold collaborators and presumably anyone else who refuses to go along with the program .
Another image shows an “ Amero ” coin , indicating the creation of a new global currency .
What is the point of “ Operation Blackjack ” , why does it continue to run in the “ arts and culture ” section of a major British newspaper ?
Is someone ’s sick fantasy being afforded exposure on a major UK newspaper website or are we being prepared for something ?
Could it be that in the fictionalization of false flag terror , the creation of detention centers and the push for global government , someone is attempting to relegate such real world issues to the pages of a comic book ?
As we previously highlighted , the rude and hostile response to people who have attempted to get clarification from the Telegraph only deepens the mystery .
Contact [ email protected ] and politely ask for clarification on who the author of the piece is , why it continues being run when it obviously has no artistic merit , and if the Telegraph has considered the offense it is causing to people who live in the cities being depicted as victims of nuke attacks

ROBERT GATES , the secretary of defense , has proposed a budget overhaul that will go a long way toward improving our national security , but more can be done to meet his long - term goal : creating the right military for the 21st century .
Not since Henry Stimson ’s tenure from 1940 to ’ 45 has a defense secretary been faced to the same degree with simultaneously fighting a war and carrying out far - reaching reforms .
Yet there are three major changes Mr. Gates should add to his agenda , and they deserve President Obama ’s support .
First , the Air Force should be eliminated , and its personnel and equipment integrated into the Army , Navy and Marine Corps .
Second , the archaic “ up or out ” military promotion system should be scrapped in favor of a plan that treats service members as real assets .
Third , the United States needs a national service program for all young men and women , without any deferments , to increase the quality and size of the pool from which troops are drawn .
At the moment , the Army , Navy and Marine Corps are at war , but the Air Force is not .
This is not the fault of the Air Force : it is simply not structured to be in the fights in Iraq and Afghanistan .
While Army , Marine and Navy personnel have borne the brunt of deployments , commonly serving multiple tours , the Air Force ’s operational tempo remains comparatively comfortable .
In 2007 , only about 5 percent of the troops in Iraq were airmen .

Seven people were arrested for allegedly plotting to bomb densely populated areas in Amsterdam , Netherlands , police said Thursday .
One member of the group of six men and one woman has ties to a bombing in Madrid , Spain , said Amsterdam police spokeswoman Shermain Canbamme .
Late Thursday , police were still searching buildings where the arrests were made , she said .
Several shopping areas and the area around a soccer stadium had been closed as a precaution .
The suspects were being held at several police stations , police said , and no charges had been filed as of late Thursday night .

Almost nine years after they played their first NHL game , the Columbus Blue Jackets are about to get their first taste of the Stanley Cup playoffs .
Rick Nash erased a 3 - 2 deficit by scoring his 39th goal with 5:30 left in regulation , and defenseman Fedor Tyutin scored the lone tally in the shootout as the Blue Jackets clinched their first - ever berth in the Stanley Cup Playoffs with a 4 - 3 victory against the Chicago Blackhawks at the United Center on Wednesday night .
Columbus , which entered the NHL in 2000 - 01 , was the only active team that had not qualified for the postseason .
The Jackets needed one point to assure themselves of the playoff berth .
" To get that one point was huge , to come back after being down 2 - 0 , " Nash said .
" To get the win was even more important .
We 're going to try to win these last two games to keep our position in the standings .
I do n't know if it 's quite sunk in yet .
We 're so used to playing out the season . "
Clinching a playoff spot was special on many levels for the Blue Jackets .
John H. McConnell , the team 's founder and majority owner , died in April 2008 at age 84 .
" It 's great , " Nash said .
" We did it for ourselves , but most of all we did it for Mr. Mac .
We know he 's up there watching .
I 'm sure he 's sitting in his chair and has a cigar in his mouth . "
The Blackhawks still need one point to clinch fourth place in the Western Conference and home - ice advantage in the first round of the playoffs .
Chicago will make its first postseason appearance since 2002 and only its second in 11 seasons .
" Fourth place was the motivation , " Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville said .
" We 'll see what happens .
We just finished a busy stretch of nine ( games ) in 15 nights and we did some good things over that stretch .
We 've got a couple of days to reflect and be excited come Saturday .
Chicago failed to come away with a second point in the standings despite jumping out to an early 2 - 0 lead .
After Nash was denied on a penalty shot by Nikolai Khabibulin 8:59 into the game , Brent Seabrook broke a scoreless tie with a power - play goal at 13:48 .
The Blackhawks ' defenseman took a pass from Brian Campbell and beat rookie Steve Mason on a breakaway for his eighth goal of the season .
Dave Bolland put the Blackhawks up by a pair with 21 seconds left in the first when his centering pass drifted behind Mason and into the slot -- and was knocked into the net by a sliding Nash as the Blue Jackets ' captain tried to catch up with the play .
But Columbus came back with two quick tallies in the second period .
Antoine Vermette cut the deficit in half when he stuffed a rebound past Khabibulin at 5:37 , and Jason Williams tied it 2:23 later as he finished a two - on - none with Vermette .
It was his 19th goal of the season .
" I 'm proud of the guys , " Columbus coach Ken Hitchcock said .
" I was n't happy about the first period .
I thought we were light on the puck .
In the second and third period we came back and managed the play . "
Martin Havlat restored Chicago 's lead with his 28th tally at 17:43 .
The score remained 3 - 2 until Nash slipped in alone from the left side and beat Khabibulin with a backhander with 5:30 remaining in regulation .
The Blue Jackets survived overtime despite being outshot 5 - 0 and having to kill a late penalty .
" It was pretty important for them , " Quenneville said .
" We would have liked to have gotten two points , which was our motivation and our goal .
We left an important , valuable point on the table .
We have n't accomplished anything yet . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices fell Wednesday in one of the biggest single - day declines in history , after a woeful supply report gave previously bullish investors little reason to believe oil would sustain a rally anytime soon .
U.S. crude for February delivery fell $ 5.95 , or 12.3 % , to settle at $ 42.63 a barrel , a day after soaring past $ 50 in intraday trading .
Wednesday 's decline was the biggest percentage drop since Sept. 24 , 2001 , in a week of massive oil price drops following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Crude 's decline nearly undid more than a week of gains that sent oil up from below $ 40 .
Prices fell early in the day on dour economic news .
The selloff accelerated dramatically after a government supply report showed still weakening demand for oil , dashing the bullish hopes of traders that had been betting on the beginning of another substantial rise in crude prices .
" For oil to make a real recovery , we will need to see a real economic rebound , not just talk about it , " said Stephen Schork , editor of the industry publication The Schork Report .
" Oil is still volatile and will likely fall below $ 30 a barrel again before it makes a material rise . "
The Department of Energy report Wednesday showed crude stockpiles rose by a whopping 6.7 million barrels for the week ended Jan .
2 . That far surpassed experts ' forecast of a 1.5 million barrel rise , according to a poll by research firm Platts .
Rising supply suggests demand for fuel continues to plummet - a trend that has continued since the late summer , when gas prices began a steep and rapid decline from a mid-July record $ 4.114 a gallon .
The report also showed supplies of gasoline rose by 3.3 million barrels , while supplies of distillates , which are used to make diesel fuel and home heating oil , rose by 1.8 million barrels .
The Platts survey expected a gasoline supply increase of 1.6 million barrels , while stocks of distillates had been expected to rise by 700,000 barrels .
Crude prices had risen more than 38 % since Christmas in very , very thin trading .
Ultra - light trading volume meant bullish trades on tension in the Middle East and Russia , and further OPEC production cuts exacerbated the rise to $ 50 .
" Many misread the rise over the past week on some kind of bogus assumption that the bottom arrived , " said Schork .
" The recent highs have been pushed around by low volume in the marketplace - virtually no one has been trading in the past two weeks . "
Economy : Job losses rose more than 45 % in December over the prior month , to 693,000 , according to payroll firm ADP .
In addition , the number of announced job cuts last month was more than four times greater than in 2007 , although down slightly from November , according to outplacement firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas .
Unemployment will continue to rise " significantly " into 2010 , according to minutes from the Federal Reserve 's December meeting , released late Tuesday .
The Fed also said that the U.S. gross domestic product , a broad measurement of economic activity , will fall in 2009 .
" It was a reminder of how bad the economy is , " said Phil Flynn , senior market analyst with Alaron Trading in Chicago .
" There 's nothing about this financial crisis that bodes well for energy prices and energy demand . "
The job reports and Fed 's comments put investor attention squarely back on falling demand , a worry that has driven oil prices down from a record high of $ 147.27 a barrel last summer , according to Flynn .
Measuring supply : Oil production has started to show signs of slowing as low prices make both production and exploration less profitable .
" Traders are seeing producers put down rigs and scuttle projects , and that is a change that is real , " Tom Orr , head of research for Weeden & Co. , wrote in an e-mail .
While the impact on the overall amount of oil entering the market is small , " it sends a signal to people that producers will put down projects very quickly , " said Orr .
Last week , the number of oil and natural gas rigs in the United States searching for or pumping energy supplies fell by 5.7 % , the largest decline in 15 years , according to oilfield service company Baker Hughes .
Furthermore , fighting in the Middle East between Israel and the Hamas - controlled Gaza Strip had sparked concerns that shipments to the West could be disrupted should an oil producing nation such as Iran get involved .
And an ongoing energy contract dispute in Eastern Europe led to a complete shutoff of natural gas shipments between Russia and Ukraine Wednesday , highlighting the region 's reliance on the energy producer .
The move could force more homes to switch from natural gas to heating oil for warmth during the winter months , according to Orr .
The United States and China also said last week that they would be adding to their respective strategic oil reserves and taking advantage of the sub - $ 50 price of oil .
Reports also emerged that Kuwait and Iran were taking concrete steps to comply with the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ' pledge to remove 2.2 million barrels a day from the market .
The CBC's SearchEngine podcast delved into the GhostNet story that broke yesterday , in which the University of Toronto 's CitizenLab discovered and revealed a spy-ring ( apparently of Chinese origin ) that was gathering intelligence from sensitive government , military and NGO computers in over 100 countries .
CitizenLab 's researchers managed to gain access to the control server for these spy - trojans , and got an unprecedented look at the extent to which these machines were compromised ( for example , they saw the spymasters activating the cameras on compromised machines and watching meetings and other sensitive communications ) .
SearchEngine and CitizenLab went well beyond the news coverage and had a fascinating discussion about what this means : how it signals a turning point in the ongoing militarization of cyberspace , and whether this demands a comparable peace movement for the Internet .
It was one of the most fascinating things I 've heard said about the Net this year , and I think I 'll be listening to it again , just to get a good crack at it .
Podcast # 27 : exposing the world 's biggest cyberspy ring
MP3 Link
The existence and operation of massive , coordinated , government - affiliated online espionage networks is typically the province of television or the silver screen , rather than the subject of research .
In the real world , even a direct link between online and offline action ( Russia 's invasion of Georgia and the simultaneous online attacks against that country are a good example ) is not enough to automatically prove that the government behind the one is automatically behind the other .
We 've covered the rise of hacktivism previously on Ars ; as more citizens come online , we 'll undoubtedly see more of this type of crowdsourced aggression in the future .
Researchers in Toronto , however , may have actually discovered and tracked a hacking effort that can be traced back to a foreign intelligence network —
China 's , in this case — over the past ten months .
The team , which is affiliated with the Munk Centre for International Studies , has published an extensive report on the activities of what they dub GhostNet .
Their investigation took place from June 2008 through March of 2009 , and focused on allegations that the Chinese had engaged in systemic online espionage activities against the Tibetan community .
GhostNet was spread through the use of a wide variety of Trojans , many of which were controlled through a program nicknamed gh0st RAT ( Remote Access Tool ) .
The report can be read ( PDF ) in one of two ways : either as a primer on the operation and capabilities of both the gh0st RAT tool and the GhostNet network , or as an intelligence document detailing ( with some redactions ) where GhostNet infections were found and , perhaps more importantly , where the espionage network 's C&C servers appear to be located .
For the purposes of this discussion , we 're going to focus more on the sociopolitical implications of GhostNet and less on the technical details .
It will have to suffice to say that gh0st RAT is apparently a complex and nasty bit of business that does not rely on the successful installation of one particular Trojan in order to operate .
Its various payloads appear to have been delivered using standard social engineering and / or spear phishing techniques .
This could be seen as further proof that relatively simple attack vectors are sufficient to overwhelm the security training and / or antivirus software of high - level government institutions ; many of the targets GhostNet infiltrated should never be susceptible to a gussied up version of a social engineering attack .
Just because you 're paranoid ...
China has been accused of attacking a number of groups and institutions through the use of cyber espionage , a fact which already put it high on the research team 's " countries of interest " list .
The team 's investigation ended up focused on Tibet in particular " because of the unprecedented access that we were granted to Tibetan institutions through one of our researchers and persistent allegations that confidential information on secure computers was somehow being compromised . "
The report notes that the lead field researcher had a substantial history of working with the Tibetan community , and was able to secure access to " the private office of the Dalai Lama , the Tibetan Government - in - Exile ( TGIE ) , and a number of Tibetan non-governmental organizations " ( NGOs ) .
The group 's on - site research identified infected systems within the Office of His Holiness the Dalai Lama ( OHHDL ) , the network of the TGIE , and the offices of a Tibetan NGO , TibTec .
In the latter 's case , there was already anecdotal evidence of espionage within the Drewla Initiative Project .
According to its description , " Drewla ( ' connection ' in Tibetan ) is an online outreach project ... that employs Tibetan youth with Chinese language skills to chat with people in mainland China and in the diaspora , raising awareness about the Tibetan situation , sharing the Dala Lama 's teachings , and supplying information on how to circumvent ... government censorship on the Internet . "
This is rather obviously the sort of project the Chinese government would be less than fond of .
The anecdotal evidence we mentioned is given on page 29/53 of the PDF , which tells the story of a young member of Drewla who was returning to her family in Tibet after two years away .
She was detained at the Nepalese / Tibetan border and held for two months .
Accused of participating in the Drewla Initiative , " She denied having been politically active and insisted that she had gone to Dharamsala for studies .
In response ... the intelligence officers pulled out a dossier on her activitiies and presented her with full transcripts of her Internet chats over the years .
They indicated that they were fully aware of , and were monitoring , the Drewla outreach initiative . "
... does n't mean they are n't out to get you
GhostNet is extremely selective for a malware network .
The Toronto researchers listed the following systems as ones they are highly confident have been compromised :
ASEAN ( Association of Southeast Asian Nations )
Asian Development Bank
Associated Press , UK
Consulate General of Malaysia , Hong Kong
Department of Foreign Affairs , Indonesia
Department of Foreign Affairs , Philippines
International Campaign for Tibet
NATO ( SHAPE HQ )
Office of the Dalai Lama , India
Russian Federal University Network , Russian Federation
Students for a Free Tibet , US
Taiwan Government Service network , Taiwan
Tibetan Government in Exile , India
Ommitted from that list is any mention of the dozen - plus embassies believed to be infected across Southeast Asia or in other geographical areas of interest to China .
As the authors themselves point out , there are plausible explanations for GhostNet that do not require it to be an espionage tool of the Chinese government , though they think that this explanation is both the most obvious and " the one in which the circumstantial evidence tilts the strongest . "
The fact that the attack IPs examined resolve back " in at least several instances to Hainan Island , home of the Lingshui signals intelligence facility and the Third Technical Department of the People 's Liberation Army " definitely helps this case .
Alternatives must , however , be considered .
These include the possibility that GhostNet is essentially a fluke , a deliberate creation of a foreign power other than China ( but with a similar set of interests ) , or the creation of a group searching for information to sell at a profit .
This last option is most plausible if we consider the likelihood that there are many GhostNets in operation around the world , each designed to monitor its own particular interests .
As the authors note , they " can safely hypothesize that it [ GhostNet ] is neither the first nor the only one of its kind . "

WASHINGTON --
The many roads of inquiry into the Bush administration 's abusive " interrogation techniques " all lead to one stubborn , inconvenient fact :
Torture is not just immoral , but also illegal .
This means that once we learn the whole truth , the law will oblige us to act on it .
Understandably , the Obama administration wants to avoid getting bogged down in a long , wrenching legal drama that almost certainly would be partisan and divisive .
But I 'm not sure it 's possible to skirt the criminal implications of what we already know , let alone what we might find out in a full - scale " truth commission " investigation with access to all relevant witnesses and documents .
On the moral question , the administration has been straightforward and righteous .
One of President Obama 's first acts was to declare that the United States will no longer practice waterboarding or other abusive interrogation methods , saying that such depredations are inimical to our nation 's values and traditions .
Attorney General Eric
Holder stated at his confirmation hearings that " waterboarding is torture . "
This refreshing and admirable clarity stands in stark contrast to the fog of legalistic sophistry in which the Bush administration cloaked its secret prisons .
On the legal question , though , the Obama team has been far less definitive .
This is what Dennis Blair , the director of national intelligence , told his staff about the interrogation abuses in a memo last week : " I like to think I would not have approved those methods in the past , but I do not fault those who made the decisions at that time , and I will absolutely defend those who carried out the interrogations within the orders they were given . "
To state the obvious , this makes no sense at all .
If Blair would not have sanctioned " those methods " -- some of which clearly meet the legal definition of torture , in my view -- then why would he give a pass to those who ordered the abuses and those who carried them out ?
At least Blair , charged with leading the agents who performed the abuses , has a reason for going all fuzzy on the matter of accountability .
And we can thank him for definitively refuting the most commonly cited pro-torture argument : that waterboarding , sleep deprivation , stress positions and other abuses were necessary to obtain vital information that kept Americans safe from another al - Qaeda attack .
" High value information came from interrogations in which those methods were used , " Blair wrote in the memo .
But in a separate statement , he added that " there is no way of knowing whether the same information could have been obtained through other means . "
This should be obvious .
Yes , people break under torture and tell what they know , along with what they do n't know and what they think their torturers want to hear .
But there is no way to be certain that the valuable information would n't have been extracted through traditional -- and legal -- methods of interrogation .
Even if experts have differing views about torture 's effectiveness , there is one point on which they cannot disagree :
It violates U.S. and international law .
What abuses legally qualify as torture ?
That probably depends on which of several possibly applicable legal standards is applied .
At a bare minimum , though , it seems clear to me that waterboarding will almost certainly be deemed illegal if put under judicial scrutiny .
The practice has been considered torture at least since the Spanish Inquisition -- except , apparently , in the Office of Legal Counsel under George W. Bush .
I do n't know what more we 'll find out if a blue - ribbon investigative panel of some kind is formed .
But what we already know is enough to ensure that sooner or later , the abusive interrogation methods authorized by George W. Bush , Dick Cheney and other officials are going to be measured against the law .
Our system , left to its own devices , is not designed to let illegal acts be revealed and then ignored .
From the viewpoint of the Obama administration , the alternatives may be unattractive or even unacceptable .
No one wants to see low - ranking CIA interrogators go down for doing what their superiors told them was legal , especially if the superiors are not held to account .
But pursuing criminal charges against the highest - ranking officials of the previous administration would be unprecedented , and it is unclear where such a process might lead .
It will be hard to stop this train , though .
The rule of law is one of this nation 's founding principles .
It 's not optional .
Our laws against torture demand to be obeyed -- and demand to be enforced .
" Just last week , I had two clients who told us they were not well treated .
One man was infected six months ago and he did not get his results until now .
That is terrible .
In Chengdu there are only four centres which do free tests .
They are far away and they do not do them seven days a week . "
Why Watching CNBC Could Destroy Your Portfolio
August 2007 - Dow Jones
13,000 - What did the CNBC Talking Heads Recommend Investors Should do ?
Ned Riley - Himself 75 % Invested in Stocks , recommends investing into the Big Banks and a viewer nearing retirement should go to 90 % invested in stocks .
Believes US stocks will rise by 9 to 11 % per annum for next 10 years .
If you followed Ned 's advice your portfolio has now been wiped out !
Vern Haden - Waffles on without saying anything other than investors should remain allocated as is .
Peter Schiff - Poor Peter , right on the economy and financial stocks but wrong on many of his other investments - Says the Dollar will collapse , interest rates will go sky high , and invest in foreign stock markets and commodities , as of writing only gold has shined from Peters picks .
Lessons
1 . If you watch CNBC , then TURN OFF THE VOLUME .
That single act will improve the chances of your portfolio surviving more than anything else .
2. EDUCATE YOURSELF - Investment managers skim a % off your funds invested with them , usually regardless of performance .
Investors need to take responsibility for their investments , if they cannot then leave them in cash deposits .

Back on September 23rd 2008 he was at it again .
He is clearly a perma bull who does not have a cliue what he is talking about .
http://in.truveo.com/Market-analysis-with-Ned-Riley/id/288230388004924459
After the volatility of 2008 he is recommending investors stay invested for the long - run , long - term opportunities .
Its a wonder that he has any clients left .

Whatever these CNBC Bozo 's tell you do the opposite , your portfolio will be fine .
They tell you to buy a particular stock - SELL It Short

You were entirely too kind to CNBC , given how horrendous that shill network is .
If you watch You Will lose money .
You were especially too kind to Cramer .
I 'm sure you recall Cramer told people to stay in BSC and LEH just a few days before they went belly up .
BTW , I do n't watch CNBC .
I only know from researching archives for a book that will blast the media .

08 Mar 09 , 22:55 CNBC 's biggest JOKER .
I think you missed the biggest joker of them all , Mr. Larry ( never gets it right ) Kudlow .
A year ago , when the economy and market were clearly in trouble , he was singing his Goldilocks song , with the Goldilocks figure dancing across the bottom of the screen .
Six months ago when the economy and market were crashing , he was stating that " they gave a recession and no one came " .
Now , when a number less negative than a so called expert guessed , he jumps up and down shouting , " MUSTARD SEED " .
Yes , he knows the lingo and he has memorized some economic equations and relationships , but he just does n't know how to interpret the data , and of course , everything he says is biased by his overwhelming republicanism .

german based studio osko + deichmann with sushi roller will be part of the kitchen ecology exhibition in los angeles , june 2009 .
sushi , being a traditional japanese dish , has been becoming increasingly popular in europe and the united states over the last decade .
recently sushi is being transferred from the restaurant to the home .
more and more people are trying to make their own sushi .
despite the fact , that becoming a real sushi- chef takes years of experience , preparing the ingredients for a maki - roll is quite easy .
the traditional maki is a rice - roll filled with sliced vegetables ( e.g. cucumber ) and covered with a sheet of seaweed ( nori ) .
only the rolling itself , with the traditional bamboo - mat , is difficult without practice .
often people get frustrated after a few attempts .
the sushiroller solves the problem enabling everybody to make perfectly round , thick maki-rolls .

PRESS RELEASE :
VIRTUAL REALITY : COMPUTER WORLDS INSPIRE DESIGN CONCEPT CREATED BY BMW GROUP DESIGNWORKSUSA FOR THE LATEST HIGH-END THERMALTAKE GAMING TOWER SHOW PIECE
The gaming industry - a sector that can deservedly adorn itself with attributes such as visionary creativity , innovation and progressiveness .
However , who inspires the gaming industry and how does one set trends in a sector that is in itself the embodiment of progressive thinking and imaginativeness ?
One answer to that question is currently being given by BMW Group DesignworksUSA , with the presentation of a design concept for a high - end gaming tower prototype that was inspired by the gaming world itself .
BMW Group DesignworksUSA , a 100 % subsidiary of the BMW Group , has for many years shaped the global design landscape working for a multitude of industries .
In addition to creating yachts , trains , aircraft , lifestyle and IT products , the three studios in Munich , California and Singapore are also engaged with design concepts aimed at transforming visions into reality .
One of these concepts is named " Level 10 " for Thermaltake , a manufacturer of computer housings and components for individually configurable high - end computers .
Design concept from another world .
The " Level 10 " concept allows gamers to experience the power of their high - end computers through the design itself .
In order to achieve this , iconic design is combined with optimum functionality and innovative details .
By rendering the inside components visible , the design concept focuses on the architectural aesthetics which are inherent in the computers and result from each individually configurable component .
The inspiration for this approach the design team took right from the computer worlds themselves – expressiveness , virtual townscapes and futuristic game components served as orientation for the arrangement and the look of individual components .
These appear within the overall design in the form of an open modular structure that visually appeals to users , offering them additional functional benefits .
Each high - quality component featured by the " Level 10 " concept is enclosed within its own protective case , rendering it not only an integral part of the design but also guaranteeing interchangeability and transportability .
Thus the design concept makes considerable allowances for the behaviour of users who wish to use their equipment in many different places and are eager to get it there safely .
The concept also has an aesthetical answer to the physical necessity for best possible cooling , this also being associated with the virtual world of the gamer .
The asymmetric arrangement of the robust vertical heatsink and the horizontally located individual components creates a strong architectural statement , clearly revealing the powerful cooling characteristics of the Thermaltake Gaming Tower .
Decisive game factor : Cleverly designed details .
Whilst the design concept initially appeals visually to gamers , clever detail solutions do justice to their high demands on the applications .
A smart lock system facilitates the blocking of access in order to protect the valuable modules .
A USB memory key was designed as an extractable " power button " that not only activates the system , but also secures personal system data , rendering it suitable for flexible use .
Two ergonomically well - positioned , integrated handles allow safe and convenient transportation of the tower , a highly relevant feature in the high - end gaming tower sector .
The design is rounded off by a cleverly devised cable conduit system and light features which communicate a multitude of tower functions such as temperature and memory volumes .
Since the computer worlds themselves supply the context for the conceptual idea , an authentic design has been created that significantly emphasises the functionality of the Thermaltake housing and no longer needs to be concealed inside the chassis .
The prototype of the " Level 10 " tower can be seen from the 3rd to 8th of March at the CEBIT in Hannover .
( Thermaltake stand hall 24 / C02 ) .
BMW Group DesignworksUSA -
Perfect design beyond the spotlights .
BMW Group DesignworksUSA is a global design consultancy and subsidiary of the BMW Group .
The company , which was acquired by the BMW Group in 1995 , now operates globally from its locations in Europe , America and Asia .
Clients turn to DesignworksUSA for brand communications , strategy , research , design development , engineering , modeling , and color , materials , and finish .
Unique to DesignworksUSA , they have both an automotive and industrial design studio , enabling the transfer of collective knowledge and inspiration from automotive design to product design and vice versa .
The studio represents a guiding force for the BMW Group brand design studios ( BMW , MINI and Rolls - Royce Motor Cars ) and simultaneously operates as an innovation driver for the most diverse industries from IT to medical , lifestyle or aviation .
Since 2004 , Verena C. Kloos has overseen the strategy and operations for the Munich , Los Angeles and Singapore design studios .
The designs consistently express the individual identity of a brand , so each product devised by BMW Group DesignworksUSA gains its specific uniqueness .
Thanks to this approach the design studio stands out significantly from its competitors , convincing big brand names – from Microsoft and HP , Starbucks , Embraer , Advanced Medical Optics and Bavaria Yachts to Boeing Business Jets .
Design studio : BMW Group DesignworksUSA , Munich Studio
Client : Thermaltake , Taipeh , Taiwan
Project name : Design concept " Level 10 "
About a decade ago , pretty much every computer in the world was housed in a boring beige box , and the biggest design question was whether that container would sit vertically or horizontally .
That 's all changed now , partly due to the influence of Apple and custom PC manufacturers like Thermaltake , a Taiwanese company that specializes in PC cases and cooling devices .
Recently , Thermaltake contracted BMW DesignWorksUSA , a wholly - owned subsidiary of the German automaker , to help create a new concept in high - end computing , and the result is wholly different from what 's common to the market today .
Instead of centering around one large box that all the computer components would sit inside , BMW 's Level 10 concept uses a set of smaller containers that would house each individual piece .
The requisiteLED lighting is present and accounted for , in this case glowing a red hue that looks Vader - esque with the rest of its piano black plastic surrounds .
This design is mostly an aesthetic exercise , but it may also have a desirable effect on cooling .
Other unique features include a " USB memory key " that doubles as a power button and dual handles that allow the unit to be transported .

The musical will feature some of Jade Goody 's favourite songs A TV talent show to find an " ordinary girl " to play Jade Goody in a musical based on her life is being planned , it has been announced .
Goody 's ex-business partner Danny Hayward said no deal had been struck with a TV network but that the stage musical would " definitely happen " .
Goody 's former publicist Max Clifford said it was " a wonderful idea that has got very , very strong potential " .
He said he would be a judge on the TV show " if it comes to fruition " .
Mr Hayward , who was one of Goody 's " best men " at her wedding to Jack Tweed in February , said open auditions would take place across the UK to find hopefuls who will compete in the TV show .
Dates would be announced in three weeks ' time , he said .
She was tabloid gold .
The people have the right to choose their hero
Danny Hayward , Jade Goody 's friend " Jade was just an ordinary girl and the person who plays her will reflect that , " he added .
He said he was hoping to " repeat history " by turning an unknown into a household name , as happened with Goody .
" Her dream as a little girl was to be in a musical , so obviously when she passed away it felt fitting to do something like this . "
He said Goody had not known about the project , as the idea had been devised since her death .
Asked if he was concerned people would accuse him of exploiting Goody , Mr Hayward said : " I have nothing to say to those people , really .
Max Clifford could act as a judge on the TV show " She was tabloid gold .
The people have the right to choose their hero .
" If the show continues to raise awareness about cervical cancer , be a good night out and further her legacy , then it 's not really hurting anyone . "
He said the production would include some original songs , which would be written by " well - known bands , who wish to remain anonymous " at the moment .
No deal has been struck with a TV network , but he said he hoped to pitch to MTV and ITV2 .
Film plan Meanwhile , Mr Clifford said the project was " nothing more than an idea - we 're talking ifs , buts and maybes " .
He added : " If it comes to fruition , then yes I will be a judge .
It 's a wait and see .
" If I 'm going to announce something is happening , it 's because I know it 's going ahead . "
Earlier this month , Mr Clifford revealed he had been in talks with several film companies about making a movie based on Goody .
He told Radio 1 Newsbeat that they were " serious discussions " because her " incredible life touched so many people " .
Goody , who became famous after appearing in Big Brother , passed away in March after she lost her high - profile battle with cancer .
Thousands of people turned out to see the funeral procession , which travelled through London before reaching Buckhurst Hill in Essex , where the funeral took place .

Sure , you could torpedo your chances for a place in the rock ’n ’roll pantheon with drugs , alcohol and your choice of sexually transmitted diseases .
But where ’s the fun in that ?
The following bands found new and interesting ways to bring that dreaded day job a little too close for comfort .
10 Billy Squier
Sabotaged by : Music Video
Boston rocker Billy Squier was the lone hard rocker still charting when synthesizers and drum machines crowded everything else out of 80 ’s radio .
With the excellent “ Do n’t Say No ” and “ Emotions in Motion ” already under his belt , record executives were salivating over the chance to market his 1984 album “ Signs of Life ” .
For the music video of the leadoff single “ Rock Me Tonight ” , they convinced him to dance on a bed wearing a pink tank top .
The album sold gangbusters but the video lost Squier his fan base–as well it should ( his dancing was compared to a French pastry chef whose souffle had fallen ) .
The shame of it was that in concert , Billy just strapped on a Telecaster and ROCKED .
Subsequent albums predictably fizzled .
The rather un - masculine video clip is above .
9 Cheap Trick
Sabotaged by : Japan
After three critically acclaimed / poor selling albums , Cheap Trick was ready to launch their best record with “ Dream Police ” .
But then their quickie live set in Tokyo went uber - platinum .
Shelved for a year , “ Dream Police ” sold well when it saw the light of day , but critics complained the band had abandoned their Budakon sound ( even though the concerts were recorded AFTER Dream Police was already in the can ) .
Desperate for another hit , record executives paired the band with producer after producer , even though nobody knew why the live album sold when the studio versions did n’t .
The band tried to sue their way free and received a package in the mail .
It was their ass .
The A&R boys called the shots from then on , so you can thank them for “ The Flame ” .
Only after their contract expired did Trick get their edge back on “ Cheap Trick ’ 97 ” and “ Rockford ” , both on independent labels .
8 Quiet Riot
Sabotaged by : Trash Talk
Quiet Riot has the dubious honor to be the very first heavy metal band to score a top ten hit with a cover of Slade ’s “ Cum On Feel the Noize ” .
But they ’d shot their wad creatively , having to release ANOTHER Slade cover as a follow - up .
The band probably could have weathered this , but when lead singer Kevin DuBrow insulted the more popular and ( I ca n’t believe I ’m writing this ) more talented Motley Crue , he angered fans on all sides .
Heavy metal found its first pariah in a movement supposedly populated by outcasts .
Oh , the angst !
7 Ozzy Osborne

Oh , he ’s all warm and fuzzy now , but back in the day Ozzy was a bat - biting , ant - eating , dove - killing badass backed by guitar whiz Randy Roads on “ Crazy Train ” , “ Over the Mountain ” , and “ Flying High Again ” .
But by letting MTV into his LA mansion ( instead of the creepy dungeon we all pictured him in ) , Ozzy cashed the last of his credibility in for a permanent Trivial Pursuit mention and assloads of cash .
6 Metallica
Sabotaged by : Napster
As file sharing made anonymous , consequence - free theft easier than copping a squat , Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich stood up for musicians by refusing to sell Metallica content digitally .
Musicians applauded the stand , but the fan base saw Metallica as out of date and hypocritical , since mix tape trading was largely responsible for Metallica ’s getting noticed by the major labels .
It took five years and group therapy before the band recovered most of its reputation .
Long time readers of Listverse will well know how hated the band is here .
5 Rod Stewart
Sabotaged by : Urban Legend
You know the one , do n’t you ?
Sure you do .
About how Rod Stewart had to have his stomach pumped because he had a gallon of human semen in it .
Regardless of which way Rod swings , he claims his career was unaffected .
For the record , Rod later married model Rachel Hunter , and she ’s Stacy ’s Mom ( who definitely has it goin ’ on ) .
Incidentally , the same urban legend has also been applied to Elton John , David Bowie , Mick Jagger , Jon Bon Jovi , Alanis Morissette , Britney Spears , and Lil’ Kim .
4 The Beatles
Sabotaged by : Jesus
In a press interview , John Lennon made a cynical off - the - cuff remark that the Beatlemania had made his band “ more popular than Jesus now ” .
The backlash was instantaneous and resulted in mass record burnings and protests .
Management quickly scheduled a press conference , and Lennon recanted according to a script we ’re all too familiar with these days .
Me ?
I think Jesus let him off with a warning .
3 The Beatles – Again !
Sabotaged by : Yoko Ono- NOT
Bands have always had to tolerate the singer ’s girlfriend , but damn , this was The Beatles .
Post Yoko , the rift between John and Paul grew unbreachable , leading to the group ’s demise before they could get old and start sucking .
Wait …
2 Jerry Lee Lewis
Sabotaged by : Marriage
Just as his star was burning brightest ( “ Whole Lotta Shakin Goin ’ On and Great Balls of Fire were established hits ) , Jimmy Swaggart ’s cousin Jerry Lee Lewis had the brainstorm that marrying his thirteen - year old cousin was a really good idea .
As you can imagine , it was career suicide , but it ’s hard to appreciate how much of an outrage it must have been in the 1950’s .
Let ’s try : today , Marilyn Manson can vivsect a leopard seal in a gradeschool crosswalk and nobody bats an eye .
But we all still abhor Jerry Lee Lewis .
Yeah .
It ’s that bad .

How bad must you be to beat Jerry Lee Lewis in a creep - out contest ?
Try cosmetic surgeries numbered in scientific notation , resulting in a bleached , noseless rictus that makes the old guy from Poltergeist 2 look huggable .
And if that does n’t seal the deal , throw in cash settlements for pedophilia charges and dangle a blindfolded baby out a window .
At his obese and addicted worst , Elvis looks angelic next to this abomination of too much fame , money , and wasted talent .

LAGOS ( Reuters ) - Nigeria ’s anti-narcotics agency confiscated 6.5 tones of marijuana Tuesday from the home of a man who claimed to be 114 years old .
The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency ( NDLEA ) said it had found 254 sacks of cannabis at the home of Sulaiman Adebayo in Ogun state , north of the commercial capital Lagos .
“ The quantity of drugs suggests a large scale involvement ...
There is more to the case than Pa Sulaiman , ” NDLEA chairman Ahmadu Giade said in a statement .
Adebayo , who said he had been a farmer all his life , told police he thought the sacks contained rice .
The agency said he claimed to have attended the inauguration of a famous hall in Abeokuta , the capital of Ogun state , in 1895 as a small boy and said he was 114 years old .
There was no independent confirmation of his age .
Marijuana is grown illegally on large - scale farms in many parts of Nigeria and is smuggled across its porous borders to neighboring countries .
Lax customs control and corruption have also made Africa ’s top oil and gas producer a conduit for hard drugs from Asia and Latin America into Western markets .
We do n't expect celebrities to genuinely be good at the video games they appear in , but one would think that Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich could play his own band 's songs in Guitar Hero .
But no ...
Disappointingly , the Metallica founder , who will digitally appear in Guitar Hero Metallica in May does n't have the skills to unlock his own song .
Lars tells music mag
Blender the sad tale of proving to his kids that , you know , there are actually Metallica songs in Guitar Hero III .
" We were never good enough to earn our way to play ' One . ' "
Ulrich says .
" So after a couple of months , my kids did n't actually believe there was a Metallica song in this fuckin ' game , so I had to call the guys : " Can we get the cheat codes , please ? "
And the same thing with ' Enter Sandman ' on Rock Band . ' "

But wait , it gets more disheartening .
" I 'll tell you a little secret about the gaming industry :
You know who gave me the cheat codes to Rock Band ?
The guy at Guitar Hero !
Is n't it nice how they all sort of work together in a perverse way ? "
Ulrich said .
Well , that shatters the illusion that Harmonix and Neversoft employees guard their secrets with ruthless abandon and that if either developer is seen on the other 's turf , a switchblade fight ensues .

Lars also recounts the harrowing tale of being wedged into a motion capture suit , which Guitar Hero Metallica tune is his sentimental favorite and how three Kill ' Em All tracks almost did n't make it into the game .

Republicans have been hilariously trying to give Democrats branding suggestions as of late , as if their problem has been a lack of fresh new insults .
Well , why we have n't had much of a shortage of insults of late ( all we have to do is point at the latest Republican hilarity ) , that still does n't mean we can't offer our own branding advice .
For starters , let 's take a look at the Republican elephant logo :
Sure , it 's cute and clever !
But elephants never forget , and do we really want to remember the last eight years ?
Better to forget they ever existed .
And it looks like it 's moving forward .
That 's progressive !
Nah , this is the conservative party , and it must cling to the past , pretending that Ronald Reagan is still hip with the kids and longing for the days when the threat of nuclear annihilation kept everyone cowering in fear .
Yes , the good old days .
And sure , elephants face extinction while corralled into regional preserves , like the GOP , I 'm afraid that symbolism is far too subtle for today 's Republican Party .
I mean , let 's not forget that its intellectual foundation is provided by Joe the Plumber and Glenn Beck !
So the party needs a new logo that is bold and , well , not subtle .
So I got my crack team of branding experts on the case , and it took them only 33 minutes to come up with :
Perfect !
We call it the Goposaur .
It 's looking back , to the past , refusing to evolve with the times as it longingly dreams of the days when only good , white , god-fearing dinosaurs roamed the earth and those multi-hued and highly evolved mammals were n't taking over the place and turning it into a socialist same - sex utopia with reeducation camps and 100 % taxes .
It 's also ready to " go Galt " , which apparently is a euphemism for quitting work and starving to death , thus negating the need for the giant asteroid .
Their brains are the size of peanuts , after all .
I 'm feeling particularly magnanimous these days , so in the spirit of bipartisan cooperation , I give Republicans this new logo for free .
It 's better than the " Poochie the Dog " thing Michael Steele is trying to get going .
Here 's a bonus version , also for free !
And since I really mean it about that " bipartisan " thing , Republicans can also take Joe Lieberman to even things out after that " Arlen Specter " hullabaloo .
It 'd be unseemly to leave Republicans with one less dinosaur than they had yesterday .
Update : Oooh , after some tweaking , it 's gotten even better :
I love the dino head growing out of the elephant 's ass .
“ When you eat a lot of chocolates or junk foods , you will get acne . ”
“ Pimples are caused by poor hygiene . ”
“ Skin care products with the word ‘ natural ’ on the label are good for you . ”
How many of these maxims about skin care do you really believe in ?
In a world which puts too much stress on physical beauty , it is sometimes frustrating for an individual to have less - than - perfect skin , which is why it is tempting to believe in all these “ principles ” as far as skin care is concerned .
But the truth is that there are a lot of skin care myths out there which persist up to now .
Remember that the type of skin care regimen and skin care products that you use really depends on the type of skin that you have .
As such , it pays to be selective about which skin care advice it is that you will take .
Otherwise , you might end up doing yourself more harm than good .
The Truth behind the Top 7 Myths about Skin Care
To help you weed out what ’s true and not when it comes to skin care principles , here is a list of the top seven myths about skin care that your mom probably never told you about :
1. “ Acne is caused by poor hygiene and eating certain foods aggravates the condition . “
First of all , acne is not caused by dirt .
No matter how many times you wash your face and your body , acne may still appear especially if you are prone to it .
Basically , the root cause of the appearance of acne is an overproduction of sebum or oil which clogs the pores .
The rate by which the skin on your face produces sebum is not at all affected by dirt – hormones , stress , pollution and bacteria are some of the culprits behind the appearance of pimples .
Second , eating foods like chocolates , soda , peanuts , junk foods , soda and any other oily or greasy foods will not aggravate acne .
Although it is not recommended that you load up on junk foods , they are not really the cause of acne .
So what is the solution if you often have breakouts which mark the clarity of your skin ?
Over - the - counter treatments like Benzoyl Peroxide and products with salicylic acid may help .
If you have moderate to severe acne , consult a dermatologist so that an acne treatment plan can be recommended for you .
2. “ Not washing your face often enough can cause blackheads . “
Aside from acne , another skin care problem that most people have is the appearance of blackheads , especially on either sides of the nose .
Just like pimples , blackheads are not caused by dirt so washing your face more often than usual is not the solution at all .
Blackheads appear when the pores become dilated and the cellular buildup will lead to oxidation that causes that black color .
The solution to steer clear of blackheads is to use a good exfoliating face scrub that is suited for your skin type .
3. “ Lying down on a tanning booth is the safest way to add some bronzed color to your skin . “
This is not true at all .
Whether it ’s natural tanning under the heat of the sun or tanning under the tanning booth , you are still exposing your skin to UVA rays .
Experts agree that this type of ultraviolet ray can still penetrate deep into the skin and cause damage like premature aging .
In effect , you are also exposing yourself to the risks of developing skin cancers .
4. “ When looking for products that help shield your skin from the rays of the sun , all you need to look for is a higher SPF . “
SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor and it is an ingredient which is ever present in sunscreen lotions .
Although a higher SPF factor will offer protection from ultraviolet rays , the SPF will only work in shielding your skin from UVB rays .
The other kinds of ultraviolet rays include UVA and UVC which some sunscreens may not necessarily protect you from .
A good compromise would be to choose a product with SPF 15 or higher , and contain ingredients which block both the UVA and UVB rays from penetrating into your skin .
5 . “ The more expensive a skin care product is , the better it is for your skin . “
The so - called miracle ingredients that some products claim to have is usually just an excuse to increase their tag price .
This is where you ’re being a wise consumer should come in .
If you want to get the best products for your skin without having to pay an arm and a leg for it , you need to make a comparison of different brands .
For example , a moisturizing facial wash from one brand which contains a particular ingredient may be better for your skin as compared to another more expensive brand .
When testing out a new product , purchase smaller bottles first to check whether it will work for your skin type or not .
6 . “ If a skin care product claims to be natural , it should be 100 % good for my skin . “
First of all , there are no regulations in the market when it comes to using the term natural .
So even if it says natural in the bottle and the product contains just one herbal ingredient , they can still use the term as a marketing ploy .
More often than not , consumers lean towards the more natural products but what they do not know is that they are actually getting synthetic or chemical - based skin care products .
For this , it pays to do your research and check which natural ingredients will actually benefit the type of skin that you have .
7. “ Dermatologist - tested and hypoallergenic products will work well for any skin type . “
Again , do n’t ’ be fooled by the words dermatologist tested and hypoallergenic .
What causes allergies to one person may not necessarily have the same effect to another person – so the term hypoallergenic is quite vague .
What you need to do is be a keen observant about which products lead you to have breakouts or skin rashes – and steer clear of them .
At the end of the day , taking care of your skin is all a matter of choosing the right products and having a good skin care regimen that you can follow on a daily basis .
Now that you already know about the top myths about skin care and the truth behind them , you can make an informed decision about how to better care for your skin so that you can have that clear , smooth and flawless complexion that a lot of people are also aiming for .
— A lone gunman burst into a North Carolina nursing home Sunday morning and started " shooting everything , " barging into the rooms of terrified patients , sparing some from his rampage without explanation while killing seven residents and a nurse caring for them .
Authorities said Robert Stewart also wounded three others , including the Carthage police officer who confronted him in a hallway of Pinelake Health and Rehab and stopped the brutal attack .
" He acted in nothing short of a heroic way today , and but for his actions , we certainly could have had a worse tragedy , " said Moore County District Attorney Maureen Krueger .
" We had an officer , a well - trained officer , who performed his job the way he was supposed to and prevented this from getting even worse than it is now . "
By late Sunday afternoon , Krueger had charged Stewart , 45 , of Moore County , with eight counts of first - degree murder and a single charge of felony assault of a law enforcement officer .
Authorities offered few other details , allowing only that Stewart was not a patient or an employee at the nursing home and is n't believed to be related to any of the victims .
" I do n't know if the emotion entirely has set in , " said Police Chief Chris McKenzie , a Carthage native who said nothing in his nearly 20 - year law enforcement career compared to Sunday 's slaughter .
" It 's a small community built on faith , and faith will get us through . "
Authorities searched Stewart 's home , 2530 Glendon Carthage Road in Carthage , Sunday night .
While they declined to comment on a possible motive , Stewart 's ex-wife said he had violent tendencies .
Sue Griffin said she was married to Stewart for 15 years .
“ He would get mad because of things that did n't go his way .
He never really hurt me , but he would get mad and blow up , ” Griffin said .
Authorities said Stewart began his rampage around 10 a.m. at Pinelake Health and Rehab Center , 801 Pinehurst Ave. , a 110 - bed rehabilitation , nursing and Alzheimer 's care facility in Carthage .
It ended when 25 - year - old Officer Justin Garner traded gunfire with Stewart in a hallway , wounding the suspect .
" He just comes in and just starts shooting everything around , " said Sen .
Harris Blake , of Moore County , relating the story told by sheriff 's officials .
Garner was wounded in his leg , and police said Stewart wounded two others .
One person remained hospitalized Sunday night at FirstHealth Moore Regional Hospital in nearby Pinehurst , and police would only say Stewart was in the custody of the Moore County Sheriff .
Krueger said the victims were Pinelake residents Tessie Garner , 75 ; Lillian Dunn , 89 ; Jesse Musser , 88 ; Bessie Hedrick , 78 ; John Goldston , 78 ; Margaret Johnson , 89 ; Louise De Kler , 98 ; and nurse Jerry Avant Jr. , 39 .
“ All I heard was just that someone went in there and started shooting , ” said Jerry Avant , Jerry Avant Jr. ’s father .
Jerry Avant said doctors called his son a hero .
“ He saved a lot of lives before he went down , ” Jerry Avant said .
Tammy Clark 's mother was inside the nursing home when the rampage began .
" To my understanding , he was shooting at the residents and the workers , ” Clark said .
“ He went into the room and shot some of the people right there in their beds . "
Clark ’s mother was n't injured .
“ I do n't know if the emotion has entirely set in .
This is a small community based on faith , and faith will see us through , ” McKenzie said .
The facility was closed after the attack as authorities worked to gather evidence inside and out .
Krueger declined to say if authorities had moved the surviving residents , including patients with Alzheimer 's disease , saying only , " They 're safe , which is the primary thing . "
" It ’s very difficult .
We prepare for these types of situations all the time .
No one ever expects it to happen , ” said Emily Sloane , with FirstHealth Moore Regional Hospital .
" We wish to express our sincere concern and condolences for the victims and their families of this tragedy .
We are cooperating with the police investigation and will assist in any way that we can , " Pinelake Health and Rehab said in a statement Sunday evening .
Pinelake Health and Rehab was last inspected in May , and the review resulted in an overall five - star - or " much above average " - rating from federal Medicaid officials .
A nursing home Web site said the facility opened in 1993 and has 110 beds , including 20 for those with Alzheimer 's disease .
You know it is over when they laugh like that .
Most of the noise in the Chamber of the House of Commons is uncouth and childish ; it is also often manufactured , designed to harass and demoralise the other side .
But when Gordon Brown headed for the exit after Prime Minister 's Questions , and had to turn round , realising that he was supposed to making a statement about Afghanistan and Pakistan , the laughter from the opposition benches – and from some on the Government side – was genuine .
It was because it was genuine that it was so cruel .
The Prime Minister has lost his way .
He has lost his place in the script .
You know it is over when Nick Clegg cuts it as a figure of moral authority , and Brown is reduced to making up numbers such as £ 1.4bn as the cost of allowing all 36,000 Gurkhas the right to live here .
Even if it did come to £ 1.4bn , which is doubtful , why should we draw the line there , after £ 175bn of fiscal stimulus , on the one immigration issue on which even Empire loyalists are on the liberal side of the argument ?
Brown has lost the argument about the Gurkhas so comprehensively that David Cameron did not even need to rehearse his Mr Angry act .
He did Mr Bipartisan instead , congratulating Clegg for setting the pace on the issue .
It was a smart bit of tactical cross-party generosity that diminished Brown further .

No , you know it is over when BBC journalists start interviewing each other about how much the Prime Minister 's " authority " has been reduced .
They were at it this week over the withdrawal of Brown 's plan to reform MPs ' expenses .
They used to do it to Tony Blair when he was at bay over the cash for honours investigation , but they did n't laugh at him .
Blair was spared the added humiliation of YouTube ridicule .
You know it is over when black is reported as white .
When everything is fitted to the template of retreat , disarray and incompetence .
Just a small example from this week : David Blunkett , the former Home Secretary , repeated his ingenious plan to make identity cards more palatable by making it compulsory for everyone to have a passport .
This was reported as Blunkett , " the father of identity cards " , calling for the scheme to be scrapped .
We have been here before .
In fact , we have been here twice in living memory .
James Callaghan and John Major seemed similarly doomed , especially in retrospect , as they limped towards their conclusions – in Callaghan 's case 30 years ago this Sunday .
But Callaghan retained his dignity and not even Major cut so miserable a figure as Brown does now .
Those were " sea change " moments .
Although we should be wary of granting sly Sunny Jim the excuse that he was up against the inevitable : his observation that there are times when it " does not matter what you say or what you do " concealed his regret that he had not gone to the country the previous autumn when he could conceivably have held on against Margaret Thatcher .
There is always something you can do .
Major probably should have stood down , as he briefly consulted close colleagues about doing , immediately after the collapse of his ERM policy .
Michael Heseltine might have swashed some buckle and gone to the country .
Brown could stand down now , as even Paul Routledge , his formerly sympathetic biographer , suggested last week , and let someone else try to limit the Conservative gains at the election .
Routledge and I , who have not agreed on much for a decade and a half , agree that Alan Johnson is Labour 's best hope .
I think it is worth a try , from a Labour point of view , even if it succeeds only in cutting the Conservative majority – and the current state of the betting markets points to a majority for David Cameron of 62 .
Some Labour people do n't see the point .
Their unspoken belief is that the next election is a write - off , so the party might as well get used to a long period in the wilderness .
This is sea-change thinking , otherwise known as giving up .
My view is that it is worse than unwise ; it is a mistake .
It is based on a fallacy , namely that Labour will have been in office for 13 years and before that the Tories were in for 18 , so whoever wins the election will occupy Downing Street for a long stretch .
On the contrary , it seems more likely that we really are back to the Seventies , in the sense of alternating parties in government and inconclusive elections .
To be brutal , the next election is a good one to lose .
The state of the public finances is such that , if the Conservatives win , as Cameron told his party 's spring forum in Cheltenham on Sunday , they will be " in an age when we 're asking people to put up with tax rises and spending cuts to pay for Labour 's debt crisis " .
Note that he said tax rises and spending cuts , because I 'm not sure that his audience in the hall heard him .
When the Tory members find out – after , say , George Osborne 's third tax - raising Budget – they are not going to be pleased .
Nor will the British voters be .
Cameron can talk the New Labour talk of difficult choices but when it falls to him actually to make some we are not going to like it .
So it is quite possible that , if the Conservatives win next year 's election , they will be unpopular quite quickly .
It is not as if the electorate are even under any illusion , as they were when Blair came in with a 93 per cent approval rating , that Cameron represents a " new politics " .
Provided the Labour Party does not fall apart – and it is not divided by anything like the quasi-Marxism that afflicted it in 1981 or the issue of Europe that split the Tories after 1992 – general elections promise to be competitive again .
So things are bad for Brown , but this is not a sea change .
There is certainly nothing inevitable about a long period of Conservative government .
Indeed , we could be heading for a long period of hung parliaments .
Yesterday was the right day for Nick Clegg to shine .
John Rentoul is chief political commentator for The Independent on Sunday .

Opposition communications spokesman Nick Minchin and the shadow attorney - general , George Brandis , launched a joint attack on Senator Conroy today , calling his conduct " grossly improper " and accusing him of expressing a partisan view regarding potential evidence in iiNet 's defence .
They said the comments had the potential to " prejudice a matter before the Federal Court " .
iiNet 's lawyers , Herbert Geer , said they were " particularly surprised " by Senator Conroy 's comments , as the telco had not yet filed its defence and evidence on key aspects of the case .
" We hope that all parties will allow the legal process to run its course .
We 'll do our talking in court and allow iiNet 's defence to be judged by the judiciary , " said partner Graham Phillips .
In response to the criticisms , Senator Conroy said : " Senator Minchin needs to get a sense of humour or , more importantly , a broadband policy . "
In a landmark case that will have far - reaching implications for ISPs and internet users , seven major movie studios and the Seven Network are suing iiNet in the Federal Court for allegedly allowing its users to download pirated movies and TV shows .
The case is set for a formal hearing about October .
" I saw iiNet 's defence in court under oath ... they had no idea their customers were downloading illegally music or movies .
Stunning defence , stunning defence , " Senator Conroy said .
" I thought a defence in terms of ' we had no idea ' ... belongs in a Yes Minister episode . "
Phillips said the case involved complex facts and evidence , and complicated legal issues , which had not been tested before the courts .
He said he was confident that iiNet had a strong defence .
' Senator Conroy 's comments were both reckless and irresponsible ; particularly considering iiNet was yet to even file that aspect of its defence and has every right to a fair hearing , " Senator Minchin said .
Senator Brandis said : " A senior Cabinet Minister of all people should know better .
It is totally unacceptable and could prejudice a matter before the court and damage the company 's reputation in the eyes of the public . "
With rumours that the Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , will reshuffle his ministry after the budget , Senator Conroy , whose internet filtering and national broadband network policies are in disarray , may be vulnerable .
Furthermore , Senator Conroy was one of 39 Labor MPs who voted against Rudd in his leadership battle with Kim Beazley .
iiNet has said in court the case brought by the movie studios was " like suing the electricity company for things people do with their electricity " .
In court last week , the telco steadfastly refused to admit that any of its users engaged in illegal downloading , despite forensic evidence presented by movie studios that apparently shows the date and time of thousands of individual copyright infringements .
They foreshadowed possible arguments that infringements did not occur , by questioning whether transferring files over BitTorrent on a " one - to - one " basis was equivalent to making them " available to the public " under copyright law .
They also claimed that , because files are broken up into tiny " packets " before being sent over BitTorrent , this may not be enough to suggest a " substantial portion " of a copyrighted file was distributed .
Gilbert and Tobin , which is representing the movie studios in the case , declined to comment on Senator Conroy 's remarks .
It is not at all unusual for European royal families to have bloodlines and names from foreign nations .
After all , it was common for European dynasties over the centuries to use marriage as a political tool for empire - building .
The Austrian Habsburgs even boasted of their talent in this regard : " Let others wage war ; you , happy Austria , marry . " * ( See Austria Today for more . )
But few people are aware of how recent the British royal family name " Windsor " is , or that it replaced very German names .
* The Habsburg saying in Latin and German : " Bella gerant alii , tu felix Austria nube . " - " Laßt andere Krieg führen , Du , glückliches Österreich , heirate . "
The House of Windsor
The Windsor name now used by Queen Elizabeth II and other British royals only dates back to 1917 .
Before that the British royal family bore the German name Saxe - Coburg - Gotha ( Sachsen - Coburg und Gotha in German ) .
Why the Drastic Name Change ?
The answer to that question is simple : World War I. Since August 1914 Britain had been at war with Germany .
Anything German had a bad connotation , including the German name Saxe - Coburg - Gotha .
Not only that , Germany 's Kaiser Wilhelm was a cousin of the British king .
So on July 17 , 1917 , to prove his loyalty to England , Queen Victoria 's grandson King George V officially declared that " all descendants in the male line of Queen Victoria , who are subjects of these realms , other than female descendants who marry or who have married , shall bear the name Windsor . "
Thus the king himself , who was a member of the House of Saxe - Coburg - Gotha , changed his own name and that of his wife , Queen Mary , and their children to Windsor .
The new English name Windsor was taken from one of the king 's castles . )
Queen Elizabeth II confirmed the royal Windsor name in a declaration following her accession in 1952 .
But in 1960 Queen Elizabeth II and her husband Prince Philip announced yet another name change .
Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark , whose mother had been Alice of Battenberg , had already Anglicized his name to Philip Mountbatten when he married Elizabeth in 1947 .
( Interestingly , all four of Philip 's sisters , all now deceased , married Germans . )
In her 1960 declaration to the Privy Council , the Queen expressed her wish that her children by Philip ( other than those in line for the throne ) would henceforth bear the hyphenated name Mountbatten - Windsor .
The royal family 's name remained Windsor .
Queen Victoria and the Saxe - Coburg - Gotha Line
The British House of Saxe - Coburg - Gotha ( Sachsen - Coburg und Gotha ) began with Queen Victoria 's marriage to the German Prince Albert of Sachsen - Coburg und Gotha in 1840 .
Prince Albert ( 1819 - 1861 ) was also responsible for the introduction of German Christmas customs ( including the Christmas tree ) in England .
The British royal family still celebrates Christmas on December 24th rather than on Christmas Day , as is normal English custom .
Queen Victoria 's eldest daughter , the Princess Royal Victoria , also married a German prince in 1858 .
Prince Philip is a direct descendant of Queen Victoria through her daughter Princess Alice , who married another German , Ludwig IV , Duke of Hesse and by Rhine .
Victoria 's son , King Edward VII ( Albert Edward , " Bertie " ) , was the first and only British monarch who was a member of the House of Saxe - Coburg - Gotha .
He ascended to the throne at the age of 59 when Victoria died in 1901 .
" Bertie " reigned for nine years until his death in 1910 .
His son George Frederick Ernest Albert ( 1865 -1936 ) became King George V , the man who renamed his line Windsor .
The Hanoverians ( Hannoveraner )
Six British monarchs , including Queen Victoria and the infamous King George III during the American Revolution , were members of the German House of Hanover :
George I ( ruled 1714 - 1727 )
George II ( ruled 1727 - 1760 )
George III ( ruled 1760 - 1820 )
George IV ( ruled 1820 - 1830 )
William IV ( ruled 1830 - 1837 )
Victoria ( ruled 1837 -1901 )
Before becoming the first British king of the Hanoverian line in 1714 , George I ( who spoke more German than English ) had been the Duke of Brunswick - Lüneberg ( der Herzog von Braunschweig - Lüneberg ) .
The first three royal Georges in the House of Hannover ( also known as the House of Brunswick , Hanover Line ) were also electors and dukes of Brunswick - Lüneberg .
Between 1814 and 1837 the British monarch was also the king of Hanover , then a kingdom in what is now Germany .
Hanover Trivia
New York City 's Hanover Square takes its name from the royal line , as does the Canadian province of New Brunswick , and several " Hanover " communities in the U.S. and Canada .

Self - destructive greed is not good , especially self - destructive greed financed with public money .
In the wake of the nightmarish financial crisis that ’s stifling the economy today , those hurt by banks and warehouse lenders have a perfectly legitimate desire to point their fingers in blame .
While it ’s true that many Americans spent well beyond their means , taking toxic mortgages and racking up giant debts financed by home equity loans , we have to ask what the banks were thinking when they were approving stated income loans for a customer with a credit score just a few ticks higher than rock bottom .
Greed is not always good and irrational greed hurts shareholders , customers and the economy at large .
The problem with excessive greed in business is that aggressively going after every dollar you see on the horizon just so you can get quick , short term gains , gets you to make decisions that will hurt your company in the long run .
An insatiable desire for loan origination fees lead to an industry built on what ’s called Pulsen Pen lending .
Got a pulse ?
Got a pen ?
You ’re approved for an adjustable rate $ 600,000 mortgage with no money down .
Income verification ?
Credit score ?
No , we ’ll be fine without seeing that .
Worse comes to worst , we just kick you out and sell the house when we foreclose and assume title .
Have a nice day and tell the next guy we ’re ready for him .
When I was working on my business degree , this is exactly what my professors warned us not to do if our companies did any lending for the sake of our long term business model .
Why ?
Making an enormous loan to someone with no money is like throwing all that cash out the window .
What stockholders and investors want to see is steady , consistent growth over a long period of time .
What they ’ve been getting for the last 40 years or so is enormous short term gains which take a massive hit when the bubble that generated them bursts .
You ’re a millionaire today , in a week , you ’re in debt , your IRA is more like an IOU and your 401k is worth $ 4.01 without a “ k ” in sight .
And the funny thing about all this is how the people who have to weather the storm react to this kind of roller coaster ride .
They do n’t like it .
They want some safeguards .
It makes them mad when banks lend money they ’ve deposited into bad loans and close their doors .
And they are n’t too fond of their financial advisers doing anything to make a dollar , then loosing it all on a bad bet .
Kinda ruins their day .
Or a few years .
They want to make sure that when companies are reckless with their money and their safety , they have a way of getting retribution .
But believe it or not , there are people who oppose the idea of basic safeguards to keep a check on the economy with all their being .
In their minds , greed is downright holy , every man should be for himself and any interference in someone ’s God - given right to make a dollar or two with no regard for the future or those around him is tantamount to one of the seven deadly sins .
In fact , if they could , they ’d make it the eighth .
Gluttony , lust , envy , regulation , sloth , etc , etc .
They constantly invoke the USSR ( something that grates on me to no end since I ’m a native of what ’s been affectionately called the Evil Empire during the Cold War ) and maintain that the forces of the free market work in mysterious ways , but it ’s always for the better and everything will turn out in the best possible way when greed is given free reign .
Free markets to them are like God to devoted theists .
They can do no wrong and they always know best .
This train of thought is a product of the Cold War .
I ’ve written before on a few major misconceptions about the way things worked in the USSR .
Rather than practice communism or any form of social welfare , the Soviet Union was a kleptocracy .
People were used as a tools for government enterprises owned and maintained by the power players of the Party .
With cheery speeches about brotherhood of all humans and thinking about the collective rather than just oneself , Soviet leaders stole and used for their own benefit .
In its twilight years , when they ran out of things to steal but kept stealing by inertia , the nation was primed for an implosion .
In a few years , the people in power cashed out of the USSR and broke apart the union .
However , to those who hold free markets as their faith , this history does n’t matter .
They heard the USSR ’s claims to be a communist state , therefore all bad things must ’ve happened because there was constant government involvement in the economy .
Today , when banks run to the government to ask for cash despite labeling the slightest bit of regulation with the generic “ socialism ” smear , these people conveniently forget that it was the previous president who nationalized $ 5 trillion of loan obligations and gave the banks a blank check rather than make them face the music .
They also disregard that the banks themselves , in a totally un - free market way , asked the government to buy them out of their errors instead of taking their lumps , and proclaim that in today ’s crisis the government has become a tyrant hell bent on establishing a socialist utopia .
Whatever that means , as long as it has a negative or menacing connotation .
To them , the companies ca n’t be faulted .
The free markets are the light and the way and companies are their instruments .
To say that the companies in America enjoy a backwards form of socialism in which they use the government as an insurance policy which never fails to pay out , no matter how badly they mess up , is blasphemy to the followers of the free - markets - are - infallible dogma .
An Interview with Dr. Hatim Kanaaneh
Hatim Kanaaneh was an eleven year old boy when his peaceful village of Arrabeh , Galilee , was invaded by Jewish terrorists and the villagers forced to surrender in 1948 .
What followed was living under a military regime , which had absolute powers , a life filled with terror and humiliation , coupled with a curtailment of freedom and infringements on human rights .
Discrimination was evident in all aspects of everyday life , even in the education system , something Dr. Kanaaneh experienced first hand when he was denied entry to the Hadassah medical school because he was deemed to be unqualified .
He later attended Harvard and received his medical degrees , following which he returned to Galilee where he worked as a physician for thirty - five years .
He founded the Galilee Society for Health Research and Services , and also the Elrazi Center for Child Rehabilitation , the first such facility specifically designed to serve rural Palestinian children .
He is now retired from clinical practice but continues to be an active member of the Galilee Society and serves on the Board of Directors of Elrazi .
Dr. Kanaaneh ’s memoirs have been published in a book , A Doctor in Galilee : The Life and Struggles of a Palestinian in Israel , ( Pluto Press , June 20 , 2008 ) , which gives readers an in - depth look at the struggles he , and the Palestinian minority in the Jewish state , have faced over the last 60 years , and which they continue to face .
His first - hand experience of life inside Israel contrasts with ex-US President Jimmy Carter ’s contention that the term “ Apartheid ” only applies to Israeli practices in the Occupied West Bank and Gaza .
I spoke with him via e-mail .
Angie Tibbs : Dr. Kanaaneh , it ’s been almost 61 years since Arrabeh was forced to surrender to Jewish terrorists .
What is life like today , not just for the people of Arrabeh , but for all Palestinians who are living inside what is called Israel ?
Dr. Kanaaneh : A prime feature of our life is our imposed separate residential areas , separate towns and villages .
Even in so - called mixed cities  some Arab slums are separated by concrete walls and barbwire from the better - off Jewish neighborhoods .
Our communities , with one or two exceptions , fall in the bottom three centile rungs in the socio-economic grading of Israeli communities .
AT : Tell me about that .
Dr. K : Our towns and villages have fewer internal resources , be it industry , commerce , tourism , or agriculture .
And they receive much less financial assistance from common central budgets , only 3 - 5 % of the total .
Sixty - one years after the establishment of the state , one has to be blind not to see the physical differences between an Arab town , even the best - off one , and a Jewish town : pot -holed roads without sidewalks , no public spaces , no private lawns , overcrowding , children playing in the streets for lack of playgrounds , and the list of signs of neglect is endless .
But these are only the physical symptoms .
At a deeper level we constitute an undesirable element , a foreign element in the body of a state whose planners and decision makers define it to exclude us .
Israeli Zionist Leaders have variously likened us to a cancer in the body of the state or a fifth column not to be trusted .
At best we are seen as a hindrance , a stumbling block for planners to maneuver around in formulating their visions of the future of the state .
At worse , we are a demographic ticking bomb to be dismantled at all costs .
The late Rabin was the most tolerant of Israeli leaders , accepting our presence up to a limit of twenty percent of the total population of Israel , a limit we have nearly reached now .
That kind of pronouncement by presumed liberal leaders of Israel is ready fodder for incitement by openly racist politicians , the likes of Avigdor Lieberman , an immigrant from Moldova , who legitimized and popularized the concept of transfer to where over two thirds of Israeli Jewish adults approve of it .
How do I feel living in such openly hostile socio-political environment ?
I feel quite insecure : mentally anguished and physically threatened .
I function with an ample reserve of paranoia , constantly on the lookout for signs of harmful intent behind every move by anyone outside my immediate circle of family and friends .
When I start doubting those , I will know that I have lost the fight .
AT : Progressive writers , Kim Petersen and B.J. Sabri , wrote a 12 - part series entitled “ Defining Israeli Zionist Racism ” which deals at length with racism inside Israel .
What , if any , discrimination and / or racism have you observed and / or encountered ?
Dr. K : Discrimination is a built - in part of life and the laws of the country .
Remember that what we are dealing with here ( and the basic issue of contention in the conflict between Zionism and all of us native Palestinians ) is a conflict over land .
As a Palestinian I am disqualified by law from equal access to land ownership or use .
This is given a deeper expression in the form of the Law of Return granting any Jewish person anywhere in the world automatic citizenship with all the benefits that accrue with it of access to land , housing , financial and social assistance , and to the symbols of the state while no Palestinian who is not born here can dream of ever becoming a citizen .
Recently laws were passed specifically to prevent our children from marrying other Palestinians and from the right to bring their spouses under the standing laws of family unification applicable to Jewish citizens .
The absolute majority of land we , the Palestinian citizens of the state of Israel since its establishment in 1948 , once owned has been confiscated for the benefit of our Jewish co-citizens through a maze of some three dozen laws specifically designed for the purpose .
Were it not for the 1976 uprising that has come since to be commemorated as Land Day , we would have lost the remainder .
We , nearly one - fifth of the total population of Israel , now own about 3 % of its land .
After all , we are dealing with what has been defined by Zionism as  the land of Israel in an ethnic sense , a definition that excludes us , Palestinians .
The last stroke in the continuing saga of disenfranchisement is the requirement from us to pledge allegiance to Israel as the state of the Jews .
And once we take such an oath , it would be up to the same racist crowd to define what constitutes a breach of it , a process inevitably leading to our expulsion one way or the other .
Beyond such basic discriminatory laws the whole official system and all Zionist civilian structures , many of which are legally entrusted with state - level powers and duties , are imbued with a sense of messianic zeal .
Our experience with such bodies is not unlike a preview of the current practices in the Palestinian Occupied Territories where Palestinians are not allowed to drive on roads for settlers .
The multitude of new settlements , named ‘ Mitzpim ’ , or hilltop lookouts , are intended to guard the land in Galilee from us , its indigenous population , and they are surrounded by barbwire and interconnected by special roads that bypass our villages .
True , we were not prevented from using those roads , but they were of little use to us because they led only to the various settlements .
At the practical level this translates into set rules and regulations that exempt Palestinians like me from all sorts of benefits if they are not openly anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian .
Much of this is practiced under the blanket justification of security , the holiest of all holy cows in the country .
AT : What about employment opportunities for Palestinians , in particular , young people ?
Dr. K : A psychologist colleague just informed me that he had gone through two years of theoretical and practical training as a lie - detector expert / operator before he found out that one needs to have served in the Israeli armed forces to qualify for a license .
Our youth , unlike Jewish youth , are exempt from the draft .
Positions from which they are disqualified on this basis when they seek employment run the gamut from civil aviation all the way down to the manufacturing of ice - cream .
The worst part of the daily discrimination that we meet with is the fact that much of the final decisions on so many little items are left to the discretion of low - level bureaucrats .
These , by and large , have been brought up on a deeply self - centered world - view that sees the world as one of constant struggle between us - the Jews and them - the Goyim and considers ones duty as serving his own people .
This , of course , leaves me out of  the favors  many officials consider it their duty to do their clients .
Intentional obstructionism is more often what we face .
Another area in which this phenomenon is evident is the differential implementation of the law .
Take , for example , the practice of house demolition within Israel .
Mind you , we are not speaking here of the savage collective punishment practiced by the Israeli occupying forces against Palestinians in the Occupied Territories .
We are speaking of the practice of demolition of homes built without permit within Israel proper .
In absolute numbers there are more illegally constructed structures in Jewish communities , but the demolition is practiced almost exclusively against Arab home owners .
The basis for the construction of homes without permit is also rooted in discriminatory practices in the laws of zoning which in many cases have retroactively criminalized all residents of many villages whose existence predated the state , itself .
Such “ Unrecognized Villages ” are frequently the site of home demolitions .
The cumulative end result of all the openly discriminatory laws , the hidden disadvantages , and the differential application of the rules and regulations are clearly seen in comparative figures from officially published data of the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics .
As a Public Health practitioner I can point to the single most telling indicator of the well - being of a community , that of Infant Mortality Rate , or the number out of a thousand infants born in a certain year who die before their first birthday .
This statistic regarding the most vulnerable segment of a population reflects such community attributes as the income level , the level of education , the sanitation , etc. etc .
The relative ratio of the IMR between Arabs and Jews in Israel has run at the level of almost exactly 2 since ever statistics were collected on both groups .
In the last decade it has been on the rise , a reflection of increasing discrimination .
One could look at many other statistics such as the level of poverty , education , housing , etc. and the gap is obvious , but IMR sums it up best .
AT : Do you see East Jerusalem being annexed completely by Israel , and , if so , what will happen to the Palestinians living where they have lived for millennia although the land has been rechristened Israel ?
Dr. K : Jerusalem has already been unilaterally and completely annexed by Israel .
What many people do not realize is that the citys municipal boundaries have been expanded tremendously since its annexation to include many formerly independent Arab communities as well as some pristine wilderness turned into housing projects .
Generous funding from Jewish communities around the world and from Western governments made this possible .
Yet part of the overall plan is to render the expanded city the Jewish - only capital of the state and of world Jewry .
The residents of the old city of about 300,000 Palestinians were granted residence status but not full citizenship in Israel .
They are slowly but constantly coerced by various means , legal and otherwise , to evacuate their Jerusalem homes and neighborhoods .
AT : How do Palestinians living in Israel view the ongoing Israeli attacks on their kin in Gaza and the West Bank ?
Dr. K :
At the personal level I can answer that best by referring you and your audience to my blog where the attack on Gaza featured in more than one posting .
To sum that up I can testify to a sense of anger , frustration and impending danger .
The daily scenes of war atrocities and destruction are enough to move the conscience of anyone with a morsel of humanity .
When the violence is visited on ones own brethren and next of kin the effect is doubly infuriating .
As a community we reacted by withdrawing into self - imposed isolation in our villages and slum neighborhoods in the cities .
There was also an outpouring of donations of food , clothing and medicine though little if any was permitted to enter Gaza .
More important , perhaps , were the daily demonstrations in our communities against the carnage , a way for our youth to vent their anger in non-violent ways .
Psychologically , a common theme I have heard expressed by many individuals around me is the fear for our own future .
AT : How so ?
Dr. K :
The worst case scenario we fear is of the world averting its eyes from our suffering and allowing Israel one day to drive us out of our homes under an imposed news blackout when the next war breaks out with a neighboring country , say , Syria or Lebanon .
If the world could sit still and not be moved to protect our brothers and sisters in Gaza from the white phosphorous and DIME bombardments and from the endless air , sea and land assault against them , why would it lift a finger to protect us from summary expulsion from our homes ?
And such contingency plans for our expulsion are known to exist .
In recent weeks the plot of such conspiratorial theories has thickened even further :
In recent years drugs have slowly become available on our streets with little interference from the police .
More recently guns and live munitions have become easily available to our youth and the police seem to keep its eyes closed .
Older and wiser members of our community theorize that this is done consciously in preparation for the final assault so that the Israeli authorities can claim that an armed uprising is brewing in our community and this would be enough of an excuse for calling in the tanks , the F - 16s and the Apaches .
I cite this only as an example of the degree our paranoia has reached as a result of the attack on Gaza .
AT : You mentioned a very real fear is that the world will turn a blind eye to your suffering and allow Israel to one day drive you out of your homes .
Who do you see as the strongest supporters of the Palestinian people in their struggle ?
Dr. K :
At the official level few countries , with the exception of Iran and of South American nations recently liberated form the clutches of USA hegemony , such as Chavez ’ Venezuela , openly support the Palestinian people .
None of the world ’s heavy weights stands behind us .
At the individual level , again , few in the world are informed and concerned enough to give our issues much thought .
That leaves the fringe activist community in Europe and North America as our best defenders in the corridors of effective power brokerage .
Potentially , the Arab and Islamic masses are a shoo - in as our back - up crowd , but they lack the freedom and democratic means to pressure their dictator presidents , kings and emirs to respond to their wishes .
Their countries  governments mostly follow the straight and narrow path dictated by their American allies with their a priori acceptance of all things Israeli .
In the end , we Palestinians , inside and outside historical Palestine , are left burdened with the task of pulling ourselves up by our own bootstraps ; we are our own best spokespeople and supporters .
Despite our spacial dispersal , internal factionalism and disunity , we have so far managed to put our issues on the worlds agenda , albeit belatedly and haltingly .
Our resilience and stoicism have proven to be valuable assets in a less - than - caring world .
The Jewish people have elevated their past suffering and future potential to axiomatic heights in the world ’s conscience .
It is now our turn .
AT : What do you see happening in the future with respect to Palestinians living in Israel ?
Are you anticipating any improvement or do you expect things to get worse ?
Dr. K :
It is likely to get worse before it gets better .
In the long run , I remain optimistic that general decency and common sense will triumph .
The democratic and Jewish state that Israel declares itself to be is an oxymoron by definition .
I see it as a three - piece puzzle that has space for only two .
One part has to go .
So far the Zionist system in Israel has skimped on democracy and successfully hidden the way it has disenfranchised a fifth of its population from the international community .
That is no longer possible especially with the rise of civil society organizations and the advent of the Internet .
Also , I do sense a new readiness in the West , and specifically in the USA , to listen to an alternative discourse coming from quarters other than the standard pro-Israel lobby , even if it is still very reluctant to change its stand on minor matters  such as the issue at hand .
Rightists in Israel who make up the clear majority in Israel have expressed their views clearly in our last elections .
Such leaders as the new Israeli Foreign Minister , Avigdor Lieberman , seem to share my analysis of the three - piece puzzle .
The only difference is that they plan on throwing the Palestinian minority out and thus maintaining a truly Jewish and democratic Israel .
I am gambling on their failure and betting on the commitment of the majority of humanity to justice and equality .
In taking such a risk I am counting heavily on the promising views of President Obama , for example .
It may not happen in my lifetime , but I foresee the eventual decline of fascism and fanaticism in the world , including in our region , and the rise of secular humanitarian views and solutions to common problems .
I know many decent people around me , both Jewish and Palestinian , and I would like to think that our shared humanity and decency are slowly contagious .
If good people like you keep the world alert to the short - range dangers and help us avoid a calamitous quick end of our combined dreams through the actions of the Liebermens and Netanyahus , then the rise of true democracy in Israel can be expected .
This will ultimately be the nucleus of the one - state solution for Palestine and Israel .
AT : Thank you very much , Dr. Kanaaneh .

A ban on restaurants using staff tips to make up wages to the legal minimum could be delayed after the hospitality industry claimed the move could put jobs at risk .
Ministers promised last year to change the law so that staff in restaurants , hotels and bars would no longer have to rely on customers ' generosity to make up their pay packets to minimum - wage level .
The move followed a union campaign warning diners that tips left for staff in some well known high - street chains were being used by managers to make up basic wages .
However the British Hospitality Association ( BHA ) has told the Department for Business that if the change is introduced in October , as planned , it would come at the worst possible time for restaurants already struggling with falling takings .
Whitehall sources said there were serious questions over whether it could be introduced in the current climate .
The BHA says it estimates about 6,000 jobs could be lost directly if the law was changed , while more jobs would be lost as businesses cut hours or posts to cover the cost of an enforced pay rise : " We do n't think this is the right time to introduce any new legislation that would cost millions . "
A Department for Business spokesman said a final decision would be announced next month .
The decision is likely to be announced shortly before a review of the minimum wage itself is published .
Employers have called for it to be frozen this year .
Ross : Recession to Last Until 2010
“ I think there are some parts about ( the stimulus package ) that are good .
I think though it ’s not going to be a silver bullet that solves everything in a very short order .
Even the tax things are going to take some months to start , then they come in very gradually over time .
The infrastructure things come in certainly very slowly over time …
I think it ’s a good idea , but it ’s going to take a while , so to me the earliest anything good will happen is sometime in 2010 . ”
He also suggested the government 's mortgage plan for stemming foreclosures should be broadened .
Principal reduction options should be available for both performing and non-performing mortgages , he intimated .
Dozens of police departments throughout Los Angeles County routinely have not tested DNA evidence collected in rape and sexual assault cases , and are unable to accurately account for thousands of pieces of evidence that could potentially help solve crimes , according to a report to be released today .
The county ’s two behemoth law enforcement agencies -- the Los Angeles Police Department and the Sheriff ’s Department -- have come under harsh criticism in recent months for not testing about 10,000 samples of semen , saliva and other genetic material gathered from victims ’ bodies after alleged attacks and for letting legal time limits pass on hundreds of cases .
The report , produced by the independent group Human Rights Watch , found that the other 47 police agencies in the county are struggling with the same problems .
Rape victims “ have a right to expect police to do all they can to thoroughly investigate their case , but in L.A. [ County ] they often feel betrayed to learn that their rape kits are never even tested , ” said Sarah Tofte , the report ’s author .
“ And in some cases , failure to test means that a rapist who could have been arrested will remain free . ”
In all , the outlying police departments , which rely on the county ’s crime laboratory for DNA testing without charge , were found to have nearly 2,750 of the so - called rape kits sitting untested in storage freezers -- some more than two decades old .
The agencies were also estimated to have destroyed about 1,500 other kits after determining the evidence was no longer of use , the report found .
Advertisement
Gail Abarbanel , director of the Rape Treatment Center at the Santa Monica - UCLA Medical Center , expressed dismay at Tofte ’s findings .
“ It ’s shocking , ” she said .
“ The disregard for this evidence and the reluctance to use it in cases reflects the deep and really troubling level of discrimination that persists against victims of rape . ”
Officials from several of the police departments challenged the way Tofte construed the figures , which the agencies provided in response to her requests made under the state ’s Public Records Act .
The Long Beach Police Department , for example -- which is by far the largest of the 47 agencies surveyed -- failed to test more than half of the 1,900 evidence kits it has booked into storage since 1995 , according to the report .
Long Beach Deputy Chief William Blair , however , said that what Tofte presented as the number of untested kits there was actually the total number of kits -- tested and untested -- in storage .
Advertisement
“ The conclusions that the report draws do not tell the true story , ” he said .
Blair and officials at other agencies say the confusion is due , in large part , to outdated and inept evidence - tracking computer systems that provide no clear account of which kits have been tested , how long they have been in storage or the status of the rape cases for which the samples were collected .
As the LAPD and Sheriff ’s Department did after coming under scrutiny , Blair said Long Beach police had begun a manual audit of each evidence kit .
He said he was “ confident ” that the audit would not turn up any cases in which detectives had no suspects and had failed to have DNA evidence tested .
Sheriff ’s officials had made similar assurances under questioning from the county Board of Supervisors , but later had to backtrack when they discovered more than 800 such cases .
Tofte questioned why police departments would provide data without being certain of the accuracy .
Advertisement
“ It gets directly to the question of how much they care about this issue .
If they were willing to just throw out some numbers that may or may not be true , then that ’s disconcerting , ” she said .
“ I did n’t find one agency that was already tracking these issues when I asked , ” she added .
“ This is the kind of thing that they should really already have had a handle on . ”
Many agencies either refused to respond to her request for information or were unable to compile the figures .
Despite 154 rapes having been reported since 1995 , police in Bell Gardens did not say how many evidence kits were untested and how many had been destroyed .
In the report , Tofte urged the small agencies to follow the LAPD and Sheriff ’s Department , which recently changed their policies to test every evidence kit collected , instead of waiting for detectives on cases to request DNA analysis .

Unexamined kits hold potentially crucial information .
DNA analysts can extract a person ’s genetic code from the collected samples and compare it to those of known felons or to a suspect ’s code .

No lamp for you , deal with it ! [ PIC ]
Of course she has been excoriated by feminists for saying that much marital disharmony might be overcome if women just " put the canoe in the water " and start paddling , even if they do n't feel like it .
" Bettina Arndt rape cheerleader " was one furious blog response .
" F--- you , Bettina Arndt , " was another .
Eva Cox of the Women 's Electoral Lobby launched a counterattack , claiming that it 's men's own fault they are n't getting enough sex , because they do n't do their fair share of housework .
" After an evening of organising kids , dinner , the shopping , the washing , the homework , etc , maybe [ women ] are too tired to want sex . "
It 's an old excuse .
As Arndt says , any time men complain about something , even in the anonymity of a sex therapist 's book , feminists hit back with the housework furphy .
The fact is , when you add up in - home and out - of - home duties , men work just as many hours as women , and sex has very little to do with it .
The latest ABS social trends survey , released last week , found that women do almost twice as much housework as men - 33 hours and 45 minutes a week .
But while men might not do as much vacuuming and ironing , they spend a lot more time than women working outside the house in paid jobs - an average of 31 hours and 50 minutes a week , compared with women 's 16 hours and 25 minutes .
In other words , men and women do about the same amount of work in total - about 50 hours a week each .
It 's called division of labour and it has long been the negotiated settlement of marriage .
Men have tried to up their share of housework - by 8 per cent - since 1992 .
But it does n't seem to have increased their share of sex , judging by The Sex Diaries .
In her chapter " Laundry Gets You Laid ? " , one of Arndt 's diarists describes her husband as the " domestic God " , yet their libidos are still worlds apart .
Another diarist , Mary , 42 , has put her husband on sex " starvation rations " until he does more housework .
But , she admitted : " [ My husband ] argues that even if I were a lady of leisure with a maid and housekeeper and no need to work … I still would n't be interested in sex .
I deny deny and deny , but deep inside I have to admit there is a chance he might be right . "
Housework is just one of the excuses used by women to fend off their partner 's advances .
Only 10 per cent of Arndt 's female diarists had higher sex drives than their partners and her book is full of the anguish of the other men , whose wives have just lost interest .
Arndt said yesterday that female libido is so fragile it is easy to find excuses not to have sex .
But desire is a decision .
Women " have to make a decision to put sex back on the to - do list because if you allow these other things to swamp your sexual interest your relationship will be in real trouble " .
Of course , " resentment is a passion killer " , and unequal share of household duties has long been high on a woman 's list of resentments .
" But it strikes me as being so unfair that women feel entitled to voice their complaints and demands of a relationship , yet a lot of men have at the absolute top of their wants and needs more sex and it's been totally ignored .
" How can we justify simply shutting up shop or forcing a man into a life spent grovelling for sex ? "
The picture Arndt gets from her male sex diarists is in large part a lament for love denied .
They love their wives but desperately need the intimacy they used to have .
They feel cheated .
" I am totally at a loss as to what to do , " writes Andrew , a 41 - year - old diarist , married for six years , with two children .
He and his wife used to have sex every day but are down to once every five or six months .
" I do love her and I think she loves me but I can not live like a monk .
" What makes women think that halfway through the game they can change the rules to suit themselves and expect the male to take it ? "
Arndt is not suggesting women have sex against their will , but to heed new research that shows they may still enjoy sex even if they did n't crave it in the first place .
Mismatched desire need not spell the end of a couple 's sex life .
The other side of the equation is women 's guilt at their own lower sex drive .
Understanding that male and female sex drives are different was the key to rapprochement in the bedroom , she said .
" It 's all about walking in each other 's shoes .
Most of the women are upset that they do n't want sex .
It 's not a deliberate thing … but we have to find a way around it if we have marriages lasting 40 years . "
Since the book was published , Arndt has been inundated with emails and messages from frustrated men .
Loading
But she has also touched a nerve with women .
The day after Arndt appeared on the ABC's Lateline to promote her book , a friend told her that every woman in her tuckshop group had sex with their husbands .
Tim Geithner says :
tg - 94 : Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner Written Testimony : Congressional Oversight Panel : Currently , the vast majority of banks have more capital than they need to be considered well capitalized by their regulators ...
I know that I was not pleased to hear that .
The failure to assure us that the vast majority of bank assets are in well - capitalized institutions seemed to me to speak volumes .
Nobody ever thought that the vast majority of banks are not well capitalized - - it 's the highly leveraged New York high flyers .
Yet the market liked it .

Sometimes the name of a pub describes exactly what it is .
So it is with the Big Baobab Bar in Limpopo Province , South Africa .
The “ Baobab ” in the moniker refers to a type of tree that ’s native to Madagascar and found sprinkled throughout arid regions of southern Africa .
The genus is colloquially referred to as “ the upside down tree ” — in the dry season , when baobabs sheds its leafs , the branches resemble underground roots .
“ Big ” is an adjective that describes many baobabs .
The trees can grow to a massive size thanks to their remarkable ability to store water .
The particular baobab that ’s the subject of this article can store an estimated 120,000 liters ( 32,000 gallons ) of water .
It ’s 47 meters ( 154 feet ) in circumference — it would take 40 adults , with arms outstretched , to encircle it !
Botanists figure that the tree is more than 6,000 years old .
Unlike your typical deciduous tree that grows in seasonal concentric circles , baobabs grow in chunky spurts that often lead to hollow areas inside the tree .
Which brings us to the “ Bar ” of the Big Baobab Bar .
Back in 1933 , the owners of the Sunland Baobab Estate near Modjadjiskloof , South Africa noticed that one of the baobab trees on their property had a particularly large and interesting hollow area .
Being Dutch immigrants , they naturally decided to construct a pub inside .
It has been serving up drinks ever since .

The Big Baobab Bar comfortably accommodates around 15 patrons , though 54 ( probably inebriated ) adults once squeezed in for a party .
The bar has many of the trappings of a traditional European pub — draught beer , bar stools , a dartboard — except there are fewer hooligans and many more ants .
Coolest of all , literally , is the lower level of the interior tree cavern where the moisture and darkness naturally keep the beer cold .
In addition to the arboreal bar , the grounds of the Sunland Baobab Estate is also home to a treehouse restaurant and a budget resort .
See our planning box , below , for some details .

Planning your Big Baobab Bar visit Getting there : Driving is by far the easiest transportation option — it ’s about 3.5 hours from Johannesburg and 1 hour from the Phalaborwa Gate of the Kruger Park .
Coming on the main road from Polokwane , your turn - off will be about 6 km before Modjadjiskloof .
Look for the “ Sunland Nurseries ” sign .
Where to stay :
At the Sunland Baobab Estate guests sleep in A - frame bungalows ( or “ jungalows ” as they call them ) that , while comfortable , are far from luxurious .
Rates are R300 ( about US $ 28 ) per adult for self - catering or double that with three meals included .
There ’s a swimming pool on the grounds , as well as a bush spa and quad biking trails .
Family friendly ?
Absolutely !
Kids are welcome inside the Big Baobab Bar in particular and around the Sunland Estate in general .

The prototype engine for the GT was first built as a secret project for the FootWork Formula One team in 1992 .
Do n't worry , the Carrera in your neighbors garage probably is n't this one , another street - legal version was developed based on this design .
This sleek little car only had 1,270 ever produced .

You betcha ' !
The 6.5L engine makes 631 hp /471 kW .
The name Murcielago comes from the Spanish name for " bat " .
It 's a fitting name considering that it does look like a bat with its doors open .

For our latest mission , 30 Improv Everywhere agents found a random funeral in the obituary section of the newspaper and turned it into the best funeral ever .
We picked a man who had very few surviving relatives and then showed up to his funeral to make it truly awesome .
Enjoy the video first , and then continue reading for photos and our report .
I knew this would be a very sensitive subject , but I thought that if Improv Everywhere could spread a little joy to the saddest place of all , it would be an amazing feat .
The first step was picking the right funeral .
It was critical that the funeral would be very sparsely attended .
My biggest fear was showing up to do this and finding tons of friends and family already there .
I started scanning through the obituaries to find short entries that mentioned very few surviving relatives .
I also wanted to pick a graveside service because it would be easier to film and photograph it from a distance .
It would be too risky to try to sneak cameras into a funeral home or church .
Organizing with the agents
The funeral we picked was in Greenwood Cemetery , an enormous plot of land in Brooklyn .
( I ’m not going to list the name of the deceased to prevent the family from finding this via a Google search , but it was an 87 year old male . )
We met in a park a few blocks from the cemetery gate , and I briefed all of the agents , who had arrived dressed for a funeral .
I instructed everyone to be as realistic as possible and not to be too over the top .
I was very worried that the family would think we were making fun of them , which was the last thing we were trying to do .
I told everyone to just act like you would if it had been your grandfather who passed away and behave accordingly .
Agents walking through the cemetery
We headed over to the cemetery right when the funeral was supposed to begin .
We figured it was best to arrive just a few minutes late .
The family would n’t talk to us if the service was already underway .
They would just be silently comforted that lots more people showed up to honor their loved one .
The family before we arrive , only eight people
Our photographers ran ahead to snap some covert photos of the service before we arrived and to try to get the natural reactions of the family when the IE agents showed up .
They tried to be discreet , hiding behind tombstones , trees , and bushes with zoom lenses .
Sure enough , there were only eight people and a priest attending the funeral .
A pretty small funeral in need of some help
Luckily there was a huge bush right behind the priest .
Agent Nicholson was able to crawl into the bush and take photos head on without anyone seeing him .
Shot through the bushes
Our agents start arriving behind them !

Family looking around in wonder
Packed funeral !
Family members started whispering , “ Who are these people ? ”
Agent Adams films covertly from the side of the bush
The family , especially the older couple in the middle , were seriously mourning .
They seemed to be focusing on the priest and mostly ignoring us .
Still , we had to be as serious as we possibly could .
If anyone cracked a smile or giggled we would completely ruin the funeral for the family .
One family member , who looked like he might have been a grandson of the deceased , got up and asked Agent Simmons what was going on and where we came from .
He definitely seemed confused , and maybe slightly irritated at first .
Agent Simmons just told him we were old friends of the deceased here to pay our respects .

Agents Wimpy and Cunningham walk to the front with flowers
Towards the end of the service , the priest discovered that Agent Nicholson was hiding in the bushes with a camera .
I guess cameras are not usually allowed at funerals , because he was not happy .
He kept his calm because of the circumstances , but he made it very clear that Agent Nicholson needed to leave immediately .
We found other ways to keep documenting the mission .
Agent Spear snapped a few covert shots with his cell phone .
As soon as the service was over , our agents disappeared as quickly as they had arrived .
We never broke character and never let the family know that we did n’t actually know the deceased .
Agents quietly leaving
The family members were left clueless as to who we were .
They gawked as we walked away .
Deep down though , you know they were profoundly moved to learn that their relative had so many friends .
One of the family members chased down some of our camera men and tried to get an answer .
Agent Adams stuck to his story and told him that he was just a tourist visiting the cemetery ( it ’s a National Historic Landmark after all ! ) , and that he did n’t know any of the other agents .
It was definitely creepy being in the cemetery , and it did feel weird staging something at a funeral , but ultimately I think everyone had a great time .
Obviously the family was sad that someone they loved had passed away , but think how much sadder they would have been if only eight people had been there .
Mission Accomplished .

SAN FRANCISCO 
On Monday , somewhere in New York City , 420 people will gather for High Times magazine ’s annual beauty pageant , a secretly located and sold - out event that its sponsor says will “ turn the Big Apple into the Baked Apple and help us usher in a new era of marijuana freedom in America . ”
They will not be the only ones partaking : April 20 has long been an unofficial day of celebration for marijuana fans , an occasion for campus smoke - outs , concerts and cannabis festivals .
But some advocates of legal marijuana say this year ’s “ high holiday ” carries extra significance as they sense increasing momentum toward acceptance of the drug , either as medicine or entertainment .
“ It is the biggest moment yet , ” said Ethan Nadelmann , the founder and executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance in Washington , who cited several national polls showing growing support for legalization .
“ There ’s a sense that the notion of legalizing marijuana is starting to cross the fringes into mainstream debate . ”
For Mr. Nadelmann and others like him , the signs of change are everywhere , from the nation ’s statehouses  where more than a dozen legislatures have taken up measures to allow some medical use of marijuana or some easing of penalties for recreational use  to its swimming pools , where an admission of marijuana use by the Olympic gold medalist Michael Phelps was largely forgiven with a shrug .
Signs were posted at several shorelines and parks in Richmond , Calif. , warning that water might be contaminated with harmful bacteria after nearly 1 million gallons of runoff and raw sewage overflowed and spilled into San Francisco Bay .
Sunday 's rainstorm flooded into cracks and leaks in the city 's sewer collection system and overwhelmed the capacity of a sewage treatment plant , causing an estimated 890,000 gallons of untreated water to spill out of the sewer system near the Richmond marina .
The company that runs Richmond 's sewer system estimated that the water was 90 percent stormwater and 10 percent raw sewage , a figure that state water quality regulators did not dispute .
Keller Beach , Brickyard Cove , Miller / Knox Regional Shoreline , Sheridan Point , Vincent Park , Shimada Friendship Park , and Point Isabel were all posted with the warnings , said Sherman Quinlan , Contra Costa County 's director of environmental health .
Quinlan added that the sewage was highly diluted by rain and water in the Bay and probably does not pose much of a health threat .
" I strongly believe the impact is minimal , " Quinlan said .
The warnings are expected to be lifted after test results show safe levels of bacteria .
Sewage spills during heavy rain are common in much of the Bay Area .
Old , leaky pipes take in more rainwater than the systems can handle .
The company that operates Richmond 's sewer system disputed the characterization of the event as a spill .
" A spill implies a preventable event , " said Mark Grushayev , program manager for Veolia Water .
" This is an overflow .
The system is designed to overflow to the Bay instead of to the streets and houses . "
State water quality regulators , who have the authority to issue fines , said they were investigating .
" We 're looking into the spill and collecting information , " said Gina Kathuria , a senior engineer at the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board .
Also during the storm , an East Bay Municipal Utility District wet weather station at Point Isabel discharged 2.3 million gallons of sewage into San Francisco Bay .
That station collects , screens and disinfects overflow before removing chlorine and sending it into the Bay , said EBMUD wastewater director David Williams .
Williams said that until last month , the Oakland - based utility was not required to report such discharges if the wastewater was successfully screened and disinfected .
But a legal settlement reached last month requires the district to come up with a plan to eliminate the partially treated discharges and to report them .

Explore further Rio Olympic water badly polluted , even far offshore
The Colorado River is a critical source of water for seven Western states , each of which gets an annual allotment according to a system that has sparked conflict and controversy for decades .
But in an era of climate change , even greater difficulties loom .
The scope of those potential problems is detailed in a study being published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Tim P. Barnett and David W. Pierce of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography report that under various forecasts of the effects of warming temperatures on runoff into the Colorado , scheduled future water deliveries to the seven states are not sustainable .
The work builds on an earlier study by the researchers that looked at whether Lake Mead , the huge reservoir behind Hoover Dam , would eventually go dry .
For the current study , they tweaked their model of river inflows and outflows and looked at the delivery shortfalls that would be needed to keep Lake Mead at the lowest functioning level .
The modifications in the model “ did n’t really change any of our answers , ” Dr. Barnett said .
“ It just made the study a lot stronger . ”
The study found that , with a 20 percent reduction in runoff , by 2050 nearly 9 of every 10 scheduled deliveries would be missed .
But the problem may be even worse , because the allotments were determined in the 20th century , when , according to tree - ring data , the region was wetter than normal .
So if drier conditions persist , delivery shortfalls will be even greater .
Traditional healers , often called witch doctors , use ancient treatments
Up to 1,000 Gambian villagers have been abducted by " witch doctors " to secret detention centres and forced to drink potions , a human rights group says .
Amnesty International said some forced to drink the concoctions developed kidney problems , and two had died .
Officials in the police , army and the president 's personal protection guard had accompanied the " witch doctors " in the bizarre roundup , said witnesses .
Gambia 's government was unavailable to comment on the claims .
The human rights group asserted that many of those abducted were elderly .

The London - based rights group said the witch hunters , said to be from neighbouring Guinea , were invited into Gambia after the death of the president 's aunt earlier this year was blamed on witchcraft .
Kate Allen , Amnesty 's UK director , said hundreds of Gambians have fled to neighbouring Senegal for safety after seeing their villages attacked .
" The Gambian government has to put a stop to this campaign , investigate these attacks immediately and bring those responsible to justice , " she said .
' Diarrhoea and vomiting '
Amnesty spoke to villagers who said they had been held for up to five days and forced to drink unknown substances , which they said caused them to hallucinate and behave erratically .
The paramilitary police armed with guns and shovels surrounded our village and threatened that anyone who tries to escape will be buried six feet under
Eyewitness
Many said they were then forced to confess to being witches .
In some cases , they were also allegedly severely beaten , almost to the point of death .
Eyewitnesses and victims told Amnesty the " witch doctors " were from neighbouring Guinea .
As well as police , army and national intelligence agents , they were also reportedly joined by " green boys " - personal protection guards of Gambian President Yahya Jammeh .
Amnesty said the incidents took place in the Foni Kansala district , near to the president 's hometown in Kanilai .
In the most recent incident , said to have taken place on 9 March , hundreds of people from Sintet village were allegedly rounded up .
One eyewitness told the rights group : " The paramilitary police armed with guns and shovels surrounded our village and threatened the villagers that anyone who tries to escape will be buried six feet under . "
Three hundred men and women were allegedly randomly identified and forced at gunpoint into waiting buses , which ferried them to Kanilai .
Once there , they were stripped and forced to drink dirty herbal water and were bathed with herbs , the eyewitness said .
Many of those who drank the concoctions developed instant diarrhoea and vomiting , the eyewitness added .

So about an hour ago I posted my dad ’s story to Reddit with the hope that reddit might show their unbelievable goodwill that they have in the past here , with my dad ’s situation .
The situation is this :
My dad is facing more then 10,000 in debt , most of which is for his hospital bills in the past two weeks .
Some of it has to do with the IRS and documents he can’t get his hands on because his former employeer went out of his way to manipulate him into not leaving that company .
My dad just wanted to be paid wages people in his position made .
He stayed in that position a lot longer then most people would , and when he finally told his boss that he was leaving , his boss made sure he could n’t find a job anywhere else in the Florida restaurant supply market .
We ’ve watched the IRS situation came crashing down around him , and then the new cancer on his ear .
We saw his earlier medical bills , dealing with California public health care system and it ’s bureaucracy ( which said he made 126 dollars too much on unemployment to qualify for state benefits and this is California ’s health care system telling him that for shit ’s sake ) .
It ’s just absolutely unbelievable .
We had to do something right ?
At least , we ’d thought that we ’d try … try and ask total strangers to help a guy they ’ve never met try and break even after everything that could go wrong did .
He ’s been looking for work since November and can’t find anything .
We ’re not asking for huge donations from people we do n’t know .
Maybe a dollar , maybe 50 cents , maybe even an up vote so that it might reach front page .
I was a little uncomfortable putting this on reddit .
The causes that redditors champion have blown me away in the past .
I think about the things that redditors contribute towards and I know that generally they are these dire situations .
I worry that people will see this blog and just dismiss my dad ’s need off hand because he ’s not at death door .
Not yet at least .
Until the pathology comes back on his ear we ’ll have no idea whether or not the cancer will escalate .
We have no idea what kind of payment plan the IRS will put him on if we do n’t find some way to help him pay for this .
How long it will be before he can get back on his feet financially ?
Will he have to go into bankrupcy and start from scratch once he ’s in his 60’s ?
No one should have to do that .
And I know people do but if theres a way we can help him , I ’ll find it .
He ’s my dad and there is nothing I would n’t do for him .
A glimpse inside a secret state North Korean soldiers have detained two female US journalists on the China - North Korea border , media reports say .
The journalists had apparently ignored warnings to stop filming in the area .
The US has expressed " concern " over the fate of the two women .
Pyongyang has yet to comment on the incident , and China says it is investigating .
The reports come amid heightened tensions between North Korea and the US over the North 's plans to launch a satellite into space .
The North says the launch is part of its communications programme , but the US fears this is a cover for testing long - range missile technology .
Crossing point According to the Associated Press news agency , Laura Ling , a Chinese - American , and Euna Lee , a Korean - American - both of whom work for the California - based online media outlet Current TV - were arrested late on Tuesday .
Their Chinese guide , an ethnic Korean , was also detained , the agency says .
Chun Ki-won , a Christian clergyman in Seoul who helped arrange the journalists ' trip , told reporters they went to the area to report on North Korean refugees in north - eastern China .
There is still some confusion as to exactly where the reporters were arrested .
South Korean television station YTN and unnamed diplomatic sources said that North Korean guards crossed the Tumen river into Chinese territory to arrest the journalists .
Munhwa
Ilbo newspaper reported the arrest of just one US journalist , and said the incident took place along another border river , the Yalu .
The two areas are hundreds of miles apart .
Both the Tumen and Yalu rivers are frequent crossing points for trade between China and North Korea .
Many North Koreans also try to cross the rivers , to escape into China through the porous border - fleeing poverty and repression in their homeland , and attracted by the economic boom in China .
The BBC's Michael Bristow , who has just returned from the North Korea - China border , says there is a heavy military presence in the area .
There are checkpoints every few kilometres , he says , with both Chinese and North Korean soldiers visible from the river banks .
In 1996 , an American was arrested by the North Koreans on suspicion of spying , after swimming up the Yalu river .
He was released after three months , due to the intervention of US congressman Bill Richardson .
Rising tensions
Millions of people are thought to be in need of food aid Tensions between North Korea and the international community - particularly the US - have heightened since North Korea 's announcement that it will launch a communications satellite between 4 and 8 April .
Analysts believe the satellite launch is actually a planned long - range missile test , and the US and its allies have called for it to be cancelled .
Pyongyang recently put its military on full combat alert and shut its border with the South , leaving 400 South Korean workers in the shared Kaesong industrial zone stranded .
On Tuesday the US said North Korea had refused to accept any further food aid supplies , despite the fact the World Food Programme recently estimated that nine million people were in need of food assistance .
Five aid groups have been told to leave the North by the end of March , the US state department said .

First it was the emails , and the tweets .
This is all nonsense about the aporkalypse , surely ?
Just like with Sars , and bird flu , and MMR , is this all hype ?
The answer is no , but more interesting is this : for so many people , their very first assumption on the story is that the media are lying .
It is the story of the boy who cried wolf .
We are poorly equipped to think around issues involving risk , and infectious diseases epidemiology is a tricky business : the error margins on the models are wide , and it ’s extremely hard to make clear predictions .
Here ’s an example .
In Glasgow in the 1980s , less than 5 % of injecting drug users were HIV positive .
In Edinburgh at the same time , it was almost 50 % , even though these two places are only an hour apart by train .
Lots of people have got theories about why there should have been such a huge difference in the numbers of people infected , and there ’s no doubt that it ’s fun to try and come up with a plausible post hoc rationale .
But you certainly would n’t have predicted it .
Maybe some bloke with HIV got off the train at Edinburgh station instead of Glasgow on a whim , some fateful day in the early 1980s .
Maybe there was a different culture among heroin users , or services .
Nobody really knows .
We face the same problem with swine flu .
All people have done is raise the possibility of things really kicking off , and they are right to do so , but we do n’t have brilliantly accurate information .
Someone has said that up to 40 % of the world could be infected .
Is that scaremongering ?
Well it ’s high , and I ’m sure it ’s a bit of a guess , but maybe up to 40 % could be .
Annoying , is n’t it , not to know .
Someone has said 120 million could die .
Well I suppose they could : I ’m sure it was done on the back of an envelope , by guessing how many would be infected , and what proportion would die , but I do n’t think anyone ’s pretending otherwise .
You could no more predict what will happen here than you could have predicted the enormous disparity in HIV prevalence between Glasgow and Edinburgh .
Everyone is just saying : we do n’t know , it could be bad , and the newspapers are reporting that .
Sure there ’s a bit of vaudeville in the headlines , but they ’re not saying things that are wrong , and do you really know actual , real people , normally pretty solid , who are suddenly now panicking ?
By Tuesday , pundit - seekers from the media were suddenly contacting me , a massive nobody , to say that swine flu is all nonsense and hype , like some kind of blind , automated naysaying device .
“ Will you come and talk about the media overhyping swine flu ? ” asked Case Notes on Radio 4 .
No .
“ We need someone to say it ’s all been overhyped , ” said BBC Wales .
I assumed they were adhering , robotically , to the “ balance ” template , but no : he kept at it , even when I protested and explained .
“ Yeah , but you know , it could be like Sars and bird flu , they did n’t materialise , they were hype . ”
Simon Jenkins suggested the same thing .
It ’s not true , I said .
They were risks , risks that did n’t materialise , but they were still risks .
That ’s what a risk is .
I ’ve never been hit by a car , but it ’s not idiotic to think about it .
Simon Jenkins wo n’t be right if nobody dies , he ’ll be lucky , like the rest of us .
Do people think this flappily in casinos ?
The terrible truth is yes .
In the time that I have been writing this piece – no embellishment – I ’ve had similar calls off This Week at the BBC ( “ Is the coverage misleading ? ” ) , Al - Jazeera English ( “ We wanted to talk to someone on the other side , you know , challenging the fear factor ” ) , the Richard Bacon Show on Five Live ( “ Is it another media scare like Sars and bird flu ? ” ) and many more .
I ’m not showing off .
I know I ’m a D - list public intellectual , but I just think it ’s interesting : because not only have the public lost all faith in the media ; not only do so many people assume , now , that they are being misled ; but more than that , the media themselves have lost all confidence in their own ability to give us the facts .
The US is significantly boosting troop numbers in Afghanistan US President Barack Obama has asked Congress for an extra $ 83.4bn ( £ 56.7bn ) to fund operations in Iraq and Afghanistan this year .
In his official letter to the House , he said the request was his " last planned war supplemental [ payment ] " .
The supplementary money is needed to pay for the new Afghan strategy and the reduction of combat troops in Iraq .
Mr Obama opposed special troop funding while a member of Congress under the Bush administration .
The sum breaks down into $ 75.8 bn for the Pentagon and more than $ 7bn in foreign aid , including $ 1.8 bn for Pakistan , the Associated Press news agency reports .
We must break that recent tradition and include future military costs in the regular budget
US President Barack Obama
It would push the war money approved for 2009 to about $ 150 bn .
The totals were $ 171bn for 2007 and $ 188bn for 2008 , when George W Bush was in the White House .
According to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service , the new money will bring the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan since 9/11 to almost $ 1tn .
Mr Obama 's request is likely to win easy approval from the Democratic - controlled Congress despite frustration among some liberals over the pace of troop withdrawals , AP adds .
' Breaking tradition '
The outlines of the request were provided in documents presented at a private Congressional briefing .
The funds are meant to pay for an average force level in Iraq of 140,000 troops , with force levels in Afghanistan rising to 45,000 .
The request is a " supplemental " , meaning it falls outside the usual budgetary process .
" The Taleban is resurgent and al - Qaeda threatens America from its safe haven along the Afghan - Pakistan border , " Mr Obama wrote .
Nearly 95 % of the money would , Mr Obama said , go to the Pentagon to " help the people of Iraq to take responsibility for their own future , and work to disrupt , dismantle , and defeat al - Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan " .
The rest of the money would be used to confront other threats to US security , from " securing loose nuclear weapons to combating fear and want under repressive regimes " .
" As I noted when first I introduced my budget in February , " Mr Obama continued in his letter , " this is the last planned war supplemental . "
He noted that since 9/11 , Congress had passed 17 separate emergency funding bills totalling $ 822.1 bn for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
" We must break that recent tradition and include future military costs in the regular budget so that we have an honest , more accurate and fiscally responsible estimate of federal spending , " Mr Obama said .
In a statement , Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Congress would review Mr Obama 's request and " engage in a dialogue with the administration on appropriate benchmarks to measure the success of our investment " .
House Republican leader John Boehner suggested Republicans would be likely to support the funding request .

What are these ?

So I 've got all these fancy blog posts planned .
More than planned , actually — they 're well underway .
But it 's also been a busy couple of months , so nothing 's really ready yet .
To make my schedule even worse , I kind of sort of got myself a little bit addicted to the writings of this one blogger .
Normally I can't frigging stand blogs , including my own .
Everyone always asks me what blogs I read , and I reply : " Um ... do books count ? "
Which of course is greeted with blank stares , since nobody seems to read books anymore these days .
Such a shame .
Anyway , recently I tried another fling with reddit .
I 'm always getting addicted to reddit for a little while , and then coming off it cold - turkey for a month or two while I reassess whether I want to be spending my life reading pun threads and upmodded lolcat pictures and conspiracy theories .
Not to mention the comments , which can individually sometimes be quite cool , but in aggregate only make sense when you read them aloud with the voice of the Comic Book Guy from the Simpsons : " I upvoted you for the appropriate uses of ' its ' and ' their ' in the link title , but downvoted you because your link actually appeared on a little - known German social networking site several hours ago .
I feel it is important that you understand that this is not a zero-vote of abstention , but rather a single upvote and a single downvote cancelling one another out . "
If you read the comments with CBG 's voice , a lot of them make a whole lot more sense .
No matter how many times I quit , in the end I always wind up sneaking a peek at the reddit home page in a moment of weakness , and before long I 'm hooked again , following the adventures of memes about narwhals and how is babby formed and all this other stuff I have zero context for , but occasionally it 's hysterically funny .
I 'm guessing this is more or less what heroin is like .
Some days I do n't even shower .
In any case , my latest reddit flirtation ultimately led to a secondary and more severe addiction to the writings of some dude who goes by the name " davesecretary " .
Yeah , him .
He 's a fucking genius .
I started reading his old re-posted stories , got hooked and basically blacked out and lost about three days where nobody knew where the hell I was .
Eventually I made my way to his stories about his trip to China .
At that point I became actively envious of someone for I think the second or maybe third time in my adult life .
I 'm just not the jealous type normally , but damn that guy can write .
He has a real gift .
So now I 'm flat - out jealous .
I 'm not going to make a secret of it , either , and pretend he 's started some trend and I 'm just a bigger light jumping on the bandwagon or some lame shit like that .
No , he writes way better than I do , and I 'm just going to copy him blatantly , like Terry Brooks rewriting Lord of the Rings line - by - line badly as Shitstorm of Shannara .
I had actually already been thinking of publishing some true stories .
In fact before I stumbled on davesecretary 's tales , I had written down the story below about my brother Dave taking out the garbage , and I had been planning more .
But Dave Secretary 's stories were like the Great Pyramids next to the mud pueblo of my own ambition .
He 's like a force of nature ; stories just surround the guy like gnats , and he spews out the funniest , most interesting possible versions of them imaginable .
So while I work on my more technically ambitious blogs - in - progress , I thought I 'd kick off a series of light reading .
It 's all true stories .
None of it is anywhere near as cool as trying to find a box bigger than Kyle 's goddamn cereal box , and nothing in them is anywhere near as funny as the line " Iodine , Dave . "
But at least these are my own stories , and they 're kinda fun to write down once you get going on them .
I probably have about a hundred stories like the ones here .
I 'll start with nine random stories that managed to get themselves written first , in no particular order .
I hope you like at least one or two of them .
If not , well , I 'll read your complaints out loud as CBG , so we 'll be even .
So this one time I 'm when in my early 20s , a fragile time during which I 'm as fat as a walrus , I 'm spending way too much time thinking about the name of the Star Wars character " Dash Rendar " .
He 's some random Star Wars dude , except he 's not from one of the actual movies .
He 's only in the aftermarket books or games or toys or whatever .
I have no idea where I 'd heard the name " Dash Rendar " , but I can tell you I absolutely loathed it .
Lucas names are always a little hard to believe , but this one was just too much .
I guess when you 're that fat it 's easy to get irritated by little things .
At that point in my life I was genuinely annoyed that the famous one in the family had n't been little Pete Rendar or Floyd Rendar or whoever else with a normal name .
No .
It just had to be frigging Dash .
I 'm telling you all this so you can understand my frame of mind for what happened next .
I 'm coming up the elevator from the underground garage because I 'm too obese to take the stairs , and I 'm in a surly mood on account of this stupidly - named character Dash Rendar .
I 'm trying to understand basic human nature here : how could anyone , even a nine year old , suspend disbelief for such an idiotic name ?
I'm all alone in the elevator , so on the spur of the moment I decide to pretend to be a nine year old and see if it makes any difference .
So I make this muscle pose and say in my most ominous nine - year - old voice : " I am DASH RENDAR !
" Right then the elevator doors open and fucking Dash Rendar walks in .
I am not making this up .
If you lined up ten thousand guys and asked a hundred people to point to the one whose name in real life was most probably Dash Rendar , they 'd all point to this dude .
He of course witnessed my little announcement , pose and all , and all I could do was stand there slack - jawed , trying to think of a clever and succinct way to say : " I was just sort of trying to understand what kind of idiot would call himself Dash Rendar , and itjustsortofrequiredmetoawfuck . "
Dash was staring at me with a look like he'd just stepped in dog shit , except when he lifted up his foot he'd found me there instead .
I was embarrassed enough to wish I would die spontaneously , but not quite enough for it to actually happen .
So instead I just walked out of the elevator and never came back there again .
Ever .
Afterwards
I definitely established some new rules about what kinds of things I 'll try in elevators .
My brother Dave used to work as a waiter at Applebees .
This was back about 2 years after he 'd graduated high school as a varsity football player , after which he'd settled into a life of comfort and no small quantity of pizza , and he'd blimped up to about 260 pounds .
But it happened so fast that he was n't entirely in touch with how much he actually weighed .
One day before the restaurant opened they were having the usual employee meeting in the back room , where everyone stood in a circle while the manager ran them through the day 's specials and whatever else waiters need to know for the day .
Dave was sweating and getting a little fidgety , so he found a chair and sat down .
The next thing that happened was a loud BANG , and everyone looked over at Dave , who was sitting on the floor with his mouth open in a big round ' O ' .
He had completely flattened the chair .
It had once been a strong industrial solid metal chair , but now all four of its legs were sticking in different directions like a baby deer crushed under a UPS truck .
Everyone was a little stunned , and the boss felt like he needed to say something to break the awkward silence , so he said delicately : " Gee , Dave , looks like it might be time to start cutting back a bit , eh ?
" Dave said later ( after losing like 100 pounds ) that at the time he did n't know what the FUCK the boss was talking about , and all he could think was :
This chair is DEFECTIVE !
So that reminds me of this time I was watching the Seattle Seahawks play at their ( at the time ) brand - new stadium .
We had sweet seats on the 50 yard line , in the second row back , and we were watching a pretty awesome game between the Seahawks and I think it was the Bears or the Giants .
I forget which , but it was definitely one of the two .
Probably the Bears , so let 's go with that .
Anyway , the row of seats in front of me was occupied by some Bears fans .
There were about twelve of them , and every single one looked to weigh well over four hundred pounds .
It was seriously the fattest row of people I 've ever seen .
They were squeezed up against each other in this tangle of arms and legs because they could n't fit in their assigned seats that had been designed for ordinary three - hundred pound fatass football fans .
Every time the Bears had a good play , they would all stand up and roar " YeaaaaAAAAH !!!! " , and then they 'd all sit down at the same time , on account of their arms being interlocked due to the aforementioned fatitude .
They did this little act over and over for the first half of the game : leaping up , bellowing fiercely , then crashing down again as a unit .
Finally I think just after half - time the Bears executed an especially good defensive play , and they all stood up and screamed wildly as usual .
But this time when they crashed their asses down , they ripped the bleacher right out of the fucking concrete .
There was this horrible thundering tearing noise like an earthquake , and the whole row of whales spilled forward onto their faces , with their twelve giant asses sticking up at the rest of us .
It looked like a bomb had gone off .
There were like twenty iron girders that had been ripped right out of the concrete .
To say it was the most wonderful thing I 'd ever witnessed would be a gross understatement .
I think even now , ten years later , it might still be my favorite whale ass sticking up scene in my whole memory .
To make it all even more sublimely beautiful , our beer splashed all over them in slow - motion because the cup - holders on the backs of their seats were thrown forward with the rest of the wreckage .
Anyway , after a few seconds of general shock and hilarity , the ushers ran over to see if the herd were all OK .
They had finally managed to extricate themselves and wipe most of the beer off , and they all stood up and started screaming : " This bleacher is DEFECTIVE !
" Once my family all went to this Chinese restaurant in Seattle 's Chinatown .
It was one of my favorites , and on this particular occasion I was there with my at - the - time girlfriend Stephanie .
Stephanie just happened to be mainland Chinese , from Beijing .
But unlike everyone else I 've known from Beijing , who by and large seem like pretty laid back people , Stephanie was unusually sensitive to race and culture issues , and she kept a keen eye out for any perceivable slights or offenses .
( Everyone else said she was just plain nuts , but I 'm trying to be charitable here . )
Steph asks my brother Mike what he 's ordering .
He ponders the menu a while and answers : " Fly lice . "
Stephanie instantly blows up at him : " What do you mean FLY LICE !!!1 !!??
You 're insulting our culture ?
We have 5000 years of Chinese culture and you Caucasians are always insulting us !
I can't believe you made fun of it and called it fly lice !
That 's very rude !
That 's not how we pronounce it !
I can't believe I 'm so offended ! " and so on in that vein .
Everyone else in the family , including me , suddenly becomes tremendously preoccupied with trying to figure out how to do origami with our chopstick wrappers .
Mike listens patiently , since let 's just say this sort of outburst is n't wholly unfamiliar territory when Stephanie 's around , and after she finally simmers down a little he says gently : " Uh ... ok .
Sorry .
" So the ( Chinese ) waitress comes around and is taking our orders , and when she gets to Mike , Stephanie starts hyperventilating a little in case she 'll have sudden need of some extra screaming oxygen .
Mike says in his blandest and most American possible voice : " I 'd like to have the fried rice , please .
" The waitress nods happily and says " FLY LICE " really loud and writes it down on her pad .
Mike , always an excellent poker player , manages to keep his face pretty straight , but I can tell his eyes are sparkling just a little .
Meanwhile Stephanie 's eyes have grown to the size of large saucers , and she hisses loudly : " She said FLY LICE !!!!!!
Hee hee hee hee hee hee HEE HEE HEE HEE HEE ! "
Mike just shrugs , like , " hey man , I just want to not get yelled at anymore .
"
We do n't call it fly lice now , though , since you just never know .
When I was growing up the holidays were always crazy because I had over 20 aunts and uncles , and seventy or eighty first cousins , and of course we had to do a massive holiday family party at my grandparents ' teeny house every year .
Every family would bring a few friends , so there would be well in excess of 100 people running around in pure holiday chaos for a day .
We used to do this secret - santa gift exchange where everyone would put their name in a hat a few weeks in advance , and then we'd all draw names , and that was the person you had to get a gift for .
It was n't split into adults and kids or anything like that .
With an extended family that big , it 's kinda hard to keep track of everyone , especially the new additions .
It was also kinda hard to know what people actually wanted , and some of my uncles were n't too big on preparation .
Uncle Harold was pretty much the worst at it .
We loved him to pieces , but he just could n't get the hang of the holiday party or the secret santa exchange .
To give you the basic Uncle Harold flavor , one year he did n't show up because on the way to the party he decided to stop in a bar down the street , and he stayed there drinking bloody marys until midnight .
Another year he was tasked with bringing the turkey , and he showed up at dinnertime with a frozen - solid turkey .
And one year his secret santa target was Aunt Celie , who was infamously religious and pretty much nothing else , just religious , so Harold , totally at a loss , got her a picture of Jesus and taped fifty bucks to the back of it .
All the adults were pissed off and all the kids thought it was pretty much the funniest goddamn thing in history .
Either way , Uncle Harold just could n't win at Christmas .
But this one year he really outdid himself .
I think I was about 11 or 12 years old , just old enough that I was no longer running around screaming like the next generation of cousins .
So I got a chance to sit back and watch the party unfold .
I 'm sitting there watching Uncle Harold give his secret santa gift to one of my cousins , one of Aunt Diana 's kids .
For some reason Harold looks embarrassed .
My dad had 11 brothers and sisters , all married with like 6 or 8 kids each , and there was no way any of us could really keep track .
Usually we'd get in touch with an immediate family member and try to get some direction , but Harold , as usual , just winged it .
I do n't remember which cousin it was , but last time Harold had seen him , he was a baby , so Harold , thinking it through with his usual clarity , got him a jar of Gerber baby food .
Unfortunately it turns out it 's been like six years since Harold had last seen him .
So my cousin opens up his present and I hear him saying to my aunt Diana : " Mom. Uncle Harold got me baby food . "
Diana was busy with two other crying kids , and she 's not feeling particularly merciful , so she says : " Well go tell him thank you .
" So my cousin walks over to the tree where Harold is sitting , and he says : " Thank you for the baby food , Uncle Harold .
" This story is more grim than funny , but it 's a story .
With sequels , no less !
In college I lived in a big four - bedroom apartment with 3 roommates for about a year .
It was n't air - conditioned and during summer it was hotter than hell , and we all kept our windows open most of the time .
I was just starting to drift off to sleep one night , laying on my back , when I heard this loud clicking noise .
It sounded like snapping a ball - point pen out of its plastic cap , and the clicks were coming at roughly one per second in irregular bursts .
The clicking noise was coming from between my eyes .
Not , like , a foot away , or an inch away , but from directly between my eyes , near the bridge of my nose .
I remember thinking : " That 's odd .
Whatever could be making that loud clicking noise coming from between my eyes ?
I 've never heard anything like that before .
" Part of me was falling asleep , and was thinking " mufbmlflfsleeep go sleep go sleep mblfjust do n't worry abouuuuuut it " , or something like that .
But there was this other little part of me , a tiny voice , that was busy thinking out loud to its tiny self : " It could be a spider .
" My falling - asleep part woke up a little at that point , and pondered it for a few dozen clicks .
Then it replied : " No .
No , it 's not a spider , because that would just be TOO horrible to contemplate .
So that 's not what it is .
" And the tiny voice was like , " Well you come up with a non-spider explanation then .
You can't just ignore loud clicking noises coming from BETWEEN YOUR EYES , dude .
" Falling - asleep voice : " Spiders do n't make noise .
So there .
" Tiny voice : " Small ones do n't .
Medium - sized ones do n't .
But we do n't really know what BIG spiders do , now , do we ?
I bet a really big one could make a noise just like that .
" At this point , opinion - wise , I 'd say I was coming down solidly on the side of falling - asleep voice , but neither the clicking nor the tiny voice would shut up , so I rolled over onto my side so I could think about it from a different angle .
As I rolled over I felt something huge jump off my face .
It landed on my arm and started dragging itself along with what felt like a dozen scrabbly legs , and of course I was like WAAAAAAAAAAAH !!!!
and I jumped out of bed faster than any human being has ever done before , and turned on the light .
Falling - asleep voice and tiny voice were both , like , " Oh , shit ! "
Sitting there next to my pillow was the biggest fucking wolf spider I 've ever seen in my life .
It had a good four inch legspan , and it was very specifically glaring at me .
There was no mistaking its expression .
It was really pissed off .
At me .
So I do the only thing I know how to do in Large Spider situations , which is to scream for help .
" AAAH !!!
A FUCKING SPIDER CRAWLED ON MY FACE ! "
My roommates ' doors all started opening and they came out in their bath robes , all keenly interested to see the spider that had crawled on my face .
Jacob is first to arrive .
He takes one look at this massive glaring spider and says : " Holy shit dude , that thing 's as big as a horse ! " and leaves as fast as he came in .
Dave shows up next .
" Holy crap , that thing crawled on your face ?
You must be psychologically damaged ! "
Dave opts to stand and goggle at the giant spider , from a safe distance .
Then Eric comes in and says : " Oh , it 's just a hobo spider .
I 'll take care of it . "
He walks into the bathroom and grabs ONE square of toilet paper .
Not a whole handful , no , just one teeny slice , like he 's going to wipe the spider 's butt with it or something , and he goes and grabs the spider with it .
We can clearly see the spider 's legs waving around outside the toilet paper , and Eric says : " I 'll just put it outside your window .
" I of course was having none of that crap .
" How the hell do you think it got on my face in the first place ?
Flush it !
Now now now !
Flush ! "
Eric , clearly disappointed , flushed the thing , and I 'm certain that it now lives in the Seattle public sewer system , feeding on rats and stray dogs and plotting its revenge on me .
My actions that day clearly angered the Spider God , because over the next few years I had several more spider - on - face incidents , at least one of which was way more dramatic than this one .
It 's a bit traumatic to tell both stories at once , though , so I 'll wait a bit on that one .
When my brother Dave was around 14 , our family lived in a house in Southern California .
It was kinda rainy at the time , which is sort of unusual for where we lived .
On this particular California winter day it was Dave 's turn to take out the trash .
Our city - issue trash bin was out in the carport , this sort of concrete alley next to the house where our big Dodge van was parked .
The trash bin was on the other side of the van , next to a six - foot brick wall separating us from the neighbor .
Dave grabs the trash bag from the kitchen and heads outside .
He walks over to the trash bin , opens the lid and sees that it 's completely full .
There 's a plastic garbage bag right at the top , and the lid just barely closes over it .
Dang .
It 's starting to rain pretty hard , and Dave just wants to get his bag into the can and get back inside , so he figures he 'll do the old Human Trash Compactor trick .
He puts down his bag , climbs up on the brick wall , aims for the bag on top of the bin , and jumps .
Usually this works pretty well , right ?
Your plummeting body weight smushes the bag down just far enough to make room for another bag , and you hop out unharmed .
Unfortunately for Dave , it turns out that this time the bin was completely empty except for the bag on top .
That one bag was full of trash , but it was so bulky that it had n't fallen down into the bin .
So Dave jumps off the wall , plunges all the way into the bin , and the lid slams shut on top of him .
His momentum makes the bin tip over , and it wedges itself solidly between the van and the wall , trapping Dave inside with the garbage .
Dave 's no more claustrophobic than the next person , but the whole thing caught him a little off guard .
In his mind 's eye he'd been envisioning some sort of heroic plunge that would compress the garbage about a foot or so , followed by a dashing bounce onto his feet on the driveway .
Instead , in just under one second he 'd materialized sideways in a dark stinky fallen - over garbage can getting pounded by rain , and the lid would n't open .
So he did the first thing that came naturally to him , which was to panic and kick and scream and thrash and flail and try to claw his way out .
Pretty much what you or I would have done .
However , he was really stuck in there pretty good , and nobody could hear him because of the rain , so it took about ten minutes of violent side - to - side heaving before he finally rolled the can out from between the van and the wall .
So we 're all sitting in our nice , comfy living room , watching TV .
Dave has gone to take the garbage out .
Ten or fifteen minutes later , after we 've all totally forgotten about him , the front door bangs open and Dave barges in , wild - eyed and soaking wet and yelling at us at the top of his lungs .
He 's completely covered in garbage : coffee grounds , smears of leftover food , pieces of dirty paper , part of a banana peel on his shoe , brown slime all over his head and arms and legs and clothes , and he 's screaming : " DIDN'T ANY OF YOU HEAR ME ?
I WAS STUCK IN THE GARBAGE CAN !
" Back when I started working at Amazon.com in 1998 , the company was in this little building in downtown Seattle in kind of a bad part of town .
I mean it was n't terrible , but there were definitely some issues .
There was a needle exchange across the street , which was cool and all , but a fair number of the drug users did their thing in the alley behind the building we were in .
So you did n't really want to walk out the back door , or you 'd run the risk of stepping on some dude with a syringe dangling out of his arm .
The nearest place to eat was the Scaryaki joint across the street , next to the needle exchange .
It was this teriyaki place that we all called the Scaryaki , since even though the food was pretty good almost nobody ever went there because it was scary .
Usually we'd walk a couple blocks past it , which took us to Pike Place Market , which is also scary in its own way but is much less overtly threatening .
Plus there 's more culinary variety .
One day my friend Jacob and I left the 'zon premises to eat at Matt 's in the Market , which was this really awesome hole - in - the - wall joint that was Zagat rated and nobody knew about it and it was delicious .
On the way back to work , we 're crossing the street in front of the Scaryaki , and I can't help but notice Jacob 's doing an unusual amount of looking at my ass and my legs .
We 're both straight , and as a consequence we usually try to avoid staring at each other 's asses as a general rule , so I 'm a little annoyed .
But he 's definitely checking me out with waaaay too much interest .
I finally give him the Glare , and he says : " Where 'd you get those pants from ?
" I shrug .
" I do n't know .
" Jacob is now really keenly eying my pants , which are these dark blue cotton slacks I 've been wearing to work on and off for at least a few months now .
He starts being more demanding .
" No , really , where 'd you get those pants from ?
" I 'm like , " Dude , I do n't know !
Stop looking at me !
" Jacob suddenly announces , in a really loud voice that everyone within a block or so can hear : " You 're wearing my pants ! "
A couple of people in the vicinity , including some druggies and some coworkers , perk up with some interest as the argument unfolds .
Me : " No I 'm not !
What are you talking about ? "
Jacob : " Those are my pants !
Where 'd you get them from ?
Those are mine !
" Me : " I do n't know where I got them !
I just had them !
They 're mine , OK ?
Leave me alone ! "
I 'm now running full bore for the doors , since I want to get back to work and out of this sudden surreal nightmare .
And all the while I 'm thinking to myself : " Where DID I get these pants ?
I never buy blue slacks .
I found them in my closet one day , so they MUST be my pants .
They fit pretty well , even though they 're a little long .
So they 're mine !
I must just not remember buying them !
"
We burst into the lobby , where everyone in the frigging company is on their way back from lunch , and Jacob is running after me yelling : " I recognize those pants you 're wearing !
Those are MY PANTS ! "
There was chaos for a while .
It was pretty messed up .
The funny thing is , it turned out they actually were his pants .
He and our mutual friend Jeff and I had all gone out to El Gaucho earlier that year .
It 's the awesomeest steakhouse in Seattle , arguably in the whole country , and we all dressed up after work one day to eat there .
I drove , and they threw their work clothes into the trunk of my car , which was almost completely filled with random crap .
When they got their clothes out later , Jacob did n't see his pants or something , and I must have thrown them in my laundry when I finally cleaned my car , months later .
One day I started wearing the pants without really thinking too deeply about their origins , and the rest was history .
He probably could have picked a better way to tell me , though .
I remember when I was 23 years old , my dad decided to have one of those Dad to Son talks .
He 'd clearly thought seriously about it , because he sat me down and gave me one of those This Is Important looks .
He said : " You know how sometimes they lose your file ? " " Uh ... what ? "
" You know , like when you call up to make a dentist appointment , and then when you get there they have no record of the conversation ?
Or you set up an account with the cable company , or whatever , and they can't find it later ? " " Er ... yeah , sure .
That happens to everyone sometimes .
" My dad is like , " Nope .
It happens to us way more often .
And when it happens , tell them to look under ' W ' . " " What ? ' W ' ? " " Yep .
Ask them to look under Wegge instead of Yegge. 9 times out of 10 they 'll find it . " " WTF ? " " Yep .
It 's weird .
But when you spell our name , Y - e - g - g-e , a lot of people write or type ' W ' instead of ' Y ' .
" I 'm thinking , " You waited until I 'm 23 years old to tell me this ? "
But I 'm also thinking : " Damn , are people really that stupid ?
And if so , how the hell did n't I notice this myself ? " " Uh , thanks Dad .
I 'll keep an eye out !
" So I watch .
And listen .
And sure as shit , he 's absolutely right .
The percentage is pretty high , like maybe 10 % to 20 % of the time .
Someone ( in person or on the phone ) will ask me to spell my name , and I 'll say ' Y ' , and they 'll enter ' W ' .
A lot of the time I 'll actually be in a position to watch them as they do it -- I 'll be looking over the rental - car counter or whatever , and when you 're looking at a keyboard upside - down from the side , you can see the ' W ' as they type it .
I have no idea how many years it took my dad to figure this out , but he 's a pretty perceptive dude , and he was 43 when he told me .
So we 're talking about half a lifetime of watching people fuck up , and eventually realizing there 's a pattern to it .
Bravo .
Nowadays I 'll say " Yellow Echo Golf Golf Echo " if I 'm on the phone , since it slows them down just enough to think about what they 're typing .
In person , when I can see what they 're typing , I still say " Y " , because I 'm always dying to know if they 're one of Those People .
If they get it wrong , I 'm like , " No , ' Y ' , not ' W ' " , and they always say : " Gosh , I have no idea why I did that !
" Me neither .
But I think it 's because when you pronounce the letter Y , it starts with a W - sound , as in " WHY " ?
Sometimes it even seems as if the slower and more deliberately I say ' Y ' , the more likely they are to get it wrong , because my lips started off with this big ' W ' sound .
Anyway , the best one ever was at a Jiffy Lube .
The Lube Supervisor Dude was asking me for my personal information and writing it all down on a form on his clipboard .
He apparently felt he was better qualified to write my personal data on the form than I was , and to be fair , he had pretty good handwriting .
He asked me to spell my name , and I said : " Y " .
He wrote " W " .
So far , so good .
I really did n't want these fuckers to have my personal information just because they gave me an oil change , anyway .
I said " e " , and he wrote " i " .
Wow , this was new .
I said " g , g " and he wrote " jj " .
Cool !
I started to get kind of excited to see if he'd get every letter wrong .
I said very carefully : " e " , and he wrote " i " , completing my last name as " Wijji " .
It was Jiffily Lubriciously Awesome .
I told him " THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT ! " , like he'd just won on Who Wants to be a Millionaire , and he gave me this big shit - eating grin with several missing teeth .
It was nice to make him feel happy .
But check it out : I told this story to my friend Gayle , whose last name has a bunch of doubled letters in it , including ending in " nn " .
She said that she 'd found empirically that in order to get people to write " nn " at the end of her name , she had to say as many as four or five N's .
She 's gotten into the habit of spelling it with " enn enn enn enn enn " at the end so they 'll write two of them .
Go figure .
OK , last story for today .
I 've been a snowboarder for almost 20 years , but waaaay back in the old days I actually used to ski .
I learned in my late teens , and I spent 2 or 3 seasons skiing , mostly using Navy rental equipment .
I have all sorts of Navy stories to tell , but they 'll have to wait for another day .
Suffice it to say the Navy provided the rental equipment for this story .
This was back when I was at the US Navy S5G Nuclear Reactor Prototype training plant in the middle of Idaho .
" S " was for " Submarine " , 5 was the reactor model number , and " G " was for General Electric , who had made the reactor .
Hmmm , maybe I should tell some of my reactor stories someday ... they 're definitely interesting .
Anyway , the reactor was at a Department of Energy site in the desert in the middle of Idaho , with a 60 - mile bus ride from the nearest city , Idaho Falls .
I 'll leave it to your imagination as to why they located the experimental and training reactor facilities out in the middle of a desert , but your first three guesses are probably all more or less correct .
Anyway , the downside to the program was that we were in Idaho , where the fun thing for residents to do is follow potato trucks in their cars , trying to hit dislodged potatoes .
That 's pretty much the pinnacle of entertainment in that fugging dustbin wasteland .
The upside was that there were some really nice ski resorts nearby , so during winter we got to do a lot of skiing .
This one time we were either at Jackson Hole or Grand Targhee .
Both of them are in Wyoming , but only about 2 hours from town , so we usually went to one of them .
The way the Navy Nuke program works during the prototype training phase is that you work 7 days on , 1 day off , 7 days on , 2 days off , 7 days on , 4 days off .
This is actually a pretty doable schedule , and the once - a - month 4 - day weekend was always something you planned in advance , since that 's a lot of days for screwing around .
A lot of my friends were skiers , and snowboarding was still pretty new back then .
There was one dude , I think his name was Lundberg ( everyone goes by last names in the Navy ) , who was learning to snowboard , and he pretty much spent all his time falling on his ass .
So I decided to ski .
The Navy pretty much takes care of all your needs , including ski rentals , so I went to the local Navy ski rental place and got hooked up with some rental skis , boots and poles .
Unfortunately this one time , which was probably no more than my seventh or eighth trip ever , the rental guy adjusted my bindings too loose .
Bindings are the things on your skis that hold your boots in place , and you do n't want them to be too tight or you could break your legs in a bad crash .
You want them to be tight enough to hold during an aggressive turn , but loose enough to pop out in a crash .
And mine were way too loose .
We ski for a few hours , and I 've warmed up a little , so I want to work on my turns instead of snowplowing down steep stuff like a sissy .
So I follow my friends to a black diamond .
When I was skiing I would actually follow my friends pretty often , which was completely idiotic because they 've been skiing since they were in the womb , and they look like frigging Olympians , and they 're always dragging me off to slopes I have no business being on .
But for some reason I still did it .
This slope is a pretty steep black -- nothing for me today on my snowboard , but back then it was way out of my league .
But it does n't hurt that much to fall , so I went ahead and tried a real turn .
Of course as luck would have it my binding popped out and I went flying straight down the slope on my face .
It was so steep that I actually started picking up speed , and I was n't experienced enough to know how to stop myself , so I just started sliding faster and faster downhill , face - first on my stomach .
I remember being vaguely aware of people stopping and looking at me and pointing as I accelerated by them , but after a hundred feet or so I had picked up enough speed that I could n't really do anything except this emit gurgling screaming noise .
The snow was bunching up in my face and going in my eyes and up my nose and down my throat , not to mention down my shirt and pants , but all this plowing was n't really slowing me down , so I wound up sliding about three hundred yards on my face .
I did n't have any really good ski gear at the time , though .
I was actually wearing baggy jeans , if you can believe it .
So when I near the bottom stopped I was caked in snow and ice .
Someone was nice enough to bring me my ski from way up the slope , and I hobbled into the lodge to grab a beer .
I was sitting there and everyone was laughing and having a great time , but I was FREEZING .
I went and sat by the big fire , but it was n't helping .
I started shivering badly .
Finally I stood up and lifted up my shirt and about ten pounds of snow fell out , which sort of explained it .
My brilliant friends told me that I should go back up for another run before we left for the day .
They said you stay warm on the slopes , which is more or less correct if you 're actually skiing and not being a human snowplow .
I really wanted to warm up so I went back up for one more run .
At the top I took a cat - track between slopes -- just a road , basically .
The cat - track was running along the side of a steep roped - off drop - off with a bunch of trees .
The cat track headed for the drop - off , then made a sharp turn to the left .
When I got to the turn , I turned too hard , and my right binding snapped open and my ski shot out from under me , and of course I wiped out .
I 'm laying there on my back , thinking " man , I 'm just not sure about this whole skiing thing " , and an older guy skis up next to me and asks me if I'm OK .
I 'm still laying on my back , with my right leg bent awkwardly under me , trying to catch my wind .
I tell him I lost my ski , and that I think it went over the edge .
I ask him if he can see it .
He skis over to the ledge .
I lay there , sun shining on my face , snow on my back , freezing my balls off , just kind of trying to enjoy the moment as best I can while he assesses the situation .
I look over and he's at the ledge , scanning the mountain .
A bird flies by .
Some time elapses -- probably no more than 30 seconds , but it seemed like eternity .
I finally ask the guy , " Hey , can you see my ski ? "
He looks at me , then back down the mountain .
Then he takes a deep breath as he decides how best to tell me .
Finally he speaks .
" Yep .
She 's still on the run . "
The attack had echoes of the harsh tactics used during the province ’s most violent years by the I.R.A. , which made a policy of killing not only soldiers and policemen but also civilians whose work supported them .
That violence , and attacks by Protestant paramilitaries , killed as many as 300 people a year at the height of the sectarian struggle , but the advent of power sharing has made political killings a relative rarity .
Last year , only three deaths were attributed to sectarian attacks .
But fears had grown recently that attacks by dissident republicans were mounting .
The dissidents wounded several police officers in 15 attacks in the past 17 months , and a 250 - pound bomb was defused last month outside another army base .
Sir Hugh Orde , the province ’s police chief , announced last week that concern about the attacks had caused him to ask for help from a “ small number ” of troops from the army ’s Special Reconnaissance Regiment , an intelligence - gathering unit based on the British mainland .
That decision ran counter to the reduction of army units under the peace accord , which has cut the pre-1998 British garrison from a high of 25,000 troops to barely 4,000 , concentrated on 10 bases that no longer play active roles in the province ’s security .
The men killed Saturday were from an engineering unit only hours away from deployment to Afghanistan .
The British military identified them on Monday as Mark Quinsey , 23 , and Patrick Azimkar , 21 .
On Sunday , as the police announced that they had recovered the Antrim gunmen ’s getaway vehicle at Randalstown , about five miles west of Antrim , Protestant leaders said the attack had vindicated the police ’s decision to call on the army intelligence specialists .
The move was condemned last week by Martin McGuinness , the former I.R.A. commander who is the province ’s deputy first minister , as “ stupid and dangerous ” for reviving memories of the role played by army intelligence units in strikes against the I.R.A. in the past .

But that disagreement was stilled as leaders on both sides of the historic divide joined in condemning the attack , showing a common front that many in Northern Ireland saw as a measure of how far the province had come under the power - sharing accord .
Mr. McGuinness and Peter Robinson , the province ’s first minister and head of the Democratic Unionist Party , the most powerful of the mainly Protestant parties in the province , announced they were postponing a joint investment - promoting trip to the United States that was to have begun on Sunday .
A number of dance songs were released in Italy in the late 1970s and early 80s , but only a handful of them can truly qualify as Italo " hammers . "
These up - tempo tunes have driving synths , unintelligible lyrics and bubblegum choruses and instantly cause cheers to erupt on the dance floor when they hit the decks .
The hammers are some of the most well - known from the Italo disco canon — far from being obscure within the genre , they are the songs that aficionados will spoon - feed to new recruits as their entry into the world of Italo disco .
Mr. Flagio , “ Take a Chance ”
The perfect introduction to Italo — this is everyone 's first favorite Italo disco song .
If you thought an anthem could n't be meaningless , check out the lyrics to " Take a Chance . "
Sooner or later
Enough is enough
I 've got to know
If we can clean it up
Keep it stron - gah !
Keep it stron - gah !
The song is actually a cover of a song by NYC electro - funk band Material that was released just a year earlier in 1982 .
Mr. Flagio wisely decided that it needed to be spiced up with as much vocoder and hi hat as possible .
They were n't wrong .
It 's synthly the best .
Dharma , “ Plastic Doll ”
If you 're only going to release one song in your career , make sure it 's a completely slamming tune about being a plastic doll .
That 's what Dharma did in 1982 , and sadly , no one 's heard from them since .
If you ever thought a doll screaming could n't be arousing , you 're wrong .
The tune features a rising crescendo of emotional sexy plastic dollness culminating in one of the deadliest chord progressions in Italo history .
Brand Image , “ Are You Loving ”
The lyrics are nearly unintelligible , but wo n't stop the entire dance floor from singing along to the instrumental solo .
" Doo doo doo doo doo doot doo doo doo doo doot , " the crowds shout , usually in English .
Which is fine , of course , because this song , like most Italo disco classics released in Italy , is in English .
Sort of .
The song was released in 1983 on the famed cult label Il Discotto label , home to many of the Italo hits .
With driving keyboards and an upbeat instrumental chorus that sounds like penny whistle plugged into an amp , this tune is a hit with or without the vocals .
Jerry Moon , “ Over and Over ”
Released in 1984 , this Italo classic goes for upwards of $ 100 whenever the vinyl single appears for sale .
One of only two 12 "s released by Jerry Moon , the song was written by Lorella ( Lori ) Ghilardi , who also wrote the lyrics for a number of other Italo hammers including Clay Pedrini's " New Dream " and B. Rose 's " Hey D.J. ( Give Me A Lot Of Music ) . "
Despite the painfully delivered , heavily - accented vocals , the electro horns and piano solos ensure this tune will be stuck in your head for ages and will have you doing air keyboard moves in public .
Peter Richard , “ Walking in the Neon ”
Released in 1983 , this is one of easiest introductory Italo tracks , primarily because the forward - thinking electro beats and relative lack of cheesiness make it an easy jump for electronic fans .
It 's arranged by Celso Valli who was also responsible for hits like Raf 's " Self Control " and Azoto 's Disco Fizz , arguably one of the best Italo albums of all time .
In an interesting juxtaposition , the song combines a fast 135 BPM synth with slow , haunting lyrics about outer space .
The dark , spacey synthesizers and futuristic lyrics will take you to another galaxy .
Los Angeles T.F. , “ Magical Body ”
A seminal 12 " Italo anthem released in Italy in 1985 .
Duo Tony Travagliante and Franco Zasa claims that the song is an ironic commentary on the " Italian Stallion " stereotype , but the beat is anything but ironic .
The song is a high - pitched love anthem sung by Italian singer Taffy of " I Love My Radio " fame and is replete with little voices , girly squeals and a catchy synth hook .
It 's pure saccharin camp .
The 12 " was previous relegated to emptying collector 's pockets on eBay , but has since been released by Clone Classic Cuts , thus solidifying its place in the Italo canon and ensuring that every Italo - trendster can now own a copy .
Camaro's Gang , “ Fuerza Major ”
By releasing more than 10 songs and staying in existence for over four years , Camaro 's Gang was one of the most prolific and enduring of Italo groups .
Half in Italian , half in English , the lyrics are just as inane in both languages .
But that does n't negatively impact the bounding bassline , catchy pop melodies and enthusiastically sincere cheese .
Phaeax , “ Talk About ”
Both the instrumental and vocal versions of this track are quintessential Italo .
The high - pitched synthesizers are matched only by the increasing intensity of the woman 's voice on the track singing " move on , move on , move on . "
It 's balanced by the male voices wailing , filling in the empty bits with " la la la la la " and screeching " talk about ! talk about ! " over and over .
The unbridled earnestness used to deliver the adorably vacant lyrics is a hallmark of time - honored Italo .
The instrumental version of the song is arguably the better one , as it keep the vocal highlights of the chorus but focuses on the synth hook that just wo n't quit .
Fun Fun , “ Happy Station ”
Have you ever heard a song that starts with a car crash and after repeated listens threatens to turn your brain into candyfloss ?
Welcome to " Happy Station . "
Antonelle Pepe and Angela Parisi were two of the wide - eyed babes of the era , wearing shirts that proclaimed " FUN , " and living up to the image .
( When they awkwardly dance next to each other their t- shirts combine to say " Fun Fun . " Get it ? )
Possibly some of the stupidest lyrics in a genre where that actually means something , but the synthesizer arpeggios and electro scratching make it a sugary sweet good time .
Gino Soccio , “ Remember ”
" Remember " is a soulful , haunting synthesizer dance track that 's an Italo standard and has been remixed by dozens of DJs since it was first released in 1982 .
Although Soccio was technically a Canadian ( born of Italian heritage ) his work is undeniably part of the Italo disco oeuvre .
He was both prolific and popular , topping club charts in numerous countries .
The sweeping synths and evocative lyrics in " Remember " give the song a melancholy air while still maintaining a danceable 129 BPM .
Over and over a mournful vocoded voice sings " yesterday " while a woman speaks in French in the background .
Both sad and hopeful , the song is one of the most influential Italo disco tracks of all time .
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - Israel ’s far - right foreign minister said on Tuesday peace efforts with the Palestinians had reached a “ dead end , ” on the same day U.S. President Barack Obama called for a Palestinian state alongside Israel .
Avigdor Lieberman , whose right - wing Yisrael Beitenu party is the second largest in Israel ’s new coalition government , was speaking as Obama ended a trip to Turkey on his first trip as president to the Muslim world .
Obama said both sides needed to compromise for a two - state solution , as outlined in peace talks Israel launched with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in 2007 at a conference in Annapolis , Maryland .
But Lieberman said of the Western - backed Middle East peace process : “ There is definitely a regression here and we must understand and admit that we are at a dead end . ”
Lieberman ’s deputy added that Israel would not implement it ’s obligation under a 2003 U.S. - backed road map peace plan to freeze settlement building until the Palestinians first fulfilled their commitment to rein in militants .
The foreign minister himself lashed out at Western calls for Israel to resume peace talks promptly , saying Netanyahu ’s government , which was sworn in last week , needed up to two months to draft new policy .
“ We have never interfered with other people ’s affairs and we expect of others not stand with a stopwatch in hand , ” Lieberman said in a speech to members of his party .
“ We expect them to allow us time for the government to put together a serious , real and responsible program , ” he said , adding that Israel would come up with “ new ideas . ”
He did not offer any specifics .
Lieberman has said Israel is not bound by the Annapolis understandings and Netanyahu has not publicly committed his government to pursuing the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel .
He said Israel remained committed to the staged road map , but he did not “ understand the logic ” of skipping directly to negotiations over the core issues -- like borders and the future of Jerusalem -- before earlier stages of the U.S. - backed plan were fulfilled .
JEWISH SETTLEMENTS
Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said Israel would meet its road map obligation to freeze Jewish settlements building , but only after the Palestinians first met their commitments to reign in militants .
“ It is very clear the road map is something which is well structured , was universally accepted , also by the government of Israel .
You know we abide by it , ” Ayalon said .

In an apparent effort to bolster Abbas ’s Western - backed government based in the occupied West Bank , Israel allowed the transfer of $ 12 million to the Hamas - ruled Gaza Strip , a quarter of the amount requested by the Palestinian leader to pay his government ’s salaries .
Israel has been under international pressure to lift its restrictions on cash transfers to the Gaza Strip , which Hamas seized by force in 2007 after routing forces loyal to Abbas ’s secular Fatah faction .
Some right - wing groups in Israel oppose the cash transfers , asserting that Gaza ’s Hamas Islamist rulers could benefit .
In the West Bank , Israeli police shot dead a Palestinian whom they said drove a car into officers guarding the demolition of the Jerusalem home of a Palestinian who killed three Israelis in a bulldozer rampage last July .
It was the first such demolition since a military commission determined in 2005 that a policy of destroying a Palestinian attacker ’s home was ineffective as a deterrent against future strikes on Israelis .
U.S. State Department spokesman Robert Wood said such demolitions and evictions are “ unhelpful ” and that the United States had raised these concerns with Israel .
Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak called the demolition “ an important punitive step ” and called for such measures to be carried out in a “ much shorter timeframe ” in the future .
QUESTION : What do you think about the idea of secession or sovereignty for your state ?
GOVERNOR PERRY , OF TEXAS : Oh , I think there ’s a lot of different scenarios .
On April 15th , a .k.a. tax day , protest rallies promoted by conservative lobbyists and Fox News television hosts attracted a couple of hundred thousand people to a couple of hundred locations around the country .
The rallies were called “ tea parties ” — more mad than Boston , by the look and sound of them — with “ tea ” standing for “ Taxed Enough Already . ”
The partygoers ’ main target was President Obama ’s plan for an enormous tax hike , under which , starting in 2011 , persons with incomes in excess of a quarter - million dollars could see their top marginal rate go from thirty - five per cent to 39.6 .
This means that a fellow making , for example , three hundred grand could see his tax bill go up $ 34.62 per week .
( In a typical liberal trick , most people making under a quarter mil , which is to say ninety - seven per cent of us , are getting a reduction . )
Illustration by Tom Bachtell
Lifting the burden of taxation from the backs of the comfortable is no longer the exciting new panacea it was back in the nineteen - eighties .
But another proposal that the tea parties were buzzing about merits the respectful consideration of concerned citizens : Governor Rick Perry ’s suggestion that Texas might end its association with the United States of America and strike out on its own .
Independence would n’t be a huge stretch for Texas .
It already has its own national flag , left over from its decade as a sovereign republic .
As a result , transition expenses should be minimal .
At the Austin tea party , Governor Perry , still flushed with the excitement of denouncing federal oppression from the platform , told reporters , “ When we came in the union , in 1845 , one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that . ”
He added , a little ominously :
My hope is that America , and Washington in particular , pays attention .
We ’ve got a great Union .
There ’s absolutely no reason to dissolve it .
But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people , who knows what might come out of that .
Or , translated into New Yorkese : Nice little Union you got there .
Be a shame if anything happened to it .
The Governor is mistaken about Texas having been admitted to the Union with an opt - out provision ; the actual deal was that Texas , with Congress ’s permission , could theoretically divide itself into five states .
Exiting the United States is not as simple as resigning from a restricted country club .
Since “ the Constitution , in all its provisions , looks to an indestructible Union ” ( Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase , Texas v. White , 1869 ) , Perry would need either a constitutional amendment or a Supreme Court chock - full of Scaliaesque “ originalists . ”
Putting aside the technicalities , though , what about the merits ?
Secession has been in questionable odor ever since Fort Sumter , but there are big differences between then and now .
The cause of the Civil War was slavery , and the white South ’s determination , in Lincoln ’s phrase , “ to strengthen , perpetuate , and extend ” it .
That was something worth fighting against , if not worth fighting for .
But a difference of opinion about a marginal tax rate ?
There is , to be sure , a superficial parallel : just as only a minority of Southern whites owned slaves , only a tiny minority of Texans are due for a tax increase .
It ’s an aspirational thing .
According to a poll taken the other day , a mere third of the people of the Lone Star State , and only half of Texas Republicans , are currently inclined to secede .
But , if the numbers mount , might it not be better for all concerned if we just let Texas — and , by extension , any other parts of the old Confederacy that wish to accompany it — go ?
Despite Perry ’s fighting words , there is no reason for the separation to be an occasion for violence .
The globe is replete with two - state solutions : India and Pakistan , Ethiopia and Eritrea , Israel and Palestine .
Admittedly , these may not be the best examples .
A closer parallel would be Czechoslovakia , which , in 1993 , split peacefully into the Czech Republic and Slovakia .
Like Czechs and Slovaks , Americans and Texans speak closely related languages , share a common , if not equally intense , interest in football games ( though the Dallas Cowboys could no longer style themselves “ America ’s Team ” ) , and enjoy each other ’s cuisines .
( Houston has a number of acceptable organic fusion restaurants , and there is a pretty fair barbecue place just a block from The New Yorker ’s offices . )
The border between the United States and the Federated States ( “ Confederate ” being a word that remains a little too provocative ) might not be as trouble - free as that between the United States and Canada , but , compared to the border with Mexico , it would probably require somewhat fewer armed citizen militias and fences topped with concertina wire to thwart illegal aliens desperate for a better life .
On balance , trade relations between the U.S. and the F.S. would be advantageous to both .
Cultural exchanges , tourism , and even a degree of military coöperation would be far from unthinkable .
For the old country , the benefits would be obvious .
A more intimately sized Congress would briskly enact sensible gun control , universal health insurance , and ample support for the arts , the humanities , and the sciences .
Although Texas itself has been a net contributor to the Treasury — it gets back ninety - four cents for each dollar it sends to Washington — nearly all the other potential F.S. states , especially the ones whose politicians complain most loudly about the federal jackboot , are on the dole .
( South Carolina , for example , receives $ 1.35 on the dollar , as compared with Illinois ’s seventy - five cents . )
Republicans would have a hard time winning elections for a generation or two , but eventually a responsible opposition party would emerge , along the lines of Britain ’s Conservatives , and a normal alternation in power could return .
The Federated States , meanwhile , could get on with the business of protecting the sanctity of marriage , mandating organized prayer sessions and the teaching of creationism in schools , and giving the theory that eliminating taxes increases government revenues a fair test .
Although Texas and the other likely F.S. states already conduct some eighty - six per cent of executions , their death rows remain clogged with thousands of prisoners kept alive by meddling judges .
These would be rapidly cleared out , providing more prison space for abortion providers .
Although there might be some economic dislocation at first , the F.S. could remedy this by taking advantage of its eligibility for OPEC membership and arranging a new “ oil shock . ”
Failing that , foreign aid could be solicited from Washington .
But the greatest benefit would be psychological : freed from the condescension of metropolitan élites and Hollywood degenerates , the new country could tap its dormant creativity and develop a truly distinctive Way of Life .
Not every Southerner would be eager to go along with the new order , so delicate diplomacy would be a must .
New Orleans might have to be made a “ free city , ” like Danzig ( now Gdańsk ) between the world wars .
If partitioning Austin along the lines of Cold War Berlin proved unfeasible , peacekeeping troops might have to be sent in .
But , before long , living side by side in peace and tranquillity , we could all say either “ God bless the United States of America ” or “ God bless the Federated States , ” as the case may be . ♦

Deft molecular detective work at Duke University Medical Center suggests that scientists may soon be able to resurrect niacin as one of the best and cheapest ways to manage cholesterol .
Niacin , also known as nicotinic acid or vitamin B3 , has long been regarded as one of the most effective weapons in managing cholesterol .
It can lower levels of triglycerides , fatty acids and to a lesser extent , the " bad " kind of cholesterol ( LDL ) while at the same time powerfully increasing the " good " kind ( HDL ) .
But there 's a catch – a big one .
Patients do n't like to take niacin because in most of them , it causes embarrassing , uncontrollable intense flushing , a rush of blood to the face and other skin surfaces accompanied by a prickling sensation .
Now , however , scientists have identified the discrete molecular pathways that are triggered when niacin enters the body , and they say that knowledge may lead to a revival of niacin - based treatments as therapies of choice .
" This opens up whole new realms for drug discovery , " says Robert Walters , M.D. , a dermatologist at Duke and the lead author of the study .
" Not only could it lead to new niacin - based therapies for cholesterol that patients could actually stick with , but it could also mean new treatments for flushing that comes with some types of allergic reactions , hives and other disorders . "
The discovery builds upon a growing body of knowledge at Duke about G protein coupled receptors , molecules that dot cell surfaces throughout the body and manage its response to drugs , hormones , pain , growth factors and many other incoming chemical signals .
Robert Lefkowitz , M.D. , a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Duke and the senior author of the study , was the first to identify these receptors and some of the roles they play in health and well - being .
Working together , Lefkowitz and Walters conducted various laboratory and animal experiments to track exactly what happens when niacin enters the body .
Earlier , others had found that it first activates a specific G protein coupled receptor known as GP109A .
This receptor , in turn , alerts other sets of proteins , including G proteins and a group referred to as beta-arrestins .
One particular protein in that group , beta - arrestin1 , was found to trigger the chemical reaction that led to flushing .

" Niacin stimulates production of a vasodilator that dramatically increases blood flow to the face , causing the flush and the hot , prickly sensation – and beta - arrestin1 is the culprit that enables that to happen , " says Walters .
" Interestingly , however , beta - arrestin1 plays no role whatsoever in niacin's ability to lower cholesterol and fatty acids .
The G proteins do that . "
The finding reinforces some of Lefkowitz 's recent research that demonstrated that beta- arrestins , which often work in tandem with G proteins , can sometimes work independently of them , initiating their own signals .
Lefkowitz says the discovery opens the door to the possibility of developing a " biased ligand , " a drug that would trigger GP109A , but not the beta- arrestins .
" That might give us a way to keep all the lipid - modifying benefits of niacin , but isolate its downside , " he said .
That might not be as simple as it sounds , however .
Other studies suggest that enhancing niacin's ability to boost HDL may be more complex than what appears at , well , first blush .
" GPR109A receptors are most often found in fat , the spleen , adrenal glands and lungs – they are absent from the liver and intestines , where most HDL is made and metabolized , so there may well be other mechanisms of action for the beneficial effects of niacin in addition to those performed by GPR109A , " says Lefkowitz .
Lefkowitz is a scientific founder of Trevena , a company that is developing G protein coupled receptor - targeted drugs .
The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health , the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and a Dermatology Foundation Physician Scientists Career Development Award to Dr. Walters .
Colleagues from Duke who contributed to the study include Arun Shukla , Jeffrey Kovacs , Christopher Lam and Erin Whalen , from the department of medicine , Jonathan Violin , from the department of biochemistry , Scott DeWire and J. Ruthie Chen , from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Michael Muehlbauer , from the Sarah W. Stedman Nutrition and Metabolism Center .
BitTorrent is already an important tool for millions of people who prefer their television on - demand , but integration with traditional TV - sets is still lacking .
This is about to change though , as the Tribler team announces version 5 of its next generation BitTorrent client .
Researchers from the Tribler P2P team at the Technical University of Delft , Netherlands , have been working on their next generation BitTorrent client for a few years now .
The initial releases worked well and innovative features were introduced frequently , even though the UI was still a little painful on the eyes .
Today the Tribler team releases the test builds of their V5 client .
To silence some of the critics and to ensure compatibility with standalone devices they have redesigned the user interface , which is now much cleaner so it can be easily navigated with a remote control .
When you launch Tribler all you have to do is put some keywords in the search box and you can download torrents instantly .
The search results are ranked by relevance and torrent quality , and if the torrent is well seeded you can play it instantly without having to wait for the download to complete .
Another key functionality of the new Tribler client is that the torrent search is fully distributed , meaning that the torrents come from within the network of peers and not from a torrent site or a central server .
This could potentially make BitTorrent indexers such as Mininova and isoHunt obsolete .
The downside of this type of search is that it is impossible to remove or moderate fake files .
In order to solve this problem the Tribler team will soon launch moderation and playlist features .
“ We aim to make P2P easy to control and use .
The power of P2P can be included in every television if we solve this issue , ” Dr. Johan Pouwelse told Torrent Freak .
“ We are continuously working on simplifying P2P and are moving towards making it suitable to operate with a remote control . ”
The scientists behind Tribler are part of the EU funded P2P - Next project .
They work together with the BBC and several other European television broadcasters , as well as hardware developers such as Pioneer .
Tribler ’s new interface
A test release of Tribler 5 is available for Windows , Mac and Ubuntu .
Tribler ’s Johan Pouwelse encourages everyone to give it a try , and provide feedback so the team can improve the client and help to bring BitTorrent to your TV as quickly as possible .
Companies will be forced to reveal how much they pay male employees compared to the salaries women receive , under legislation designed to tackle the gender pay gap to be published next week .
All companies employing more than 250 people will be obliged to publish a percentage figure showing how much more men are paid than their female colleagues .
The equalities minister , Harriet Harman , has said that the first step to tackling pay inequalities is to increase transparency , so that women know whether they are being paid less then men .
On average , women working full - time receive 17 % less than their male colleagues , and female part - time workers are paid 36 % less .
The measure will not require companies to conduct comprehensive pay audits , based on evaluating the individual salary of every staff member , but will be much simpler to calculate – by averaging men's hourly salaries and those of women , and making a company - wide comparison .
Details of how the figures should be compiled and published will be worked out by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ) later in the year .
In the light of recent research by the EHRC showing that men's bonuses and annual incentive payments were on average 79 % higher than those of women , companies will be obliged to include bonuses in the calculation .
Public sector organisations with over 150 employees will also be required to publish a similar statistic .
Companies that have a large gender pay divide will then be given until 2013 to improve their record .
If they take no action , they could face prosecution .
The full details of the measure will be included in the equalities bill on Monday .
In the interests of greater transparency , the bill will also ban " gagging clauses " that prevent individuals from disclosing their salaries .
However , equal pay campaigners warn that this will have little impact because not many companies have gagging clauses and , in any case , people in Britain tend to be reticent about discussing their pay .
There was concern from the business community about the cost involved in compiling these statistics , and the cost of paying for retrospective equal pay claims that could be triggered by the publication of the figures .
But the union response was more positive .
Bronwyn McKenna , Unison 's director of organising and membership , said she would welcome any measure that helped to tackle the pay gap .
" Too few women currently get equal pay through the courts .
It is a lengthy and hugely costly process which forces women to jump over numerous technical hurdles , " she said .
When Heath Ledger 's family stepped onstage at the Kodak Theatre in Hollywood to accept his posthumous Oscar , it was billed as both a moving and triumphant end to the late actor 's tragically short - lived career .
There is , however , a final chapter still to be written in the Heath Ledger story .
For at the time of his death , the tortured genius whose Joker lifted The Dark Knight into the premier league of modern blockbusters was working on another eerily complex film role .
That movie , which will represent Ledger 's true swansong , is called The Imaginarium Of Dr Parnassus .
It was directed by the British former Monty Python star Terry Gilliam , and has been billed as a " fantastic " tale about a travelling circus magician who makes a series of Faustian pacts with the devil .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Gilliam was a third of the way through the production process when Ledger was killed by an overdose of prescription painkillers .
He decided to dramatically rejig his script – and invited a selection of prominent actors to perform what remained of his role .
The resulting Dr Parnassus stars Johnny Depp , Colin Farrell and Jude Law in Ledger 's place .
It was independently financed , cost $ 20 m ( £ 14 m ) to make , and was finished in August last year .
Yet there remains a pressing problem .
Despite its stellar cast and alluring back - story , not to mention Ledger 's enduring box office appeal ( The Dark Knight last week surpassed $ 1bn in ticket sales ) , America at present has no prospect of seeing Dr Parnassus in cinemas .
For reasons which are not fully clear , Gilliam 's film has so far failed to secure a US distribution deal .
Though negotiations with several prospective commercial partners are ongoing , it has yet to be awarded a release date .
Unless it finds a theatrical distributor willing to pay the going rate for rights to screen it in cinemas , Dr Parnassus will face the fate of the hundreds of other independent films which fail to secure a deal : it will go straight to DVD .
That would be an extraordinary fate for a movie that is already the subject of a strong buzz , and which received a glowing reference by Ledger 's sister , Kate , at the Oscars .
" We 've seen a little bit of footage , and I think it 's going to be amazing , " she insisted to a backstage press conference .
" Terry Gilliam is amazing and Heath always had such enthusiasm and interest in whatever Terry was doing . "
The Hollywood Reporter last week published an investigation which concluded that negotiations between the movie 's production company , Davis Films , and major US buyers Lionsgate and Overture during the summer had proved fruitless .
" That has fuelled all sorts of rumours in indie circles , ranging from dissent over finances on the producers ' side to outsized expectations on the part of filmmakers , " the Reporter noted .
At present , Dr Parnassus has effectively been " on sale " for six months .
Potential buyers may be wary of its eccentric subject matter and fantasy - driven plot , which traditionally prevent a film securing mass - market approval .
Publicity photos show a white - faced Ledger in a clown 's outfit .
The movie 's synopsis meanwhile requires a significant suspension of disbelief : it involves a surreal contest between the 1,000 - year - old Dr Parnassus ( played by Christopher Plummer ) and the devil ( known as Mr Nick , and played by Tom Waits ) .
Ledger 's character , Tony , is a mysterious outsider who apparently travels through a dream world .
In what could be either a stroke of genius on Gilliam 's part or an elaborate folly , Farrell , Law and Depp play different " transformations " of Tony 's personality .
" Even with the Ledger hook , a distributor would have a hard time with marketing , " mooted The Hollywood Reporter .
" Gilliam has grown more experimental in recent years with such fare as Tideland and The Brothers Grimm ... [ and ] retailing Dr Parnassus as a Ledger film risks running a word - of - mouth problem with general audiences who are not accustomed to that kind of material . "
In the UK , where Gilliam has a strong following , Mandate International was able to justify splashing out for distribution rights , and is scheduled to release the film in June .
Its relatively large budget means Dr Parnassus would have to reach a wide audience in order to turn a profit .
Most experts still expect the film to get a release – and rumours suggest a deal , of sorts , may be announced imminently .
But unless a major buyer makes an offer , the film could be limited to a relatively small number of screens in major US cities .
Ledger 's former agent , Steve Alexander , did n't respond to requests for a comment about the film 's future yesterday .
The British screenwriter and film producer Allan Schiach , a former friend of the late actor who was due to work with him on an adaptation of the novel The Queen 's Gambit , said he thought it " inconceivable " that Ledger 's swansong would never see the light of day .
" You just do n't know what 's going on .
The producers could be asking for too much money ; the distributors could want to market the film , or structure a deal in a particular way .
There 's all sorts of reasons a sale could take so long .
" Terry Gilliam has done this brilliant job of replacing him with these amazing stars .
Jude Law , Colin Farrell and Johnny Depp are an incredible line - up , and I simply do not believe the film is unreleasable . "
Bad timing : Actors who died during production
* James Dean ( died 30 September 1955 ) Giant .
The first actor nominated for a posthumous Academy Award for best actor and the only person to be nominated after death twice in acting categories , one of which was for Giant .
Died in a head - on collision driving to a sports car race .
The last scene he filmed of Giant was re-recorded because he died before the editing process began .
* Richard Harris ( died 25 October 2002 ) Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets .
Won a Golden Globe in 1968 for his performance as King Arthur in Camelot .
He died of Hodgkin 's disease two - and - a - half weeks before Chamber Of Secrets premiered in the US .
The year before , he said he feared his part in the Harry Potter films would outshine the rest of his long career .
Michael Gambon took on his role .
* Oliver Reed ( died 2 May 1999 ) Gladiator .
Reed died aged 61 from a sudden heart attack during a filming break from Gladiator , in which he played Proximo .
It was almost exactly a year before the film 's release .
Due to the timing , some scenes had to be completed using computer - generated images .

CHICAGO ( Reuters ) - Teenage and young adult men who make serious suicide attempts often had emotional problems at age 8 , while most suicidal women succumb to depressions that develop after puberty , Finnish researchers said on Monday .

Nearly four out of five suicidal men tracked in a study in Finland had exhibited problems as 8 - year - olds that were evident to their teachers or parents .
“ Most males who commit suicide or need hospital care after a suicide attempt have high levels of psychiatric problems at the age of 8 years , ” wrote Dr. Andre Sourander of Turku University Hospital in Finland and colleagues .
“ The main finding of our study is that severe suicidality in adolescence and early adulthood has different childhood trajectories among males and females , ” they wrote in a report published in the Archives of General Psychiatry .
The study tracked 5,302 people born in 1981 , of whom 27 men and 27 women made serious suicide attempts by age 24 .
Of those , 13 men and two women died .
According to the World Health Organization , 877,000 people worldwide kill themselves each year .
For every suicide death , anywhere from 10 to 40 attempts are made , the U.N. agency estimates .
Males tended to use “ more lethal ” methods , while female suicide attempts were mostly by intoxication or poisoning , according to the Finnish study .
In what they termed a “ pathway of persistence , ” 78 percent of the suicidal males had displayed bad conduct at age 8 such as disruptive fits of temper , disobedience , aggression or cruelty toward others , destroying of property , stealing , lying , inattention or hyperactivity .
No such pattern was seen for the girls .
Sourander ’s team said previous research has shown “ female suicide attempts are often used to communicate distress or to modify the behavior and reactions of others . ”
Most mood disorders affect girls after puberty , they added .
They urged effective screening to detect and treat childhood disorders , in the hope of reducing suicide rates .
“ This focus is particularly important among males with severe conduct problems because , during adolescence , they usually do not seek mental health services , ” Sourander wrote .
The confirmation today by the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , that the government intends to go ahead with plans to grant itself unchecked and unscrutinised access to all our communications data must draw a battle line for all civil liberties groups and everyone who cares for the future of freedom and privacy in the United Kingdom .
On the surface , the statement from the Home Office may appear to offer some withdrawal from the data silo –containing all communications data– proposedin the Queen 's speech .
However in effect the state will still grant itself total freedom to see whom we are contacting , when and where .
The only difference is that civil servants will demand that private telecoms companies and internet service providers do their dirty work for them .
They will retain our data so that it may be trawled by tens of thousands of people employed by the state .
Who knows what conclusions will be drawn from innocent web searches , phonecalls and emails ?
Who dares to predict the kinds of abuse by the government , which is already tracking legitimate protesters in real time with automatic number recognition camera network cameras and infiltrating environmental groups with informers and spies ?
This outsourcing of the state 's data collection is the government 's response to the era of austerity – in a similar move it will require travel agencies and tour companies to collect 53 pieces of information for the e-Borders scheme when we travel abroad .
We should not be lulled into seeing this as change in the government 's goal of knowing everything about every one of us .
The civil servants behind the scheme have a very long horizon indeed – an agenda that is designed to survive cuts in public spending and any change of government .
They will argue the urgent necessity of the case with force and plausibility to inexperienced Conservative ministers , as they have done to the co-operative second raters in the present government .
I pray that a future government will have the gumption , sense of history and political values to resist these arguments and to listen instead to the former director of public prosecutions Sir Ken Macdonald , who said : " This database would be an unimaginable hell house of personal private information .
It would be a complete read - out of every citizen 's life in the most intimate and demeaning detail . "
The data silo may have been canned but the violation continues .
If we had not been so ground down by Labour 's war on liberty and privacy there would certainly be an outcry at this disgraceful proposal .
Ministers say that we are merely complying with European demands for greater access to communications but what they do not explain is that they lobbied Europe for these very measures .
Their effect is well described by campaign group NO2ID 's general secretary , Guy Herbert , who said : " Officials from dozens of departments and quangos could know what you read online , and who all your friends are , who you emailed , when , and where you were when you did so – all without a warrant .
Tracking your every move is more efficiently creepy than reading your letters . "
Think of the abuses that have been allowed under the extension of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers
Act and you know we may come to regret it if we do not stand up to the government now .
Meanwhile I leave you with this thought which began a piece in the Daily Telegraph .

Cessna 172s are used in flying schools in many countries
A small plane reported stolen from an airport in Canada has been intercepted by US fighter jets and forced to land in the US state of Missouri .
Pentagon officials said the pilot had flown erratically and did not respond to requests to establish contact .
The pursuit continued across Michigan , Wisconsin and Illinois before the plane landed on a highway near Ellsinore .
A state trooper who helped arrest the man said he had wanted to kill himself by being shot down .
A spokeswoman from the US Federal Aviation Administration said the Cessna 172 came from a flight school at Thunder Bay Airport , Ontario , from where it was reported stolen .
The head of the school , Judi Maundrell , said someone apparently " jumped over the fence and just jumped into an aircraft " .
" It was sitting as usual parked on the ramp .
The keys are in all the aircraft because students are using them , " she said .
The single - engine aircraft was intercepted by fighter jets , but kept heading south .
It landed about six hours after the reported theft , according to officials .
The Missouri state trooper who made the arrest said the pilot told him he had hoped to be shot down .
" He made a statement that he was trying to commit suicide and he did n't have the courage to do it himself , " Justin Watson told ABC television .
" And his idea was to fly the aircraft into the United States , where he would be shot down . "
Apple retail stores on Thursday began receiving the company 's third - generation 4GB iPod shuffle in extremely limited quantities .
What follows are a few dozen unboxing and comparison shots , along with some commentary .
Average to mid-size Apple stores we spoke with report receiving only a couple dozen of each color ( black and gray ) as part of their initial shipment , with more expected by the end of the week .
Thus far , the black model is proving to be far more popular with early adopters than the grey model , and was expected to sell out at several locations by day 's end .
Apple says the third - gen iPod shuffle ships in packaging that 's 40 % smaller and 33 % lighter than the one used for the second - gen shuffle , and it shows ( comparison photos below ) .
The plastic capsule - like container can be concealed almost completely in the palm of your hand .
Inside the box is a pair of Apple Earphones with Â Remote , a 1.8 - inch iPod shuffle Dock sync USB cable , a Quick Start guide , and of course the 4GB shuffle itself .
The first thing we noticed is how incredibly tiny the player is .
It 's no bigger than the length and width of three pieces of Chiclets chewing gum aligned side - by - side .
It 's also considerably smaller than the mini BiC lighters it resembles .
If you 've ever gone diving between the couch cushions to find your misplaced Apple Bluetooth Headset , watch out with the new shuffle .
It 's most comparable in size — slight shorter but wider , and approximately the same width ( not factoring in the headset 's earpiece ) .
On top , there 's a 3.5 mm stereo headphone jack , a three - way control switch ( shuffle , play in order , turn off ) and tiny LED that could easily be mistaken for a spec of dust or some other form of debris .
Meanwhile , the back sports a new version of the shuffle 's familiar clip , only this time with a chromed finish and grainy off - white Apple logo with a bit of sparkle .
More generally speaking , the precision anodized aluminum molding of the player is perfection at its finest .
While floating in its retail packaging , the new shuffle appears to lack seams entirely .
It 's only after a close inspection that you 'll notice seams for what looks like a trap door mostly obscured by the clip on the back of the device .
At this juncture , it would also be impossible for Apple to deliver a thinner digital music player without substituting the 3.5 mm jack with a new generation of connector .
It 's that thin .

Skype will be spun off in an IPO early next year , eBay announced Tuesday , acknowledging that the internet telephone company the auction giant acquired three years ago for $ 2.6 billion was a bad fit .
" Skype is a great stand - alone business with strong fundamentals and accelerating momentum , " eBay President and CEO John Donahoe said in a statement .
" But it 's clear that Skype has limited synergies with eBay and PayPal .
We believe operating Skype as a stand - alone publicly traded company is the best path for maximizing its potential . "
Investors seemed pleased by the prospect , pushing up eBay shares more than 3 percent in after - hours trading .
But analysts questioned both the timing of the move and Skype 's potential valuation .
Donahoe telegraphed his intentions to unload Skype earlier this year — even using the same " great stand - alone business " phrase to describe Skype to analysts during his Q4 call .
But the use of an IPO — de rigeur in the heady days before the dot - com bust but not so much these days — comes as something of a surprise .
The news follows by a day word that eBay had sold StumbleUpon back to its owners , and speculation by the New York Times on Saturday that eBay might sell Skype back to its founders , Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis , as well .
The two initiatives herald in a new , post - Meg Whitman era strategy of concentrating on eBay 's core , retail - oriented businesses .
" ... separating Skype will allow eBay to focus entirely on our two core growth engines — e-commerce and online payments — and deliver long - term value to our stockholders , " Donahoe said .
It also signals confidence by a major Silicon Valley company about what market conditions will be in about 12 months after a year in which IPO activity virtually ground to a halt .
The precise timing of the Skype IPO would be based on market conditions , the company said , but it intends to complete the offering in the first half of 2010 .
EBay acknowledged some time ago that it had overpaid for Skype by about $ 1 billion — the purchase price was $ 2.6 billion but the New York Times has reported the total cost reached $ 3.1 billion after bonus payouts to founders .
It took a took a $ 1.4 billion charge on purchase price in early 2007 .
Purchase price aside , the acquisition never seemed to make much sense .
One of the initial rationales behind the purchase — a " click to talk " feature integrated in eBay auction pages to give buyers and sellers a more immediate means of communicating with each other — never caught on and was abandoned .
After that , with credible synergies elusive , the only justification for owning a non-strategic property like Skype would be if it added significantly to the bottom line .
It does n't .
Ebay posted $ 8.54 billion in revenue last year , to which Skype contributed a paltry $ 550 million — about $ 1.35 per user .
The basic service , calls over the internet to other Skype users , is free .
Revenue comes from such up - charges as calls out to the normal telephone system , a rented telephone number so non-Skype members can call in and voicemail - to - text conversion .
Yet , Skype has enormous global street cred with its millions of users , and is the world 's leading international telephone company .
With the ultra portability of mobile phones and Wi-Fi connectivity become increasingly ubiquitous , VoIP is moving far away from the geeky confines of its headset - and - desktop roots .
The company has recently been making aggressive moves to increase its already significant market share and , with that , revenue opportunities .
Last month , it announced an app for the iPhone and Blackberry and an initiative to move into the enterprise VoIP space .
Downloads for the Skype iPhone app passed the 2 million mark in about a week , and a quarter of them were new users .
It 's anybody 's guess what additional revenue - producing plans eBay might have between now and the time of the IPO , but a valuation based on even a generous multiple - of - earnings alone would fall far short of what it paid .
EBay says it expects
Skype to top $ 1 billion in revenues in 2011 .
Analysts were not convinced market conditions would improve sufficiently by early 2010 and questioned whether even the expansion into wireless handsets would provide significant new revenue .
" The very first thing that I have to say is market conditions currently would not support an IPO of Skype in our opinion , " Commresearch analyst Gregory Lundberg told Reuters .
" 2010
will be equally questionable unless the business completely changes course with the launch of the Blackberry and iPhone applications . "
" The issue is the iPhone itself wo n't change that user base because
AT&T wo n't let it run on its network , only when it has connection to a Wi - Fi hotspot , " Lundberg said .
" That same sort of control is being exercised in
Europe by some carriers and that 's a major barrier to uptake . "

Keith Olbermann 's arrival as the lone commentator at NBC Nightly News is the first overt commentator NBC 's hired since PBS omnipresence Bill Moyers in 1995 .
A quick Nexis search shows Olbermann has been very rarely on NBC News airwaves .
He actually anchored NBC Nightly News as a weekend substitute on April 12 , 1998 ( Easter Sunday , see accompanying photo ) and May 9 , 1998 .
In recent years , he 's surfaced a few times on the Today show .
He was interviewed to plug his " Worst Person In the World " book last September 15 .
He reported on major - league shortstop Alex Rodriguez on February 16 , 2004 , and co-hosted the Saturday edition of Today with Campbell Brown on August 23 , 2003 .
In the commentary and prime - time special clauses of Olbermann 's new deal , there are obvious parallels with Moyers .
They are two fiercely left - wing commentators who oddly deny a liberal bias when asked by the press .
In February 1995 promotional spots NBC promised : " Bold , clear , balanced and fair .
Now NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw has a new dimension -- Bill Moyers . "
Moyers began his new duties on February 14 , 1995 , and NBC had no plans to provide a conservative counter - weight .
Just like the odd denials of Steve Capus that it's " really sad and pathetic " to think Olbermann tilts NBC further to the left , in February of 1995 , we reported in MediaWatch that the New York Times relayed February 1 that NBC News President Andy Lack dismissed questions about Moyers ' liberal bias at PBS , insisting " that perception is inside the beltway , and perhaps inside about ten blocks of New York and ten blocks of L.A.
I do n't think the American people give a whit about it . "
The same day the Baltimore Sun quoted Moyers : " I 'm not in politics .
I have no agenda .
I 'm not pushing a platform .
I have no ideology . "
Really ?
In a 1989 Esquire profile Moyers tagged Newt Gingrich as " Joe McCarthy with a southern accent . "
Here 's an example of his Nightly News commentary , from March 7 , 1995 : " Gingrich uses words as if they were napalm bombs ....
He sent conservative candidates a long list of words to smear their opponents -- words like ' sick , ' ' pathetic , ' ' traitors , ' ' corrupt , ' ' anti- family , ' ' disgrace . '
With talk radio quoting it all back to us , our political landscape is a toxic dump . "
Moyers only lasted a few months , leaving his evening - news spot due to heart trouble .
A year later , on April 12 , 1996 , Moyers hosted a Dateline NBC special blaming conservatives for the Oklahoma City bombing -- which might offer an inkling of the kind of prime - time Olbermann specials we might see :
As Welch listened to G. Gordon Liddy on his car radio , Moyers charged : " The airwaves are still saturated with militant rhetoric .
Day and night you can hear a stream of rage and insult directed with unremitting hostility at government and others .
It rubs like salt in deep wounds and some of the families are trying to counter it . "
Then , as viewers saw several victims being interviewed by KTOK's Carole Arnold , Moyers explained : " Emerging from their private grief , they appeal for an end of hateful talk and political invective .
Their experience is their message .
What a society sows , it reaps .... This local station has given the families a forum , but it also carries several hours of talk every day that they find inflammatory . "
The station does not carry Liddy , so the broadside against " hate " and " inflammatory " talk goes undefined .
Welch proceded to tell Arnold : " Of course I think the media need to be involved a little bit in a little bit of control of the hate radio going on .
I 'm very disturbed about that .
I mean where 's the responsibility ? "
... Moyers concluded the hour with this seeming indictment of House Speaker Newt Gingrich as co-conspirator : " It will never be the same .
The bombers saw to that .
The tears and grief , the pain and the sorrow were all intended .
Terrorism is the politics of murder .
We should have seen it coming .
Hate was in the air .
Government had been vilified , found guilty and sentenced to die .
It did n't matter who was in the way .
There are lessons for us here , something to take away from the wreckage of that day , if we 're listening , one year later . "
Woody Lewis is a Social Media Strategist and Web Architect .
He authors a blog at woodylewis.com about social media strategy for newspapers .
These days , everyone knows that one of the hottest stories any newspaper can cover is that of its own demise .
The collapse of print advertising and the downturn in sales , at the news stand and through subscriptions , has led to a frantic search for new ways to monetize content that ’s often available online for free .
Social media gives any business an interactive channel to communicate with its current and future customers .
For newspapers , that channel can increase the chances of survival in a market where commoditized information has diminished the value of individual brands .
Here are ten ways newspapers are using social media to save the industry .
1. Twitter headline feeds
With more than 280,000 followers , the New York Times ’ main Twitter feed dwarfs the Wall Street Journal ( 19,000 + ) , the Washington Post ( 4,800 + ) , and the Chicago Tribune ( 5,200 + ) .
Many metropolitan and small - town dailies have followed suit , creating a Twitter handle as an extension of their brand , but the Times , like other large dailies , has gone one step further , establishing channels for Books , Arts and Entertainment , and other sections .
These are sub-channels that support personalized interaction , a point of interest for advertisers .
2. Acquiring providers of social media services
In November , 2008 , Gannett Co. , publisher of 85 daily newspapers , acquired Ripple6 , Inc. , maker of a social networking platform that links marketers to end users .
By investing in a company that has already helped Procter & Gamble with its social media initiatives , Gannett will be better able to collaborate with its advertisers .
Look for more acquisitions , or partnerships , as legacy publishers broaden their online portfolios .
3 . Creating more online events to attract readers
The German newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung ( FAZ ) introduced a thematic website last month to promote the translation of The Kindly Ones , a controversial novel that has generated much publicity in Europe , and more recently the U.S.
By posting streaming video and a downloadable mp3 of a popular actor reading chapters from the book , and then creating daily discussion forums around related topics , FAZ generated a significant increase in traffic to its
Web site , which had seriously lagged those of its competitors .
4. Promoting and monetizing user - generated content
In 2007 , the Cincinnati Enquirer created CaptureCincinnati.com , a photo - sharing site where over a thousand local photographers uploaded nearly 12,000 images .
The best shots were featured in Capture Cincinnati , a coffee table photo book that included a DVD , selling at a retail price of $ 39.95 .
Last year , the numbers continued to improve , and the Enquirer expects strong sales of the 2008 edition as well .
Marketers might call this bundling products , but whatever you call it , the Enquirer probably wo n’t argue .
5. Story - based communities
The Toronto Globe and Mail uses Cover It Live , a live - blogging / discussion tool that provides interactive coverage of breaking news and live events such as conferences and hearings .
Real - time comments , audio and video postings , and polls are among the types of content that can be recorded and then embedded in the story , like this piece on a subway shooting in January .
6. Collaborative outsourced news services
While British startup
Yoosk bills itself as an “ interactive news magazine , ” it represents the type of outsourced service many newspapers may wind up using as their own resources dwindle .
Yoosk allows its users to put a question to politicians and celebrities , to comment on the publicly viewable answers , and to submit their own ideas for interview features .
Its founders hope to collaborate with established news sites , including newspapers willing to outsource parts of their magazine sections .
7. Customized delivery
Denver - based MediaNews Group , publisher of such major dailies as the Denver Post and Oakland Tribune , has announced plans to test a “ customized news delivery service called ‘ I - News ’ or ‘ Individuated News ” this summer with the LA Daily News .
This service would allow subscribers to choose from different categories , including news from other parts of the country .
Blending the offerings of regional newspapers into a separate platform may help more of them survive .
8. Branded communities
The St. Louis Post - Dispatch has launched MySTLtoday , a branded community featuring areas such as user - created groups , user - posted content , and special interest sections like St. Louis ’ BestBridal .
Excerpts from shared stories are printed each week in the legacy paper .
This might seem old - school , but it strengthens a traditional middle American brand , and it promotes more interaction , which helps advertisers pinpoint their targets .
9. Publishing APIs for third - party developers
The New York Times has taken the lead in an area sure to attract other organizations .
By publishing application programming interfaces , or APIs , for third - party software developers , the Times Developer Network has encouraged the creation of a new class of social media applications .
Developers have already produced mashups that combine Times content with other resources .
Advertisers should see new opportunities to embed messages tailored to the end user , and the Times may partner with those developers it deems worthy , avoiding the incremental cost of creating new applications internally .
UK's The Guardian has announced similar plans to open up its content with Open Platform .
10 .
Burning the boat that brought you
Unfortunately , this is n’t the most agreeable method for many , but social media applied to a smaller , virtual organization might be the way of the future .
As reported here last week , the Seattle Post - Intelligencer may move to an online - only version of its daily newspaper .
This is the ultimate way to save a paper through social media : make the Web its only channel of distribution , and leverage the history of the brand .
Loyalty wo n’t be hard to track , and the test of that loyalty will be the price point established by subscriptions , for individual sections or the entire publication .
The argument “ would you save this paper for the price of a latte ? ” becomes very cogent , especially in Seattle .
Social journalism
The word “ newspaper ” will take on a different meaning , like “ record album , ” or “ TV show . ”
It wo n’t go away , and it will continue to describe some of the most hallowed brand names in the world .
Social media will play a big part in that transformation .
As the dynamics of our society change , as institutions go public or private , or disappear entirely , the need to report these events in a responsible manner will be even more critical .
Social journalism is more than a buzzword , it ’s the way social media will save the industry .

This dish is so good , yet so bad for you .
There really ought to be a law against this kind of cooking .
In fact , I reckon that there used to be a law against such things , back in the day when churchmen were so worried about the status of everyone ’s mortal souls that laws were made against sins such as gluttony .
And if there is ever a recipe to incite gluttony , it is this one .
And here I am writing about it during Lent .
I ’m a very bad woman , a temptress , a sinner in the hands of a wicked kitchen muse .
This is what comes of being a godless heathen , I guess .
I have fallen , and I doubt I will ever , ever get up , because I do n’t feel the least bit guilty about making up this recipe .
Because , shoot , sometimes , you just have to eat something that is completely indulgent and delicious , even if it is n’t very good for you .
For most folks , that means dessert : chocolate truffles , cheesecake , pie or chocolate cream - cheese brownies .
As you can tell , I can throw down and make all of those aforementioned decadent desserts , but I prefer to make savory dishes that engage the senses and beguile the palate .
It ’s just how I am–in culinary school , I was one of those trainees who preferred cooking to baking , though I could do either very well .
As wonderful as baking can be , it requires a different skill set and a different creativity than cooking does–and I am one of those folks who think that truly wonderful pastry chefs and bakers are a breed apart from the rest of us .
I also tend to prefer eating savory dishes to sweet ones , though I am not certain why that is .
That is not to say I do n’t like all the cookies , cheesecakes , brownies , truffles and other wickedly tasty desserts I make , but I do n’t really crave them very often .
Certainly not anymore–as I have gotten older and I have started to lose weight , I have found that the foods I crave and eat as indulgences has changed .
I am more enamored of cheeses , especially the blue mold cheeses that I was denied most of my life , than I am of ice cream .
And bacon .
I can always eat bacon .
And as a hillbilly born and raised , I think that nearly anything can be improved if you add bacon to it .
I mean , fried rice is better with bacon .
And chicken and bok choy are elevated into the realm of amazing when bacon comes into the picture .
And hey , the Chinese agree with me–tofu with bacon bloody well rules .
So , why not bacon baked into waffles ?
I mean , you eat bacon - with - waffles , right ?
So , why not put it inside the waffles , and then top the whole thing with apples cooked in bacon fat , brown sugar , cinnamon and chilies .
That way , it is sweet , salty , bready , spicy and just plain old all - around good .
It is hillbilly food raised up into art .
And how can that be bad ?
( Which of course makes me wonder that if I open a restaurant whether I should open a pan-Asian fine dining establishment or a haute - hillbilly food emporium .
I am sort of stuck in the middle of the question with no answer . )
Of course , saturated fat is saturated fat , whether it comes from cocoa butter or bacon , and neither is particularly great for one ’s health , but at least I am avoiding the sugar .
Sort of , mostly .
Except for the sugar cooked into the apples , and the sugar in the waffles and the maple syrup drizzled on top .
Ah , hell , I guess that these waffles are probably just as unholy as a chunk of my cheesecake would be .
I guess you could say that it has no redeeming feature except that it tastes great and would make a knock - your - socks off brunch for omnivores who did n’t mind the fat from the bacon that inhabits both the waffles and the apples .
I do n’t intend this to be eaten every day , or even every week , or even once a month .
How about once every six months ?
And in between–eat lots of salads and stir - fried greens to make up for the indulgence of this one brunch dish .
Now , let ’s talk about the specifics of the waffle recipe .
I originally got it from Fine Cooking , and have modified it a little bit .
I switched butter for the oil , but the truth is , in this version , I switched back to canola oil .
You can use melted butter if you want , but the flavor of it is overpowered by the bacon added to the batter as it is being cooked .
So , just go with the canola or other mild vegetable oil .
The egg whites –you beat them until they come to soft peaks , then add sugar and beat to stiffer peaks and then fold it into the batter just before you scoop it into the waffle iron and bake .
Do n’t skip this step .
The waffles have a much better texture when made this way .
Do n’t use powdered buttermilk for these waffles –I did once .
It was not a good substitute .
Just get some buttermilk and use it .
If you have leftover buttermilk , make biscuits .
Or scones .
Or dumplings .
Or ranch dressing .
Just do n’t do the powdered crap–it really does n’t taste good in the waffles .
Also–if you do n’t want to put the waffles into an oven to crisp up , or if you oven is n’t convection and thus does n’t seem to be crisping them up –you can use your toaster to crisp them up before serving .
It is a sneaky little trick , but it works .
Just cut your finished waffle into the four sections delineated by the iron , then put each little waffle into a slot in the toaster and toast on the lowest setting .
In one or two passes with the toaster , they crisp right up .
Then , you can put them on the oven rack to hold them for service .
One more thing –this recipe is for a regular waffle iron that makes ten or twelve inch square waffles that are then cut into four small waffles , not for a Belgian waffle maker .
I have no idea if it will work with a Belgian waffle iron , nor do I know how many waffles it would make in a Belgian waffle iron .
So , if you have a different kind of waffle maker , you will have to experiment a bit to see how it all works together .
As for the apples –you can fry them in butter , but since you already have hot bacon grease sitting right there , why not use that ?
It is n’t like butter is better for you , and the smokey pork flavor goes beautifully with the apples .
Besides ,
West Virginia grandmas have been frying the apples like that for years , and so there is the weight of tradition behind it–traditional and frugality .
And –you can leave out the chilies , but I beg you not to .
They are part of what elevates this dish from pretty darned good into sublime .
So , I beg you to get some Aleppo pepper flakes –you can get them at Penzey ’s or at various Middle Eastern grocery stores–and use them .
Once you have them , you will use their sweet - hot tingly savor to make lots of your foods sparkle .
Trust me –I love the stuff , and I know that you will find uses for it beyond fried apples .
So here we come to the recipe –the one that inspired Brittney to say to me , “ You would make such a great evil genius , especially in the kitchen . ”
Bacon -Filled Waffles With Chili -Spiced Fried Apples
Ingredients for the Waffles :
1 1/2 cups all purpose flour
1/2 cup cornstarch
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/2 cups buttermilk
1/2 cup milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract or vanilla bean paste
12 tablespoons canola oil
2 large eggs separated
2 tablespoons sugar
1/3 cup crumbled cooked bacon ( cook until chewy , and then chop finely –if it is too crisp , it will dry out in the waffle iron and not taste as good . )
Canola oil spray
Method :
Heat your oven to 200 degrees F. and plug in your waffle iron and start it heating .
Whisk the dry ingredients together thoroughly except for the sugar and bacon in a large mixing bowl .
Set aside .
Whisk together the milks , vanilla , canola oil and egg yolks in a large measuring cup or batter bowl until well combined .
In another bowl , whisk the egg whites until they form soft peaks .
Sprinkle the sugar over them and continue whisking until they form fairly stiff peaks .
Blend together the liquid into the dry ingredients until they are just combined .
Do not overmix .
Fold in the egg whites .
Spray your waffle iron well with canola oil spray .
Fill the iron with scoops of batter without overfilling the iron .
Sprinkle with an even layer of bacon bits .
Close waffle iron and cook as directed .
When baked , remove from iron , cut into fourths along guidelines and lay in oven on racks in a single layer to crisp up .
( You can also crisp them in the toaster as I directed in the post and then hold them in a single layer in the oven .
This works a bit better in my opinion . )
Serve topped with fried apples and a bit of maple syrup .
Ingredients for Chili - Fried Apples :
3 1/2 tablespoons bacon drippings or grease , depending on what you want to call them
4 crisp tart apples , peeled , cored and cut into thick slices ( see photo for reference )
1/4 cup raw , brown or maple sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon Aleppo pepper flakes
Aleppo pepper flakes and maple syrup for serving / garnish
Method :
Heat your bacon drippings or grease over a medium flame in a skillet or frying pan .
Add apples in a single layer and cook , stirring , until they soften to where they can be pierced by a fork , but they still are a bit hard in the center and they are golden colored .
Sprinkle with sugar , cinnamon and chili flakes , and keep cooking , stirring constantly , until they are fragrant , glazed with a thick syrup and are soft through without being mushy .
Serve spooned over the bacon waffles with a drizzle of maple syrup and if you like another sprinkle of Aleppo pepper flakes .
( These would be good over home - made sour cream vanilla ice cream , especially if you added black walnuts to the mixture . )

My post on mind control properties in semen still attracts a disturbing amount of attention .
So to appease your curiosity — and , I ’ll admit it , mine — I ’ve decided to do a little more investigation into the compounds in semen that may enter the bloodstream after sex .
Some may have an indirect effect on the recipient ’s hormones .
A few may breach the blood - brain barrier , directly influencing mood and sex drive .
Several , but not all , of the chemicals have been studied and proven to pass through the vaginal walls .
From an evolutionary perspective , mood - modulating components in semen may give a woman an incentive to be in a committed relationship with regular , frequent sex .
Apparently , the goo is bonding .
The information below comes from SUNY Albany evolutionary psychologists Gordon Gallup and Rebecca Burch , whose fascinating study on semen and depression I describe in BLONDES .
Gallup and Burch wrote a chapter , “ The psychobiology of human semen , ” published in a compilation of research on sexuality .
What they describe , I think , is fascinating .
The primary putative mind - altering ingredients in semen :
Luteinizing hormone : astounding concentration in semen ; linked to high sperm count and motility .
Absorption into female bloodstream may facilitate or even induce ovulation .
Prolactin : influences maternal behavior , oxytocin secretion ; mediates bonding
Estrone and estradiol : assists in recipient ’s absorption of other compounds such as progesterone ; may boost woman ’s sexual motivation and mood
Testosterone : may increase sex drive and motivation ; the more intercourse , the higher the testosterone levels in women , and the stronger the sexual desire .
More than half the amount of testosterone in sperm has been found to be absorbed by the vagina .
Cytokines : these are the “ warriors , ” they suppress immune reaction to semen invading the vagina and cervix and therefore increase likelihood of pregnancy
Enkephalins : these opioids may contribute to orgasmic experience .
They may decrease anxiety and cause drowsiness after sex .
There ’s also speculation that they assist in immune function and “ reinforcing effects ” — making a woman come back for more , i.e. addiction ( although the absorption rate in female bloodstream is unknown )
Oxytocin : assists in stimulation of ovulation , increases production of other hormones , initiates bonding , facilitates orgasmic contractions ; may strengthen bonding and make sexual activity more rewarding
Placental proteins , including human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hcg ) and human placental lactogen : associated with sperm motility ; may increase chances of pregnancy
Relaxin : made in the prostate , this hormone may facilitate fertilization , implantation , and uterine growth .
The role of relaxin suggests that women should keep having a lot of sex during pregnancy because sperm has pregnancy - maintaining properties .
Relaxin also facilitates implantation and prevents preterm labor .
Thyrotropin - releasing hormones : potential anti-depressive ; works by stimulating the release of thyroid - stimulating hormone , which in turn triggers hormone production in the mood - mediating thyroid gland .
In pill form , it ’s used to treat PMS and depression .
Serotonin : increases sperm motility .
It also mediates mood , although not much known yet about vaginal absorption .
Even if it does n’t make it to the brain , it may indirectly alter behavior and emotions by contributing the building blocks of serotonin
Melatonin : increases effects of steroid hormones ; induces sleepiness and fatigue , which may help the woman relax after sex ; may stimulate reproductive function , also mood mediator ; low melatonin levels are associated with depression and “ reality disturbance ”
Tyrosine : a precursor of neurotransmitters such as dopamine , the hormone of reward and addiction , and norepinephrine , involved in attention and arousal
Oh , and there ’s also sperm in there , the DNA - bearing courier .
Sperm is less than 3 percent the total volume of semen .
But as it turns out , the bath water is nearly as important as the baby .
n.b. Although not yet studied , researchers suspect that these chemicals in semen may also enter the bloodstream through mucous membranes when having oral and anal sex .
If so , straight women are n’t the only lucky recipients .
The victory for the entertainment business was Pyrrhic , although this initial success is dampened by a possible mistrial .
Nevertheless , four Swedes have been martyred .
Yet content creators and consumers are no closer to new business models that solve the problem .
Piracy is not usually honorable .
But it is often a symptom of some kind of failure or injustice .
The 17th Century pirates of the high seas were rebelling against tyrannical maritime labor practices .
The pirates in Somalia are a direct result of government failure , and the pirates put on trial in Sweden were the result of a market failure , which is sadly now a decade old .
That the market has not come up with alternatives to file - sharing good enough to make piracy moot is the real problem , and the companies and individuals that have stood in the way of this are the ones who owe content creators an explanation .
Extremists on both sides are hailing this as a win , but it ’s the majority of us in the middle who continue to lose out .
This was a show trial about money and politics , but most of all it was a sideshow .
This argument is over and the entertainment industries should be focusing on the licensing schemes , royalty agreements and the new business models content creators desperately need .
Thankfully many more of them are .
But this verdict will encourage the ones who are not to continue pretending there is some other way around this problem that involves suing people .
No one should have to accept people “ stealing ” their work , just as no one should have to accept a company demanding that its business model works when it does n’t .
But we all have to adapt to new market realities .
The way we communicate and distribute all kinds of information will continue to change at an alarming pace .
Taking hard - line measures against file - sharing in the interests of a handful of large organizations sets a dangerous precedent for the future of privacy , net neutrality and freedom of speech .
Intellectual property laws are about striking a balance between the interests of individual IP creators and society as a whole .
If the law tips too far in either direction , the whole system will fall .
Bad legal decisions on piracy may actually end up doing more damage than the piracy itself .
The Pirate Bay verdict gives lawyers everywhere a mandate to continue chasing shadows .
It wo n’t stop the Pirate Bay , let alone online piracy .
The enormous surge in the Pirate Party ’s membership that was reported after the trial is just the beginning .
Most of the commentary that followed rightly talked of cutting heads off hydras and hitting hornet ’s nests , etc .
What that really means is anonymity features and non-accountability measures being baked into BitTorrent software , probably in the next six months to a year .
Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde said after the trial that “ there ’s no difference between us and Google . ”
The judge thought there was a difference – intent .
The Pirate Bay was all about file - sharing and Google is not .
But thanks to this trial the next generation of file - sharing sites will be much more secretive .
The next mutation of The Pirate Bay will have no subversive rhetoric and wo n’t mock the labels and studios chasing it .
It will be silent .
It wo n’t respond .
It wont be nearly as fun as TPB , but there will be no real differences between it and Google .
No one will be able to prove intent , making it even more of a threat .
Does n’t exactly sound like a win for anybody in the business of creating content .
The real winners wo n’t be the ones that come out on top of this long , bitter trial process , appeals and all , which could take five years .
It will be the side that develops the new technologies that will render that court decision meaningless before it is even issued .
They may be Scandinavian pirates or Hollywood privateers , or some combination of thereof .
The file - sharing community is working ten times harder because of this trial .
The entertainment industries would be wise to do the same , and wiser to find ways to work with the pirates they continue to fight .
The fact that they did n’t do so ten years ago cost a generation of artists billions .
No - one is ever going to trial for that .

Credit and debit card fraud is the No. 1 fear of Americans in the midst of the global financial crisis , according to a report by Unisys , an information technology company .
Concern about fraud supersedes that of terrorism , computer and health viruses and personal safety .
According to research conducted in February 2009 and released in March , 68 percent of the more than 1,000 respondents are extremely or very concerned about other people obtaining their credit or debit card data .
Additionally , 66 percent of respondents said they are extremely or very concerned about identity fraud .
Only 58 percent said they are extremely or very concerned about terrorism and war , and 41 percent say they feel the same about a serious health epidemic occurring .
National security issues such as war and terrorism were at the lowest measurement of concern among the respondents since the the company began the survey , which is compounded into the Unisys Security Index , in August 2007 .
The index is a biannual statistical measure about consumers ’ concerns in the area of national , financial , Internet and personal safety and security .
Eight specific issues , which vary depending on current events and the region the index is measured , are weighed against the categories .
Consumer concern is taken on a scale of zero to 300 .
“ The economy ’s pervasive effects go well beyond job losses and home foreclosures , ” says Tim Kelleher , vice president and general manager of Managed Security Services for Unisys .
“ Our data show most people see an immediate , personal risk from greater fraud . ”

While Mr. Lewis remains chief executive — the board expressed its unanimous support for him — many inside and outside the bank wonder if he can hang on .
Mr. Lewis confronts daunting challenges , and many of his investors are losing patience .
Even after receiving billions of taxpayer dollars , some analysts say , the bank may still need to raise more to shore up its weakened finances .
“ Ken Lewis has now become the lightning rod of controversy , and that is highly distracting , ” said Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld , a professor at the Yale School of Management , who believes Mr. Lewis should resign .
“ Even if everything he did was appropriate , it has hampered his legitimacy to lead . ”
It was not long ago that Mr. Lewis was celebrated for his vision .
His daring takeover of Merrill Lynch was the latest in a series of high - profile acquisitions that helped transform Bank of America into a national powerhouse .
His conquests included the Countrywide Financial Group , the giant mortgage lender which , for many , came to symbolize the excesses of the subprime era .
In December , the American Banker , the daily chronicle of the banking industry , named him 2008 Banker of the Year .

But that was then .
Now Mr. Lewis is drawing fire for overpaying for Merrill , whose gaping losses prompted Bank of America to seek a second rescue from Washington .
The attorney general of New York is examining whether Mr. Lewis adequately disclosed the risks of the takeover to his shareholders , drawing headlines — and more ire .
The timing could hardly be worse .
Bank of America is bracing for another wave of loans to go bad as the recession drags on .

Incredible must - watch clip .
This is a clip of a borrower calling the show questioning why he should continue to pay for a home for which he owes so much more than it is worth .
The guy bought the home for $ 600 k and put a 50 % down payment on it .
Now he owes $ 350 k due to neg - am but the value has dropped from $ 600 k to $ 270 k .
This guy has been destroyed losing $ 300 k cash .
He wants to stop the pain .
The loan adjusts soon and his payments will double .
The hosts gang up on this guy relentlessly essentially blaming him saying a ) you made a contract that you must repay b ) even if you have to give up your kids education you made a commitment c ) you will drag down all your neighbors value d) you will not be able to ever buy or rent d ) you are getting ‘ value ’ by staying in the home because its a place to live e ) you have to take responsibility for your action f ) you likely lived beyond your means and now you have to sacrifice g ) pay extra to principal to make it up .
etc
The homeowners do not stand a chance against thinking like this .
As we exit the ‘ Subprime Implosion ’ and into enter the Alt - A , Pay Option , Jumbo Prime and Prime implosions presently happening simultaneously in various degrees , this will be the primary reason people default .
I am afraid this is just a little taste of the type of attacks we should be prepared for .
The fact is — with $ 300 k down this is one of the good guys .
He was duped into buying a $ 250 k home for $ 600 k because of the high - leverage , risk taking of the financial insti’s that allowed people with zero money down , terrible credit and no jobs to bid up this neighborhood making it appear the home he bought was really worth $ 600 k .
He likely is not saving much money because the lion ’s share is going out to this massively depreciating asset .
In all likelihood it is a good financial decision for him to walk and rent the home down the street without all of the other ‘ joy ’ of homeownership expenses that come along with owning .
If we walked now the pain goes away .
His credit is hurt for a while but if he keeps everything else current if wo n’t hurt him for long .
His credit will recover quicker than the house will recover in value .
His loan is a purchase money loan so there is no recourse if he exercises his right to foreclosure .
Suggesting that the he dips into his kids college education to make up the difference is a crime .
This man has already paid with his life ’s savings .
I recently took a business trip to Las Vegas , which in my line of work meant searching for good drinks .
But while traveling to party towns like Vegas or New Orleans is part of the package when your job is related to spirits and cocktails , there are plenty of occupational hazards that come with the territory .
For me , the biggest drawback may be confronting the ugly side of alcohol .
I love a good drink , but the alcoholic slushies being sold by the yard in the spring break atmosphere of these cities have all the appeal of a day - old Big Mac left to ferment in the sun .
Whether it ’s the tall , green plastic flasks of sweetened grain alcohol marketed as “ Hand Grenades ” to tourists on Bourbon Street , or the Big - Gulp - sized piña coladas served in Eiffel Tower - shaped go -cups toted by visitors stumbling along the Strip , these drinks and the people who regularly slurp them do n’t make my job any easier .
I realize that every time I take a drink in front of my children , a message is being sent .
As I walk among the party crowd – en route to someplace a little quieter and more subdued , where the drinks are served in modest proportions and in actual glasses – I want to approach the occasional Scripture - quoting soul - savers who also frequent these places , and say a little defensively , “ I ’m not actually with them – I ’m just here to watch . ”
Not that it would be likely to make any difference , of course ; my search for a proper Negroni , no matter the size , is for many people on par with the debauchery of Mardi Gras , simply because of the shared element of alcohol .
These flip sides of the drink equation call to mind G.K. Chesterton ’s observation ( helpfully posted by a reader in the comments section to my first Proof post ) that ’s become something of a chestnut in imbibing circles :
“ The dipsomaniac and the abstainer are not only both mistaken , but they both make the same mistake .
They both regard wine as a drug and not as a drink . ”
Early in my drinking life , when I would meet my high school friends beneath a remote river bridge near my Oklahoma hometown to drink warm beer or cheap gin mixed with Sprite , I fell soundly into Chesterton ’s dipso category ( which for a 17 - year - old is pretty much par for the course ) .
As I matured , however , so did my relationship with alcohol .
While it seems obvious in some ways , I eventually realized that different forms of drink have different tastes ( and not simply the taste of the things you throw in to mask the alcohol ) , and that some of these drinks actually had some real appeal .
While I still have friends who view the taste of beer , wine or spirits as secondary , at best , to the potency of the drink ( whether they view this as a positive or a negative depends on the person ) , over time I came to value the flavor and character of a drink much more than the inherent buzz .
That ’s not to say that I ’m either disingenuously oblivious or unappreciative of alcohol ’s chemical side .
When I sit at a local bar and sip a Last Word or a Toronto Cocktail , I enjoy the slow suffusion of warmth and the language - loosening properties of drink that enable a preternaturally shy person like me to strike up a conversation with a complete stranger .
But to end the observation there , myopically viewing alcohol ’s effect as the be-all and end - all reason for drinking , or to see an inevitable progression from one or two drinks to nine or ten , misses the point of a good drink as entirely as those who down quarts of frozen margaritas during an epic Vegas bender .
I drink because I like it , and for reasons that usually place “ effect ” a step or three down the list .
I love the spicy sweetness of whiskey and I ’m a total sucker for the herbal ballet of a good vermouth ; when tasting well - made spirits and cocktails composed from them , I can admire the skill of a talented distiller , along with that of a bartender who understands what they have .
While plenty of spirits and cocktails are so artlessly made as to make me consider early retirement , there are great new things being done by bartenders and distillers , making this an exciting time to be a drinker .
Drinking also satiates my historical and culinary curiosity : as a fan of obscure and sometimes obsolete spirits and cocktail ingredients , I ’ve spent inordinate amounts of time searching for liqueurs , bitters and other products that appeared in bar manuals from the 1860s through the 1950s , but which disappeared from bars decades ago .
Recreating these drinks and having the chance to taste them gives me a richer perspective of other eras and places , an experience I usually find far more satisfying than the simple buzz I could get from something as pedestrian as a vodka and tonic .
But in addition to these reasons why I drink , there ’s another factor that comes into play .
As paradoxical as it may sound to include it , in a roundabout way I ’m also drinking for my kids – but before you leap to the comments section and spit out an accusatory fireball , please hear me out .
During my formative - drinking years , when alcohol was still a relative novelty , I had something that many of my harder - drinking friends did not : parents who demonstrated a responsible relationship with alcohol .
My father and sometimes my mother would crack a cold beer on hot days , and wine was regularly served at dinner on weekends and special occasions to everyone including the kids .
They kept a decently stocked liquor cabinet , but usually only opened it for drop - by guests and the occasional dinner party , which were celebrated in good cheer but were seldom if ever followed by awkward phone calls the next day .
This open yet modest approach to alcohol was in contrast to the paths taken by the families of some friends and neighbors , whose habits ranged from over - indulgent to abstemious and were sometimes an odd mix of the two : it was not lost on me during my secular Bible Belt upbringing that some of my hardest - drinking friends – whose relationships with booze were often of the vomit - in - the - shrubbery , loss - of - all - personal - control variety – were from religious homes in which alcohol was seldom if ever served .
Knowing that my 6 - year - old daughter and 8 - year - old son will likely start to experiment with alcohol in – let ’s be realistic – about a decade , give or take , I fully realize that every time my wife or I take a drink around them , a message is being sent .
There are several directions this can go , and I understand I ’ll never have total control over any of them .
If completely banishing alcohol from our home would protect them from any of its hazards later in life , it ’d be an easy choice , but as my old hard - drinking friends demonstrated , that ’s just a bit too simple and naïve to be a realistic option .
Instead , I try to mirror the moderate approach taken by my own parents , leavening this with the lessons I learned from these hard - drinking friends who had more rigid upbringings , along with those I pick up from watching the unique slice of life visible in Las Vegas and New Orleans : when it comes to alcohol , an extreme approach at either end of the spectrum can be bad news .
Too much is always too much , and none at all can also be too much ; but tacking an even course between the two is usually just enough .
If you can fit a whole computer , keyboard and screen into a tiny , fold - up 7 " box , why not squeeze one into a keyboard ?
And while you 're there , what about adding a little touchscreen in the space normally inhabited by the number pad ?
What 's that ?
Asus did it already ?
By jove , it did !
Look at that !
The Eee PC Keyboard is a netbook stuffed inside a keyboard : 1.6GHz Atom processor , 1GB RAM and either an 8 GB or a 16GB solid state drive for storage .
The touch screen is a five - incher and can be used for navigation and display .
Should you feel the need for something a little larger , you can hook the Eee up to a monitor via VGA and HDMI or , in the case of the more expensive model , the display can be connected wirelessly .
The Eees will be available in May , for $ 400 and $ 600 .

Not only are the Mormon bigots once again attacking gays in a state that has nothing to do with Utah , but this time they ’re directly contradicting the Mormons ’ earlier statements that they have no problem with civil unions .
You see , after it was revealed that the Mormons were the monetary powerhouse behind the revocation of marriage rights for gays in California , the Mormons went all out with a PR campaign pretending they were n’t really anti-gay , only anti- gay marriage .
They claimed that , for example , they had no problem with civil unions .
Well , surprise .
The Mormon bigots are again up to their old tricks , trying to impose their ways on other states and other people who have nothing to do with Mormonism .
And guess what ?
The Mormon bigots are using the same lies they used in California to kill love in that state .
Including the lies that granting gay couples the right to , for example , visit their dying loved one in a hospital will lead to :
1 . The “ gay lifestyle ” being taught to small children in school ; and
2. Little girls will be forced to share bathrooms with confused old men .
Funny that a people who forcibly convert dead Holocaust victims to Mormonism against the will of their families , who believe that Jesus and the devil are brothers , and who believe that Jesus had three wives and had sex with one of them , are so interested in having a public discussion about whose morality is better .
I do n’t know what it says in the Book of Mormon , but in the Bible we ’re taught not to lie , not to hate , and not to judge lest we be judged .
Perhaps the bigots running the Mormon agenda should read it some time .
A silent $ 1 trillion " Run on Britain " by foreign investors was revealed yesterday in the latest statistical releases from the Bank of England .
The external liabilities of banks operating in the UK – that is monies held in the UK on behalf of foreign investors – fell by $ 1 trillion ( £ 700 bn ) between the spring and the end of 2008 , representing a huge loss of funds and of confidence in the City of London .
Some $ 597.5 bn was lost to the banks in the last quarter of last year alone , after a modest positive inflow in the summer , but a massive $ 682.5 bn haemorrhaged in the second quarter of 2008 – a record .
About 15 per cent of the monies held by foreigners in the UK were withdrawn over the period , leaving about $ 6 trillion .
This is by far the largest withdrawal of foreign funds from the UK in recent decades – about 10 times what might flow out during a " normal " quarter .
The revelation will fuel fears that the UK 's reputation as a safe place to hold funds is being fatally comp-romised by the acute crisis in the banking system and a general trend to financial protectionism internat- ionally .
This week , Lloyds became the latest bank to approach the Government for more assistance .
A deal was agreed last night for the Government to insure about £ 260bn of assets in return for a stake of up to 75 per cent in the bank .
The slide in sterling – it has shed a quarter of its value since mid-2007 – has been both cause and effect of the run on London , seemingly becoming a self - fulfilling phenomenon .
The danger is that the heavy depreciation of the pound could become a rout if confidence completely evaporates .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Colin Ellis , an economist at Daiwa Securities , commented : " The outflow of overseas banks '
UK holdings is not surprising – indeed foreign investors in general will still be smarting from the sharp fall in the exchange rate last year , as many UK liabilities are priced in sterling terms .
That raises the question of what could possibly tempt overseas investors to return to the UK .
Further heavy outflows of funds are probably a given . "
The Bank of England said that there had been a large fall in deposits from the United States , Switzerland , offshore centres such as Jersey and the Cayman Islands , and from Russia .
Paranoia that the UK could follow Iceland into effective national insolvency and jibes about " Reykjavik on Thames " will find an unwelcome substantiation in these statistics – which also show that stricken British banks are having to repatriate similar sums back to Britain .
This is scant consolation for the authorities , however , as it means the UK and sterling are , like some emerging markets and currencies , suffering from a flight of capital .
By contrast some financial centres and currencies – notably the US dollar and the Swiss franc – are enjoying a boost as " safe havens " in a troubled world .
The sudden international trend towards financial deglobalisation and the flight of money to " home " bases has nonetheless been dramatic .
The Prime Minister has already warned about this drift to " financial protectionism " – even though UK banks brought back almost $ 600bn in the last months of 2008 , as they attempted to repair fragile balance sheets .
Mr Ellis added : " These data are consistent with UK banks reducing their overseas holdings , at the same time as overseas banks scale back their presence in the UK .
That is not surprising , given that governments around the world are having to prop up their banking sectors , and in turn demanding that national institutions focus on domestic markets .
But it does run the risk of being financial protectionism by the back door . "
Investment from the West into developing countries has fallen from the level of about $ 1 trillion a year seen earlier this decade to about $ 150 bn last year .
Economies in eastern Europe such as Hungary and the Baltic republics , some in Asia such as Pakistan and developed nations such as Iceland have been severely hit by the collapse in foreign investment .
Like Iceland , the UK has an unusually large banking sector in relation to her national income , with liabilities four times GDP .
Should the UK taxpayer have to assume these debts it will represent , in relation to GDP , about double the national debt the nation bore at the end of the Second World War , a near unsustainable burden .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - Rust pokes through the peeling paint on the railings , pest control has been curtailed and the palm trees are no longer being fertilized at the 1940s - era Miami Modern condominium building in Miami Beach .
Miami Beach city commissioner Jerry Libbin holds a stack of resolutions from cash - strapped condo associations representing some 135,000 condo owners which he plans to carry to the Florida legislature as he stands outside Miami Beach City Hall in Miami Beach , Florida March 31 , 2009 .
The resolutions from condo associations are pleading with state legislators to change state law to force lenders to pay more toward delinquent monthly association fees when they foreclose on a home .
Florida 's condominium and homeowners ' associations are facing what experts call a trickle - down disaster from the property crisis .
Dozens and perhaps hundreds of condo buildings have budget shortfalls as thousands of owners , under water on their mortgages or in foreclosure , stop paying monthly fees .

The condo association has been forced to cut expenses because the owners of 11 of the 28 apartments in the modest two - story building are delinquent , victims of a mammoth U.S. real estate collapse that has hit Florida especially hard .
With so many cash - strapped owners failing to pay their monthly fees for upkeep , the condo board last year had to raise $ 40,000 with a special levy to fill a giant hole in the $ 80,000 annual budget , but only managed to collect $ 19,000 from the owners who are still able to pay their bills .
Florida ’s condominium and homeowners ’ associations are facing what experts call a trickle - down disaster from the property crisis .
Dozens and perhaps hundreds of condo buildings have budget shortfalls as thousands of owners , under water on their mortgages or in foreclosure , stop paying monthly fees .
“ I call it a death spiral , ” Miami Beach city commissioner Jerry Libbin said .
“ It ’s a catastrophe in the making . ”
Nearly half of Florida ’s 18 million residents live in condo or homeowners associations , communities where owners pay monthly fees for common expenses like cleaning , landscaping , pool maintenance and building insurance .
When a unit owner stops paying monthly fees , which can range from $ 150 in a small building to over $ 1,000 in a luxury tower , a condo board must collect money from other owners to make up the shortfall .
Rising fees or special assessments , or levies , can drive other vulnerable owners into insolvency .
No one seems sure how many condo buildings are in trouble but the number of calls to Florida ’s condo ombudsman could be an indicator .
They are up tenfold in recent months .
At Miami - based condo management company CADISA Inc , co-founder Jackie Diaz - Sampol estimated that delinquency rates are running at 30 percent to 35 percent in half her buildings .
As a result , associations are cutting back pool and hallway maintenance , trimming services and firing maintenance staff .
“ We ’ve had to become very creative .
Desperate times create desperate measures , ” Diaz - Sampol said .
“ We ’ve even had owners who have volunteered to do a little painting . ”
TROUBLED BUILDINGS
Carol Housen , the board president at the Miami Beach condo where nearly half the units are in hot water , would talk about its problems only with an agreement that the address would not be published .
It ’s tough to sell a condo with a bad reputation .
Housen points out chipped paint on the concrete walkways , which have n’t been redone lately .
Crown - of - thorns and bougainvillea plants are blooming but she wonders how they will survive with the landscaper visiting less frequently .
“ Everything is not going to look as nice , ” said Housen , a property broker .
“ We had an exterminator once a month .
Now he comes once every two months .
We ’re not fertilizing the trees . ”
The story of this building is a familiar one .
The apartments were converted to condos at the height of a boom that saw prices -- inflated by speculation and fraud -- double within four years , then tumble in the last three .
A one - bedroom , 560 - square - foot ( 52 - square - meter ) unit that topped out near $ 200,000 might now get $ 70,000 , leaving owners drowning in debt .
Still , said Housen , it could be worse .
She pointed to a nearby tower where she said more than 200 of the 244 units have liens or lawsuits pending .
Housen said an upscale building not far away -- where units that once sold for over $ 1 million and are now priced below $ 500,000 -- has 16 troubled apartments of 44 in the building .
The crisis could mean serious pain for Miami Beach , a resort town with 88,000 residents and 42,000 condos .
If debtors walk away from their units , buildings could become derelict .
“ I have n’t seen it yet , but I think we ’re going to see it , ” Housen said .
BANKS ARE STALLING
Condo advocates say banks are partly responsible for hobbling condo boards by being slow to foreclose on owners who have fallen behind .
Lenders do n’t become responsible for an apartment ’s costs until they foreclose and under current law , a bank is liable to pay only six months worth of fees in arrears , or 1 percent of the mortgage value , when it takes back a property .
Condo advocates say banks are deliberately stalling .
“ There ’s no doubt in my mind it ’s done so they do n’t have to pay the fees , ” Rosa de la Camara , a lawyer with Becker & Poliakoff , a Florida firm that does condo legal work .
Proposed legislation would make banks pay up to 12 months of fees .
Advocates also want the Florida legislature to allow associations to collect rent directly from tenants when owners are taking in rent but not paying condo fees , and said other states are considering similar legislation .
Libbin , the Miami Beach commissioner , left this week for the state capital Tallahassee to lobby lawmakers to pass a bill giving more financial protection to condo associations .
He took with him resolutions from Florida condo boards representing some 135,000 unit owners pleading for help .
He said the state might end up taking over bankrupt condo associations .
“ Imagine what it will be like if you have to call the governor ’s office to get a plumber , ” he said .
At night , I can hear the soft thumps as the rats land on my roof .
They launch themselves from the branches of the apricot tree because they want to get inside my attic , into a house with heat .
The house next door , and the one next to that , have been empty since October .
Their yards have gone feral , with hundreds of dandelion heads glistening gray in the night .
The rats are cold and hungry .
The skunks have a den somewhere next door , where the metal shed was dismantled .
Opossums , raccoons and lizards have colonized the abandoned yards on my block in Riverside .
And it ’s spooky , at night , to see so much darkness , to hear skittering , to keep an eye out for homeless people trying to break in and sleep , to listen for the sounds of desperate humans and animals .
Last week , a woman stole a pair of shoes right off my neighbor Maria ’s front porch .
Maria woke her son , who ran down the street and confronted the woman .
She threw the shoes back at him .
After a pair of clippers disappeared from my yard , I ’ve started taking ladders and anything else of possible worth inside at night .

Our mailman , Randy , said this week that from what he sees in his letter bag ( he reminds me that Americans have no secrets from the letter carrier ) , about one in eight homes in our neighborhood are in foreclosure or a few months away .
The street already has six empty houses , some vacant for nearly a year .
And people walking aimlessly in the street make life eerie and uncertain .
Here in the Inland Empire , we joke that our people are canaries but we do n’t die .
Our foreclosure rate was the highest in the country for many months ; Riverside County ’s unemployment rate is 12.2 % .
But we do recession better than many places .
We have experience .
In the 1980s , we lost Kaiser Steel and many other manufacturers ; from 1992 - 94 , the unemployment rate for the Riverside - San Bernardino metro area averaged 10 % , with an astonishing 12.1 % in July 1992 .
But this feels different .
More desperate .
Last year , after the price of copper skyrocketed , metal theft was rampant ; thieves stole catalytic converters from parked cars , brass plaques from headstones and monuments , faucets and bushings from fire hydrants , copper wire from schools and parks .
Thieves strip foreclosed homes , identifying them by “ Bank Owned ” signs in the dead lawns .
Water heaters , copper pipes , electrical equipment -- all torn from walls and floors , homes destroyed .

I have n’t slept well for about a year .
For a while , I woke up at night to check on my daughter ’s Honda , which was broken into repeatedly .
We knew it was a prime target .
But recently it was stolen from in front of her friend ’s house , in the 15 minutes she left it to go inside .
On Presidents Day , my ex-husband and I drove to a towing yard in San Bernardino near the Colton border to retrieve what was left of the car when police found it .
The guy who brought it to me shook his head .
Stripped .
Everything gone but the fast - food trash the thieves had strewn on the floor .
“ I ’ll call the salvage guy for new door panels and seats , ” my ex-husband said .
Then he rolled his eyes .
“ He only takes cash , but my tax refund ’s gonna be an IOU , right ? ”
We drove through streets of boarded - up bungalows , the neighborhoods of old California now turning back to wild oats and silvery foxtails so high the windows were obscured .
Men wandered the potholed streets looking like something out of a current - day Steinbeck novel .
To say we might lose “ community ” is too simple .
We are already more isolated and urbanized than in the past .
But to lose the community on my street , the street I ’ve lived on for 22 years , breaks my heart .

We watch out for each other .
A neighbor with orange trees brings me bags of navels , which I share with other neighbors .
I give Maria eggs from my chickens and winter tomatoes and oranges , and she brings us foods from her native Philippines -- chicken adobo and pancit .
But increasingly there are things we can’t help each other with .
Down the block , my neighbors -- waitresses and home day - care workers and contractors and retired people -- are all nervous about whether they ’ll have jobs tomorrow .
One neighbor sold many of her belongings last year in a series of yard sales , trying to make house payments ; her husband , an adult - education teacher , was furloughed for the summer , and his hours for this school year were cut .
They are filing for bankruptcy .
A few days ago , police were at Maria ’s ; someone had tried to carjack her son at gunpoint for his truck .
And from my kitchen window , I saw police at a house on the next street .
After work , my youngest and I smelled smoke on that street , so several neighbors and I ran to see whether the elderly widows on the block were OK .
The fire was put out quickly , but one man said to me , “ A bad day on this street . ”
Earlier that morning , police arriving to evict a woman found her dead .
A woman in her 30s , in a rental house , who ’d lost her job some months before and was being evicted , had hanged herself .
None of us can get her out of our minds , because we did n’t help her .
We did n’t know .
She had n’t been here long .
I can see the roof of her house as I wash dishes , and when I go to bed , I can hear the rats gnawing at the chicken wire over the vents on my roof .

Susan Straight ’s most recent novel is “ A Million Nightingales . ”
On Monday : The view from South Los Angeles .
The remains of a mutilated adult bald eagle were discovered Saturday afternoon near Iona Island Regional Park .
The carcass was stuffed into a clear plastic garbage bag with its beak and talons removed -- a sign it was killed by poachers .
Richard Singleton was out walking his Golden Retriever when he came across the bird .
" Obviously whoever did this is motivated by money or greed or something , " Singleton said .
" I mean , why would you kill an amazing animal like that for its parts ? "
Singleton told a park ranger , and two other women called RCMP .
Richmond RCMP Cpl. Jennifer
Pound says a pair of rubber gloves was also found nearby .
Pound says the body appears to have been at the location for quite some time judging by the decomposition and how torn the bag was .
Dozens of mutilated eagles were found on the Burrard Inlet First Nation Reserve in North Vancouver in 2005 .
Wesley Francis and Tommy Shaw were convicted of poaching .
During the investigation , a manager for the B.C. Conservation Officer Service said the parts were sold in Canada and the U.S. , possibly within the First Nations community 's powwow circuit .
In November , David Essary Bill of Brentwood Bay , B.C. , was fined $ 10,000 after pleading guilty to unlawfully trafficking in bald eagle parts following a year - long Canada - wide investigation .
Conservation officials estimate up to 1,000 birds are killed illegally each year .
Black market for birds
Wildlife officers said that these killings are quite common because there is a large market for the feet and tail feathers of bald eagles .
The bird parts , which are used for ceremonial or artistic purposes , are sold on the black market for anywhere from $ 100 to $ 1,500 per part .
First Nations are issued permits to use parts of eagles that have died naturally for traditional ceremonies .
When dead birds are passed on to a native band , they are blessed to release their spirit , and prayers are said to apologize on behalf of man for their death .
B.C. is home to approximately 20,000 bald eagles , which are included in Canada 's protected species list .
Under the B.C. Wildlife
Act , trafficking in bald eagle parts can lead to a two - year jail sentence and a $ 250,000 fine .

CAPE CANAVERAL , Florida ( Reuters ) - NASA ’s outreach to the public to drum up interest in the International Space Station started innocently enough with an online contest to name the station ’s new living quarters .
But Stephen Colbert , a comedian who poses as an ultra right - wing news commentator on cable television ’s Comedy Central , nosed into the act with a grass - roots appeal that has backed the staid U.S. space agency into a corner .
The comedian ’s supporters cast 230,539 write - in votes to name the new module at the $ 100 - billion space outpost “ Colbert . ”
The top NASA - suggested name , “ Serenity , ” finished a distant second , more than 40,000 votes behind .
Contest rules stipulate that the agency retains the right to basically do whatever it wants , but it may not be that easy .
Last week , U.S. Representative Chaka Fattah , a Pennsylvania Democrat , called on NASA to do the democratic thing and use the name that drew the most votes .
“ NASA decided to hold an election to name its new room at the International Space Station and the clear winner is Stephen Colbert , ” Fattah said in a statement .
“ The people have spoken , and Stephen Colbert won it fair and square -- even if his campaign was a bit over the top . ”
NASA is taking some time to ponder its next move .
“ We have a plan and we ’re working with some folks and in a couple of weeks you ’ll know what the answer is , ” NASA ’s associate administrator Bill Gerstenmaier said .
The decision could see Windows XP enjoy an even longer life Anyone buying a PC with Windows 7 pre-installed will be able to swap it for XP or Vista .
Microsoft has confirmed that the licence conditions under which the software will be sold will allow people to downgrade .
The conditions will apply to both businesses that buy licences for Windows in bulk and consumers that get the operating system on a PC or laptop .
No firm date has been given for the release of Windows 7's final version .
New life Downgrade rights are common in Microsoft licensing terms and conditions and customers who buy large volumes of Windows operating systems have always been able to roll back to previous versions .
Microsoft has twice granted Windows XP a reprieve to allow computer makers to get licences for it for far longer than was originally planned .
Windows XP , released to consumers in 2001 , was also granted a lifeline to ensure that it could be used on so - called netbooks - cut - down net - capable laptops that are proving very popular .
At the same time , computer makers such as Dell and HP have been exploiting clauses in the licensing terms that let them rollback machines with Vista pre-installed to the older operating system .
The news comes as the cut - off date for free mainstream support for Windows XP ends .
From 14 April , Windows XP and Home plus Office 2003 enter their " extended support " period .
This means the only updates and bug fixes these products will get will be to improve security .

Frank McCloud travels to a run-down hotel on Key Largo to honor the memory of a friend who died bravely in his unit during WW II .
His friend 's widow , Nora Temple , and wheelchair bound father , James Temple manage the hotel and receive him warmly , but the three of them soon find themselves virtual prisoners when the hotel is taken over by a mob of gangsters led by Johnny Rocco who hole up there to await the passing of a hurricane .
Mr. Temple strongly reviles Rocco but due to his infirmities can only confront him verbally .
Having become disillusioned by the violence of war , Frank is reluctant to act , but Rocco 's demeaning treatment of his alcoholic moll , Gaye Dawn , and his complicity in the deaths of the Osceola Brothers and a deputy sheriff start to motivate McCloud to overcome his Hamlet - like inaction .

I remember hearing that the hub for the Disconstructed Wheel was machined by Sam 's dad as a high school grad present .
Screen cap from NWDIII .
Sam riding his creation back in 2002 .
Samuel Jackson Lindsay - Brown could ride a bike .
Screen cap from NWD III .
I met Sam Brown once - by chance - back in 1999 .
I was with a few buddies and we had just ridden The Monster in Kaslo B.C.
It was mid summer and we were sitting by the truck drinking a beer and revelling in the glory when he pedalled up to say hi .
We soon learned that Sam had built much of The Monster himself - a truly world class marvel of a trail .
He was just a kid and he was riding around on flat pedals with no shoes on - and he really looked like a forest elf .
He was soft spoken and he seemed a kind , gentle spirit .
The next time I saw Sam was at the premiere of NWD III Freewheel Burning - on the screen .
He had built one of the most amazing contraptions you could ever ride a bike on .
He called it the ' The Disconstructed Wheel ' but everyone else called it the hamster wheel .
He rode on and his rear wheel stopped on the latching mechanism , releasing the wheel .
Then he got on the pedals and the wheel began to turn until it finally hit the opposite lock and he rode off onto a skinny .
The next move was a wheelie off from a standstill .
It was an imaginative engineering marvel that he somehow managed to put together high on a mountain top .
Or at least that 's what I heard at the time .
Sam put together a pretty decent segment after that .
His most impressive move was a high speed manual on a long skinny .
He put the front wheel down just in time to launch off the end .
I have no idea what life held for Sam after that but it 's clear that at some point things got interesting .
Recently Sam was contacted to transport 350 lbs of marijuana across the B.C. border into northern Washington State .
The deal was set up by the US Drug Enforcement Agency .
Apparently it was a rainy , foggy night and the DEA assumed the helicopter delivery would be canceled .
News reports suggest that when the DEA arrived at the meeting point Sam was already unloading the crop from the machine .
He had apparently flown the helicopter through the mountains on a very dirty night , landing in the Colville National Forest north of Spokane .
The helicopter was reported stolen by the owner from Malakwa B.C. I have n't been able to discern whether Sam held a fixed or rotary wing license at this point but I think a rotary license is unlikely .
That was February 23rd .
On Friday February 27th Sam was found dead in his jail cell in Spokane .
It 's unlikely that we 'll ever know much about what happened on the four days after Sam 's arrest .
Without knowing all the details it 's tough to know how Sam found himself in this predicament .
While his actions were clearly risky , dangerous and against international law , Sam can also be considered a casualty of the misguided , expensive and - worst of all - fruitless , ' War On Drugs .
'
We 'd like to express our sincerest condolences to Sam 's friends and family .
A tech - savvy ( and kind of sadistic ) judge in Mississippi is making news for his unusual decision to force a paroled convict to tweet every ten minutes as a way of updating his parole officer of his whereabouts .
It 's tough to know who 's being punished more - the convict or whoever 's following him .

The Lawyer They Represent They ’re Going to Argue …
Shannon Minter National Center for Lesbian Rights Proposition 8 is so expansive in scope that it constitutes a revision , not an amendment to the Constitution and as such , it did not follow the prescribed process for a revision– which requires a 2/3 majority vote from the legislature before it goes to the voters .
Raymond Marshall Friend - of - the - court briefs from civil rights organizations Groups as diverse as the AFL - CIO , ACLU and American Federation of Teachers all wrote the court in opposition to Prop .
8 . Their particular concern is that Prop. 8 makes it very easy for basic rights to be stripped away by simple majority votes .
While they support gay rights , their primary concern is that the process and logic of Prop.
8 could be applied to their own interests down the line .
Michael Maroko Robin Tyler and Dianne Olson Robin and Dianne have married more times than Elizabeth Taylor , but only to each other each time .
Their commitment to challenge the courts and legal system set off the 2004 lawsuit which led to ( through many various legal hairpin curves ) the California Supreme Court marriage decision last May .
They are the “ human face ” of gay marriage and , as such , expect Maroko ’s argument to be about fariness and equality .
Therese Stewart City & County of San Francisco San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom permitted the city to issue marriage licenses to gays and lesbians five years ago , serving as the other main catalyst for the California gay marriage decision .
Stewart will be arguing that it ’s in the best interest of the city for its residents to be allowed to marry , regardless of gender , and that Prop.
8 fundamentally denies basic civil rights , which can not and should not be left in the hands of the majority .
Chris Krueger Attorney General Jerry Brown
The most expansive and broad argument against Prop. 8 will come from the AG ’s office , who did a surprising about face in December , saying that it would not support Prop. 8 and felt that the initiative violated the California Constitution .
Brown ’s argument is unique in that it argues not on process grounds , but on moral grounds .
Essentially , the AG ’s office will argue that denying gay people marriage is fundamentally wrong and undemocratic .
Kenneth Starr
The sponsors of Proposition 8 “ Is this court really prepared to overturn the will of the voters of California ? ”
This is the theme , Ken Starr will return to again and again .
He will point out that the Court has no preexisting case law that permits it to act in such a unilateral action ( true ) and that voters were not denying a right , but rather , reaffirming traditional marriage ( sophistic lie ) .
Starr , as the defendant , has the easiest job : Convince the court to do nothing at all .
Nationally , some question whether such attempts at social engineering are appropriate for the classroom or should remain the purview of parents , churches and youth groups outside of school hours .
“ Who could be against teaching empathy ? ” said Michael Petrilli , a vice president for the Thomas B. Fordham Institute , an education policy group in Washington .
“ But there ’s a laundry list of seemingly important activities that , when added together , crowd out the academic mission of our schools . ”
But Deborah Kasak , executive director of the National Forum to Accelerate Middle - Grades Reform , said that teaching empathy can seem “ artificial or hokey ” to some students , but over time can foster a school culture that encourages learning over social distractions .
“ I do n’t know if you can teach everybody to be empathetic , ” she acknowledged , “ but you can raise awareness . ”
Empathy lessons are spreading everywhere amid concerns over the pressure on students from high - stakes tests and a race to college that starts in kindergarten .
The Character Education Partnership , a nonprofit group in Washington , said 18 states  including New York , Florida , Illinois , Nebraska and California  require programs to foster core values such as empathy , respect , responsibility and integrity .
This year , Los Angeles is spending nearly $ 1 million on a nationally known program for its 147 middle schools , called Second Step : Student Success Through Prevention , which teaches empathy , impulse control , anger management and problem solving .
In Seattle , seven public elementary schools are using a Canadian - based program , Roots of Empathy , in which a mother and her baby go into the classroom to explore questions like “ What makes you cry ? ”
Within the charter network KIPP , which stands for Knowledge Is Power Program , some schools are focusing more on empathy , with lessons about the Holocaust , role - playing and a “ values jingle ” sung to the tune of “ Jingle Bells . ”
And on Long Island , Weber Middle School in Port Washington inducted 300 students  nearly one - quarter of the school  into the Weber Pride club this year as reward for gestures like sitting with a new girl at lunch or helping a panicked classmate on the rock climbing wall .
At Public School 114 in the South Bronx , where David A. Levine , author of “ Teaching Empathy , ” has been running workshops since 2006 , the principal , Olivia Francis - Webber said that the number of fights had dropped to fewer than three a month  from one to three a week  and disciplinary referrals were down to about five a month from nearly 20 .
This artist 's concept illustrates a dead star , or white dwarf , surrounded by the bits and pieces of a disintegrating asteroid .
The scene suggests the raw material for planets like Earth are common .
LONG BEACH , Calif . ?
New observations of chewed - up asteroids around old dead ? stars calledwhite dwarfs bolster the idea that the Earth and other rocky planets in oursolar system are far from alone in the universe .
Astronomersused NASA 's SpitzerSpace
Telescope to peer at six such white dwarf stars and found thesignature of asteroid debris circling the stars .
An analysis of the lightcoming from the systems show the rings are made of some of the same materialsas rocky bodies in our own solar system .
" Itstrengthens suspicions that Earth - like planets are common , " said MichaelJura of UCLA here Monday at the 213th meeting of the American AstronomicalSociety .
Planetbuilding
Asteroidsand planets form from the dust and gas that swirls around young stars .
As thedust sticks together , it forms clumps that eventually become full - fledgedplanets , according to the leading theory .
Asteroids are the " leftoverbuilding blocks that didn ?t get incorporated in the planets , " Jura said .
As starslike our own sun near the end of their life , they puff up into red giants thatconsume their innermost planets and jostle the orbits of outer planets and asteroids .
Eventually the stars blow off their outer layers and shrink down into whitedwarfs .
Occasionally , a perturbed asteroid will wander too close to the white dwarf , whose gravityrips the rocky body to shreds , forming debris .
( This is similar to whathappened to Comet Shoemaker - Levy 9 when it was tornapart by Jupiter 's gravity before impacting the planet in 1994 . )
Spitzer hadpreviously observed shredded asteroid pieces around two white dwarfs ; the newobservations bring the total count ( of white dwarfs with asteroid debris ) toeight .
" Nowwe ?ve got a bigger sample of these polluted white dwarfs , so we know thesetypes of events are not extremely rare , " Jura said , noting that they about1 percent of white dwarfs are estimated to have these signatures .
Thedetails
All eightwhite dwarf systems observed showed signatures of a glassy silicate mineralsimilar to olivine , which is common on Earth .
" Thisis one clue that the rocky material around these stars has evolved very muchlike our own , " Jura said .
The spectra( light broken into its components ) of the asteroid debris also showed no carbonsignature ?
what Jura calls a " carbon desert " ?
another similarity tothe asteroids and rocky planets in our own solar system , which have relativelylittle carbon .
Asingle asteroid is thought to have broken apart within the last millionyears or so in each of the eight white - dwarf systems .
The biggest was onceabout 124 miles ( 200 km ) in diameter , a bit larger across than LosAngeles County .
Continuedobservations of this white dwarf debris could help astronomers further figureout the composition of exoplanets , which so far has proven difficult .
Claim : U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld owns stock in the company that makes Tamiflu .
Status : True .
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , 2006 ]
“ Bird Flu ”
Do you know that ‘ bird flu ’ was discovered in Vietnam 9 years ago ?
Do you know that barely 100 people have died in the whole world in all that time ?
Do you know that it was the Americans who alerted us to the efficacy of the human antiviral TAMIFLU as a preventative ?
Do you know that TAMIFLU barely alleviates some symptoms of the common flu ?
Do you know that its efficacy against the common flu is questioned by a great part of the scientific community ?
Do you know that against a SUPPOSED mutant virus such as H5N1 , TAMIFLU barely alleviates the illness ?
Do you know that to date Avian Flu affects birds only ?
Do you know who markets TAMIFLU ?
ROCHE LABORATORIES .
Do you know who bought the patent for TAMIFLU from ROCHE LABORATORIES in 1996 ?
GILEAD SCIENCES INC .
Do you know who was the then president of GILEAD SCIENCES INC .
and remains a major shareholder ?
DONALD RUMSFELD , the present Secretary of Defence of the USA .
Do you know that the base of TAMIFLU is crushed aniseed ?
Do you know who controls 90 % of the world ’s production of this tree ?
ROCHE .
Do you know that sales of TAMIFLU were over $ 254 million in 2004 and more than $ 1000 million in 2005 ?
Do you know how many more millions ROCHE can earn in the coming months if the business of fear continues ?

So the summary of the story is as follows :
Bush ’s friends decide that the medicine TAMIFLU is the solution for a pandemic that has not yet occurred and that has caused a hundred deaths worldwide in 9 years .
This medicine does n’t so much as cure the common flu .
In normal conditions the virus does not affect humans .
Rumsfeld sells the patent for TAMIFLU to ROCHE for which they pay him a fortune .
Roche acquires 90 % of the global production of crushed aniseed , the base for the antivirus .
The governments of the entire world threaten a pandemic and then buy industrial quantities of the product from Roche .
So we end up paying for medicine while Rumsfeld , Cheney and Bush do the business .
ARE WE CRAZY !!?
OR ARE WE IDIOTS !!?
AT LEAST PASS THIS ON SO THAT IT CAN BE KNOWN !!!!!!!
Origins :
This particular e-mail first came to us in April 2006 .
As to its claims , rather than take them in order , we ’ll examine them in two parts : whether the U.S. Secretary of Defense owns stock in the company that produces Tamiflu , and whether Tamiflu is effective against influenza .
As to the first , it is true Donald Rumsfeld does indeed have stock holdings in Gilead Sciences , Inc. , the California biotech company that developed Tamiflu ( a product now manufactured and sold by the pharmaceutical giant Roche ) , and so he benefits financially from increases in that company ’s stock price .
( Gilead receives a royalty from Roche equal to about 10 % of sales . )
Rumsfeld was a member of Gilead ’s board of
directors between 1988 and 2001 , and he was its chairman from 1997 until he joined President George W. Bush ’s cabinet as Secretary of Defense in 2001 .
According to federal financial disclosures filed by Rumsfeld , he has Gilead stock holdings valued at between $ 5 million and $ 25 million .
The Secretary of Defense is not the only politically - connected person to have ties to Gilead .
Former Secretary of State George Shultz , who is on Gilead ’s board , has sold more than $ 7 million worth of Gilead stock since the beginning of 2005 .
Another Gilead board member is the wife of former California governor Pete Wilson .
Rumsfeld is in a “ damned if you do , damned if you do n’t ” position because of his stock holdings , even though he apparently has no say in what Gilead does ( he ’s no longer on its board ) and has removed himself from being part of governmental decisions that affect it ( he ’s recused himself ) .
In a statement to The Independent in March 2006 , the Pentagon said : “ Secretary Rumsfeld has no relationship with Gilead Sciences , Inc. beyond his investments in the company .
When he became Secretary of Defense in January 2001 , divestiture of his investment in Gilead was not required by the Senate Armed Services Committee , the Office of Government Ethics or the Department of Defense Standards of Conduct Office .
Upon taking office , he recused himself from participating in any particular matter when the matter would directly and predictably affect his financial interest in Gilead Sciences . ”
If Rumsfeld holds onto his stock and its share price rises ( which one would expect it to do if an avian flu pandemic becomes a reality , or if concerns about such a pandemic continue to grow ) , he will be seen to be profiting mightily from sales of a product the U.S. government has been buying in large quantities .
If he sells his stock and so divests himself of further interest in Tamiflu sales , he will be accused of locking up profits from the rise in share price that has already occurred .
( In 2001 , shares of Gilead Sciences , Inc. traded in a range between $ 6.64 and $ 17.93 .
Between January and April 2006 , its price range has been $ 53.00 to $ 65.62 . )
As to the second aspect of the e-mail , whether Tamiflu is effective against influenza ( especially the specific H5N1 strain now referred to as avian or bird flu ) , the e-mail ’s dismissive “ This medicine does n’t so much as cure the common flu ” is misleading in that Tamiflu is n’t meant to be a flu cure .
Positioning the drug as a medicine that flopped obscures that fact .
Tamiflu does not cure the flu , but if taken soon after symptoms appear , Tamiflu can reduce the flu ’s severity .
As to how well it ’s going to match up against bird flu , that is not yet known and indeed it may well not be knowable until the time comes .
However , it is anticipated Tamiflu will have at least some effect against bird flu , and with that in mind , more than 60 countries ( including the U.S. ) have so far ordered large stocks of it .
Such stockpiling is likely going to appear highly prudent if the bird flu pandemic , a worldwide medical disaster the United Nations estimates could kill 150 million people , does materialize .
Influenza is not a straightforward disease , as it is constantly mutating .
While media attention has now conditioned us to regard “ bird flu ” as a particular entity , in truth there are many forms of “ bird flu . ”
The one now the focus of so much concern , the H5N1 strain , was first noted in Asian birds in 1997 .
That first year , 18 people in Hong Kong were diagnosed with the contagion , 6 of whom died .
Since 1997 , there have been approximately 206 known human cases bird flu ( of which 114 died ) , but as the CDC points out : “ It is possible that the only cases currently being reported are those in the most severely ill people , and that the full range of illness caused by the H5N1 virus has not yet been defined . ”
Viewed from one angle ( 114 deaths over the course of nine years ) , avian flu is not worth being much concerned about .
But viewed from a more informed standpoint about the nature of influenza , there may indeed be great cause for alarm .
Influenza can jump species and move from birds ( and other animals , such as pigs ) into humans .
During the process of that move — and afterwards , as one person infects another — the virus changes form .
What at one moment can be a containable and well - understood virus can in the space of hours or days become almost an entirely new virus .
For this reason , flus are hard to combat : they change as they are passed along , staying well ahead of science ’s attempts to contain them .
Most strains of flu are not deadly to humans , save for members of groups especially at risk to all forms of contagion ( e.g. the very young , the very old , and the infirm of all ages ) .
Bird flu , however , is a killer , and if it jumps species and mutates on the fly into a form that humans can easily pass to each other , it could take the lives of millions in the space of weeks , ultimately making the United Nations ’ projected death toll of 150 million worldwide look like wishful thinking .

Not a single teen plans to buy a Zune , Microsoft 's ill - conceived challenger to Apple 's iPod .
And that 's probably just as well , given it looks like Microsoft is sending its player heavenward following what 's looking like the Zune 's final physical manifestation .
In a result that has more in common with North Korean election , a survey of teenagers has found 100 per cent will buy one of Apple 's music players in the next year .
Piper Jaffray 's biannual report even suggests these could be the new owners ' second iPods .
While 92 per cent already owned an MP3 player , 86 per cent already had an iPod .
Just four per cent owned a Zune , meaning Microsoft beat Sony and Sandisk for second place but that it also tied with the " other " category .
That 'll make tough reading for the few remaining Zunesters at Microsoft planning a new round of Zune hardware before the end of the year and who must be wondering why they 've been left manning this particular fort .
The Zune unit was disbanded and broken up in February , and once the new hardware is finished , the focus will be on services for the PC , phone , and TV .
The software and services portion of the Zune unit were absorbed by Microsoft 's Media Room and Media Center TV businesses .
The hardware people were taken over by Microsoft 's Windows Mobile unit . ®

( CNN ) -- Singer Natalie Cole told CNN's Larry King she is searching for a kidney after an illness caused both of her kidneys to fail .
Singer Natalie
Cole continues to tour , despite being on dialysis three times a week .
Before she finished telling King Tuesday night about her battles with drugs , illnesses and her search for a kidney , dozens of e-mails flooded the CNN studio .
They were all offers from people saying they would get tested to see whether their kidney could be donated .
King handed a thick stack of paper to Cole .
" These are all e-mails from dozens -- dozens of people offering to be tested to see if they can match , who want to give you a kidney , " King said .
Cole stared at the papers for a moment .
" There are some great human beings out there .
That 's all I can say , " Cole said .
Watch Natalie Cole 's interview with Larry King »
" I'm on a very long list , which is why we are looking to donors , " said Cole , the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole .
Cole said her kidney troubles date back to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with hepatitis C. Cole said she attributes the hepatitis C from her well - publicized struggles to stop using cocaine and heroin .
Cole said she has been sober for some time now after two stints in a rehabilitation clinic .
Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus .
Within four months of getting chemotherapy , both of Cole 's kidneys failed .
" I could n't breathe .
I -- I went into -- literally , my kidneys stopped functioning .
They stopped , you know , processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body . "
Since then , Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney , she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue .
Cole won six Grammy awards for her 1991 critically acclaimed album " Unforgettable ... With Love , " a jazzy tribute to her father .
She won a Grammy this year for her new album " Still Unforgettable " and another Grammy for her work on another album .
Cole said that she has still been able to tour this year even with her kidney ailment .
" I have been on dialysis in Istanbul , Milan , Indonesia , Manila , London .
It 's -- it 's amazing , " Cole said .

Laser technology has been used to create the first ever digital record of the iconic 15th century building , which was the centrepiece of the book and film , The Da Vinci Code , starring Tom Hanks .
The cutting edge scan allows experts to “ virtually ” take the building apart inside and out .
And it could help solve the mystery of whether there are any hidden chambers in the chapel , which according to legend contain prized relics such as the Holy Grail , the mummified head of Christ or the Ark of the Covenant , the container of the Ten Commandments .
David Mitchell , director of the technical conservation group at Historic Scotland , said the scans allowed heritage sites to be recorded in a way never been done before .
He said : “ We are able to get to the centimetre accuracy on our buildings , so for example if there was ever a major fire at Edinburgh Castle we would then have the information to be able to rebuild it .
We have just finished scanning Rosslyn Chapel and everyone is interested to know whether there are secret hidden parts . ”

Disclamer :
This version was build automatically due to the lack in time I had to create this version and poorley tested .
So it might contain bugs .
Localepurge was used to gain free space on the ISO .
If your language is n’t completely localized install localepurge and execute /usr / share/doc/localepurge/reinstall_debs.sh

Based on where the second stage fell , it is clear that the North Korean satellite launch was another failure .
Oh - for - three .
These guys really suck .
NORTHCOM says :
Stage one of the missile fell into the Sea of Japan / East Sea .
The remaining stages along with the payload itself landed in the Pacific Ocean .
No object entered orbit and no debris fell on Japan
( I would also direct you to SEESAT , where they have a nice discussion going . )
Update .
The wags are out .
“ Paul ” writes :
According to the US Navy the highly unique North Korean satellite has entered subaquatic orbit in the Pacific Ocean , and is transmitting melodies of the immortal revolutionary paeans Song of General Kim Il- sung and Song of General Kim Jong-il on a 15 kHz acoustic channel .
Seriously , the best thing about this blog are the readers .
That is pure genius , right down to the frequency .
The federal Bureau of Land Management ’s chance to cash in on millions of dollars from oil and gas leases in Utah starting this week has been delayed , at least temporarily , by a court order .
A federal judge on Saturday granted a temporary restraining order sought by seven environmental groups that blocks oil and natural gas exploration on tens of thousands of acres of federal land in the state .
The judge , Ricardo M. Urbina of Federal District Court in Washington , ruled that the Interior Department had not done sufficient environmental analysis , particularly of how air quality might be degraded .
“ Because of the threat of irreparable harm to public land if the leases are issued , ” Judge Urbina wrote , “ the balancing of equities also tips in favor ” of the environmental groups .
The decision came just hours before oil and gas companies could have taken possession of the leases , which they bought on Dec. 19 .
The Bureau of Land Management could have cashed the checks from the winning bidders on Monday .
At that point the leases would have become final .
After the bug fixing goodness of Amarok 2.0.2 , it is time to crank up the coolness factor by a few orders of magnitude .
Deep in our hidden lair we have been hard at work plotting world domination - and occasionally working on the next major version of Amarok - and we are now ready to let the rest of the world have a taste with the release of Amarok 2.1 beta1 .
Amarok 2.1 will come with many new features and some old favorites will make a re-appearance .
Beta 1 gives you a sneak preview of all these improvements .
While not quite ready for general use yet , the stability is quite good and overall the beta should be quite usable in most cases ( standard " may eat your cat , spouse , favorite cupcake or pet iguana " warnings do apply however ) .
Major new features include a new , completely user configurable playlist with an easy to use drag - and - drop editor , cue sheet support , a new take on managing applets in the Context View , bookmarks - allowing you , among other things , to save and share favorite finds in the services , support for showing radio stations with many alternate streams as one track in the playlist , much faster startup when reloading large playlists containing non local tracks , as well as many other improvements , UI tweaks and bug fixes across the board .
So download , test drive and cuddle this beta a little , provide feedback and bug reports and help us make Amarok 2.1 the best Amarok release ever .

Bugfixes
The full ChangeLog since 2.0.2 is about a mile long and follows below :
TUCSON - Marshall Wyatt Earp 's fabled 1881 shootout at the OK Corral in Tombstone was reported this way :
" A day when blood flowed as water , and human life was held as a shuttlecock , a day always to be remembered as witnessing the bloodiest and the deadliest street fight that has ever occurred in this place , or probably in the territory . "
For nearly 140 years , the Tucson Citizen has told the stories of Southern Arizona , but on Saturday ( March 21 ) , the state 's oldest newspaper will tell its last - its own .
Gannett Co. Inc. , the nation 's largest newspaper publisher , announced in January it would close the Citizen if it did n't find a buyer for certain assets .
Robert J. Dickey , president of Gannett's U.S. Community Publishing , said the paper was losing money and was a drain on Gannett operations .
The Citizen becomes the latest casualty of a newspaper industry struggling to survive despite the tough economy , dwindling advertising revenues and Internet competition .
The battle has been especially tough in two - newspaper towns .
E. W. Scripps Co. closed the 150 - year - old Rocky Mountain News , one of two daily newspapers in Denver , in February .
Hearst Corp. has said it will close or sell the San Francisco Chronicle if it can't slash expenses , and has laid out plans to close the Seattle Post - Intelligencer if a buyer is n't found before April .
Four newspaper companies , including the owners of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune and The Philadelphia Inquirer , have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in recent months .
The Citizen , an afternoon newspaper , has struggled for years against the Arizona Daily Star , a 117,000 - circulation morning newspaper owned by Lee Enterprises .
During the Citizen 's heyday in the 1960s , circulation was about 60,000 ; today , it 's 17,000 .
Editor Jennifer Boice said the Citizen 's closure is a loss for the Star , the community and journalism .
" It 's a loss because what we do makes the Star better , the Star makes us better , and because of that , the community gets better information , " said Boice , who started at the paper 25 years ago as a business writer .
" It 's more than the sum of the parts . "
The Arizona Citizen was founded on Oct. 15 , 1870 , by John Wasson , a newspaper man from California , with behind - the - scenes help from Richard McCormick , the territory 's governor and later territorial delegate to Congress .
The paper changed ownership several times over the next 100 years until Gannett bought it in 1976 , just a few years after a U.S. Supreme Court case involving the Citizen led Congress to pass the Newspaper Preservation Act and new rules for joint - operating agreements for competing newspapers doing business together .
Gannett also changed the name to the Tucson Citizen .
During its lifetime , the Citizen reported on Arizona 's biggest stories , including the 1881 gunfight at the OK Corral and the 1934 arrest of bank robber John Dillinger and three other gang members hiding out in Tucson .
" It has such a long history , " Arizona historian Marshall Trimble said .
" That makes it part of Arizona history , and it 's just another piece of our history that 's going away . "
Michael Chihak , the Citizen 's former editor and publisher who retired last summer , spent a significant portion of his life with the paper .
His grandfather was a pressman at the Citizen in the 1940s .
As a boy , Chihak delivered the paper on his bicycle and was a high school stringer .
He later became a reporter and editor , working for other news organizations along the way , and returned to the Citizen as its publisher and chief executive in 2000 .
" It was more than a career , more than a job , it was part of my life , " said Chihak , who is now executive director of a nonprofit foundation in San Francisco .
He said it 's heartbreaking to see the demise of the Citizen , and " the loss of all the jobs of the finest journalists I knew . "
Newspapers remain at the forefront of gathering and disseminating information , Chihak said , " but obviously the emphasis has shifted to other means of distribution , and of gathering , for that matter . "
More than 60 newsroom employees will lose their jobs because of the closure , but Tucson Newspapers Inc. , which oversees the Gannett - Lee Enterprises business operations under the JOA , will continue until at least 2015 .
Star publisher John Humenik could n't comment on the Citizen 's closure because of pending legal issues related to the JOA , but Lee spokesman Daniel Hayes said , " it 's always unfortunate when a community voice is lost . "
The final Citizen will be a 24 - page commemorative edition delivered on Saturday .
About 20,000 copies will be printed and available in news racks for a couple of days .
The Citizen 's staff continues to work as hard and as skillfully as ever in its waning days , said Bruce Johnston , who joined the Citizen 36 years ago .
" We 're professionals , " he said .
" We 're treating every day like it normally is , even though there 's a lot of gallows humor around here . "
Except for the stacks of boxes and large trash bins lining the newsroom to catch years ' worth of notebooks and paper stacked atop desks , it was business as usual .
Reporters continued to call sources , plan coverage and share laughs .
But they also shared tidbits about mostly fruitless job searches , punctuated by sighs and knowing nods as they prepared for their final week at their newspaper - and for many , likely their final week in the business .
Associate Editor Mark Kimble , a 34 - year veteran , said he worries about what closures like the Citizen 's mean for the future of journalism .
There are " fewer sets of eyes looking at what government is doing and keeping an eye on the things that I think we all take seriously , " Kimble said .
" That 's very unfortunate . "
When senior officials are interviewed by journalists they usually pick up almost immediately what story the reporter wants to write and may sometimes try to confuse ; it can also work the other way .
If the reporter puts to the officials overly positive – oily – questions , the officials may laden their assurances with caveats , pointing out the many complexities , uncertainties , risks and challenges .
So it was good to talk earlier this week to Bill Crothers , CIO of the Identity and Passport Service and its chief executive James Hall .
They tell it like it is .
Two things were clear to me at the outset – before the interview – and were still clear afterwards .
1 ) If the Conservatives win the next General Election and cancel ID Cards , there will be little in effect to cancel .
The IT infrastructure for passports is being combined with that of ID Cards .
So the £ 650 m worth of contracts which were awarded this week to CSC and IBM for new ID Cards and passports IT will remain largely intact .
2 ) The costs of ID Cards are likely to be met , to a large extent , by passport fee increases .
It ’s going to be increasingly difficult to separate the costs of producing passports and ID Cards .
And I had no denial from the Home Office that the cost of ID Cards will be mixed in with the cost of passports .
ID Cards will be voluntary at first and the fee will be low initially : £ 30 .
[ There would be little point in a high charge for ID Cards while they are voluntary as few people would buy them . ]
But as ID Cards and passports will share much of the same IT infrastructure , the cost of ID Cards can be included in monopolistic passport fee increases .
The Treasury requires that the Identity and Passport Service is self - funded .
But it ’s not possible yet to split the costs of the infrastructure between ID Cards and passports .
So ID Card costs will be mixed into passport fee increases .
Already passports cost up to £ 114 – and officials do n’t deny that we ’re heading towards the £ 200 passport .
Note the response of the Home Office to my questions on whether passport fee increases will pay for ID Cards .
A spokesman said :
“ In the long - term it is our intention to continue to break even by recovering the operational costs of the National Identity Scheme from the fees generated by the issuing of ID cards and passports . ”
