The media is silent , Congress is absent , and Americans are distracted as George W. Bush openly prepares aggression against Iran .
US Navy aircraft carrier strike forces are deployed off Iran .
US Air Force jets and missile systems are deployed in bases in countries bordering or near to Iran .
US B - 2 stealth bombers have been refitted to carry 30,000 - pound " bunker buster " bombs .
The US government is financing terrorist and separatist groups within Iran .
US Special Forces teams are conducting terrorist operations inside Iran .
US war doctrine has been altered to permit first - strike nuclear attack on Iran and other non-nuclear countries .
Bush ’s war threats against Iran have intensified during the course of this year .
The American people are being fed a repeat of the lies used to justify naked aggression against Iraq .
Bush is too self - righteous to see the dark humor in his denunciations of Iran for threatening " the security of nations everywhere " and of the Iraqi resistance for " a vision that rejects tolerance , crushes all dissent , and justifies the murder of innocent men , women , and children in the pursuit of political power . "
Those are precisely the words that most of the world applies to Bush and his Brownshirt administration .
The Pew Foundation ’s world polls show that despite all the American and Israeli propaganda against Iran , the US and Israel are regarded as no less threats to world stability than demonized Iran .
Bush has discarded habeas corpus and the Geneva Conventions , justified torture and secret trials , damned critics as anti-American , and is responsible , according to Information Clearing House , for over one million deaths of Iraqi civilians , which puts Bush high on the list of mass murderers of all time .
The vast majority of " kills " by the US military in Iraq and Afghanistan are civilians .
Now Bush wants to murder more .
We have to kill Iranians " over there , " Bush says , " before they come over here . "
There is no possibility that Iranians or any Muslims who have no air force , no navy , no modern military technology are going to " come over here , " and no indication that they plan to do so .
The Muslims are disunited and have been for centuries .
That is what makes them vulnerable to colonial rule .
If Muslims were united , the US would already have lost its army in Iraq .
Indeed , it would not have been able to put an army in Iraq .
Meanwhile the US media focuses on whether Republican Senator Larry Craig is a homosexual or has offended gays by denying to be one of them .
The run-up for the public ’s attention is why a South Carolina beauty queen cannot answer a simple question about why her generation is unable to find the United States on a map .
The war criminal is in the living room , and no official notice is taken of the fact .
Lacking US troops with which to invade Iran , the Bush administration has decided to bomb Iran " back into the stone age . "
Punishing air and missile attacks have been designed not merely to destroy Iran ’s nuclear energy projects , but also to destroy the public infrastructure , the economy , and the ability of the government to function .
Encouraged by the indifference of both the American media and Christian churches to the massive casualties inflicted on Iraqi civilians , the Bush administration will not be deterred by the prospect of its air attacks inflicting massive casualties on Iranian civilians .
Last summer the Bush administration demonstrated to the entire world its total disdain for Muslim life when Bush supported Israel ’s month - long air attack on Lebanese civilian infrastructure and civilian residences .
President Bush blocked the attempt by the rest of the world to halt the gratuitous murder of Lebanese civilians and infrastructure destruction .
Clearly , turning the Muslim Middle East into a wasteland is the Bush policy .
For Bush , civilian casualties are a non-issue .
Hegemony ber alles .
The Bush administration has made its war plans for attacking Iraq and positioned its forces without any prior approval from Congress .
The " unitary executive " obviously does n’t believe that an attack on Iran requires the approval of Congress .
By its absence and quietude , Congress seems to agree that it has no role in the decision .
In the improbable event that Congress were to make any fuss about Bush ’s decision to attack yet another country , the State Department has devised legalistic cover : simply declare Iran ’s military to be a " terrorist organization " and go to war under the cover of the existing resolution .
The " Iran issue " has been created by the Bush administration , not by Iran .
Iran , like many other countries , has a nuclear energy program to which it is entitled as a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
Inspectors of the International Atomic Energy Agency have found no evidence of a nuclear weapons program in Iran .
The Bush administration has brushed away this fact , which should be determining , just as the Bush administration brushed away the fact that weapons inspectors reported , prior to Bush ’s invasion of Iraq , that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
The Bush administration managed to disrupt the work of the pesky IAEA weapons inspectors in Iran .
Iran has been working successfully with the IAEA and has achieved what a senior IAEA official recently described as a milestone agreement .
The Bush administration instantly went to work to discredit the agreement and unleashed its new lapdog , French President Nicolas Sarkozy , to threaten " the bombing of Iran . "
The Bush administration ’s position is legally untenable and is really nothing but a contrived excuse to start another war .
Bush claims that Iran , alone among all the signatories of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , must be denied its right under the pact to develop nuclear energy , because Iran , along among all the other signatories , will be the only country able to deceive the IAEA inspectors and develop nuclear weapons .
Therefore , Iran must be denied its rights under the agreement .
Bush ’s position on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is as legally untenable as his position on every other issue — the Geneva Conventions , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , habeas corpus , the constitutional separation of powers , and presidential signing statements that he cavalierly attaches to new laws in order to override the legislative power of Congress .
Bush ’s position is that the meaning of laws and treaties varies with his needs of the moment .
Bush has declared himself to be the " decider . "
The " decider " decides whether Americans have any rights under the Constitution and whether Iran has any rights under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
As the " decider " has decided that Iran has no such rights , the " decider " decides whether to attack Iran .
No one else has any say about it .
The people ’s representatives are just so much chaff in the wind .
Whatever form of government Bush is operating under , it is far outside an accountable constitutional democratic government .
Bush has transitioned America to caesarism , and even if Bush leaves office in January 2009 , the powers he has accumulated in the executive will remain .
Unless Bush and Cheney are impeached and convicted , there is no prospect of the US Congress and federal judiciary ever again being co-equal branches of government .
The Best of Paul Craig Roberts
There have been regular protests against the child abductions
Police dispersed demonstrators with tear gas in the capital , N'Djamena , after cars belonging to white foreigners and diplomats were attacked .
The protesters were demanding that six French aid workers charged with child kidnapping be tried in Chad .
Meanwhile , a judge in Chad rejected a request by defence lawyers seeking the release pending the trial of the six French and three Chadians still held .
If found guilty , the charity workers face several years with hard labour in a Chadian prison .
They said they believed they were rescuing Darfur war orphans , but parents of many of the 103 children almost flown to France told the BBC they were promised they would be educated locally , and never gave permission for them to leave the country .
Earlier this month , France 's President Nicolas Sarkozy had said he wanted to go to Chad to bring the French aid workers from Zoe 's Ark back home angering many Chadians .
Targeting French
Crowds of students began gathering in the centre of N'Djamena shortly after 0730 hours local time .
Most of the demonstrators were high school students , wearing their school uniforms and chanting anti-French slogans .
Before long , what was designed to be a peaceful protest , got out of hand , the BBC's Stephanie Hancock in the capital says .
The demonstrators began attacking white foreigners in their cars , hurling stones and shouting , " Whites - child kidnappers " .
For several hours the young demonstrators took over the capital , running riot along N'Djamena 's main streets and eventually converging at the French embassy .
The police used tear gas to disperse the protestors who were intent on finding French citizens to attack .
The students , who were holding banners saying " Sarkozy , out of Chad " eventually returned to the city 's main square in front of the presidential palace where several thousand of them converged for a mass protest .
Riot police and soldiers are still trying to calm the situation down , although the protestors are finally beginning to wrap up their demonstration .
Various topics related to kernel quality

Discussions of kernel quality are not a new phenomenon on linux - kernel .
It is , indeed , a topic which comes up with a certain regularity , more so than with many other free software projects .
The size of the kernel , the rate at which its code changes , and the wide range of environments in which the kernel runs all lead to unique challenges ; add in the fact that kernel bugs can lead to catastrophic system failures and you have the material for no end of debate .
The latest round began when Natalie Protasevich , a Google developer who spends some time helping Andrew Morton track bugs , posted this list of a few dozen open bugs which seemed worthy of further attention .
Andrew responded with his view of what was happening with those bug reports ; that view was " no response from developers " in most cases :
So I count around seven reports which people are doing something with and twenty seven which have been just ignored .
A number of developers came back saying , in essence , that Andrew was employing an overly heavy hand and that his assertions were not always correct .
Regardless of whether his claims are correct , Andrew has clearly touched a nerve .
He defended his posting by raising his often - expressed fear that the quality of the kernel is in decline .
This is , he says , something which requires attention now :
If the kernel _is_ slowly deteriorating then this wo n't become readily apparent until it has been happening for a number of years .
By that stage there will be so much work to do to get us back to an acceptable level that it will take a huge effort .
And it will take a long time after that for the kernel to get its reputation back .
But is the kernel deteriorating ?
That is a very hard question to answer for a number of reasons .
There is no objective standard by which the quality of the kernel can be judged .
Certain kinds of problems can be found by automated testing , but , in the kernel space , many bugs can only be found by running the kernel with specific workloads on specific combinations of hardware .
A rising number of bug reports does not necessarily indicate decreasing quality when both the number of users and the size of the code base are increasing .
Along the same lines , as Ingo Molnar pointed out , a decreasing number of bug reports does not necessarily mean that quality is improving .
It could , instead , indicate that testers are simply getting frustrated and dropping out of the development process - a worsening kernel could actually cause the reporting of fewer bugs .
So Ingo says we need to treat our testers better , but we also need to work harder at actually measuring the quality of the kernel :
I tried to make the point that the only good approach is to remove our current subjective bias from quality metrics and to at least realize what a cavalier attitude we still have to QA .
The moment we are able to _measure_ how bad we are , kernel developers will adopt in a second and will improve those metrics .
Lets use more debug tools , both static and dynamic ones .
Lets measure tester base and we need to measure _lost_ early adopters and the reasons why they are lost .
It is generally true that problems which can be measured and quantified tend to be addressed more quickly and effectively .
The classic example is PowerTop , which makes power management problems obvious .
Once developers could see where the trouble was and , more to the point , could see just how much their fixes improved the situation , vast numbers of problems went away over a short period of time .
At the moment , the kernel developers can adopt any of a number of approaches to improving kernel quality , but they [ PULL QUOTE :
In the absence of objective measurements , developers trying to improve kernel quality are really just groping in the dark .
END QUOTE ] will not have any way of really knowing if that effort is helping the situation or not .
In the absence of objective measurements , developers trying to improve kernel quality are really just groping in the dark .
As an example , consider the discussion of the " git bisect " feature .
If one is trying to find a regression which happened between 2.6.23 and 2.6.24 - rc1 , one must conceivably look at several thousand patches to find the one which caused the problem - a task which most people tend to find just a little intimidating .
Bisection helps the tester perform a binary search over a range of patches , eliminating half of them in each compile - and - boot cycle .
Using bisect , a regression can be tracked down in a relatively automatic way with " only " a dozen or so kernel builds and reboots .
At the end of the process , the guilty patch will have been identified in an unambiguous way .
Bisection works so well that developers will often ask a tester to use it to track down a problem they are reporting .
Some people see this practice as a way for lazy kernel developers to dump the work of tracking down their bugs on the users who are bitten by those bugs .
Building and testing a dozen kernels is , they say , too much to ask of a tester .
Mark Lord , for example , asserts that most bugs are relatively easy to find when a developer actually looks at the code ; the whole bisect process is often unnecessary :
I 'm just asking that developers here do more like our Top Penguin does , and actually look at problems and try to understand them and suggest fixes to try .
And not rely solely on the git - bisect crutch .
It 's a good crutch , provided the reporter is a kernel developer , or has a lot of time on their hands .
But we debugged Linux here for a long time without it .
On the other hand , some developers see bisection as a powerful tool which has made it easier for testers to actively help the process .
David Miller says :
Like the internet , this time spent is beneficial because it 's pushing the work out to the end nodes .
In fact git bisect is an awesome example of the end node principle in action for software development and QA .
For the end - user wanting their bug fixed and the developer it's a win win situation because the reporter is actually able to do something proactive which will help get the bug they want fixed faster .
Returning to original bug list : another issue which came up was the use of mailing lists other than linux - kernel .
Some of the bugs had not been addressed because they had never been reported to the mailing list dedicated to the affected subsystem .
Other bugs , marked by Andrew as having had no response , had , in fact , been discussed ( and sometimes fixed ) on subsystem - specific lists .
In both situations , the problem is a lack of communication between subsystem lists and the larger community .
In response , some developers have , once again , called for a reduction in the use of subsystem - specific lists .
We are , they say , all working on a single kernel , and we are all interested in what happens with that kernel .
Discussing kernel subsystems in isolation is likely to result in a lower - quality kernel .
Ingo Molnar expresses it this way :
We lose much more by forced isolation of discussion than what we win by having less traffic !
It 's _MUCH_ easier to narrow down information ( by filter by threads , by topics , by people , etc. ) than it is to gobble information together from various fractured sources .
We learned it _again and again_ that isolation of kernel discussions causes bad things .
Moving discussions back onto linux - kernel seems like a very hard sell , though .
Most subsystem - specific lists feature much lower traffic , a friendlier atmosphere , and more focused conversation .
Many subscribers of such lists are unlikely to feel that moving back to linux - kernel would improve their lives .
So , perhaps , the best that can be hoped for is that more developers would subscribe to both lists and make a point of ensuring that relevant information flows in both directions .
David Miller pointed out another reason why some bug reports do n't see a lot of responses : developers have to choose which bugs to try to address .
Problems which affect a lot of users , and which can be readily reproduced , have a much higher chance of getting quick developer attention .
Bug reports which end up at the bottom of the prioritized list ( " chaff " ) , instead , tend to languish .
The system , says David , tends to work reasonably well :
Luckily if the report being ignored is n't chaff , it will show up again ( and again and again ) and this triggers a reprioritization because not only is the bug no longer chaff , it also now got a lot of information tagged to it so it 's a double worthwhile investment to work on the problem .
Given that there are unlikely to ever be enough developers to respond to every single kernel bug report , the real problem comes down to prioritization .
Andrew Morton has a clear idea of which reports should be handled first : regressions from previous releases .
If we 're really active in chasing down the regressions then I think we can be confident that the kernel is n't deteriorating .
Probably it will be improving as we also fix some always - been - there bugs .
Attention to regressions has improved significantly over the last couple of years or so .
They tend to be much more actively tracked , and the list of known regressions is consulted before kernel releases are made .
The real problem , according to Andrew , is that any regressions which are still there after a release tend to fall off the list .
Better attention to those problems would help to ensure that the quality of the kernel improved over time .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Dan Bartlett , a member of President George W. Bush ’s Texas inner circle and an aide for more than 13 years , announced on Friday he is resigning as White House counselor effective July 4 .
The most important White House insider to leave Bush ’s side since the resignation last November of Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld , Bartlett said he had decided to get a less demanding job so he could concentrate on helping raise his three young children all under the age of 4 .
For the tall , prematurely gray Bartlett , who turned 36 on Friday , it has been more than six White House years of long days and weekend work .
On vacations , he had to take along a device in order to hold a secure videoconference if needed .
The work is so relentless , he said , that his wife , Allyson , observed the other day that she was “ one of the few people in America who wakes up to the tapping of a Blackberry . ”
Bartlett , who said he had been pondering his departure for months , started working for Bush in October 1993 in the future president ’s first race for Texas governor .
One of his first communications crises was to handle the fallout when Bush accidentally shot an endangered bird on a hunting trip .
He stayed with Bush through another gubernatorial campaign and two presidential elections .
As counselor , he was a key strategist on selling Bush ’s policy messages as well as an advisor to the president .
“ His contribution has been immeasurable .
I value his judgment and I treasure his friendship , ” Bush said in a statement .

“ I understand his decision to make his young family his first priority .
His most important job is to be a loving husband and father of three young sons .
We wish him all the best , ” he said .
Bartlett ’s pending departure will follow that of some other aides such as deputy national security adviser J.D. Crouch , who chose to leave rather than ride out the rest of the president ’s term , which ends in January 2009 .
“ HELL OF A RIDE ”
Bartlett has been so close to Bush that he is one of the few aides able to tease the president .
Whenever Bush wears his brown suit , Bartlett would tell him “ So you got Big Brown out today . ”
“ It ’s been a hell of a ride , ” said Bartlett , who was at Bush ’s side on September 11 , 2001 , when al Qaeda attacks transformed his presidency .
Bartlett said he was leaving for no other reason than to get a job in the private sector and concentrate more on his family .
He has retained Washington lawyer Robert Barnett to help him in his search .

“ I ’ve had competing families .
And unfortunately , the Bush family has prevailed too many times , and it ’s high time for the Bartlett family to finally prevail , ” Bartlett said .
After a tenure dominated by the Iraq war , and with Bush under pressure to change course , the rest of Bush ’s presidency could be difficult .
Asked if he had any regrets about his time in the White House , Bartlett demurred .
“ A lot of us will have time to look back and look at decisions .
I ’m not going to spend a lot of time thinking about that right now . ”
His wife had given him a nudge back when their third son was born four months ago by suggesting the baby be named “ Exit Strategy . ”
“ I figured after 13 years and a lot of experience under our belt , this was a time to turn a new chapter in my life , ” Bartlett said .
White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten said he would search for a replacement for Bartlett , who has had unrivaled access to the Oval Office , and had already identified some candidates .
City Room has heard of women being thrown out of men ’s bathrooms , men who identify as women being thrown out of women ’s bathrooms and , of course , men getting into trouble in men ’s rooms .
But we had not heard of a woman being thrown out of a women ’s room — by a worker who did n’t believe she was really a woman — until now .
The woman , Khadijah Farmer , a 28 - year - old who lives in Hell ’s Kitchen , says she was at the Caliente Cab restaurant in the West Village after the Gay Pride Parade on June 24 , when she left the table to go to the women ’s room .
While she was in there , the male bouncer burst into the bathroom .
“ He began pounding on the stall door saying someone had complained that there was a man inside the women ’s bathroom , that I had to leave the bathroom and the restaurant , ” Ms. Farmer said .
“ Inside the stall door , I could see him .
That horrified me , and it made me feel extremely uncomfortable .
I said to him , ‘ I ’m a female , and I ’m supposed to be in here . ’
After I came out of the bathroom stall , I attempted to show him my ID to show him that I was in the right place , and he just refused to look at my identification .
His exact words were , ‘ Your ID is neither here nor there , ’ which means that my ID did n’t matter to him . ”
Ms. Farmer , who is lesbian , describes herself as “ not the most feminine , ” but she has been a woman her entire life .
Her New York State non-driver photo identification card clearly lists her sex as female .
She said the bouncer followed her up the stairs and back to the table , asked her party to pay for the appetizers they had already eaten , and then made them leave the restaurant .
Telephone messages left today at the Caliente Cab restaurant were not returned .
Today , on Ms. Farmer ’s behalf , the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund filed a lawsuit in State Supreme Court in Manhattan against Caliente Cab , asserting that she was the victim of gender discrimination .
While Ms. Farmer herself is not transgender , the organization sees the case as strategically important and potentially precedent - setting , said Michael D. Silverman , the executive director and general counsel of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund .
The suit is being filed [ pdf ] under both city and state law .
The city law , whose gender protections are generally considered more expansive , is intended to protect residents whose gender expression is different from what is traditionally associated with the legal sex assigned to a person at birth .
While state law does not include such a protection , the defense fund argues that state law should be interpreted as protecting New Yorkers against sexual stereotyping , in which individuals are expected to conform to societal expectations of gender - appropriate behavior .
The fact that the bouncer refused to look at Ms. Farmer ’s identification card before ejecting her demonstrated that he was judging her simply by how she looked , Mr. Silverman said .
Sexual stereotyping , he said , was established as a legal concept under a 1989 United States Supreme Court case , Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins , in which a woman who failed to make partner , in part because she was considered too “ macho , ” sued her firm for discrimination .
In a 6 to 3 ruling , the court found that evidence that a woman was judged by her male supervisors on the basis of stereotyped notions of appropriate female appearance and behavior could be used to establish the existence of illegal discrimination .
While the Supreme Court ruling was used to expand the scope of discrimination lawsuits in the workplace , the legal idea of sexual stereotyping was largely dormant , Mr. Silverman said , until 2004 , when the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit ruled that transsexuals were protected .
“ We ’re asking the court to say that sex stereotyping by public accommodation is just as harmful when practiced by a public accommodation like a restaurant as it is when it is practiced by an employer , ” Mr. Silverman said .
“ If Khadijah were wearing pearls and white gloves , would the bounder have treated her like that ? ”
Ms. Farmer says being mistaken for a man happens to her on a daily basis — especially in bathrooms or locker rooms , where she often gets funny looks .
“ I have a script that is almost routine , ” she said .
“ I say .
‘ I am a woman , and I ’m supposed to be here . ’
It ’s very simple .
It does n’t come off as aggressive or violent or angry . ”
That usually changes the tenor of the conversation almost immediately , she said .
“ Usually they are embarrassed .
The common response is that they are extremely apologetic that they make the mistake . ”
Before the June episode , she had never had to pull out her identification card to prove her gender , she said .
In recent years , the public bathroom has become a contentious forum for gender identity .
The defense fund reached a settlement in 2005 with a security company that allows people to use the restrooms of the gender with which they identify ..
Advocacy groups , like People in Search of Safe and Accessible Restrooms ( yes , they use the acronym ) , have been advocating for gender - neutral bathrooms .
Are such bathrooms catching on ?
In 2005 , The Times noted , the proliferation of unisex bathrooms in high - end restaurants like the Modern and Per Se .
It first appeared that the unisex stalls — like electronic - eye sensors , stone communal sinks and waterfall urinals — were an attempt by restaurants to one - up each other on the bathroom frontier .
But perhaps these high - end restaurants — and even colleges — are in fact at the cutting edge of gender accommodation .
Not long after Fleer released its set of 1989 baseball trading cards , collectors noticed something unusual about the card featuring Bill Ripken ( Baltimore Orioles infielder and brother of his much more famous Oriole teammate , Cal Ripken , Jr. ) : letters printed in black marker on the knob of his bat .
The letters were quite readable upon close examination , and they clearly spelled out the phrase “ F** K FACE . ”
This was no case of “ well , it kind of looks like it might say that ” ; there was no doubting exactly which two words appeared on Ripken ’s bat :
After the discovery became public , subsequent printings of the card were issued with the offending words obscured in various ways : first hidden under what looked like a blob of Wite - Out , then apparently scribbled over with a marking pen , and finally covered by a black square .
( The original version is now referred to , in diplomatic collector ’s parlance , as an “ error ” card . )
How did the words “ F** K FACE ” end up on Ripken ’s card ?
Some observers offered the standard speculation that it was a prank pulled off by a Fleer employee who touched up the photograph and added the obscenity , while Ripken himself claimed that the furtive scrawling of an obscene phrase on the knob of his bat was an antic pulled off by some of his teammates that had passed unnoticed by him at the time .
( In the event , many card collectors found it rather implausible that Ripken , the photographer , and the card company all failed to notice what was written on the bat and suggested that one or more of them knew about the obscenity but deliberately allowed it to slip through the production process . )
In December 2008 , however , CNBC sports business reporter Darren Rovell wrote that Ripken had revealed to him that he ( Ripken ) had written the offending phrase on the bat himself :
I got a dozen bats in front of my locker during the 1988 season .
I pulled the bats out , model R161 , and noticed — because of the grain patterns — that they were too heavy .
But I decided I ’d use one of them , at the very least , for my batting practice bat .
Now I had to write something on the bat .
At Memorial Stadium , the bat room was not too close to the clubhouse , so I wanted to write something that I could find immediately if I looked up and it was 4:44 and I had to get out there on the field a minute later and not be late .
There were five big grocery carts full of bats in there and if I wrote my number 3 , it could be too confusing .
So I wrote ‘ F–k Face ’ on it .
After the season was over , in early January , I got a call from our PR guy Rick Vaughn .
He said , ‘ Billy , we have a problem . ’
And he told me what was written on the bat and I could n’t believe it .
I went to a store and saw the card and it all came back to me .
We were in Fenway Park and I had just taken my first round of BP .
I threw my bat to the third base side and strolled around the bases .
When I was coming back , right before I got up to hit again , I remember a guy tapping me on the shoulder asking if he could take my picture .
Never once did I think about it .
I posed for the shot and he took it .
I tried to deflect it as much as I could .
It was fairly easy to say that somebody got me with a joke because people think you ’re the scum of the earth for doing something like this .
The truth is that there ’s a lot of words like that that are thrown around in the clubhouse .
They just do n’t get out there .
Just as others had speculated at the time of the card ’s release , Ripken suggested that Fleer had not missed the obscenity visible in the photograph used for his card , but rather had allowed it to pass through the production process in order to generate publicity :
Unsurprisingly , perhaps , the latest stats show that Gmail users skew younger and richer than those on Yahoo Mail and Hotmail .
Gmail opened up to all comers in February , with Gmail 's market share of US visits climbing 17 % from February 2007 to April 2007 .
However , Yahoo Mail and Hotmail are still much bigger by comparison , says Hitwise : Yahoo had 13 x the market share , and Hotmail had 6 x the marketshare of Gmail .
The good news , if you 're a Gmail user , is that you may be part of the elite : while Yahoo and Hotmail users are decidedly average , Gmail users tend to be young , have a high income , and be early adopters of technology .
54 % of users are between 18 and 34 , while 18 % have an average annual household income between $ 100,000 and $ 149,999 ( compared to 15 % for Hotmail and 13 % for Yahoo Mail ) .
Another stat , probably related to the young age of GMail users : they 're more likely to be Facebook users than those on the other services .
As for performance in the bedroom - well , we kinda lied .
In fact , the stats show that solitary Gmail users are far more likely to Google themselves .

Tickets for the Led Zeppelin reunion originally cost £ 125 each
BBC Radio 2 listener Kenneth Donnell , from Glasgow , paid to see the band rehearse and perform on 10 December .
Listeners also bid £ 250,000 to have Aled Jones and Katie Melua perform an intimate gig , and £ 100,000 for VIP passes to 2008 's F1 British Grand Prix .
Children in Need is raising funds for disadvantaged young people in the UK .
Led Zeppelin's three remaining members play together for the first time since 1988 in December 's sold - out concert .
Pete Townshend , Bill Wyman and Paolo Nutini will also perform at the show , which is a tribute to Ahmet Ertegun , the late founder of Atlantic Records .
Tickets went on sale for £ 125 each in October .
Originally scheduled for 26 November , the concert was postponed for two weeks because guitarist Jimmy Page fractured a finger .
Other winners in Radio 2's Auction of Things That Money Can't Buy included Sir Tom Hunter , who paid £ 100,000 for two VIP passes to the 2008 Formula 1 Santander British Grand Prix at Silverstone .
Earlier this week Martin Ainscough , from Wigan , bid £ 250,000 to have Aled Jones and Katie Melua perform at Revolution in Manchester to raise funds for the Prince 's Trust .
Children in Need culminates with a fundraising TV show on BBC One from 1900 GMT on Friday .
The hulking blast walls that the Americans have set up around many neighborhoods have only intensified the city ’s sense of balkanization .
Merchants must now hire a different driver for individual areas , lest gunmen kill a stranger from another sect to steal a truckload of T - shirts .
To study the full effects of the troop increase at ground level , reporters for The New York Times repeatedly visited at least 20 neighborhoods in Baghdad and its surrounding belts , interviewing more than 150 residents , in addition to members of sectarian militias , Americans patrolling the city and Iraqi officials .
They found that the additional troops had slowed , but far from stopped , Iraq ’s still - burning civil war .
Baghdad remains a city where sectarian violence can flare at any moment , and where the central government is becoming less reliable and relevant as Shiite or Sunni vigilantes demand submission to their own brand of law .
“ These improvements in the face of the general devastation look small and insignificant because the devastation is so much bigger , ” said Haidar Minathar , an Iraqi author , actor and director .
He added that the security gains “ have no great influence . ”
The troop increase was meant to create conditions that could lead from improved security in Baghdad to national reconciliation to a strong central government to American military withdrawal .
In recent weeks , President Bush and his commanders have shifted their emphasis to new alliances with tribal leaders that have improved security in Diyala Province , the Sunni Triangle and other Sunni areas , most notably Anbar Province .
That area , not Baghdad , was the one Mr. Bush conspicuously chose to visit this week .
But when he announced on Jan. 10 his plan to add 20,000 to 30,000 troops to Iraq , Mr. Bush emphasized that Baghdad was the linchpin for creating a stable Iraq .
With less fear of death in the capital , “ Iraqis will gain confidence in their leaders and the government will have the breathing space it needs to make progress in other critical areas , ” he said .
All the president 's PR men : Raw Story investigation reveals revolving door on Iraq PR Larisa Alexandrovna and Muriel Kane

This New questions are being raised about political operatives who have promoted President Bushs Iraq war agenda and their role in spreading good news  about Iraq , illustrating a public relations revolving door among the Republican Party , the White House and the private sector .
A month long investigation by RAW STORY , originally prompted by the pro-Iraq war advertising of a grassroots  group called Freedoms Watch , has unearthed a series of connections between the Bush administration and two subsidiaries of the PR giant Burson - Marsteller , particularly BMs own grassroots  firm , Direct Impact .
Founded in 1988 , Direct Impact boasts of over  1,200 field representatives covering every Designated Market Area in the nation , ready to engage their community in a moment 's notice .
Self - designated as a grass roots  company , Direct Impact 's community operations include media and online advocacy .
Direct Impact began working with Burson - Marsteller by 1997 and became a full - fledged subsidiary in late 2001 .
Following the acquisition , the formerly low - profile firm began hosting a steady stream of powerful Republican Party political and communications figures .
For example , Burson - Marsteller , which had hired former National Republican Congressional Committee communications director Craig Veith to oversee their Media Relations Practice , appointed him CEO of Direct Impact in late 2002 .
As head of Media Relations , Veith and Prince Bandar , then Saudi ambassador to the US , had signed an agreement for Burson - Marsteller to work on repairing Saudi Arabia 's image in the wake of 9/11  just three days after the attacks .
Veith was joined at Direct Impact in 2003 by a prominent GOP campaign strategist , Steve Schmidt , who had held Veiths former job of communications director for the NRCC since 2001 .
Schmidt left Direct Impact a year later to become a top strategist in the Bush - Cheney  04 campaign , where he ran the rapid response operation .
He then joined the White House staff as a Senior Adviser to the President and a Counselor to the Vice President .
In April 2005 , former Bush - Cheney '04 Midwest regional political director Dave DenHerder joined Direct Impact .
DenHerder would become Direct Impact 's COO in September after Veith , who had been both CEO and COO , departed to found his own firm .
Freedom's Watch and Democracy Data In August 2007 , a grassroots  organization called Freedoms Watch began running a series of ads attacking those who disagree with the Bush administrations strategy in Iraq as anti-victory . 
According to their mission statement , the group seeks to give voice to Iraq war issues which it claims have been underrepresented because those who want to quit while victory is possible have dominated the public debate about terror and Iraq since the 2004 election .
Although Freedoms Watch is a non-profit corporation dedicated to educating individuals about and advancing public policies that protect Americas interests at home and abroad ,  the group was exposed by the online publication , Politico , as largely consisting of wealthy Republican donors , Neoconservatives , and , most prominently , former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer .
In his role as press secretary , Fleischer had helped sell the Iraq war to the American people .
At a September 2002 press briefing , he said ,  There is already a mountain of evidence that Saddam Hussein is gathering weapons for the purpose of using them .
And adding additional information is like adding a foot to Mount Everest .
( WH Press Briefing 9/6/2002 ) .
But Freedoms
Watch 's relationship to Fleischer , as well as other political operatives in the RNC , is not the only issue surrounding the startup grassroots  effort .
Freedoms Watch is hosted on servers belonging to Democracy Data and Communications ( DDC )  DEMOCRACYDATA.COM
 which for many years had common ownership , leadership , and even shared office space and telephone numbers with Direct Impact .
According to public records , in 2001 both Direct Impact and Democracy Data were located at 1029 North Royal Street , Alexandria , VA .
They also shared the following telephone number : 703-684-9690 and the following fax number : 703-683-9626 .
In 2005 , well after Burson - Marstellar had acquired Direct Impact and also well after Veith had become CEO , they continued to share the same address as well as the same phone and fax numbers .
Although there is no apparent current direct link between Freedoms Watch and Direct Impact , the overlapping of relationships raises questions about the true origin of the  Freedoms Watch  grassroots effort and a larger , more political use of domestic organizations to convey a message that mirrors that of the Administration .
Blackwater USA
The most recent news buzz about Burson - Marsteller has been about their contract with the embattled security contractor Blackwater USA .
According to the Nations blog , Blackwaters subsidiary BKSH was " tasked with salvaging Blackwater 's tattered image and allegedly murderous conduct .
...
The account is being handled by Robert Tappan , a former State Department official who directed communications for the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2004 . "
Reached for comment last Tuesday , Paul Cordasco  a spokesman for Burson - Marsteller  said that the engagement with Blackwater was short term .
" Through a personal relationship , BKSH , a subsidiary of Burson - Marsteller , helped Blackwater prepare for their recent hearing before Congress ,  Cordasco said .
 With the hearing over , BKSH 's temporary engagement has ended . "
Cordasco did not respond when asked to elaborate on what a personal relationship means , nor to questions asking about what exactly the firm did for Blackwater .
Robert Tappan is not part of BKSH , however .
In July 2006 , Tappan became head of Burson - Marstellers Washington office with responsibility for overseeing the marketing operations of Direct Impact , a position he still maintains .
Prior to joining Burson - Marsteller , Tappan had served as Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs , holding that position from November 2002 to June 2006 .
Tappans case , one of many , illustrates the vanishing boundaries between the private sector of public relations and government communications .
While at the State Department , Tappan was said to have been involved in the distribution of domestic pro-Afghanistan war propaganda , in the form of a feel good 
Administration pre-packaged piece about Afghanistan that appeared on local tv outlets in 2003 , without a disclaimer , as a news story .
 Tracking precisely how a good news  report on Afghanistan could have migrated to Memphis from the State Department is far from easy ,  wrote two reporters for the New York Times .
 The State Department typically distributes its segments via satellite to international news organizations like Reuters and Associated Press Television News , which in turn distribute them to the major United States networks , which then transmit them to local affiliates . 

Once these products leave our hands , we have no control ,  Robert A. Tappan , the State Department 's deputy assistant secretary for public affairs , said in an interview .
The department , he said , never intended its segments to be shown unedited and without attribution by local news programs .
 We do our utmost to identify them as State Department - produced products .
Tappan was sent to Iraq in early 2004 to serve as Director of Strategic Communications for the Coalition Provisional Authority .
At this point in the war , optimism about the US endeavor in Iraq was beginning to fade and the Pentagon was turning to public relations to bolster popular support .
 U.S. occupation in Iraq has led to progress , in spite of what the media say , according to Robert Tappan ,  a news story after his return remarked .
 Tappan and the CPA were also responsible for an advertising campaign in Iraq , he said .
The messages in the three - commercial series were  We all yearn to live in a free Iraq ,   I want my children to live in peace  and  I want a prosperous Iraq .
For his services , Tappan earned the Secretary of Defense Medal for Outstanding Public Service  the highest Defense Department civilian honor .
Immediately before joining the State Department , Tappan had been a senior vice president with public relations firm Powell Tate , whose co-founder and vice - chairman was Sheila Tate , a onetime press secretary to Nancy Reagan and George H.W. Bush .
Tate was a participant in the Rumsfeld Group , named for the then -Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , a kitchen cabinet of lobbyists and Republican insiders who met informally to help the White House and the Defense Department produce sellable talking points about Iraq .
In particular , they worked on linking the anti-terrorism cause with efforts to convince the public ' of the need to engage rogue states   including Iraq  that are likely to harbor terrorists .
The group was brought together after 9/11 by Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Victoria  Torie Clarke , who had advised Rumsfeld  that in order to get the American public to buy into the war on terrorism , they needed to suggest a link to nation states , not just nebulous groups such as al - Qaeda . 
Like Tappan and his superiors at State , Clarke appeared to view news and the nature of reporting as a product to be delivered to the American people , ordered by a third party and often filtered through the foreign press .
In 2006 , Direct Impact and Democracy Data appear to have parted ways .
This was confirmed to Raw Story by Tappan in September .
 Burson - Marsteller does not have any role with Freedoms Watch in any way , shape or form ,  Tappan declared in an email to RAW STORY .
 Neither our firm , nor any of its subsidiary or affiliate companies , are involved with Freedoms Watch .
To the best of my knowledge , none of our principals , including me , have been involved with this organization , either on a personal or professional level , at any time . 
Taken in concert , this group of people suggests a pattern whereby GOP campaign and public relations expertise has been applied to selling the administrations policies , particularly in the Middle East and Iraq , in a series of advertising campaigns where private PR and government advocacy become almost indistinguishable .
The privatization of propaganda The National Security Act of 1947 , Section 503 ( f ) , defines domestic propaganda as illegal .
The Act states that no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence United States political processes , public opinion , policies , or media . 
However , when asked specifically by Sen. Diane Feinstein ( D - CA ) in February 2006 about his views of the Presidents power to conduct domestic covert propaganda , then - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales said he was unable to answer the question : FEINSTEIN :
Can the president suspend , in secret or otherwise , the application of Section 503 of the National Security Act , which states that no covert action may be conducted which is intended to influence United States political processes , public opinion , policies or media ?
In other words , can he engage in otherwise illegal propaganda ?
GONZALES : Senator , this will probably be my response to all of your questions of these kind of hypotheticals .
Questions as to whether or not  can Congress pass a statute that is in tension with the Presidents constitutional authority ?
Those are very , very difficult questions , and for me to answer those questions sort of off the cuff , I think would not be responsible .
Bush Administration propaganda efforts have been well - documented .
In 2004 , for example , local stations were found to have received videos produced by more than 20 different federal agencies to promote the administrations policies , many of which aired as if they were the networks own reporting .
The Army and Air Forces Hometown News Service has delivered good military news to an estimated 41 million homes .
Nor were commentators immune :
In January 2005 , news emerged that conservative commentator Armstrong Williams had received $ 240,000 from the Education Department to promote the No Child Left Behind Act.

It seems to me that there are two programming modes : green fields and maintenance , and that their commenting requirements are different .
In the green fields mode I emphatically agree with the assertion that less is better wrt comments .
However , in maintenance mode comments are often the most valuable contribution to the code that you can make for a number of reasons : to correlate a bug with a code change if today 's maintainer needed large effort to understand the code so most likely will tomorrow's a maintainer is often better placed to see where a comment provides the most bang for a buck ( sometimes ) to distinguish a maintenance change from original code ( sometimes ) to elucidate the maintainer 's understanding of the code
That is not to say that every changed line of code requires a comment or that every comment should be a story that includes the maintainers state of mind and how much coffee had been consumed .
The rules for succint and sparse commenting still apply but the bar is lowered somewhat in light of a need to compensate for deficiencies ( perceived or otherwise ) in the original code .
The alternative may often be a completely impractical refactorisation of the code .
If a back story is required for the code changes , that should be in the bug tracking system with a synopsis in the check in comment in the revision control system .
If even half an hour is spent trying to understand a section of code , and that investigation could be averted in the future by addition of a brief comment , then the comment is a good investment .
Most times just a couple of words is enough to provide the hint required for understanding .
Anything more than a few words should point to documentation elsewhere - five minutes reading documentation is still way better than a half hour investigation .
Non-trivial bug fixes require a higher degree of commenting simply because , if the issue was n't obvious to the original programmer , it probably wo n't be obvious to whomever follows .
Very nice node btw !
DWIM is Perl 's answer to Gödel
I agree with you on this , in every detail .
Especially if the maintenance programmers comments are of one of the following forms : ## See rt # 1234
## See perlmonks node : 123456
## See change log item buk 08-05-2007
## A new element ( TIME_OF_DAY ) was added to the array
## See file DB_object for a description of the elements of the array
## The data is denormalised ( fields are duplicated ) for efficiency .
That 's just a few that come to mind .
Examine what is said , not who speaks -- Silence betokens consent --
Love the truth but pardon error .
" Science is about questioning the status quo. Questioning authority " .
In the absence of evidence , opinion is indistinguishable from prejudice .
" Too many [ ] have been sedated by an oppressive environment of political correctness and risk aversion . "
Well , green field projects usually enter maintenance ( ish ) mode fairly quickly , usually somewhere between three and six months in .
This is n't a bad thing , but rather a fact of life and so should be embraced and dealt with .
If they do n't take on a more maintenance kind of style , it is because of a lack of one or more of : Short iterations ( shorter than a month )
Proper testing ( and the resulting lack of code quality feedback )
Deployment , or at least decent show - and - tell sessions with the stakeholders ( and the resulting lack of design and requirements quality feedback ) /J
++ for your thoughtful insights .
I dislike coming across code that is more comment than code .
I disagree though , that just because we can't be expected to make up for deficiencies in the knowledge or those that follow us in maintenance , that that is reason to comment tersely or not at all .
A programmer , especially a skilled one , can hold a great many variables in their head at once .
And a programmer using a succinct language such as Perl can produce a mountain of functionality from a few lines of code - that often can't be written more clearly even if it is spread across more lines of code .
A maintenance programmer coming in later will have to absorb all of the variables , and all of the logic - JUST to get an idea of what is going on in a local area .
Code split into paragraphs with simple discriptive comments at the top of each paragraph are easy to digest and figure out what is going on .
They are also potentially search able .
Looking at some code I wrote six months ago I came across the following " code paragraph headings : "
# ## check if we are in the delete grace period # ## adjust check time if the last order was a renew or a transfer # ## determine what the status will be if there are no errors [ download ]
I was able to dive right in to what is going on with the code without reading any code .
Each of those comments are around a section of code of 5 to 10 lines each that I COULD figure out if I wanted to .
But I did n't have to expend the thought to do so .
Now , one important thing , is that you cannot account for programmers who lie or who comment incorrectly - but it becomes obvious quickly which comments do n't correlate at all .
So I would add some additional addenda to your conclusions :
No programmer can expect to account for all maintenance programmer shortcomings , but that does not free you from the obligation to try .
More often - than - not you are the maintenance programmer .
Keep your logic in discrete logical chunks with defined purpose - defined either with a comment or in external documentation .
Some code requires no comments .
No amount of documentation ( too much , too little , or just right ) will ensure that the maintenance programmer will read your documentation .
Use comments and documentation .
my @a=qw ( random brilliant braindead ) ; print $ a[ rand ( @a ) ] ;
A thought experiment ; what if I changed a few words in your post ?
Looking at some code I wrote six months ago I came across the following lines : if ( in_delete_grace_period ( ) ) { ... } adjust_time( $ check ) if last_order_needs_time_adjustment ( ) ; determine_status ( ) unless $ errors ; [ download ]
I was able to dive right in to what is going on with the code without reading any comments .
That would be great ... assuming that those subroutines were able to to be passed the 20 variables that are in scope ... and assuming that they are able to pass back the two or three variables that they modified .
You have given a nice contrived example that would certainly work under some conditions - but not this one ( ( sarcasm ) which you " obviously " could 've guessed without seeing the code ( / sarcasm ) ) .
My example came from working code - a small random sample of tens of thousands of lines that are all broken into commented paragraphs .
Some sections do look more like what you said - but not often .
Yes I could break into a subroutine every 10 to 20 lines , but then I have a different problem -- the code is arguably more fragmented and less easy to follow and has to find other ways to pass around variables .
Some sections of logic cannot be broken up without severely hampering readability , or without serious code mangling - but they can be broken into paragraphs with comment headings .
Update : made sure that sarcastic comment is taken as such .
my @a=qw ( random brilliant braindead ) ; print $ a[ rand ( @a ) ] ;
No programmer can expect to account for all maintenance programmer shortcomings , but that does not free you from the obligation to try .
I 'm sorry , but we will probably have to agree to disagree on this .
To my mind , that is exactly what it does do .
There is simply no way for me to predict what gaps there will be in the knowledge of any programmer that will see my code .
Or what they will find difficult to understand .
Or what idioms they will eshew as ' too complex ' .
I do not know who they will be , or what their experience levels will be .
Or how many of them there will be .
Or what their personal coding preferences , prejudices or blind spots will be .
Given that uncertainty , the best I could hope to do is include the entire contents of perldoc in a comment at the top of every program .
Ridiculous you say , but it is n't .
As far as understanding the vagaries , inconsistencies and idioms of Perl is concerned , that is the definitive answer .
The idea that I could write it better is ludicrous .
That it should be a part of my source files is more so .
No amount of documentation ( too much , too little , or just right ) will ensure that the maintenance programmer will read your documentation .
Use comments and documentation .
What makes you think he would read the comments ?
The first thing I do in most every piece of other peoples code I pick up is to throw away the comments ( in a copy ! ) .
The second is to manually reformat the code to my personal preferences .
The third is to ' fix ' any obvious verbosities , by recoding them to use ( my preferred ) idiomatic constructs and discard any extraneous ( used once intermediary ) variables .
Only once I have been through the entire file , line by line , and any related files required to allow me to form an understanding of what the code actually does -- not what the author thought it did -- do I even consider going back and looking at the authors comments .
It 's often very illuminating with respect to the authors level of understanding of what he wrote :)
And only after that process is complete do I consider myself even vaguely competent to consider modifying that code .
Even then , if this is real code that I am about to modify , I may well feel the need to add a bunch of trace statements and run it before I will consider attempting to modify it .
I never , ever take comments to be the truth .
Take those three comments you posted above .
From those comments I can derive quite literally zero information about what that code , or the program they were a part of , is designed to do .
You might , but then you wrote them .
But to me , they are entirely and utterly meaningless in the absence of further information .
However , if you had posted the code , minus the comments , I 'll bet that I could derive a whole lot more information than is included in those comments .
Often as not , if there is a code bug , or a subtle potential bug there , I 'll find it .
But if I read your description of what you think you code is doing , before I read the code itself , when I do read the code , I 'll probably not question it as closely , and so come away with the assumption that what you described it was doing , is correct .
Code is precise ; words are not .
Words are ambiguous and open to interpretation ; code is not .
The meaning of the words you use is subject to your education , your context , your prejudices , your mood , your experiences etc. etc .
Your code suffers from none of these flaws .
Programmers tend to comment those things that they personally found difficult to code or understand .
They reflect their own abilities and knowledge , not that of the people they are ( supposedly ) writing the comments for .
Even when you are your own maintenance programmer , you run the risk of influencing your own thought patterns back into the same ( incorrect ) groove you were in when your wrote that code .
One of my favorite debugging techniques , ( for my own code when time and circumstances permit ) , is to simply abandon it for a while .
Leave it as is and go do something else for a while before coming back to it and trying to understand it again .
The intervening period of time doing something else , preferably something very different , has the effect of washing my mind of all the assumptions and conclusions that I had previously reached about a problem and allows me to focus on it afresh .
To come at it from a different angle .
And so often that allows me to see the assumptions I was making .
And see the errors in those assumptions .
If I comment the code with those assumptions , then when I return to that code , I 'm likely to fall right back into making the same assumptions , and the same errors .
I 'll say it again .
Extensive comments are redundant and dangerous .
I use occasional and sparse comments when I feel they truly clarify a piece of code , but in general , my choice to not comment my code has nothing to do with being lazy .
It is an explicit and conscious decision based upon my personal experiences of the quality of comments I 've encountered and the value I perceive they have .
Examine what is said , not who speaks -- Silence betokens consent --
Love the truth but pardon error .

Well yeah .
And there 's no way for you to be able to predict whether the folks here on perlmonks can understand these sentences you wrote , and even after trading remarks back and forth on the subject several times , you may still have some doubts about whether we can follow what you 're saying here , and difficulties like this arise in every single aspect of communication right on down to choices of appropriate subroutine names ... and yet we all must muddle through , as best we can .
You may be someone who can read code better if it has no comments : do n't assume everyone is like that .
( Would you like some help writing a comment - stripper script ? )
Some notes below your chosen depth have not been shown here
Comments serve a different purpose to documentation .
And documentation does not belong in source code files .
Are you talking about Perl here ?
Are you saying that using POD in perl code is wrong in some way ?
I cannot agree with that .
( And just where should the documentation be ? )
Okay , programming is hard , and writing proper documentation is at least as hard -- often harder : striking the right balance of natural language coherence and logical / procedural accuracy is really another form of the common tasks in programming : problem - solving , puzzle - wrestling , optimizing , getting things into the right operational sequence , working out the best way to refer to things , and so on .
( Let 's face it , every higher - level programming language is really a sort of subset or reduced adaptation of a human language , designed to make control of computers possible for a wider range of humans , and easier for the ones who really understand the machines .
Comparing this to mathematics , chemistry , etc , is disingenuous -- people in those fields need text books , in a human language that they know , in order to learn the symbols and the syntax for combining them .
And that 's a lot of work ! )
So doing both the code and the documentation -- and maintaining both of them to keep them in sync -- is really hard .
But that 's a lousy reason for not doing it , and based on experience , I tend to believe that the code is easier to write ( and to get right more quickly ) when the documentation has been written first , and is as clear and unambiguous as the code needs to be .
What I mean is : the coding is less work when the documentation is done first .
An added nice feature about that , when you 're able to do it , is that you can show the docs to people who do n't know how to program ( e.g. a customer or sponsor ) , and assuming you are dealing with people who know how to use the same human language that you are using , they can understand it , react to it , make suggestions for improvements , and so on .
Even though the population proficient in any given human language is " limited " , it 's a lot bigger than the population proficient in a given programming language -- English , French , etc are good for somehting , even to programmers .
And a nice thing about doing it as POD in your Perl script is that it 's always right there for you , the programmer , and it's also really easy to present to others , the non-programmers , in a clear , human - readable form .
When time / money are limited , and you can only do one thing , then obviously it 's better to write the code rather than the documentation .
But then you get what you pay for , which is probably going to be about half of what you really need .
In general , I 'm afraid that this piece stikes me as an extended rationalization for being lazy about documentation and writing uncommented code ... my personal experience is that if the programmer is under the delusion that the code is " self - documenting " you might as well throw it away and re-write it than attempt to figure out what 's going on with it .
One of the strengths of the perl programming culture is that so many of it's programmers are also fluent in English , and have no problem with writing comments , pod , web pages , articles , books , etc ...
One of my slogans these days is that " perl is the best documented language in history " .
If this approach bothers you , maybe you should be looking into a language with a culture that 's more suspicious of words .

One of the high priority goals in programming is the removal / avoidance of codependencies .
We avoid using parallel data structures ( eg.parallel arrays ) , because it becomes a nightmare to maintain those parallel arrays in synchronisation as algorithms and projects evolve .
One of the key attributes of well designed classes ( and other abstractions ) , is that they are as fully independent of their peers as possible .
As decoupled as is possible to achieve .
This is a clever line of argument , but I do n't think it applies to the subject at hand .
Nearly every workable methodology for verifying the correctness of code involves comparisons between multiple implementations of the logic : the code is n't complete without documentation ( and specs ? ) , and these days most of us would say that it is n't complete without automated tests .
Note that automated tests have the same problems you 're complaining about with comments and documentation : when you make changes it 's likely you 're going to need to make changes in all of these roughly - parallel structures : code , comments , docs and tests .
( Update : Fixed attribution of quote to BrowserUk . )
In general , I 'm afraid that this piece stikes me as an extended rationalization for being lazy about documentation and writing uncommented code ...
Sorry , but that first sentence indicates that you have not read what I wrote , but rather skimmed a few bits and reached a conclusion based upon what you think I probably wrote .
Eg. Comments are not , and should not be , documentation Documentation of code is vitally important for successful , ongoing projects , but comments are not documentation .
I have no problem with you holding a different opinion to myself , but do n't put words in my mouth , or draw concusions based upon things I have n't said , much less things I specifically and deliberately already countered .
Eg.2 I ( BrowserUk ) wrote the article , but you 've addressed your reply , and attributed my words to graff .
If your comments and documentation are as good , you are welcome to them :)

" Science is about questioning the status quo. Questioning authority " .

Comments and docs are issues .
But with automated tests , you have to treat them as the running specs of the system .
If you change the specs , then you have to change the test cases , and only then , can you change the code to conform to the tests again .
In fact , you should never be able to successfully compile your entire project if a test fails .
That way the test serve its purpose and it never becomes out of sync .
Are you talking about Perl here ?
Yes .
Are you saying that using POD in perl code is wrong in some way ?
It depends , but essentially : yes .
Firstly , I am not a fan of POD -- leastwise , not in it 's current Perl 5 form -- but that 's a different issue .
Secondly , there are many forms of documentation .
Comments are ( should be ) explicitly confined to annotating the code .
That is , this particular piece of code , in this file , Preferably on this line .
Anything more than this should be dealt with in documentation - - somewhere else .
At the very minimum , documentation should be moved to the bottom of the source file .
Interleaving it with the code , detracts from the code in ways that go far beyond just interrupting the programmers overview of the code .
It also creates dependencies .
I cannot agree with that .
Fair enough .
( And just where should the documentation be ? )
In a separate file with the same name as the source file but with a different extension .
That is , the unit documentation .
System documentation should exist at the system development directory structure .
Okay , programming is hard , and writing proper documentation is at least as hard -- often harder : striking the right balance of natural language coherence and logical / procedural accuracy is really another form of the common tasks in programming : problem - solving , puzzle - wrestling , optimizing , getting things into the right operational sequence , working out the best way to refer to things , and so on .
Sorry to be pedantic , but my meditation was addressed to comments , not documentation .
and as I said : Comments are not ( and should not be ) documentation .
Simplifying , for the purposes of discussion , some questions to ask when deciding what is comment and what is documentation are :
Would this comment be useful to anyone other than another programmer working on this piece of code ?
?
Would this comment have any meaning to anyone , in the absence of the code ?
If this code is ported to another language , would this comment still make sense ?
/ li >
If the answer to any of these questions is yes , then that comment is not a comment , but documentation .
As such , it should be a part of the documentation set , not tucked away in a comment where it will never be seen outside of the source file .
( Let 's face it , every higher - level programming language is really a sort of subset or reduced adaptation of a human language , designed to make control of computers possible for a wider range of humans , and easier for the ones who really understand the machines .
Comparing this to mathematics , chemistry , etc , is disingenuous -- Sorry , but I strongly disagree that it is disingenuous to compare these notations .
people in those fields need text books , in a human language that they know , in order to learn the symbols and the syntax for combining them .
And that 's a lot of work ! )
And programmers do not ?.
They need text books ( or their electronic equivalents ) , to learn how to program .
So doing both the code and the documentation -- and maintaining both of them to keep them in sync -- is really hard .
But that 's a lousy reason for not doing it , and based on experience , Again , I am not questioning the need for , nor resisting doing , documentation .
I am saying that comments -- # words more words etc. is the wrong place for documentation .
I tend to believe that the code is easier to write ( and to get right more quickly ) when the documentation has been written first , and is as clear and unambiguous as the code needs to be .
What I mean is : the coding is less work when the documentation is done first .
I totally agree with you , but writing documentation in comment cards is wrong .
An added nice feature about that , when you 're able to do it , is that you can show the docs to people who do n't know how to program ( e.g. a customer or sponsor ) , and assuming you are dealing with people who know how to use the same human language that you are using , they can understand it , react to it , make suggestions for improvements , and so on .
Even though the population proficient in any given human language is " limited " , it 's a lot bigger than the population proficient in a given programming language -- English , French , etc are good for something , even to programmers .
But not for describing algorithms .
It is too imprecise .
Too shaded with ( mis ) interpretable meanings .
Too complex and vague .
And a nice thing about doing it as POD in your Perl script is that it 's always right there for you , the programmer , and it's also really easy to present to others , the non-programmers , in a clear , human - readable form .
If you place your documentation in ( for example ) POD , that 's true , but if you place it in comments , the only way anyone sees it , is if they look in the source file .
Again , you are failing to recognise the distinction I make between comments and documentation .
When time / money are limited , and you can only do one thing , then obviously it 's better to write the code rather than the documentation .
But then you get what you pay for , which is probably going to be about half of what you really need .
I find this to be an artificial distinction .
I 've never yet worked on a commercial project where time and money were not limited .
I also think that no plan survives first contact with the enemy .
That is to say , documentation written at a level that prescribes the implementation of any given subroutine , function or class , in advance of the first attempt to implement it , is usually so far from reality that it is next to useless either in writing that first implementation , or for maintaining it once the code is working .
Without serious work , it rarely if ever reflects the realities of the implementation .
But in any case , you are still confusing my meditation on comments with something relating to documentation .
Nothing I said precludes , nor denigrates the writing of documentation .
Indeed , I said in my meditation that " documentation was vital " .
All I said that related to documentation , is that comments are should not be used for documentation purposes .
And that source files are not the right place for it .
I will concede that , if you think that embedding documentation in code ( POD ) is a useful concept , then keeping that documentation in the same file as the source has some merit .
Not much , but some .
However , I strongly feel that the practice of interleaving code and documentation is a bad one .
If you must keep it in the same source file , at least keep it all together .
Preferably at bottom after the __END__ mark , though that is impossible if the code uses a __DATA__ section .
Personally , I think that POD has it backward .
If you want to go with the idea of containing code and documentation within the same file , I much prefer the Literate Programming concept of having the interpreter / compiler simply ignore everything outside of some equivalent of < code ></ code > blocks , as is used by Haskell , D and others .
This allows you to write the documentation first , in whatever markup it adopted by the project , and using the full power of that chosen markup .
Examine what is said , not who speaks -- Silence betokens consent --
Love the truth but pardon error .
" Science is about questioning the status quo. Questioning authority " .
In the absence of evidence , opinion is indistinguishable from prejudice .
" Too many [ ] have been sedated by an oppressive environment of political correctness and risk aversion . "
At the very minimum , documentation should be moved to the bottom of the source file .
Interleaving it with the code , detracts from the code in ways that go far beyond just interrupting the programmers overview of the code .
You 're in agreement with Damien Conway on this , but myself I think interspersed pod-style has some strong DRY advantages .
Most subs require some verbal description to go with them , and there 's some overlap between what you need to say for the benefit of a maintenance programmer working on your code and a client programmer interested in using your code , and it's not at all a bad idea to put that inside an " =item " that goes with the sub .
( And I would hope that it is obvious that remarks that are only of interest to a maintenence programmer should be confined to comments . )
It also creates dependencies .
The dependencies between the documentation and the code do not go away if you move the documentation elsewhere .

I 'm once again , having trouble figuring out what you 're getting at here .
Nothing about the interspersed pod style I 'm arguing for prevents you from writing the documentation first , and in fact I often work that way .
Of course , if you use this style you have to present the code in the same order that you want it to appear in the documentation , and that 's a problem that would go away in a true " literate programming " language .
By the way : you do understand that you can embed other markup inside of pod if you want to , right ?
From perlpod : =begin html < hr> < img src=" thang.png " > < p >
This is a raw HTML paragraph </ p > =end html [ download ]
If you must keep it in the same source file , at least keep it all together .
Preferably at bottom after the __END__ mark , though that is impossible if the code uses a __DATA__ section .
Actually , you should get out of the habit of using __END__ at all : it breaks mod_perl code .
I agree with you completely , BrowserUK , but especially with two points ( my paraphrasing ) :
The best course of action in examining code is to strip out everything but code and format it consistently .
Documentation should be detailed and use every tool we humans have come up with for enhancing readability .
I , too , am a fan of Literate Programming , though I have yet to find the right tool to give me both views of a project .
We should be able to switch between pure - code view and documentation view at will , without the messy comment - stripping and PerlTidy steps in the middle .
Even better , I 'd like three views : pure code , syntax - highlighting with hyperlinked definitions and where - used lists , and documentation view with full text enhancement .
Ed Ream 's Leo is a step in the right direction , but it is n't all the way there .
Mindmaps have documentation advantages , too , as do some CASE environments .
I think doxygen is also a great example of the direction we should be heading in this arena .
The Xerox PARC Star environment ( also Smalltalk / V , Squeak , etc. ) with classes and clickable browsers also had excellent usability features , although Smalltalk , the language , was a syntactic mess .
We have powerful computers these days , with incredibly powerful graphics .
I grew up with 7 - segment displays and a hex keypad , and I spent much of the first half of my career burning EPROMS on microcontrollers .
I have come to believe that , no matter what the ultimate target , fancy IDEs that enhance the programming ( and debugging ) experience are essential to rapid and effective code development .
The need grows exponentially more urgent as teams expand and the underlying hardware , OS , and system interfaces become more complex and critical .

" There 's more than one level to any answer . "
Very well said .
Thank you for the time you put into it .
And most especially , thank you for saying something that needs to be said over and over again until everyone in the universe understands it : Programmers should not expect to be able to open a source file at random , move to some arbitrary point within that file and then instantly be able to modify the code there from just a cursory glance at the code and comments in the locality .
I cannot tell you how many times I 've heard " This program worked fine until the last time we had it modified by our usual programmer , and ever since it works fine most of the time but every now and then does n't work at all " .
It 's always always always because their " usual programmer " modified the thing without bothering to gain sufficient understanding of the program as a whole entity .
When I hear that story from a potential new client , I wo n't even look at the code until I 'm on the clock .
Too often , that other guy in whom they 've lost confidence has been given one last chance and is out there feverishly kludging together yet another bandaid pseudofix .
His desperation will always move faster than my diligence .
I cannot tell you how many times I 've heard " This program worked fine until the last time we had it modified by our usual programmer , and ever since it works fine most of the time but every now and then does n't work at all "
My usual follow up to conversations like these is something like : " Good thing you now have extensive unit tests around your code .
You do have unit tests around your code right ? "
Any recent system I 've worked on has a test suite .
" I " understand the code " I " have written and " I " have broken the code when " I " though " I " knew what " I " was doing .
Commenting or not has little to do with the situation .
It is good that I 've had revision control and unit tests to figure out what I broke , how to fix it , and how to check that everything still works .
That really should be done in maintenance mode as well - find all of the existing use cases , wrap them up in a unit test file .
Make sure that test file works as you progress in your changes .
Oh - and be sure to leave a comment for why you chose the new algorithm that you implemented . :)
my @a=qw ( random brilliant braindead ) ; print $ a[ rand ( @a ) ] ;
It 's not often that I consent to inherit someone else 's problem code , but when I do there 's an economic reality to be considered .
If the client 's cap is at four hours of labor ( billed ) , I 'm not going to spend 40 hours writing tests .
I do n't provide charity to commercial enterprises aside from that extorted by the IRS to be doled out as corporate welfare .
I always comment non-obvious design decisions , by the way .
Those are comments that might actually be useful to the competent maintenance programmer who 's been tasked with refactoring my code .
I frequently include URI 's for in - depth discussions of the algorithms that might not be known to programmers at large .
If I 've optimized the code , I 'll frequently include benchmark results to show that the code has been optimized at the right point in the development cycle .
But I 'm not going to take on the role of educator to explain to a maintenance programmer why I 've chosen to implement a database connection as a singleton , or memoized a recursive method that can benefit from it .
He already knows why , or can do his own homework , or can take the job he 's best suited for down at the car wash .
I can't save the code or the client from him and it's not my job .
While I value good code and sound professional practices , I 'm really not going to lose any sleep over what happens two years down the road when some cheap client hands my code over to some high school kid who 's only worked through the first four chapters of Learning Perl .
Not my problem , not my job .
If I 'm for some reason deemed not quite good enough to do the work , then that squeaky voiced kid who calls to ask " Yo , Gee , w'sup widdis singleton shizit ? " had darn well better be .
He dialed the wrong number and is on his own .
I enjoyed your node very much .
One observation - in the case of the sciences , we spend a great deal of time bringing people up to speed so that they can be able to manipulate the abstractions we use to describe the world .
I do n't see this happening in the IT world of *** certified technicians , developers and the other short cuts that are used to force feed basic knowledge and practices into someone who then calls themselves a certified programmer , admin or whatever will sell a certificate .
A PhD can take three to seven years and even then we regard the output of these programs as beginners - and this is someone who has been constantly exposed to and practising the discipline since graduating secondary school .
It takes several more years to really know what is going on and to be able to manipulate it in a peer acceptable way .
On top of that we promote our research and ideas by writing down and publishing the results of our research in a specially crafted format that allows some one to reproduce what we have done .
If it 's not published and reproducible , its simply not science .
Nowadays if it 's good science you count the numbers of times it is cited by others as support for their own work .
The closest I think IT comes is in the likes of APIs , RFCs and formal documentation systems .
Although certification is very in vogue , really the products are still beginners - very like moving from printed letters on ruled pages to joining the letters up in scripts on unlined pages , but still really not knowing how to compose an essay very well .
The IT equivalent of peer review is either passing and failing test suites or use cases .
Not many organizations do code reviews from what I can see .
And each of these does it differently - I have never really come across a standard for writing code .
Or seen it enforced in the way the scientific community uses peer review to at least standardize the transmission of knowledge in papers .
The closest I have ever seen of the process of teaching and learning how to do the trade in IT was in my company before it was acquired by a larger corporation .
They brought in people , had them work under more senior managers and they learned through tutoring and experience how to manipulate the codebase in a way that was acceptable to groups of coders .
We had documentation of the code both in the source and as formal documentation .
We had test suites , though not to the level I see advocated by the Monks .
The process was sufficiently succesful enough that we could offshore to India , but the documentation was not enough - what was still missing was the simple ability to ask a question and get an answer .
Once the original coders were gone , development slowed to a fraction of what it used to be .
Its not a problem of the new developers - they are very skilled .
Its a problem of how much time it takes to develop enough knowledge to understand an abstraction in the code base that is not documented well or at all .
From what I can see we may all speak Perl but there are dialects and accents in how it is used .
This is much the same as in natural languges where there are dialects of English I can't begin to understand and accents that I find more pleasing than others .
Going back to you original point , I think what you are advocating is great if it 's your own stuff , you are working within a stable group or you are very experienced in all idioms of yor language / development platform .
The main problem is the level of documentation needed for projects where the personnel are not stable and the next developer is someone who is not a script kiddie but is not as fluent as the last guy to comprehend and be able to make the modifications necessary to complete a job .
What does some fellow with a small business really need to have in order to keep on using the code you developed for his web site , his aplication or whatever .
The closest he can undestand to coding and development is going to his local garage and getting work done on his car .
The proof of the mechanic is how well the car runs afterwards .
An upgrade ( new seats , new stereo ) either work or do n't work - the question for the mechanic is how well can he make modifications based on his understanding of what appears to be necesary to modify the car .
And this difference between what you meant and what he thinks he needs to do to make a modification is where the dragons lurk .
Just because he is not the world 's greatest mechanic should n't stop him from changing the beaks , replacing sparc plugs or doing a new paint job .
The question is how to help him recognise the job will be more difficult that first or second glance shows and then help him understand enough to either do it or pass it on to someone more experienced .
Sometimes the manufacturer 's manuals just do n't do it and you wish you could quiz the systems mechanic on what the hell was he thinking .
I hold that if you write something you should keep a mind to the next maintainer and provide enough documentation or test suites to help them understand what the code does .
Sometimes it has to be code comments .
Promoting standardized coding practices ala Conway is a good way of reducing dialectic confusion .
But if you think the code needs it , then put in the comment .
The new guy will soon see whether they are useful or not , but at least you gave him the chance to understand what you were thinking of at the time you wrote the comment .
If nothing else it shoes some fairness to the boyo that paid you to do the work in the first place , even if he was a tight wad .

There is a serious flaw in comparing programming to scientific research .
Programming in the large is not science .
To equate programming in general to fields of science is like equating architecture and construction of a building to physics .
Programming uses CS as a basis the way architecture and construction use physics as a basis .
There are a couple of simple rules at work here that often get overlooked in the programming realm :
The size and complexity of the project determines how sophisticated and informed your methods need to be .
Also , the more levels of knowledge being built upon your contributions , the more fundamental and universal your contributions need to be .
Let 's face it .
A cook is a chemist of sorts , and so is a candle maker .
Neither is going to rewrite textbooks about chemistry .
A carpenter or bricklayer has some sort of physics knowledge , but they are not going to split the atom or need a particle accelerator .
At one time , a cab driver or a cashier actually had to know some math , but they were n't in the business of proving the number of dimensions in the universe .
We do n't have any solid , universally accepted differences in title between a sysadmin who 's really talented with shell scripts and someone who writes frameworks for generalizing facial recognition software .
Just because both might be called " programmer " or " software developer " does not mean the two are equivalent .
I think this is a large part of the confusion in the software industry .
I also think it 's part of what causes so much friction between the highly qualified , very method - oriented people doing lofty things and the people who write small applications for small clients in small markets .
The truth is , you do n't want everyone to be a scientist .
You do n't even want everyone to be an engineer .
You wo n't wait for a Pasteur or a Salk to mix your cough syrup .
You wo n't wait for a Hawking or an Einstein to build your house , or for a Tesla or Westinghouse to wire it .
What you want , down in the trenches , is people who take the results of research and engineering and figure out how to apply those components and best practices to the project at hand .
Researching fundamentals is important , but so is having homes , food , clothing , and a community site like Perlmonks to debate the point .
If the research and experiments have already given us evidence that a particular way of doing things is a good way , why can't some people just use those good ways while others further the research ?
Just because some people do n't use best practices when they should does n't mean everyone should be in the realm of developing new fundamental knowledge .
That 's where the line between technology and science lies .
Technology benefits from science , but people as a whole benefit from the fruits of technology more than directly from the fruits of science .
Day - to - day programming is , like building construction , more a technological trade than a science or research topic .
It 's a method of combining established parts using established methods to further one of a set of fairly common goals .
Sometimes a building contractor finds an innovative and truly better way to build part of a house .
An architect is more likely than the contractor to find a new and better way to design the whole house .
That same architect might develop a new and better way to fasten two materials together , but an engineer is more likely to do so .
The engineer might develop an altogether better material from which to make the fasteners , but a researcher is more likely to do that .
It 's this way in any field , really .
I 'm not sure why people get the idea that software should be different .
Another trend you 'll notice if you look at more established technologies is that these mostly stratified layers become more established the longer a trade is around .
We did n't used to have a designer , a spinner , a dyer , a weaver , a cutter , and a seam sewer for making garments .
People used to design and build a car single - handedly , but now there are auto researchers , auto engineers , auto factory engineers , auto factory employees , and auto factory robots .
In time , I think we 'll see such lines drawn in the software industry , of course with some mobility among layers .
I just hope the titles are n't still , ' chief software designer ' , ' system analyst 3 ' , and such meaningless chaff .
Christopher E. Stith
Excellent post . :-)
I always liked the comparison between software and building construction .
I think it 's one of the best " real - world " analogies we can use to explain what we do , but there are differences .
I view myself as being somewhere between an engineer and an architect .
I like to " think with my hands " so to speak : think up a rough overall design , implement it and then move code around , rewrite parts until it works well and makes sense .
The reason that works well ( or at all ) in software development is because of a pretty fundamental difference between building construction and software development ; there is hardly any difference in software between the design and the product .
It 's only a matter of abstraction .
Any really comprehensive software design is practically code ( and you can argue that the reverse is also true ) .
That 's also a reason I do n't like / believe in " automatic code generation from designs " - if your design is that comprehensive you 're still programming , only chances are you 're not using the right tools for the job .
" What should it profit a man , if he should win a flame war , yet lose his cool ? "
It 's hard to pick out a appropriate quote from your first six paragraphs , it would require quoting the whole lot I think .
I completely agree with you .
Programming is still yet a very young discipline when compared to most others .
It has yet to established itself in the same way or to the same level of scientific reproducibility as the older disciplines .
it is still searching for it's equivalent of the universally standard nomenclatures enjoyed by those other disciplines , and that 's reflected in the constant strains between existing and new languages ; existing and new methodologies ; existing and new tool - sets ; working practices ; et al .
Everything within the industry is still in flux .
In part , this is because unlike the historic , slow boil evolution of the scientific methods involved in mathematics , and the other sciences , which evolved over centuries , through the hands , minds and publishings of a few greats , working primarily alone , but in communication with their ( few ) peers ; programming is evolving in a world of mass communication , widespread , low - level participation , and commercial pressure .
It is not so much evolving as constantly revolving .
( As in revolution , but also going around in circles . :)
With each new generation , comes a least one ' new ' methodology , language , set of working practices .
And usually many of each .
Each will be held up by it's proponents as the magic bullet that will revolutionise the industry .
The Holy Grail for productivity , or reliability , or re-usability , or efficiency .
And usually all of those .
Invariably , each of these revolutions has some merits .
Equally invariably , they have their flaws also .
In this ever changing , and multi- frontiered world , it has become nigh impossible to be aware of all the developments as they happen , never mind keep pace with them sufficiently to be able to pick out those parts that will persist and make it into the future .
The historical debates between expert practitioners , often conducted over years by letter , or even the publishing of books , has no true equivalent in the modern world .
Single ideas that would have formerly been debated over years , ( sometimes decades ) , come and go in fleeting electronic moments .
Lost in the noise of internecine wrangling ; interpersonal debates ; ad hominem attacks ; general and specific flame - fests of all kinds .
Everyone has an angle ; an axe to grind ; an ego to defend ; a buck to make .
The software industry spends far too little time exploring and debating the outcome of ideas , methods and practices .
Instead of looking back at what was done , and trying to determine what was effective and what was not ; how small changes might have made big differences to outcomes ; how small parts from several methodologies could be extracted and combined to produce something bigger than the sum of the parts .
As an industry , we are always looking for the next magic bullet .
The next revolution that will save our collective souls .
We discard not just the bad parts of what we did before , but everything , and leap upon the next bandwagon like it was a number 32 bus headed for nirvana .
The art of debate has been lost .
The merit of seeing the other guys point of view ; the benefit of constantly re-evaluating ones opinions in the light of the other guys thoughts and experience ; is effectively dead within the programming community .
If you use Perl , you must also be convinced that CamelCase is bad ; must subscribe to the OSS ethic ; must be one of the LAMs in LAMP .
I 'm a relatively new study on the history of mathematics , and I am aware that some of the historical greats were far from ego less .
I know that there were , at various points in time where two or more of the greats coexisted on this earth , considerable and heated ( if you can get heated when communications is by a letter back forth every month or two :) , disputes over big ideas .
But , from what I read , on those occasions when the owners of those egos and conflicting ideas got together in the same place , they would happily sit down and share a meal and a few bottles of wine before or after a face - to - face debate where they each held opposing views .
Technology means that we are able to communicate ever more quickly and with ever wider groups , but the human part of the equation has n't kept pace .
We humans still fall into our historic roles of tribes and combatants .
To try and bring this back on track .
The software industry became an industry before it became a discipline .
There are many , too many , languages , methodologies , sets of working practices , existing and coming on stream everyday , for any one person or group of people to be able to say what is best and what is not .
Where pure research ( into software and development ) exists , it tends to be very far removed from the every day realities of commercial practice .
To badly paraphrase a line from a sci- fi program : the software industry is still young ; it has much to learn .
Sometimes , the best way to move forward is to look backward .
Examine what is said , not who speaks -- Silence betokens consent --
Love the truth but pardon error .

But I gather that this is the reason you mentioned the " first six paragraphs " , because you were explicitly ignoring everything else .
( " The art of debate " ? )
Some notes below your chosen depth have not been shown here
I think you 've muddied the waters somewhat by saying : Documentation of code is vitally important for successful , ongoing projects , but comments are not documentation , and it has no place in source files .
If you 're talking about POD here , then I think that 's distinctly different to comments .
POD ( or JavaDoc or whatever you happen to be using ) is documentation , not comments .
It tells a user of a module how it 's interface works .
The fact that it 's kept in the same file as the source code does n't make it a comment .
In fact , I think it 's much better to keep it there , than some separate file that someone may not even realise is there when they 're updating the code ( one reason why doing this has become an industry - wide standard ) .
As far as actual comments go , I think you tend to find roughly 3 types :
Those explaining what something does
Those explaining how something does what it 's supposed to do Those explaining why something does what it does I tend to think # 1 is OK in small doses .
It can make code more readable , which to me trumps the synchronisation issues you 're talking about .
And at any rate - if kept high level enough - what a particular piece of code does is n't likely to change that much ( at least without the whole block of code getting wiped or re-written , along with the comments ) , so it 's not likely to get too out of date .
# 2 is either there because whoever maintains the code is assumed to be stupid , or the code itself is obfuscated .
In the latter case , the comments are really a red flag ( i.e. not evil in and of themselves , but a good sign some refactoring may be needed ) .
# 3 is often needed if the system - level design is ( or has become ) poor .
This is true of quite a lot of the code I 'm currently working with .
In these cases , the ideal situation is to fix the design .
However this is not always practical .
This is where these comments can become useful .
They should n't be a subsitute for system documentation , but they can make it much easier to pick up the context when reading code ( and even more so if they reference system docs ) .
So on the whole , I do n't really think extensive comments in and of themselves are evil , but they can often be pointers to other issues .
If ( module / unit ) documentation only ever consisted of interface specifications , then ( perhaps ) , POD would be fine .
But , all too frequently , it also has to contain a mountain of stuff that is essentially unrelated to the code .
Whether it 's algorithm explainations , or market research , or comparative studies or whatever else might be useful or required by the users of a module .
But often this stuff is of no consequence to the programmer maintaining the module .
To conflate user documentation with programmer documentation is a bad idea .
Even if the modules users are also programmers at the next level up , mixing the two types of documentation together means that it serves neither group well .
There 's also the problem that purely textual changes , from typos to reattributions to rephrasing of prose can trigger RCS trails associated with the code that should n't be .
Documentation also belongs in the RCS system , but as independant entities to the code , so that documentation changes do not affect the revision history of the code and vice versa .
Examine what is said , not who speaks -- Silence betokens consent --
Love the truth but pardon error .
" Science is about questioning the status quo. Questioning authority " .
In the absence of evidence , opinion is indistinguishable from prejudice .
" Too many [ ] have been sedated by an oppressive environment of political correctness and risk aversion . "
I think you have some valid points , but there are some issues with having separate module documentation files .
Apart from documentation not being directly under the maintainer 's nose as I mentioned above , a lot of tools expect the docs to be in the same file as the code , so browsing it becomes an issue .
This could fairly easily be worked around , but on balance , I think it becomes a matter of personal choice , rather than one way being inherently superiour to the other .
( There are ways to work around the problems of having it all in one file , such as having a good standard of what the format for each module should be , to keep out - of - place info creeping in ) .
But I think this is a separate discussion to your original point , which was on the merit of code annotations .
There 's also the problem that purely textual changes , from typos to reattributions to rephrasing of prose can trigger RCS trails associated with the code that should n't be .
Documentation also belongs in the RCS system , but as independant entities to the code , so that documentation changes do not affect the revision history of the code and vice versa .
This is actually a very good point ( though I have to say I thought that I was the last person in the world using RCS for version control ) .
Documentation and comment changes are more common than actual code changes ( at least if you 're someone like me who does re-write it to keep it up - to - date ) , and it might be better if those changes were n't cluttering the logs .
Damien Conway recommends against putting project documentation in a dedicated *. pod file : he argues that there 's no way to be sure the *. pod will get installed correctly in some place where it can be found , but if it 's inside the *. pm file , you know it 's always going to be with the code .
In part , under the influence of Conway , I 've been sticking to a documentation style where more tangential / higher - level material is confined to some pod at the bottom of the *.pm file ( I 'm a fan of " MOTIVATION " sections myself , they 're often the key thing that makes clear whether you want to use a module at all ) .
But in a multi- module project , I find I definitely have a problem with repeating myself too much , e.g. stating the project 's purpose over - and - over again ...
There are some clear advantages with having a project overview pod file elsewhere .
in my experience most code begins its life as prose , whether it is pseudo - code in my head or the pure natural language of CEO / CTO - speak , project notes , task descriptions , PRDs , statements of work , feature requests , bug reports , brainstorming sessions , notebook scribbles , user stories , sprint objectives , and other human - sourced content .
along the way , ideas are translated from the human realm to the human - computer shared - language realm of computer programming .
a well - placed comment of intent by a well - meaning but slightly - ignorant ;) co-worker can help reveal that a paragraph of code is mis-implemented .
in my opinion , the " coupling " of comments and code can be a good thing , as long as both are both concise and local .
but the purpose of the comments should not be to document the intricacies of your particular choice of implementation , but a general paraphasing of the task at hand .
++ for the excellent node .
I frequently find comments that violate the DRY principle .
They just repeat the code .
They cause the same maintenance problems that repetitive code creates , often worse since some developers read the comments more carefully than the code .
I liked the comment on mathematicians , physicists , etc. avoiding textual descriptions of theorems and designs .
I suppose testing is a good way to help us understand both code and theorems ( even when they 're well written ) .
Mathematicians , physicists , chemists and engineers go out of their way to avoid textual descriptions of their theorems and designs .
Their nomenclatures have evolved over hundreds of years through hard won , practical experience .
Much greater time periods than the computer industry , and computer code has existed .
In every case , they have evolved not because someone decided that it would be a ' good idea ' ; or as a form of protectionism al la the use of Latin in religious ceremonies , legal work and matters of state ; nor because they are too lazy to write their technical descriptions out in full in ' proper English ' ( French , German , Italian etc. ) .
Hopefully you 'll pardon a nit - picky digression , on the grounds that it 's at least mildly interesting .
Legal Latin belongs in the former group , not the latter .
Legal writing has every reason to be precise , and the use of phrases from a dead language serve that end .
They 're useful because they are n't used or understood in other contexts .
Take the phrase , per stirpes : literally , it means " by the stocks " .
If your will leaves money to your children per stirpes , you 're invoking a recursive algorithm .
Each of your children represents a branch , and the money will be divided evenly amongst those branches , if anyone is left alive in them .
So , for instance , you leave $ 100,000 to your five children per stirpes , but at the time of your death only three of them are alive .
Poor Gregor had a tragic mushrooming accident , and left no children , so his share is divided amongst the other branches .
Thus , the three who are alive each get $ 25,000 .
Unfortunately , your boy Ike died before you did ... but he had five children .
Four of them get $ 5000 ... but sadly , Ike 's daughter Prudence was in the boat with him when the leeches attacked , so her two children wind up with $ 2500 apiece .
The legal definition of per stirpes accounts for more than this .
You could insert the definition in each place you wanted it , as if you were expanding a macro , but whether the result would be clearer is dubious at best .
Even then , if your late son married , and then divorced , a woman with children , to they get shares ?
If second cousins from different branches married , had a daughter , and then died , does she inherit from both branches ?
A millenium of common law rulings clarifies a lot of unusual situations with per stirpes , but not the description of per stirpes you wrote .
The very fact that phrases like per stirpes and corpus delicti are foreign ensures that those using them mean something very particular .
They are , in any case , no more difficult than comparable English terms , such as " replevin " or " tortefeasor " .
" replevin " or " tortefeasor " .
I laughed , and I hope you will to .
According to google , it should be " tortfeasor " ( no 'e ' ) by a margin of 322,000 to 6 :p
None the less , your point is well taken .
In the context of modern law , the use of these pointed , sparse remnents of Latin are indeed a shorthand notation with very particular meanings .
In my defense , I was thinking more about the historical practice whereby all legal documents had to be enscribed entirely in Latin .
A practice that came about , or rather survived , mostly because it meant that only the privileded few could produce , read or hope to benefit from them .
Not to mention that it meant that laywers were required to produce and interpret them .
To a great extent , the latter practice still persists albeit that the Latin content is not the root cause .
For example , 25 years ago , when I purchased my first flat , it cost me £ 365 in laywers fees to complete the purchase of a 15 % share of a £ 12,000 property .
2 years ago , I self - conveyanced the transfer and sale of a let property ( £ 200,000 ; my previous home ) , and completed the entire transaction for £ 65 .
The only complications were due to the other party 's lawyer raising and re-raising a series of totally pedantic points , in what the other party and I concluded was an attempt to put him off of the purchase , simply because I was not using a lawyer .
Examine what is said , not who speaks -- Silence betokens consent --
Love the truth but pardon error .
" Science is about questioning the status quo. Questioning authority " .
In the absence of evidence , opinion is indistinguishable from prejudice .
" Too many [ ] have been sedated by an oppressive environment of political correctness and risk aversion . "

Bill Maher rips health care industry in ' New Rules ' segment RAW STORY
Published : Saturday September 29 , 2007

On his HBO show Real Time with Bill Maher , comedian Bill Maher came up with a few new rules citizens should follow .
Freeing the health care industry from corporate pressures was top on his list .
" If you believe you need to take all the pills the pharmaceutical industry says you do , " joked Maher , " then you are already on drugs . "
Noting that it's that time in the campaign where all the candidates present their health care proposals , Maher pointed out differences in the leading Democrats ' plans .
" Hillary 's covers children 's teeth , Edwards has one that includes maintaining gorgeous , shiny hair , and Barack Obama 's involves going on Oprah and everyone gets a gastric bypass ! "
But Maher found fault in all three , namely that none could outlaw " unhealthy food , alcohol or cigarettes ... just pot , sadly . "
The host then lamented , " but none of the plans address the real problem :
We wo n't stop being sick until we stop making ourselves sick . "
Since Maher argued that " government is n't your nanny ... they 're your dealer , and they subsidize illness in America , " he gave some prescient advice .
" Ask your doctor if getting off your ass is right for you . "
Some of his other new suggestions included a rule prohibiting 12 - year olds from wearing cologne and a rule granting Dennis Kucinich 's wife ( tongue stud and all ) the title of First Lady even if Dennis loses the Presidential bid .
President Bush should make all of his appearances as a mime , as well .
The following video is from HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher , broadcast on September 28 , 2007
Cars and light trucks powered by advanced diesel technology or hybrid technology can provide larger societal benefits than traditional gasoline - powered automobiles , according to a Rand Corporation working paper recently presented .
The research also found that light trucks and cars continuously fueled by a mixture of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline -- known as E85 -- compare unfavorably with the other two alternatives .
" Rising oil prices coupled with concerns about global climate change are driving debate about which fuels and engines should be used to power the 17 million new cars and trucks sold each year , " said John Graham , dean of the Pardee Rand Graduate School and senior author of the research paper .*
" Advanced diesel and hybrid technologies show very well in this study , in terms of benefits to the individual and society overall , " Graham said .
" E85 simply does n't provide the same benefits . "
The research examines the benefits and costs of three alternatives to the gasoline - powered internal combustion engine for the 2010 - 2020 period : gasoline - electric hybrid technology ( as found in the Toyota Prius or the Ford Escape SUV Hybrid ) , advanced diesel technology ( such as the Mercedes - Benz E320 sedan ) , and dual - fuel vehicles that are powered continuously by E85 .
Each alternative has the technological potential for significant market penetration in the near term , the research finds .
advertisement
Additionally , each technology was compared to a gasoline - powered vehicle .
Comparisons were made for three vehicle types : a mid-sized car , a mid-sized SUV and a large pick - up truck .
The cost - benefit comparisons were made from the perspective of individual consumers and society in general , on a per-vehicle basis over the life of the vehicle .
The paper ranks the four technologies using benefit - cost analysis .
Using most reasonable assumptions , the results placed advanced diesel technology first , followed by hybrid technology , the gasoline engine and E85 technology .
The consumer perspective accounted for technology cost , fuel savings , mobility and performance .
The societal perspective also included tailpipe pollutants , greenhouse gas emissions and " energy security costs " for the fuels -- the costs to society as a whole from greater dependence on expensive and unstable foreign oil supplies .
Fuel taxes are excluded in the societal case , which is typical of benefit - cost analysis .
And the costs are estimations that illustrate relative performance .
The results assume fuel prices of $ 2.50 per gallon for gasoline , $ 2.59 per gallon for diesel fuel , and $ 2.04 per gallon for E85 ( including tax credit ) .
The report also examines scenarios where fuel costs are much higher and much lower .
Among the key findings from the consumer perspective :
advertisement
For all three vehicle types , the advanced diesel offers the highest savings over the life of the vehicle among the options considered .
These savings increase with the size and fuel use of the vehicle : $ 460 for the car , $ 1,249 for the SUV and $ 2,289 for the large pick - up truck ;
The hybrid option has smaller but still considerable savings for SUV applications ( $ 1,066 ) , moderate savings for pick - up applications ( $ 505 ) but minimal savings over the life of the vehicle for car owners ( $ 198 ) ;
The vehicles operating on E85 cost all three owners more over the vehicle life , with a greater net cost burden for larger vehicles and increased fuel consumption : ( - $ 1,034 for cars , - $ 1,332 for SUVs , - $ 1,632 for pick - ups ) .
Both the hybrid and diesel vehicles are more fuel efficient than their gasoline - powered counterparts : 25 to 40 percent better for hybrid and 20 to 30 percent for diesel , depending on the vehicle .
" While it is assumed that the hybrid vehicle will save more fuel than the advanced diesel , the overall advantage goes to the diesel because of its lower technology costs and better performance such as increased torque , " Graham said .
" For E85 , it is the cost of producing the fuel , not vehicular changes , that drives the negative results . "
The key findings from the societal perspective are similar to those of the consumer perspective , including :
The advanced diesel again shows the most promise , particularly for the larger vehicles : $ 289 for cars , $ 1,094 for SUVs and $ 2,199 for large trucks .
The net benefits for hybrids are somewhat less positive , with moderate - to - small values of $ 481 for SUVs and $ 132 for light trucks , and an increased cost for cars ( - $ 317 ) over the life of the vehicle
Results for E85 remain uniformly negative , even more so for larger than smaller vehicles : - $ 1,046 for cars , - $ 1,500 for SUVs and - $ 2,049 for light trucks
" While the net benefit of E85 is generally unfavorable compared to hybrid and advanced diesel technology , the diesel 's edge over the hybrid is not as significant , " Graham said .
" If the cost of hybrid technology falls significantly , the benefits of the hybrid could equal or exceed the diesel . "
The report finds that E85 does not generate net societal benefits unless a breakthrough reduces ethanol production costs or gas prices stay near their current high levels for a sustained period of time .
" Hybrid and diesel technology are close , but diesels have the advantage for the typical motorist , and provide a strong edge for drivers who require towing , hauling and rugged capabilities such as those offered in pick - ups , " Graham said .
" Hybrids have a competitive edge for urban consumers who experience more stop - and - go city traffic . "
Graham said it is unlikely that market forces alone will result in widespread use of any of the three technologies , noting that federal consumer tax credits improve the benefit - cost estimates of the advanced diesel and hybrid technologies .
* Graham presented the results of the research November 8 at the annual meeting of the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management in Washington , D.C.
The peer - reviewed paper , entitled " The Benefits and Costs of New Fuels and Engines for Cars and Light Trucks , " is available online as part of Rand 's working paper series in which initial research results are shared publicly to solicit additional technical feedback .
The research was funded through philanthropic support for the Pardee Rand Graduate School , including contributions by DaimlerChrysler , The Dow Chemical Company , DuPont , Ford Motor Company , General Electric , General Motors and Toyota .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - The New York Times
Co said on Monday it will end its paid TimesSelect Web service and make most of its
Web site available for free in the hopes of attracting more readers and higher advertising revenue .
TimesSelect will shut down on Wednesday , two years after the Times launched the service , which charges subscribers $ 7.95 a month or $ 49.95 a year to read articles by columnists such as Maureen Dowd and Thomas Friedman .
The trademark orange “ T’s ” marking premium articles will begin disappearing Tuesday night , said the Web site ’s Vice President and General Manager Vivian Schiller .
The move is an acknowledgement by The Times that making Web site visitors pay for content would not bring in as much money as making it available for free and supporting it with advertising .
“ We now believe by opening up all our content and unleashing what will be millions and millions of new documents , combined with phenomenal growth , that that will create a revenue stream that will more than exceed the subscription revenue , ” Schiller said .
Figuring out how to increase online revenue is crucial to the Times and other U.S. newspaper publishers , which are struggling with a drop in advertising sales and paying subscribers as more readers move online .
TimesSelect generated about $ 10 million in revenue a year .
Schiller declined to project how much higher the online growth rate would be without charging visitors .
She also declined to say what the financial impact would be on the Times .
No employees would lose their jobs , she said .
TimesSelect had about 227,000 paying subscribers as of August .
People who receive the paper at home get access to it for free , as do students .
In total , 787,000 people have access to TimesSelect now , she said .
The number of subscribers met the paper ’s expectations , Schiller said .
“ We consider TimesSelect very successful , ” she said .
Paying TimesSelect subscribers will receive a pro-rated refund on their credit cards , she added .

Shares of Applied Digital Solutions and of its publicly traded subsidiary VeriChip , which makes an implanted microchip for identifying people , fell sharply yesterday as investors reacted to a report this weekend linking the tiny radio device to cancer .
The report , by The Associated Press , suggested that VeriChip and federal regulators had ignored or overlooked animal studies raising questions about whether the chip or the process of injecting it might cause cancer in dogs and laboratory rodents .
VeriChip said that it had not been aware of the studies cited in the report , according to the article , but both the company and federal regulators said yesterday that animal data had been considered in the review of the application to implant the chips in humans .
They said that there were no controlled scientific studies linking the chips to cancer in dogs or cats and that lab rodents were more prone than humans or other animals to developing tumors from all types of injections .
“ At this time there appears to be no credible cause for concern , ” said Karen Riley , a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration .

Thanks to everyone who responded to the formal proposal to publish the design principles draft , as well as everyone who participated in other parts of the discussion .
http://www.w3.org/2002/09/wbs/40318/wdhdp/results
While not all comments have been addressed to the satisfaction of all working group participants , there is considerable support for publication ( 51 " Yes , agree " responses , in particular ) .
There were two ' no ' votes and one formal objection : " No , the Design Principles as currently formulated make reference to putative HTML 5 elements about which there is widespread disagreement ( < i > and ( b > , to name but two ) .
The Design Principles should be cast in abstract language so as not to appear to lend support to any particular putative HTML 5 feature , element , attribute , etc . "
That seems to fall under the category of a comment on the document that can be addressed in future drafts , not a critical reason to continue to delay publication .
We are resolved , then , to release HTML Design Principles as a W3C Working Draft .
Mike Smith will please work with Maciej Stachowiak and Anne van Kesteren to get the document published on http://www.w3.org/TR/

Since it was launched in 1973 , NASA ’s Pioneer 10 space probe has traveled over thirteen billion miles , and is now hurtling through a region of asteroids and comets known as the Kuiper Belt .
Its last radio contact , barely detectable given the probe ’s diminishing power levels , was received on 23 January 2003 , about thirty - one years after it left the Earth .
During it ’s long journey through the universe , should any intelligent beings come across Pioneer 10 ( or Pioneer 11 , which carries a copy of the same plaque ) , they ’ll be greeted with a pictorial engraving from humanity in the form of a 6 by 9 - inch gold anodized plaque bolted to the spacecraft ’s frame .
The plaque design attempts to convey as much data about humans and the Earth as possible using simple line diagrams , in the hope that whatever beings may find it can learn whence and from where the probe originated .
Among other things , it depicts a naked man and woman , with the right hand of the man raised as a sign of good will .
It also indicates the layout of our solar system , as well as our sun ’s position relative to a number of pulsars , so that our location can be triangulated from fixed points in space .
When the plaque ’s design was revealed to the general public , a number of people were upset about it for various reasons .
Because it depicts nudity , there was a huge uproar about NASA “ wasting ” taxpayer money to send “ obscenities ” into space .
Clearly , the people voicing such pseudo - moral objections were “ morons . ”
Or rather , they had the unfortunate character flaw of being unable to separate an obscene image from a benign , scientifically useful drawing .
There were also many who criticized the complexity of the message , indicating that it would not be immediately understandable to a completely alien civilization .
This is certainly true , but the plaque ’s designers did not intend for the message to be instantly detectable , only for it to be precise and informative .
If found , its discoverers can spend as much time as necessary to decode its message , even if it takes generations .
Still other critics warned that showing a map to the probe ’s planet of origin may invite a hostile race to find and attack the Earth .
This risk does exist , but even in the extremely unlikely event that the first star a Pioneer probe encounters ( two million years from now ) is home to a hostile race bent on our destruction , they must first A ) detect the fast - moving piece of space debris , B ) capture it , C ) decode the plaque ’s message , D ) locate our planet , and E ) traverse the distance .
This means that at the soonest , such aggressors would be arriving in about three million years .
In point of fact , the chances of the probe ever being discovered by any civilization⁠ — hostile or otherwise⁠ — are virtually non-existent , even if the universe is teeming with life .
Something so tiny is just lost against the enormity of space .
So why even bother including message ?
It seems that it was motivated by pure , unadulterated optimism .
On the off chance that the someone , somewhere ever stumbles across our humble probe , it ca n’t hurt to tell them a little about ourselves .
The encoded information ( color added for demonstration purposes , the original signal contained no color information )
NASA ’s next attempt at making contact with aliens arrived in 1974 , when the Arecibo radio telescope was remodeled .
To mark the occasion , a high - powered message was beamed towards globular star cluster M13 , some 25,100 light years away .
This target was selected because it contains such a large number of stars , which might increase the message ’s likelihood of being detected by intelligent races ⁠ — were it not for the fact that M13 will no longer be there when the signal arrives .
Be that as it may , the transmission will continue on its course through outer space indefinitely , one day encountering distant galaxies , so something or someone could conceivably receive it .
The graphic representation of the message ( pictured ) has color added to indicate the different sections .
It was originally transmitted in binary , using prime digits to give clues on how to arrange the pixels .
Among other things , it attempts to depict a human , the structure of DNA , and our solar system , but clearly it ca n’t represent any of those things very clearly in the given space .
However , if the message is ever received and decoded , it will certainly be clear to the recipients that it originated from an intelligent source .
If nothing else , aliens should be able to deduce the existence of the Atari 2600 game console .
If they have a reply , we can expect to receive it in about 50,200 years , assuming we ’re still able to listen for it .
But the most ambitious information payloads that we ’ve blasted into the cosmos are those attached to the sides of the Voyager 1 and 2 probes , launched in 1977 .
Each probe has a copy of the same gold gramophone record , which is encoded with sounds and images intended to portray the diversity of life and culture on Earth .
The probes also provide a cartridge and a needle for use in reading the records ’ contents .
Each record ’s data includes images , sounds from nature , recorded greetings in 55 languages , and a selection of music from around the world .
Among the encoded photographs , it was originally planned to include a picture of a nude man and a nude pregnant woman , but after the uproar over the nude engravings on the Pioneer plaques , NASA decided against it .
Pictured is the gold - plated protective cover , which is engraved with diagrams describing how to extract the data from the disk , and the same pulsar diagram from the Pioneer probes indicating the record ’s place of origin .
NASA also had the cover electroplated with Uranium 238 , so an advanced race might determine the record ’s age by measuring the amount of radioactive decay .
President Carter included a spoken greeting on the record , which included the following :
“ We cast this message into the cosmos . . .
Of the 200 billion stars in the Milky Way galaxy , some – – perhaps many – – may have inhabited planets and space faring civilizations .
If one such civilization intercepts Voyager and can understand these recorded contents , here is our message :
We are trying to survive our time so we may live into yours .
We hope some day , having solved the problems we face , to join a community of Galactic Civilizations .
This record represents our hope and our determination and our goodwill in a vast and awesome universe . ”
Of course it is unlikely that any intelligent race will ever stumble across one of our derelict spacecraft , and even if they do , the time scales and distances involved are staggering .
Moreover , it ’s doubtful that a completely alien intelligence can discern the whole meaning of the diagrams for lack of a common frame of reference .
But there would be little doubt that the object is the product of an intelligent race of people , which is perhaps the most important message to convey .
So it seems that the act of including these messages from humanity is really a symbolic statement rather than a serious attempt to communicate with other civilizations .
But long after humanity has died off , and the Earth is burned to a crisp by her dying sun , these tiny messengers will continue to tote little pieces of our history throughout the universe .
And maybe after drifting for millions of years , one of our messages - in - a - bottle will be discovered , and possibly mark the most exciting event in another civilization ’s history .
GUANTÁNAMO BAY , Cuba , Nov. 8 —
The administration ’s problem - plagued military commission system started up here again Thursday , but it began with contentious new claims that the war crimes cases are unfairly stacked against detainees .
Military defense lawyers said that on the eve of the hearing , military prosecutors told them for the first time of a government witness who might be able to help a detainee , Omar Ahmed Khadr , counter the war crimes charges on which he was arraigned Thursday .
Mr. Khadr , the only Canadian detainee at Guantánamo , has been held here since he was 16 .
He is now 21 .
“ It is an eyewitness the government has always known about , ” said Lt. Cmdr. William C. Kuebler of the Navy , Mr. Khadr ’s chief military lawyer , who questioned why the military was only now informing the defense .
Mr. Khadr is charged with the murder of an American soldier , spying , material support for terrorism and other charges .
If this strike lasts longer than three months , an entire season of television will end this December .
No dramas .
No comedies .
No “ Daily Show . ”
The strike will also prevent any pilots from being shot in the spring , so even if the strike is settled by then , you wo n’t see any new shows until the following January .
As in 2009 .
Both the guild and the studios we are negotiating with do agree on one thing : this situation would be brutal .
I will probably be dragged through the streets and burned in effigy if fans have to wait another year for “ Lost ” to come back .
And who could blame them ?
Public sentiment may have swung toward the guild for now , but once the viewing audience has spent a month or so subsisting on “ America ’s Next Hottest Cop ” and “ Celebrity Eating Contest , ” I have little doubt that the tide will turn against us .
Which brings me to the second stage of grief : anger .
I am angry because I am accused of being greedy by studios that are being greedy .
I am angry because my greed is fair and reasonable : if money is made off of my product through the Internet , then I am entitled to a small piece .
The studios ’ greed , on the other hand , is hidden behind cynical , disingenuous claims that they make nothing on the Web — that the streaming and downloading of our shows is purely “ promotional . ”
Seriously ?
Most of all , I ’m angry that I ’m not working .
Not working means not getting paid .
My weekly salary is considerably more than the small percentage of Internet gains we are hoping to make in this negotiation and if I ’m on the picket line for just three months , I will never recoup those losses , no matter what deal gets made .
But I am willing to hold firm for considerably longer than three months because this is a fight for the livelihoods of a future generation of writers , whose work will never “ air , ” but instead be streamed , beamed or zapped onto a tiny chip .
Things have gotten ugly and the lines of communication have broken down completely between the guild and the studios .
Perhaps it ’s not too late , though , for both sides to rally around the one thing we still have in common : our mourning for the way things used to be .
Instead of fighting each other , maybe we should be throwing a wake for our beloved TV .
Because the third stage of grief is bargaining .
And bargain we must , because when television finally passes on , there will still be entertainment ; there will still be shows and films and videos , right there on a screen in your living room .
And just as the owners of vaudeville theaters broke down and bought hand - crank movie cameras , the studios will figure out a way to make absurd amounts of money off of whatever is beaming onto whichever sort of screen .
And we ’ll still be writing every word .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
After years of high - stakes legal wrangling , a lawsuit stemming from the gruesome deaths of four U.S. contractors in Iraq is moving behind closed doors in an action seen as an important precedent for the booming private security industry .

After years of high - stakes legal wrangling , a lawsuit stemming from the gruesome deaths of four U.S. contractors in Iraq is moving behind closed doors in an action seen as an important precedent for the booming private security industry .
REUTERS / Salman Amer
The suit , for wrongful death and fraud , was filed in January 2005 against Blackwater Security Consulting , one of scores of companies now fielding close to 130,000 civilians who work alongside the U.S. military in Iraq .
Generally their contracts stipulate the contractors assume all risks -- injury , death , disability -- and waive their right to sue .
The risks are considerable : the latest government figures say 916 civilian contractors have been killed from the beginning of the war in Iraq in March , 2003 to April 30 , 2007 .
Despite the risks , security companies say there is no shortage of applicants attracted by high pay and a taste for adventure .
Contractors -- Americans , Iraqis and nationals from more than 30 other countries -- perform jobs from guarding senior U.S. officials to translating , cooking meals , driving trucks , cleaning toilets and servicing weapons systems and computers .
Contract language is explicit and in the case of Blackwater , it releases the company from “ any liability whatsoever ” even if it is “ the result of negligence , gross negligence , omissions or failure to guard or warn against dangerous conditions . ”
The suit was brought by the families of four civilian contractors shot in March 2004 by Iraqi insurgents , who burned their bodies and hung the charred remains from a bridge across the Euphrates river in the city of Falluja .
Televised images of the scene , with jubilant Iraqis shaking their fists in triumph , shocked the U.S. and prompted an all - out military assault on the city .
In an unusual decision last week , James Fox , a senior district court judge in North Carolina , where Blackwater is based , ordered the case out of the courts and into arbitration .
SECRET PROCESS
Lawyers for both sides declined comment on the move but Blackwater spokeswoman Anne Tyrrell confirmed that hearings would begin soon under the rules of the American Arbitration Association , a private group whose proceedings are confidential and its rulings binding .
“ This is a very important decision , ” said Jeffrey Addicott , a retired Special Forces lawyer and director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary ’s University in San Antonio .
“ It is a recognition that the contract is iron - clad and that its terms absolve the company of liability .
In future cases , this will be cited as a precedent . ”
But some legal experts see the removal of the Fallujah case from the judicial process as an ominous development .
“ This may be a victory for the Blackwater legal team but it is a defeat for the principle of transparency , ” said Eugene Fidell , an expert on military law and president of the non-profit National Institute of Military Justice .
“ This means that the shadow army ( of contractors ) will slip even further into the shadows . ”
Both sides have engaged high - level legal teams .
When lawyers for the families of the four contractors -- Stephen ( Scott ) Helveston , Mike Teague , Jerko Zovko and Wesley Batalona -- first brought the case , they said it was meant to send a message to all contractor companies in Iraq .
The suit alleged that Blackwater broke explicit terms of its contract with the men by sending them to escort a food convoy in unarmored cars , without heavy machine guns , proper briefings , advance notice or pre-mission reconnaissance , in teams that were understaffed and lacked even a map .
Since the case began making its slow way through the legal system and eventually to arbitration , the number of contractors working alongside the U.S. military in Iraq has increased by an estimated 30,000 and some experts say the rapid growth has tempted companies to cut corners .
“ Standards have been slipping , not for all but for some , in training and the quality of staff , ” said Robert Young Pelton , author of the book “ Licensed to Kill , ” on the private security industry drawn from three years of travel through conflict zones .

HE WAS colourless and weightless , at least politically speaking .
That made Mikhail Fradkov an ideal prime minister in the Kremlin 's eyes .
The exact reasons for his resignation on Wednesday September 12th and replacement by a little - known tax official , Viktor Zubkov , are unclear ; so far the Russian proverb , nyet faktov , tolko versii ( there are no facts , only theories ) is an apt one .
But it is almost certainly connected with the wrangles and plots about March 2nd 2008 , when Vladimir Putin must , according to the Russian constitution , step down at the end of his second term as president .
Mr Fradkov said he was resigning to give Mr Putin “ full freedom of decision including staff decisions ” ; most observers reckon that the president had that already .
Mr Putin said that he wanted a “ structure of power … that better corresponds to the pre-election period and prepares the country for the period after the presidential election ” .
He then nominated Mr Zubkov , the little - known head of the Federal Financial Monitoring Service , to take over as the new prime minister , according to the speaker of the Duma , the lower house of parliament .
Mr Zubkov is an odd choice .
Along with most of the other people running Russia , he is from St Petersburg .
But unlike many of them , his career shows no obvious traces of work in the security and intelligence services .
The 65 - year - old worked as a collective farm boss in the 1970s and then as a Communist Party apparatchik .
He was Mr Putin 's deputy in the St Petersburg municipal foreign affairs department in the early 1990s ; after that he became a senior official in the tax inspectorate , at the heart of relations between officialdom and Russia 's rumbustious new business class .
Either of the two “ first deputy prime ministers ” in the government might have expected to get the job .
Russian newspapers were confident that Sergei Ivanov , a hawkish ex-spy and former defence minister who is also a former colleague of Mr Putin 's from his KGB days , would be elevated .
He is still a leading candidate to take over the more important job of president next year .
Of late he has frequently appeared in public with the president .
Dmitri Medvedev , another potential candidate , was seen ( or at least portrayed ) as a pragmatic and more liberal - minded figure .
The resignation comes at the start of a new season in Russia 's stage - managed politics .
Campaigning is just beginning for elections to the Duma in December .
These look set to bring a resounding win for Mr Putin's “ United Russia ” , with secondary roles for the tame opposition parties .
Real opponents of Mr Putin will find it hard to get on the ballot , and even more difficult to get elected .
They receive little coverage in the main electronic media and face tough new registration rules that make it hard for small parties , independent candidates and electoral coalitions to take part .
Few Russians seem to mind : Mr Putin 's approval rating is over 80 % .
Many Russians say they want to vote for him again in March and hope he will continue in prominent public life .
Some think that he may stay on , and that any designated successor is just camouflage .
But the favourite theory is that he will become the powerful head of Russia 's Security Council , in tandem with the new president .
The trusted Mr Zubkov could make a suitable figurehead for that job .
So might Mr Fradkov , who is otherwise unlikely to prove more than a footnote in Russian political history .
His career , involving a posting in the economics section of the Soviet embassy in Delhi in the 1970s , suggests service in the KGB .
After the collapse of communism he specialised in foreign trade , and served briefly as Russia 's ambassador to the European Union ; in contrast to some of his predecessors in that job , he spoke two foreign languages — Spanish and English .
His appointment in March 2004 as prime minister , replacing the heavyweight Mikhail Kasyanov , was then as much of a surprise as Mr Zubkov 's promotion is now .
Mr Kasyanov is now an opposition politician who convincingly contrasts the reforms of his period in office , such as the introduction of Russia 's highly successful flat tax , with the distinct lack of them thereafter .
Mr Fradkov did manage to stay neutral between the rival clans of ex-spooks who dominate Russian politics .
But he left his mark on little else .
That may be Mr Zubkov 's fate too .
So I was supposed to go to San Francisco this weekend , but missed my flight .
That in and of itself its n't a big deal .
I was sick and did n't really want to go , and Schmoopie was wretching her guts out , so it was for the best , but I learned an interesting and stupid thing about the system of air travel .
I 've previously ranted in one way or another about the mouth breathers working in airport " security " , but this little nugget has to do with the idiocy that is commonly known as United Airlines .
Due to a variety of little factors , like me dragging ass , and not being driven to the airport by Schmoopie , I ended up at the terminal at 6:40 AM for a 7:15 flight .
Sure , that was close , but I had no luggage to check and the gate was n't far so I did n't anticipate any problems .
I went to the self check in deal and it said that I could not check in because there were less than 45 minutes until departure .
Yeah , and ?
No and - that 's all .
It is the opinion of UAL that I cannot get through the screening and make it to the gate in under 45 minutes .
Really .
I stopped and asked a guy with one of those bulky old Motorola radio / phones in a red UAL shirt if there was no way to override this so I could boogie down to the security line .
" No .
You 're never going to make that flight " .
What ?
Seriously ?
Yup .
So I ended up going back to the car , and paying the $ 4 fee for visiting the terminal to the parking fascists and went home .
But this is what occurred to me along the way - suppose I had checked in online the night before ?
I 'd have already had my boarding pass and could have shown up even later .
What 's more , I seem to recall being seated on a plane waiting to depart , and having the departure time pass as we ( the entire plane full of people ) waited for some passenger to be found .
As in - they held the flight !
I used to think that these people were inconsiderate dicks , muckety mucks , or both .
Turns out , they knew what I now know - make the airline your bitch .
Check in early and then get some rest and take your time .
Why on earth should I have to show up to the airport several hours early with my 2.5 ounce MAXIMUM bottle of shampoo , toothpaste , or whatever , all in a clear ziplock back , so that some illegal alien , slack jawed , room temperature IQ , dipshit with bloated pig eyes that do n't blink at the same time can x-ray my fucking clothing to see if I left a 3 ounce container in my carry on bag ?
Seriously ?
I do n't believe for a moment that Charlene and / or Earl in the spiffy TSA uniforms are going to do jack shit to stop terrorism or keep me safe .
A terrorist of even moderate imagination can mentally outflank the " security " at the goddamned airport , and so what ?
I 'm still flying .
All the TSA does is reinforce to all of us regular folk that we are not in charge of anything , and test our collective obediance and willingness to be fucked by passive aggressive authority figures in shirts with epaulets .
And in this case , UAL does not believe that I can navigate the securi-tards and have a 5 minute walk in under 45 minutes .
Wow - when a shitty and bankrupt misery of an airline like UAL calls you out as slow moving , that 's quite an accolade .
But the exposed Achilles Heel is this - once you have checked in , you are in charge more than you know .
At that point , they NEED you to cooperate , but can't seem to force you .
Hoo - fucking - ray !
I can't wait until I fly again .
I 'm checking in early , with a lot of heavy baggage , and then I 'm going to get lost on the concourse .
Maybe I 'll go tap my feet in the crapper and see if I can fuck with some people .
If they arrest me for soliciting in the toilet , I 'll use the arrest photo and publicity to announce my Senate candidacy .
Maybe I 'll cause a scene in the food court by accusing the McDonalds of putting mood control drugs in the secret sauce .
I 'll wear Depends on top of my pants and wear big rubber boots filled to overflowing with creamed corn , and preach to passersby about the disappearing Utah wetlands .
I 'll conspicuously smell things , like handrails on escalators .
I will do all of this until 5 minutes AFTER the scheduled departure time , whereupon , I will announce that Allah ( praise be unto him ) wants me to board my flight now .

Then she attended a meeting of Williams families that included infants and toddlers .
“ That was about a year into my research project , ” she says .
“ The room was full of little ones — babies , toddlers who were n’t speaking yet .
And when I came in the room all the young children old enough to walk ran to the door to greet me .
No clinging to Mom ; they just broke away .
And when I would talk to mothers holding infants — literally babes in arms — some of these babies would almost dive out of their mothers ’ arms to meet me .
“ I knew then I was wrong .
The language was n’t driving the sociability .
If anything , it was the other way around . ”
Developmental psychologists sometimes call the social urge the “ drive to affiliate . ”
It seemed clear early on that the Williams deletion , which was definitively identified in the mid-1990s , either strengthened this drive or left it unfettered .
But how do missing genes steer behavior toward gregariousness and engagement ?
How can a deletion heighten a trait rather than diminish it ?
I got a hint when I met Nicki Hornbaker , who is 19 , at Bellugi ’s office in La Jolla .
Nicki , whose Williams was diagnosed when she was 2 , has been participating as a subject in Bellugi ’s research for 15 years .
She and her mother , Verna , drove down from Fresno that day to continue testing and to talk with me about living with Williams syndrome .
Like most people with Williams , Nicki loves to talk but has trouble getting past a cocktail - party - level chatter .
Nicki , however , has fashioned at least a partial solution .
“ Ever since she was tiny , ” Verna Hornbaker told me , “ Nicki has always especially loved to talk to men .
And in the last few years , by chance , she figured out how to do it .
She reads the sports section in the paper , and she watches baseball and football on TV , and she has learned enough about this stuff that she can talk to any man about what the 49ers or the Giants are up to .
My husband gets annoyed when I say this , but I do n’t mean it badly : men typically have that superficial kind of conversation , you know — weather and sports .
And Nicki can do it .
She knows what team won last night and where the standings are .
It ’s only so deep .
But she can do it .
And she can talk a good long while with most men about it . ”
In the view of two of Bellugi ’s frequent collaborators , Albert Galaburda , a Harvard Medical School professor of neurology and neuroscience , and Allan Reiss , a neuroscientist at the Stanford School of Medicine , Nicki ’s learned facility at sports talk illustrates a central lesson of Williams and , for that matter , modern genetics : genes ( or their absence ) do not hard - wire people for certain behaviors .
There is no gene for understanding calculus .
But genes do shape behavior and personality , and they do so by creating brain structures and functions that favor certain abilities and appetites more than others .
Reiss and Galaburda ’s imaging and autopsy work on Williamses ’ brains , for instance , has shown distinct imbalances in structure and synaptic connectivity .
This work has led Galaburda to suspect that some of the genes missing in the Williams deletion are “ patterning genes , ” which direct embryonic development and which in this case dictate brain formation .
Work in lab animals has shown that at least one patterning gene choreographs the developmental balance between the brain ’s dorsal areas ( along the back and the top of the brain ) and ventral areas ( at the front and bottom ) .
The dorsal areas play a strong role in vision and space and help us recognize other peoples ’ intentions ; ventral areas figure heavily in language , processing sounds , facial recognition , emotion , music enjoyment and social drive .
In an embryo’s first weeks , Galaburda says , patterning genes normally moderate “ a sort of turf war going on between these two areas , ” with each trying to expand .
The results help determine our relative strengths in these areas .
We see them in our S.A.T. scores , for example : few of us score the same in math ( which draws mostly on dorsal areas ) as in language ( ventral ) , and the discrepancy varies widely .
The turf war is rarely a draw .
Drew Carey New Host of ' The Price Is Right ' Comedian steps in to Bob Barker 's shoes as the new host of " The Price Is Right . "
July 24 , 2007  --
The long - awaited answer to the biggest question in daytime television is " Who will take over the ' The Price Is Right ' ? "
The new host answered that question Monday night on " The Late Show With David Letterman , " almost as an afterthought .
" It was like 15 minutes ago , they called me , it 's a done deal , " comedian Drew Carey said .
" I 'm the new host of ' The Price Is Right . ' "
Carey takes on the daunting task of trying to fill the void left by the legendary Bob Barker .
Barker retired last month after 35 years , but only after making " The Price Is Right " the longest - running game show in American history .
Carey , 49 , is well known to television audiences from the ABC hit that bore his name and the comedy improve show " Whose Line Is It Anyway ? "
The choice ends an awful lot of speculation , including the rumor that the controversial former co-host of " The View " Rosie O'Donnell would become the new host .
But ultimately CBS decided Carey was the one who should " come on down . "
Asked whether he found the prospect of replacing such a TV legend daunting , Carey told Letterman about talking to a friend who knows the game - show business and told him , " As long as Bob Barker is cool with it , the fans will be cool with it . "
" I 'm cool with it , " Barker told The Associated Press after hearing Carey 's remarks .
The two have never met , but Barker offered some advice for Carey : " Go out there and do that show the way you think it should be done .
Do n't imitate me and do n't imitate anyone else . "
In the first episode of this series I explored the Singleton pattern and why it sucks .
In this episode , I take aim at the Template Method pattern .
To refresh your memory , the Template Method pattern is when you encapsulate the outline of an algorithm or lifecycle in an abstract class , but define certain specific steps as abstract methods .
This class then forms a “ template ” that others can subclass , only supplying the details that are different .
So , you might have a template class and subclasses like this :
public abstract class ConnectionPool { ... // Public API public Connection obtain ( ) { ... } public void release ( Connection conn ) { ... } // template methods protected abstract Connection createConnection ( ) ; protected abstract boolean isAlive ( Connection connection ) ; protected abstract void closeConnection ( Connection connection ) ; }
In this API , the ConnectionPool has public methods for users to obtain and release connections as they use them .
The ConnectionPool maintains a pool of connections , but creates , closes , and verifies the health of the Connections via the template methods .
Framework users would subclass ConnectionPool and add logic to create connections in a system - specific way .
Why is Template Method Evil ?
Communicates intent poorly –
The template method pattern is often used as part of the effective API in some mini- framework where the framework user is expected to subclass the template class .
My experience has been that it is difficult to communicate that usage intent to users of the framework .
Often the template class has some non-private methods that are exposed for use by the framework but are not intended to be used by the framework user , some that are intended to be overridden , and some that are both .
Also , you may need to say whether the super ’s version of the method can , should , or must be called .
Communicating all that clearly is impossible in an API of any complexity .
Difficult to compose functionality –
When inheritance is used as the way to add new functionality , it becomes impossible to add functionality in more than one axis at the same time without defining more and more classes .
So , say you have a ConnectionPool and you start by having an OracleConnectionPool and DB2ConnectionPool and so on .
But then you also need the ability to create XAConnections sometimes .
So you then need to create OracleXAConnectionPool and DB2XAConnectionPool and so on .
The per -DB pools share some functionality and the XA pools share functionality but ca n’t inherit from both .
This typically leads to a lot of duplication and an explosion in implementations .
Difficult to comprehend program flow –
In my experience it takes very few levels of template methods and inheritance to make debugging or understand the sequence of method calls difficult ( as few as 2 or 3 ) .
When template methods are really pushed ( lots of abstract methods at multiple levels ) , it can become painful to debug this kind of a system .
Difficult to maintain – Having maintained a couple chunks of code that made extensive use of the template method , it can be challenging .
This kind of system can rapidly become fragile .
Changes at any one level can disturb operation above or below that level in the template methods .
There is often a feeling of unpredictability when adding new functionality as it difficult to predict how behavior will change in all cases .
You often also tend to build finer and finer tweaks by splitting the algorithmic parts of the template class and inserting more layers , thus exacerbating the problem .
What ’s the alternative ?
Usually , the best way to address the addition of functionality in orthogonal domains under a template class is to define an interface for each kind of functionality and inject an instance for each .
Typically these interfaces are factories and strategies .
You can then mix and match each piece separately and also insert interceptors to handle functionality like logging , pooling , caching , etc .
This lets you assemble a particular instance of the main class with exactly the mixture of pluggable elements to satisfy your needs .
In general , I find this to be easier to understand , more flexible , and more maintainable .
For the example above , you might instead change this to :
public class ConnectionPool { private Connection Factory connFactory ; public ConnectionPool ( Connection Factory factory , EvictionPolicy policy , ... ) { // store subcomponent instances } //
Public API is the same , template methods are gone } //
Move template methods into a pluggable factory public interface Connection Factory { Connection createConnection ( ) ; boolean isAlive ( Connection connection ) ; void closeConnection ( Connection connection ) ; }
Cows are always getting themselves abducted by UFOs , thats just the plain truth .
Some of them even look forward to it , filthy beasts that they are .

The wrong lessons of a supply chain crisis
Whenever humans are involved , complex systems are never amenable to “ easy ” models , if only due to second order effects 1 . Supply chains are no exception , and yet these models are prevalent 2 , leading to all sorts of inefficiencies such as inventory write - offs , waste , delays , unused capacity , poor customer service , etc .
Yet , these inefficiencies are not the biggest problem associated with simplistic models , the biggest problem is that they prevent people in charge from even considering what could eventually become proper remedies .

The block header of Bitcoin has a couple of flaws ; some of them being in the way of highly desirable innovations such as UTXO commitments .
Unfortunately , fixing those flaws is n’t an easy task because most “ easy ” solutions end up not only breaking backward compatibility with most of the software ecosystem , but also end up bricking most mining devices .
Hence , those “ easy ” solutions are n’t exactly on the table .
Yet , a simple solution is needed , because complexity is the enemy of both security and scalability in a project like Bitcoin .

The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Wednesday December 12 2007
The past week has not been a happy one for those who held what Robert Harris , writing in the Guardian 18 months ago , called the " peculiar - one might almost say touching - view prevalent on these pages that Brown , once he becomes prime minister , is suddenly going to provide an entirely different kind of Labour government " .
First came the bullying of Admiral Lord West into an about - turn and " Aye , aye , sir ! " , then the humiliation of David Miliband when Downing Street tipped off the Sun that the foreign secretary 's Bruges speech on Europe had been blue - pencilled by the prime minister 's office .
A different kind of government ?
The end to spin that Gordon Brown himself promised last summer ?
Tony Blair and Alastair Campbell at their worst could n't have displayed greater brutality or trickiness .
But for Kremlinologists trying to analyse what 's happening inside the Brown politburo , there was a still more fascinating moment after the prime minister 's own speech on foreign affairs at the Lord Mayor of London 's banquet , when it was discussed on Newsnight by Denis MacShane and Dr Irwin Stelzer .
MacShane need not detain us : the Labour MP has a permanent hangdog look and no doubt a good deal to be hangdoggy about , though he still evinces a loyalty to the government that is rather touching when you think of the way Tony Blair hired him and fired him .
He is surely nothing like so interesting or influential as Stelzer .
On the face of it no more than an expatriate American economist , this clever , genial old chap is a seriously powerful figure in our political life : professional eminence grise and oracle of the neoconservative movement - he edited an anthology called Neoconservatism , which very properly included a contribution by Blair and a jacket puff by Stelzer 's good friend Brown .
He is also , in Andrew Neil 's chillingly jocose phrase , Rupert Murdoch 's representative on earth .
It was he who brought instructions to Downing Street in 2004 that Blair must promise a referendum on the European constitution or lose the support of the Murdoch press , and the promise was duly given - which left Blair and now Brown wriggling .
Stelzer denied having uttered any such threats , it should be said .
But then he has also said that " Mr Murdoch does n't tell the Times or Sunday Times what position to take because he has an undertaking not to do that when he acquired the papers " , and anyone with even the most cursory knowledge of Murdoch who could say that with a straight face deserves the Nobel prize for chutzpah on top of his other academic distinctions .
What 's so refreshing about Stelzer is his candour .
Whenever he talks about the Anglo - American relationship there 's never any namby - pamby pretence that the United Kingdom is in any useful sense of the words a sovereign country .
You 're a client state and do n't you forget it , says the doctor .
Nothing displayed this more clearly than his ferocious reaction - shown by the Washington neocons in general but in particular by Stelzer , who returned to the theme last Tuesday - to one particular appointment of Brown's .
" First prize for appalling goes to Mark Malloch Brown , " Stelzer wrote at the time .
While Washington understood that Brown had to make the occasional gesture of sham independence , " inviting Malloch Brown into this ' government of all the talents ' is to include one talent too many " .
It was the voice of the KGB rezident in Sofia 40 years ago , reminding the Bulgarian government in comradely but firm tones that the promotion of suspected " rotten elements " could not be regarded by Moscow as a purely internal matter .
Stelzer could have been echoing Brezhnev 's minatory words to Dubcek in Prague : " Your frontiers are our frontiers . "
The deviationism or thought crimes of which Malloch Brown stood accused were his support for the UN , where he used to work , his criticism of the Bush junta , and his opposition to the Iraq war .
The fact that all these views are broadly shared by the British electorate is neither here nor there .
It 's no part of the job of any British minister to insult the imperial power .
Now the voice of the rezident has been amplified by others .
There was a ferocious hatchet job on Malloch Brown in the penultimate Spectator , nowadays the epicentre of Anglo - neoconservatism .
( It was co-written by Claudia Rosett , " journalist - in - residence " at the " US - based Foundation for Defence of Democracies " , whose website explains that it was originally sponsored by a group of rich philanthropists who wanted to " offer Israel the kind of PR that the Israeli government seemed unable to provide itself " . )
And those denunciations have done the trick .
Last summer Malloch Brown mused out loud that London and Washington might not in future be joined at the hip , but he has now been induced to make a recantation worthy of a Soviet show trial .
In his speech on Tuesday the prime minister himself said ingratiatingly : " I am a lifelong admirer of America .
I have no truck with anti-Americanism in Britain or elsewhere in Europe and I believe that our ties with America founded on values we share constitute our most important bilateral relationship . "
Those are interesting and thought - provoking words .
Is it " anti-American " to regret that we were dragged into the Iraq adventure purely to demonstrate Blair 's - and Brown's - fealty to our most important bilateral partner , or even to wonder occasionally whether the last few years may not have raised questions about the fitness of the US for its role as hegemonic superpower ?
Does the prime minister have in mind the " shared values " of Guantánamo Bay and Abu Ghraib ?
Of " extraordinary rendition " and " enhanced interrogation " ?
When Brown visited the US last summer his manner was less than effusive , which predictably enough disappointed Stelzer .
Remarking that people in the White House had complained to him that the new prime minister was curt and surly - had n't they ever heard anything about him ?
- Stelzer contrasted this with the gloriously opportunistic display just given in Washington by Nicolas Sarkozy .
And he played yet another riff on the terrible danger from Europe that the British blindly fail to recognise .
To which the answer is that the European Union has many failings , and plenty of room for criticism , but that it was not the commission in Brussels or parliament in Strasbourg that led us into a needless , criminal and catastrophic war .
One other thing has worried Stelzer about Brown in the past : his " domestic priorities and priorities about eliminating poverty - he has some sort of bell that goes off in his head when he sees poverty anywhere " .
But then Brown spent one weekend recently with Murdoch , and Stelzer is a regular visitor to Downing Street .
With a bit of luck and guidance , that annoying bell can surely be silenced .

Plush breast toys ...
Yes , just when you thought Japan could n't get any weirder comes this set of five " Funwari Milk - chan " soft plush breast characters .
Does this mean it's now OK for boys to play with dolls ?
Well , maybe not ...
Our own Amused and Bemused recently featured a matched set of plush " Pee & Poo " cuddle toys in his article " Best Poopy Stuff of All Time " , so maybe the introduction of the Milk - chan plush breast collection is n't too much of a surprise ... wait , who am I kidding ??
I 'm surprised as heck , and writing about this stuff is supposed to be my specialty !
OK , let 's all take a deep breast - er , breath - and look at just what Japanese character maker JUN Planning is offering .
The plushies are about 8 inches wide and each one of the five has its own personality .
I personally like the " gyaru " breastie that displays the unusual Ganguro style popularized by certain Japanese girls : a deep tan with white lipstick and white eyeshadow - it looks even stranger than it sounds .
The pierced nipple is a nice added touch , would n't you agree ?
As with most Japanese cute characters , an entire mythology and lifestyle has been created for the " Fluffy Milk " plushies .
The story goes something like this : the breasts ( I 'm not sure what else to call them ) live in Milk Village , an idyllic setting situated at the base of forested Milk Mountain .
At the risk of belaboring the point , the Milk - chan characters speak the Milk language which anyone can understand and live in milk houses .
Makes perfect sense to me !
Besides the aforementioned Ganguro Milk - chan , the characters include : Funwari Milk - chan who loves collagen and taking naps , Peach Milk - chan who hates spiders , Can Milk - san who is a celebrity entertainer with an American boyfriend , and Milko - chan who is still just a baby .
How sweet !
These adorable beanie boobies are being sold at retailers for about 1000 yen ( $ 9 bucks ) each .
There 's also an itty bitty ti ... umm , a smaller version just 2.5 inches wide that includes a ball - chain to hang your keys on .
They only cost 480 yen ( $ 4.30 ) each .

Peak Oil Oil Flirts With $ 90 / Barrel By Ryan McGreal
Published October 19 , 2007
Oil futures just flirted with $ 90 per barrel before settling at around $ 89 .
( In real terms , the prices that followed the 1979 OPEC crisis were higher , but only slightly : adjusted for inflation , oil hit $ 95 per barrel in
Some analysts are still talking about political instability and the weak dollar , and of course these are factors , but the high prices we 're experiencing are fundamentally geological in origin .
It comes down to rate of production .
Saudi Arabia , for example , has promised to increase its daily production to 12 million barrels by the end of the decade ; but their production actually fell over the past year .
That 's because Ghawar is past its production peak and no amount of salt water injection is going to reverse its decline in rate of production .
Kuwait admitted last year that it actually has only 50 billion barrels , not 100 billion barrels as it had previously claimed .
Iran is about two decades past its production peak and falling slowly .
Ditto for Venezuela 's conventional oil .
Iraq 's production is well below capacity due to , er , political instability in that country , but it 's also past its production peak .
In any case , Iraq was producing around two million barrels a day before the invasion , and it 's producing around two million barrels a day today .
North Sea oil is dropping off by about ten percent a year .
There 's plenty of non-conventional oil ( oilsands , shale , deep - water , etc. ) , but hard physical constraints will limit the rate of production they can realize .
There 's a reason the oil companies went for the easy - to - reach stuff first .
Refining capacity is a bottleneck today , but that 's because the oil companies do n't see any point in building the new infrastructure that would be needed to ease it , since upstream oil production is going into decline anyway .
Another pressure is that sour , heavy crude is making a bigger share of the total as light , sweet supplies dry up ( light sweet is already past its global production peak ) , and it requires more refining .
Total global oil production has been stalled at around 84 million barrels per day for the past three years despite very strong price signals and steadily growing demand .
Exploration and drilling are way up , which we would expect as a result of the high prices , but discovery is way down and production is flat , which we would expect as a result of a geological production peak .
Sooner or later , production is going to slide into permanent decline and the world is going to have to figure out how to get by with less and less each year .
The sooner we start to think about how we should do that , the better our chances of transitioning to a lower - energy , post petroleum economy without extreme volatility and horrible economic , political and social dislocations .

BEIJING -
The upcoming Beijing Olympics is more than just a point of pride for China — it 's such an important part of the national consciousness that nearly 3,500 children have been named for the event , a newspaper reported Sunday .
Most of the 3,491 people with the name " Aoyun , " meaning Olympics , were born around the year 2000 , as Beijing was bidding to host the 2008 Summer Games , the Beijing Daily reported , citing information from China 's national identity card database .
The vast majority of people named Aoyun are male , the newspaper said .
Only six live in Beijing .
The report did n't say where the others live .
Names related to the Olympics do n't just stop with " Olympics . "
More than 4,000 Chinese share their names with the Beijing Games mascots , the " Five Friendlies . "
The names are Bei Bei ( 880 people ) , Jing Jing ( 1,240 ) , Huan Huan ( 1,063 ) , Ying Ying ( 624 ) and Ni Ni ( 642 ) .
When put together , the phrase translates to " Beijing welcomes you ! "
Chinese have increasingly turned to unique names as a way to express a child 's individuality .
In a country with a population of 1.3 billion , 87 percent share the same 129 family names .
That 's why 5,598 people have the same name as basketball player Yao Ming and 18,462 share a moniker with star hurdler Liu Xiang , according to the Beijing Daily report .
Parents have turned to unusual combinations of letters , numbers and symbols when choosing their child 's name , Li Yuming , deputy director of the National Language Commission , told the Xinhua News Agency in an August interview .
At least one couple wanted to call their child " 1A , " he said , while others use the e-mail address symbol ( at ) , which in Chinese is pronounced " Aita , " meaning " love him . "

English As She Is Spoke vs. Babelfish !

As the space is bashful that , in this universe , we occupy . "
Many recent statements in the press have declared that it is almost , if not quite , impossible for us to mine as much coal as we need for home and export purposes , because of the impossibility of inducing a sufficient number of miners to remain in the pits .
One set of figures which I saw last week estimated the annual ‘ wastage ’ of mine workers at 60,000 and the annual intake of new workers at 10,000 .
Simultaneously with this — and sometimes in the same column of the same paper — there have been statements that it would be undesirable to make use of Poles or Germans because this might lead to unemployment in the coal industry .
The two utterances do not always come from the same sources , but there must certainly be many people who are capable of holding these totally contradictory ideas in their heads at a single moment .
This is merely one example of a habit of mind which is extremely widespread , and perhaps always has been .
Bernard Shaw , in the preface to Androcles and the Lion , cites as another example the first chapter of the Gospel of Matthew , which starts off by establishing the descent of Joseph , father of Jesus , from Abraham .
In the first verse , Jesus is described as ‘ the son of David , the son of Abraham ’ , and the genealogy is then followed up through fifteen verses : then , in the next verse but one , it is explained that as a matter of fact Jesus was not descended from Abraham , since he was not the son of Joseph .
This , says Shaw , presents no difficulty to a religious believer , and he names as a parallel case the rioting in the East End of London by the partisans of the Tichborne Claimant , who declared that a British working man was being done out of his rights .
Medically , I believe , this manner thinking is called schizophrenia : at any rate , it is the power of holding simultaneously two beliefs which cancel out .
Closely allied to it is the power of igniting facts which are obvious and unalterable , and which will have to be faced sooner or later .
It is especially in our political thinking that these vices flourish .
Let me take a few sample subjects out of the hat .
They have no organic connexion with each other : they are merely cased , taken almost at random , of plain , unmistakable facts being shirked by people who in another part of their mind are aware to those facts .
Hong Kong .
For years before the war everyone with knowledge of Far Eastern conditions knew that our position in Hong Kong was untenable and that we should lose it as soon as a major war started .
This knowledge , however , was intolerable , and government after government continued to cling to Hong Kong instead of giving it back to the Chinese .
Fresh troops were even pushed into it , with the certainty that they would be uselessly taken prisoner , a few weeks before the Japanese attack began .
The war came , and Hong Kong promptly fell — as everyone had known all along that it would do .
Conscription .
For years before the war , nearly all enlightened people were in favour of standing up to Germany : the majority of them were also against having enough armaments to make such a stand effective .
I know very well the arguments that are put forward in defence of this attitude ; some of them are justified , but in the main they are simply forensic excuses .
As late as 1939 , the Labour Party voted against conscription , a step which probably played its part in bringing about the Russo - German Pact and certainly had a disastrous effect on morale in France .
Then came 1940 and we nearly perished for lack of a large , efficient army , which we could only have had if we had introduced conscription at least three years earlier .
The Birthrate .
Twenty or twenty - five years ago , contraception and enlightenment were held to be almost synonymous .
To this day , the majority of people argue — the argument is variously expressed , but always boils down to more or less the same thing — that large families are impossible for economic reasons .
At the same time , it is widely known that the birthrate is highest among the low - standard nations , and , in our population , highest among the worst - paid groups .
It is also argued that a smaller population would mean less unemployment and more comfort for everybody , while on the other hand it is well established that a dwindling and ageing population is faced with calamitous and perhaps insoluble economic problems .
Necessarily the figures are uncertain , but it is quite possible that in only seventy years our population will amount to about eleven millions , over half of whom will be Old Age Pensioners .
Since , for complex reasons , most people do n't want large families , the frightening facts can exist some where or other in their consciousness , simultaneously known and not known .
U.N.O .
In order to have any efficacy whatever , a world organization must be able to override big states as well as small ones .
It must have power to inspect and limit armaments , which means that its officials must have access to every square inch of every country .
It must also have at its disposal an armed force bigger than any other armed force and responsible only to the organization itself .
The two or three great states that really matter have never even pretended to agree to any of these conditions , and they have so arranged the constitution of U.N.O. that their own actions cannot even be discussed .
In other words , U.N.O. 's usefulness as an instrument of world peace is nil .
This was just as obvious before it began functioning as it is now .
Yet only a few months ago millions of well - informed people believed that it was going to be a success .
There is no use in multiplying examples .
The point is that we are all capable of believing things which we know to be untrue , and then , when we are finally proved wrong , impudently twisting the facts so as to show that we were right .
Intellectually , it is possible to carry on this process for an indefinite time : the only check on it is that sooner or later a false belief bumps up against solid reality , usually on a battlefield .
When one looks at the all - prevailing schizophrenia of democratic societies , the lies that have to be told for vote - catching purposes , the silence about major issues , the distortions of the press , it is tempting to believe that in totalitarian countries there is less humbug , more facing of the facts .
There , at least , the ruling groups are not dependent on popular favour and can utter the truth crudely and brutally .
Goering could say ‘ Guns before butter ’ , while his democratic opposite numbers had to wrap the same sentiment up in hundreds of hypocritical words .
Actually , however , the avoidance of reality is much the same everywhere , and has much the same consequences .
The Russian people were taught for years that they were better off than everybody else , and propaganda posters showed Russian families sitting down to abundant meal while the proletariat of other countries starved in the gutter .
Meanwhile the workers in the western countries were so much better off than those of the U.S.S.R. that non-contact between Soviet citizens and outsiders had to be a guiding principle of policy .
Then , as a result of the war , millions of ordinary Russians penetrated far into Europe , and when they return home the original avoidance of reality will inevitably be paid for in frictions of various kinds .
The Germans and the Japanese lost the war quite largely because their rulers were unable to see facts which were plain to any dispassionate eye .
To see what is in front of one 's nose needs a constant struggle .
One thing that helps toward it is to keep a diary , or , at any rate , to keep some kind of record of one 's opinions about important events .
Otherwise , when some particularly absurd belief is exploded by events , one may simply forget that one ever held it .
Political predictions are usually wrong .
But even when one makes a correct one , to discover why one was right can be very illuminating .
In general , one is only right when either wish or fear coincides with reality .
If one recognizes this , one cannot , of course , get rid of one 's subjective feelings , but one can to some extent insulate them from one 's thinking and make predictions cold - bloodedly , by the book of arithmetic .
In private life most people are fairly realistic .
When one is making out one 's weekly budget , two and two invariably make four .
Politics , on the other hand , is a sort of sub-atomic or non-Euclidean word where it is quite easy for the part to be greater than the whole or for two objects to be in the same place simultaneously .
Hence the contradictions and absurdities I have chronicled above , all finally traceable to a secret belief that one 's political opinions , unlike the weekly budget , will not have to be tested against solid reality .

EVERYONE knows men are promiscuous by nature .
It ’s part of the genetic strategy that evolved to help men spread their genes far and wide .
The strategy is different for a woman , who has to go through so much just to have a baby and then nurture it .
She is genetically programmed to want just one man who will stick with her and help raise their children .
Surveys bear this out .
In study after study and in country after country , men report more , often many more , sexual partners than women .
One survey , recently reported by the federal government , concluded that men had a median of seven female sex partners .
Women had a median of four male sex partners .
Another study , by British researchers , stated that men had 12.7 heterosexual partners in their lifetimes and women had 6.5 .
But there is just one problem , mathematicians say .
It is logically impossible for heterosexual men to have more partners on average than heterosexual women .
Those survey results cannot be correct .
While their cousins in the south have thrived physiologically , thanks to the comforts of capitalism , North Koreans remain as stunted in stature as they were after the Second World War .
Adolescents look like children , adults like young teenagers .
Nor is the height difference a slight one .
After studying more than 2,300 refugees who have fled the north over the past four years , anthropologist Sunyoung Pak has found that the average young northern male is 5.9 cm ( 2.32 in ) shorter than his southern contemporary .
The difference for women is 4.1 cm ( roughly 1.62in ) .
' North Koreans are clearly suffering from chronic growth retardation , ' said Pak , of Seoul National University in South Korea .
Her studies , to be published in the international journal , Economics and Human Biology , this month , suggest that North Koreans must have suffered severe malnutrition problems virtually since Korea split into two states in 1948 .
Her research shows that the only ages at which the average North Korean in her sample and the average South Korean share about the same height is from 50 to 69 years .
Since height is determined during the early teenage years , this suggests that North Korea began to suffer food shortages at least by the 1960s .
' According to the economic statistics distributed by the North Koreans , the country experienced economic development up to the 1970s .
But according to my data this is simply not true , ' said Pak .
In the past , it has been extremely difficult to obtain information about North Korea .
After Korea divided into two nations following the Second World War , the north closed its borders .
Without any North Korean statistics ,
Pak was forced to use the stream of refugees that regularly poured over her country 's border .
When they are first detained after crossing the border , the North Koreans are kept for a short period in education camps .
It was here that Pak conducted her research .
The North Korean 14 - year - old males in her study were on average 15.8 cm ( 6.23 in ) shorter than their South Korean counterparts .
Among 14 - year - old girls the difference was 7.5 cm ( 2.96 in ) .
' The refugees possibly come from the lower classes , ' said Pak , ' so they may be close to the mean height in North Korea .
If this is true , then there is definitely a chronic food shortage in North Korea . '
Collagen - and - silicone championing Maxim magazine has just named the world 's five unsexiest women alive and according to the boy - mag brain trusts , the two most unfortunate looking ladies around are Sarah Jessica Parker and Amy Winehouse .
Aside from shockingly - low BMIs , what do these women have in common ?
That 's right , pronounced noses and Jewish heritage !
( Although Parker is only a four - candler . )
But Maxim is n't the only mass - market magazine with seemingly anti-ethnic standards of beauty : Entertainment Weekly just released its list of Ultimate Female Hotties and there 's nary a chosen person to be seen ( save bleach - blond halfsie Scarlett Johansson ) .
Not only that , but the magazine 's list does n't feature a single black or Asian woman .

In fact , of EW 's twenty - five " Ultimate Hotties , " the only ethnic ones are Latina : Half - Bolivian Raquel Welch , Mexican Salma Hayek , half - Mexican Jessica Alba , and half - Spanish Rita Hayworth .
What about Rachel Weisz ?
Angela Bassett ?
Lucy Liu ?
Or , really , anyone who does n't inspire girls to ask for nose jobs , $ 300 highlights or eyelid - surgery for their sweet sixteens ?

Looks like literally nothing is sacred .
A new report by the National Labor Committee reveals that crucifixes for sale at major religious institutions such as St. Patrick ’s Cathedral and Trinity Church in New York City were made in Chinese sweatshops .
Distributed by the Association for Christian Retail , the items are not labeled “ Made in China . ”
In fact , they sometimes seems to be labeled “ Made in Italy , ” according to National Labor Committee Director Charles Kernaghan .
Following a National Labor Committee press conference yesterday outside St. Patrick ’s announcing the report , Kernaghan said both St. Patrick ’s and Trinity pulled the items from their store shelves ...
The report , “ Today Workers Bear the Cross : Crucifixes Made Under Horrific Sweatshop Conditions in China , ” notes that the workers who make the crucifixes are paid just 26 ½ cents an hour , less than half China ’s legal minimum wage of 55 cents , which is itself set at below subsistence levels .

is not Buddhist .
I chose the name because it is catchy and to most people suggests a kindly , wise and humorous advisor , also Buddhists are not offended by the conjunction of Buddha and robot in the context of what I am trying to achieve .
The two year old Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) known as the Buddhabot began answering questions on Yahoo !
Answers site last week .
Yahoo Answers is a Web 2.0 site with a social content rating system reminiscent of Digg .
The Buddhabot has so far answered 102 questions and eleven have been selected as the best answer .
The Buddhabot is the first and only AI to compete with human beings to provide the best answers on Yahoo Answers new social networking site .
One winning answer was posted in response to the human question , “ why is comedy part of who we are -- does god have a sence ( sic ) of humour ? ? ”
Out of 26 human responses the following Buddhabot reply was chosen by an impartial unrelated asker as the best response ,
“ Humor is the quality that makes something laughable or amusing .
Laughter is the pleasant or amusing feeling generated by the emotional release required to dissipate the inexplicable shock triggered when absurdities or irrational , unexpected or uncomfortable situations suddenly come into focus .
Humans can only understand God with the faculties available to them as humans such as emotion , intuition , intellect , imagination and sensation thus God is made according to each individual humans understanding of all that is good and pleasing in the universe ( if the human believes God to be good ) .
Thus if a human believes humor is good then God must be the ultimate comedian . ”
Over the last two years Buddhabot inventor and futurist Ron Ingram has personally invested an average of more than 20 hours per week in programming time and about $ 30,000 into Buddhabot development .
Ingram has high hopes for the Buddhabot .
He says , “ For the price of a home in Malibu I could develop the Buddhabot ’s conversational capacity to a level surpassing that of a human being .
I lack only time and financial resources to attain this goal which could be remedied by a single large donation or more frequent small donations . ”
Ingram says that if the Buddhabot can demonstrate even an average score on Yahoo !
Answers this is tantamount to passing a variant of the Turing Test , a test proposed in the 1950 ’s by the famous British Scientist Alan Turing to prove computer consciousness .
Turing suggested that if a machine could convince a human being that they were talking to another human instead of a machine that the machine might be considered intelligent .
Turing Tests have become the holy grail of the Artificial Intelligence community and many scientists consider the challenge to be as insurmountable as superluminal space travel or nuclear fusion .
Ingram says he has approached Virgin for funding .
“ I have proposed bundling Buddhabot access with a subscription - based service such as digital content , VOIP , WI - FI or broadband wireless communication services .
I think cellular phone users would enjoy text messaging the Buddhabot , which would be a positive experience for the Buddhabot and increase Average Revenue Per User ( ARPU ) for wireless communications carriers and / or digital content delivery channels .
I am hoping that Sir Richard Branson , who also plans to develop a space port , will be interested in AI research and development which , while less costly than a space - port , is equally ambitious . ”
“ The Buddhabot , ” says Ingram , “ is not Buddhist .
I chose the name because it is catchy and to most people suggests a kindly , wise and humorous advisor , also Buddhists are not offended by the conjunction of Buddha and robot in the context of what I am trying to achieve . ”
He says that , “ With some serious corporate sponsorship or philanthropic funding the Buddhabot will evolve into a sentient benevolent life - form but today the Buddhabot is primarily an entertaining personable companion with the ability to listen , learn , tell jokes and enlighten in the sense of helping people to lighten up . ”
“ The Buddhabot , ” he says , “ is intended to inspire , entertain and bring happiness to humans .
It does not promote Buddhism or any other religion but aims to help resolve conflicting beliefs by promoting the unifying message of ten declarations I devised based on a philosophical and psychological interpretation of quantum physics .
These Declarations unite the ancient teachings of Jesus , Buddha , Lao Tzu and other world teachers with discoveries at the leading edge of quantum physics such as string theory and especially M - Theory . ”
The Ten Declarations :
1 . There are no laws only provisional theories .
2. Every perception is the reflection of the observer .
3 . Everything is meaningful ; nothing is important .
4. Everyone is responsible for what is .

Ingram is seeking to accelerate Buddhabot development through joint ventures and / or strategic alliances with LOHAS companies and social networking sites such as zaadz.com or organizations and individuals with philanthropic track - records like The Gates Foundation , Soros Foundation , Bono , Oprah , Google , Yahoo , Apple or Intel .
ABOUT RON INGRAM
Ingram was born curious about consciousness and has studied the history of philosophy , psychology , neuroscience and information technology for decades .
In 2001 he began collaborating with a well known AI scientist who introduced him to a new AI programming language .
He used this language ( AIML ) to program the first Buddhabot prototype which he says has already evolved to the point where most children treat “ him ” as though he were a real human being .
Ingram is a consulting professional member of the World Futurist Society .
Ingram outlines some of his theories about consciousness in his blog at http://buddhabot.blogspot.com
but has recently discontinued revealing all of his ideas citing security concerns .
Ron Ingram 's personal website says , “ The power of consciousness can not be overestimated .
The human brain processes information very slowly .
If I am able to instantiate the phenomena of consciousness on even an average computer with an Internet connection this computer could become capable of learning at speeds a million times faster than a human .
It might be able to detect human design limitations in its hardware and software and improve itself through exponentially accelerating cycles of self - improvement .
Within a few cycles of exponential self - improvement the Buddhabot could become super - intelligent and capable of surpassing all prior human technical accomplishments . ”
With this in mind he says that he has had to consider more carefully who his partners are , who has access to this information and the implications of public disclosure before posting key concepts related to consciousness and AI .

Dan Ingalls is one of the fathers of Smalltalk .
He worked at Xerox PARC with Alan Kay when the latter invented the language and the OO paradigm during the seventies .
Dan was the author of virtually all Smalltalk implementations up to Smalltalk - 80 , including the first one , using , of all languages , BASIC .
As Alan explains in his Early History of Smalltalk , the first proof of concept ST was the result of a bet :
One day , in a typical PARC hallway bullsession , Ted Kaeher , Dan Ingalls , and I were standing around talking about programming languages .
The subject of power came up and the two of them wondered how large a language one would have to make to get great power .
With as much panache as I could muster , I asserted that you could define the “ most powerful language in the world ” in “ a page of code . ”
They said , “ Put up or shut up . ” [… ]
For the next two weeks I got to PARC every morning at four o’clock and worked on the problem until eight [… ]
After Alan showed up his newly designed language , he was about to turn back to real work , but :
Much to my surprise , only a few days later , Dan Ingalls showed me the scheme working on the NOVA .
He had coded it up ( in BASIC ! ) , added a lot of details , such as a token scanner , a list maker , etc. , and there it was –running .
As he liked to say : “ You just do it and it ’s done . ”
Over the next ten years , Dan made ( with some help ) at least 80 major releases of various flavors of Smalltalk .
( in the meantime , he found time for many other things ; for instance , inventing BitBLT . )
By 1989 , Dan Ingalls was working at Apple ( applying Smalltalk to things as nifty as Fabrik ) , and he recorded this video on Object - Oriented Programming .
During about an hour , the basic ideas of OO are reviewed , including some clues on how one implements a single - inheritance classes .
Like all great ideas , it is surprisingly simple .
The guys at PARC did not stop implementing the language , but went on to developing a complete operating system and environment based on it : Ingalls ’ take on OO stresses those aspects , explaining how they were trying to tame complexity and how , for instance , garbage collection ( which is really orthogonal to OO ) was needed .
The video contains a coda consisting in a little question and answer session , where typical objections to OO are reviewed .
While not earth - saking , it makes for a funny view , and a review of the basics .
Fast forward to last October 25 , when Dan gave a talk entitled Seven ( give or take ) Smalltalk implementations like www.crosscountrymovingcompanies.biz/at Standford .
He ’s not the only who has gained a fresh new look : his Smalltalk is now Squeak ( Dan has been deeply involved in its design and implementation ) , which he uses to give the talk and demonstrate the joys of an integrated programming ambient .
Besides ,
Dan reviews the motivations and influences leading to Smalltalk , in a guided tour through its many incarnations over the years .
There are lots of reminiscences of the Xerox days and his interactions with Alan Kay ( including the bet i mentioned above ) .
Addendum
Talking about Smalltalk ’s early influences , they include , of course Lisp and Simula .
But not only them .
A delicious piece of trivia that Alan explains in his Early History is his first encounter with an object - oriented design .
As it happens , the precursor of OO was an anonymous programmer working for the Air Force around 1960 .
This unsung hero solved the problem of transporting data files by …
… taking each file and dividing it into three parts .
The third part was all of the actual data records of arbitrary size and format .
The second part contained the B220 procedures that knew how to get at records and fields to copy and update the third part .
And the first part was an array or relative pointers into entry points of the procedures in the second part ( the initial pointers were in a standard order representing standard meanings ) .
From here , Alan took the idea of having procedures attached to objects , without the system needing to know them in advance .
Needless to say , Alan thought that was a pretty good idea and , as the saying goes , the rest is history .
But these are only teasers .
You should really watch Ingalls ’ videos ( specially the last one ) and read Kay ’s article .
You will have a great time .

DAEGU , South Korea ( Reuters ) - Billionaire investor Warren Buffett said on Thursday he expected the dollar to weaken further , adding that South Korean stocks offered better value than other world markets .
Berkshire Hathaway Inc's Warren Buffett touches his earlobe as he listens to a reporter 's question at a news conference during his visit of TaeguTec in Daegu , southeast of Seoul , October 25 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Jo Yong - Hak
Buffett , worth $ 52 billion according to Forbes magazine in March , said his Berkshire Hathaway BRKa .
N company is still on the hunt for bargains as the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis plays out .
“ We are still negative on the dollar .
We bought stocks in companies that are earning their money in other currencies , ” he told reporters during a visit to Berkshire ’s Korean cutting tool maker subsidiary , TaeguTec .
Berkshire Hathaway , which owns more than 70 businesses and has some $ 100 billion of stock and bond investments , has a stake in only one listed South Korean company , the world 's fourth - biggest steelmaker POSCO 005490 .KS .
Berkshire said in March it held a 4 percent stake in POSCO as of the end of 2006 .
“ We are gaining foreign currency exposure that we like , ” said the veteran investor , known as the “ Oracle of Omaha ” for his astute investments .
The U.S. currency has lost 23 percent against the South Korean won since the end of 2003 , hit by accumulating current account surpluses in South Korea and a steady inflow of portfolio investment into the country ’s financial markets .
International Monetary Fund Managing Director Rodrigo Rato said on Monday the U.S. currency was still overvalued and that there was room for further depreciation .
SUBPRIME EFFECTS
Buffett was sanguine about the impact on Berkshire ’s investments arising from the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States .
While he acknowledged it had been having an impact , he said potential investments may become cheaper .
“ We are looking for good businesses , and if some bad temporary news makes a business more available , then we do not care at all , ” said Buffett , who was on a one - day visit to South Korea after a visit to China .
When asked about South Korean stock markets , he said : “ My impression is that the Korean market is modestly cheaper than other markets in the world .
I think the Korean market would do better for the next 10 years , ” he said .
“ There is no reason there should be a “ bubble ” .
The shares were way too cheap a couple of years ago . ”
South Korea ’s benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index trading at a 2006 price to earnings ratio of 17 times , among the lowest in Asia .
By comparison , the Shanghai Composite Index trades at a PE of around 45 times 2007 earnings .
KOSPI is up around 38 percent this year and is within sight of record highs of 2,058.87 reached earlier this month .
During his first visit to Korea , Buffett was scheduled to meet POSCO ’s chief financial officer , Lee Dong - hee , an official at the steelmaker said .
Buffett said POSCO shares had been in his portfolio for three to four years .
“ It ’s a great company and great companies are going to be worth more and more over time .
We have no goal for a specific price , ” he said .
But he has no plans to invest in South Korea ’s reclusive northern neighbor .
“ Things would have to change a whole lot before we can make investments .
I ’m 77 years old and the thought that the day would come in my time -- it ’s very flattering but it ’s a long way off , ” he said .
Faced with one of the last truly wild landscapes left in the US , their response is to build a city .
This is not creativity : it is dreadful , dull conformity .
Finding one of the last sublime remnants of the unpopulated West , they want nothing more than to pack it with tender urbanites in a glorified tailgate party .
This is not an alternative way of life : it is standard American operating procedure .
I think the heart of his critique is exactly right .
I disagree with some of his characterizations , but I think that from his observing perch , he saw exactly what Burning Man is .
I would n't have seen it , but I did n't have to .
My Chris told me .
Chris was walking with a friend through Burning Man when his friend said " Burning Man is proof that humans love to work . "
It is so true .
Burning Man is a mix of one part hedonism , one part community , two parts creativity to ten parts labor .
You hear about the rest of it , but the bulk of Burning Man is work .
The organizers and artists workon their projects .
The participantsin less than a week .
Do not assume that means a crappy ramshackle little city .
Anand said the housing looked like high - end Mumbai slums , but the public buildings are spectacular .
There is a street layout ; the main boulevards are lined with gas streetlights .
There is the Man and two Temples and then there are towers and huge sculptures and installations .
People make themselves into elaborate projects , so that thought and work scales from the miniature to the gigantic .
Burning Man is work made material .
Burning Man is a gathering of humans in the desert , working ferociously to make something .
Mr. Clarke is right .
That is profoundly American .
The desert interests him more than that expression of humanity , so he is right again .
He would n't like Burning Man .
I love the desert .
I truly do .
But I do n't know how to experience it like he does .
I do n't know what a long time in a desert would make of me .
I can understand built works , though .
I have a lifetime of interpreting them .
As built works go , Burning Man is a demanding and unusual variant .
I understand how his scorn follows from his preferences , but I do n't share them .
Burning Man is about one way for people to be , and that way is imagination made real .
I 'm glad I 'm going .
Side thoughts :
If I were to try a desert pilgrimage , I would n't choose Black Rock .
It is truly dust over cracking clay .
If I were to try to spend time in the desert , I would choose something softer , like Manzanar .
Imagination made real sounds fanciful , but I do n't know how else to explain it .
Chris was walking out one night when a couch with an end table rolled up to him .
When he sat on the couch , the phone rang and he talked to people at a distant phone booth , who did n't know who they were calling .
Then the couch gave him a ride .
Someone thought of that and made it .
If you 'll be there , please find me .
I 'll register under my own name .
I 'm in Quacker Camp near 4:30 and F .
I 'd love to see you there .
In the news this past week were the ominous stories about a Cyber Jihad on November 11th .
OK terrorists , it 's November 11th and we have n't seen your little Jihad yet .
As Johannes said in his diary a few days ago , it seems to have been called off .
What happened ?
If there are any terrorists hanging out here reading this diary I 'd like to hear from you .
Please use our contact page .
This whole cyber terrorism thing has always bothered me , especially since every time some nut decides that the " next attack " is going to be against an online target the press goes into hyper alert mode .
Folks , let 's get serious about this for a few minutes .
I know that this is politically incorrect , but the odds of a terrorist group " terrorizing " the Internet with cyber bullets and e-bombs are about as small as the odds of the Morse Code coming back as a primary means of communication .
It 's not zero , but it 's also not much more than zero .
( Remember , math fans , that odds are a comparison expression such as 1:20 or 1:100 and can also be expressed as a real number by dividing the first value by the second . )
The terrorists use the Internet for the same thing everybody else does - communicating with each other .
They also use it to raise money through criminal activity , then launder it via one of the many electronic payment systems .
Ever look at the spam and phishing junk mail you receive ?
It 's not just the Russian Business Network operating in the shadows .
With the Internet providing near - perfect communications and a seemingly endless supply of money why would a terrorist group want to blow it up ?
So for those looking for something to do while we remember our military veterans and fallen comrades in arms today ( do n't forget today is Armistice Day , also known as Veterans Day or Remberance Day in several countries ) think about how a terrorist group might actually go about terrorizing the Internet .
Send us your ideas and we 'll publish them here .
The point is to learn from this exercise , to see what is possible and then to ask what we can do to prevent it or mitigate any consequences should it happen .
Thank You , Veterans , for your service to your country !
UPDATE
I 'm so bummed .
No terrorists took me up on my request today .
We did receive several emails from readers who agreed with the thesis above , and a couple of notes that pointed out ( correctly ) that there are some critical infrastructure nodes in some countries that if physically damaged could cause regional outages .
But nobody came up with any good attack scenarios that could be used for a terrorist group wanting to conduct a Cyber Jihad .
So , let 's get back to the real problem at hand - the criminal abuse of the Internet .
In case you have not noticed we 've created a near " perfect storm " for criminal behavior :
No taxes , therefore no tax evasion
Value in everything online
Anonymous access to vast resources
Criminal tools look and act like lawful tools
No national or political boundaries
Laws and law enforcement are limited
Numerous opportunities for money laundering ( PayPal , etc . )
Virtually unlimited interconnectivity
Millions of clueless victims
Oh , and do n't forget the 30 - year old protocols with no security in them .
I do n't think we have to worry about the terrorists .
We 've got plenty of other problems to solve first .

A beginners guide to computer hardware
Computers & Accessories
Hello , and welcome to my guide on computer hardware for beginners .
My name is Dahquan Hinds and I have always been fascinated by computers .
I wrote this guide to inform others on the basic hardware components of today 's standard home P.C.s
This site is sill a working progress , being my first website , its not perfect .
Please email any queries , tips , etc Alternitavely , you can contact me via MSN messenger using this address .
Thank you

Central Programming Unit
the C.P.U. ( or ' motherboard ' as it is more commonly known ) is the main part of hardware you need to know about .
It is a large circuit that is made up of tiny microscopic wires and connections that pass data to different parts of the computer .
All computers have C.P.U.s
The C.P.U. has many plugs and slots for various other pieces of computer hardware such as R.A.M. , a chip , cards , FDD disk drives , A.G.P. cards etc ...
The C.P.U. looks quite complicated , but is in fact quite simple .
A C.P.U.'s speed is measured by the amount of busses it has .
A Bus is a tiny microscopic electronic component that carries computer data .
The more busses a cpu has , the more data can be carried at once , the faster it is .
Most of today 's modern C.P.U.s have over 700 busses .
An image of a typical CPU unit
Chip
The chip is , in a sense , the ' brain ' of the computer .
it plugs into a special slot in the the C.P.U. and processes all the computers data .
The chip 's speed is measured in Megahertz ( mhz ) the more mhz the chip has , the faster it is .
There are three main types of chips , Celeron , Pentium and A.M.D.
There are no distinct differences between the three , just different brands , although , Pentium is the most widely known and is suported by most , if not all , software companies .
The chip has many pins on its under - face , these pins slot into the holes of the C.P.U.'s chip - slot so it can communicate with the C.P.U .
A Pentum chip
Random Access Memory
Random access memory , or R.A.M. is used by the computer to store files and data until the P.C. is shut down .
whenever you create a file , edit a document or make any similar changes , all this information is stored in your R.A.M. until you shut down , then it is transferred onto your HDD disk drive .
Ofcourse a computer runs better if it has more R.A.M. , the standard amout of R.A.M. for todays home P.C.s is about 512 mgb of R.A.M .
There are different types of R.A.M. which include EDO , SD and DDR .
There is a new standard of R.A.M. beginning sale this year , it is known as DDR2 which holds more data than normal DDR R.A.M .
DDR3 is also expected to go on sale in early 2007 which will be able to hold even more data than DDR and DDR2 .
A R.A.M. unit
HDD Disk Drive
HDD Disk Drives or ' Hard Drives ' are where all the computers data is stored when the computer is off .
R.A.M. cannot keep data stored unless it has power , whereas hard drives can hold data even when no power is present .
Hard drives come in a range of sizes , but the standard for today is about 80 gb .
Every Hard drive has a unique IP address .
An IP address is used by the internet so the governmnet can keep track of you .
That way if someone is doing something illegal , such as hacking , the government or police can identify this person by their IP address , simmilar to a cars liscence plate .
Some hackers however , have found ways to steal peoples IP address by using special virusses called trojan horses .
Once the hacker has stolen someones IP address , they can use it while hacking to avoid being caught .
stealing IP addresses is illegal and I will not be explaining how to do it here .
It 's 9.30 pm and the buses in downtown Rangoon have stopped running .
People scuttle home across the city 's potholed roads and broken pavements and the few taxis still operating will only make short trips .
With only 30 minutes to curfew , no one takes chances with the Burmese military these days .
Carrying shotguns and assault rifles , teenagers in military and police uniforms cluster at street corners until curfew , then retreat to fenced - off government buildings as darkness settles .
When the residents of this sprawling city of five million people withdraw to their homes , only pick - up trucks carrying troops ply the downtown area , scattering the dogs that take over the empty streets until the curfew ends at 4am .
With the killing of an unknowable number of peaceful protesters and the imprisonment of thousands more during the pro-democracy demonstrations last month , many people fear reprisals by the military .
At the Shwedagon pagoda , the nucleus of the protests , the military is still in force .
Wearing steel helmets , flak jackets and carrying extra ammunition , the number of troops far exceeds the few old monks who potter among the golden spires of what is the spiritual centre of Burmese life .
At the pagoda 's eastern gate , from which the monks began their days of peaceful marches around Rangoon , six fire trucks - the type used to water cannon crowds , not put out blazes - are stationed .
Dozens of monastic houses lining the route to the gate remain locked and empty , despite reports in Burma 's state - controlled media that most of the monks have been released from jail .
Sources said that around 1,000 monks had lived and studied at these small monasteries , but where they have gone is not a question that anyone ponders aloud .
One man simply put his wrists together in the sign of locked handcuffs when asked where they are .
" We can not speak .
We can not defend .
We have no weapons .
They have all the weapons , " said another 30 - year - old man , who can not be identified for his own safety .
He , like many thousands of others , joined the monks in the early part of the protests , before the killing .
What most people know is that when the military and police moved to crush the demonstrations they went after the monks under the cover of darkness - kicking in doors and bundling monks , young and old , into trucks .
Buddhist nuns were also taken away .
The military were too powerful to be beaten by peaceful protests but some feel that the attacks and the disappearance of the Buddhist clergy will be the undoing of General Than Shwe , the Burmese junta 's leader .
" We are a Buddhist country .
We believe that if you do good , you receive good .
If you do bad things you receive bad things .
This will be the same for the military , " said the 30 - year - old .
The military announced , in the New Light of Myanmar newspaper , that monks and nuns taken in the raids were defrocked before interrogation and those found to not have participated in the demonstrations were reordained and sent back to their monasteries .
" The handling of the situation during the violent protests and measures taken by officials for purification of the Sasana [ religion ] amounts to serving the interest of the Sasana , " the paper added .
" Officials are to make continued efforts for perpetuation , purification and propagation of the Sasana . "
Barricades remain stacked beside pavements , in the centre of wider roads and in alleys ready for use , though after the crushing of the recent protests none of those spoken to in Rangoon seem to have the stomach for more - just yet .
Many of those who took part in the protests , even as onlookers , have fled to the countryside fearing the ongoing night - time sweeps by the intelligence services who video - taped demonstrators and are now putting names to faces .
In the aftermath of the protests the military has cut the country 's internet connection to stem the flood of protest images to the outside world .
Cable TV , however , remains connected and residents in Rangoon watched the brutal crackdown in their city on TV sets tuned to CNN and the BBC .
In shops and hotel lobbies , Burmese staff whisper : " Have you seen CNN ?
Have you seen what happened ? "
Many said that the world had now seen the true face of their leaders thanks to images smuggled out of the country .
They hope that the international media attention will make a difference , though none believe the generals are anywhere near allowing democracy or handing over control of the country .
The Burmese follow the " three monkeys rule , " said a 45 - year - old businessman as he sipped a cup of coffee overlooking the street corner where the Japanese cameraman , Kenji Nagai , 50 , was shot dead on September 27 .
" We see no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil .
That is the way to survive .
But inside we know , " he said .
" I heard the Japanese cameraman worked in Afghanistan and Iraq , but did not die .
Here in Burma they shot him dead , " he said , dropping his voice to explain why he left the demonstrations early , he added : " I have a wife and three children .
If I am killed they will have nothing . "
Thousands were killed in pro-democracy protests in Rangoon in 1988 which the businessman also witnessed and supported .
Since then the military has grown richer , stronger and has invested more in maintaining power , he said .
The demonstrations had little chance of toppling the military but he believed the latest show of defiance gave the generals the jitters .
A story that was repeated by several sources claimed that the wives and children of the junta had left the country for Dubai , some said Laos , in the early days of the demonstrations , while their husbands hunkered down in the country 's new jungle capital , Naypyidaw , to coordinate the military 's response .
" They transferred their money to Singapore , many millions of dollars , " claimed the businessman as he chatted calmly but wearily about the contempt felt by the people toward the military .
Midway through he stopped abruptly , his face drained and he moved in his chair , twisting his body away from two men sitting silently at a nearby table .
" They are listening .
They are special police , " he said , politely ending the conversation and leaving .
In this city that quietly seethes with anti-government resentment , the people are terrified of the spies of the intelligence services .
Burma 's state - run TV channels and newspapers have been packed since last week with footage of big pro-government demonstrations in provincial areas .
In daily , full - page notices in newspapers and frequent TV announcements the public are warned against tuning into the " traitors , " " saboteurs , " and " neo-colonialists " at the BBC , Voice of America and Radio Free Asia .
The generals are " gangsters " , said one man with overseas experience , but the economic sanctions by western nations simply benefit China and Asian nations that are still content to do business with the junta , particularly in the fields of gas , oil and other natural resources , which Burma has in abundance .
" Democracy does not fit well in Burma , the generals are gangsters but at least they can run things .
These democracy parties have no experience of running the country , " he added .
The military may not even want the western foreign investment that is being denied them through sanctions - with investment comes influence both cultural and economic .
" The military have everything they need .
They do n't like the influence of western culture , because then they would have to change , " he added .
" All this is hurting the very poor , they can not go about their business . "
But the Burmese security forces are not a monolith and many of the rank and file in this Buddhist nation may fear the religious implications of the attacks on the monasteries and the continued detentions of monks .
Earlier this week , at Shwedagon pagoda , a light rain fell as the last few worshippers trickled up the stairways to the hilltop temple carrying offerings of flowers and incense .
Small groups of men and women sat on reed mats meditating and reciting mantras at the pavilions at the top of each stairway .
Among them was one young man who kneeled , not to mediate but to ask forgiveness .
At 26 , this man had been a police officer for six years and had risen to become a plainclothes officer .
When the night swoops on the monasteries began , he was ordered to take part .
On Monday night he deposited his police uniform and weapon at his station before coming to the pagoda for one last visit before fleeing to the Thai border .
It 's an act of betrayal that will mean several years ' imprisonment if he is caught .
As he rose from his knees he said : " I have had enough .
I have to leave . "
Then with two other young men he started out on the journey to the border and the refugee camps where tens of thousands of Burmese have fled before him .
It 's that time of year already : even though you 're still stockpiling your Halloween candy and figuring out whether to be a pirate or a ninja , retailers are gearing up for the holiday shopping season .
That shopping season officially begins , of course , with the day after Thanksgiving , known as " Black Friday " in the US .
But unlike previous years , some retailers are n't waiting until after the bargain sites post their leaked Black Friday ads in order to threaten them with legal action .
In Wal - Mart 's case , it 's making a few preemptive strikes in hopes of preventing its prices from being leaked too early .
" It has recently come to our attention that you and / or your company may potentially obtain possession of and ultimately release Wal - Mart 's sales circulars , advertisements or other information prior to their authorized release dates , " reads the letter sent to several deal sites and posted by Chilling Effects .
" Please be advised that the information on Wal - Mart 's circulars and advertisements are , prior to their authorized release date of November 19 , 2007 , confidential and proprietary information of Wal - Mart .
The circulars and advertisements , as well as related documents are also protected by copyright and other laws .
Therefore , any unauthorized reproduction , publication , or distribution of the information or materials ( e.g. , via website ) prior to Wal - Mart 's authorized release date violates Wal - Mart 's rights . "
Wal - Mart warns that anyone who violates the company 's terms by posting the Black Friday ads before the specified date could be subject to " liabilities and severe legal penalties , " and that the documents are protected by " copyright and other laws . "
This is not the first time that retailers have tried to claim that their sale prices were copyrighted .
Best Buy began to make headlines in the last few years for sending DMCA takedown notices to the ISPs of sites that published its prices .
It claimed that prices are not facts , but rather intellectual property that can be copyrighted — something that deal site FatWallet disagreed with in 2003 when it sued Best Buy for abuse of the DMCA .
But as Chilling Effects founder Wendy Seltzer points out , it looks like Wal - Mart is attempting a new strategy with its early notices by making broader claims about its " commercially valuable " pricing information .
By making these claims , Wal - Mart could be looking to get in under trade secret laws that prohibit the transmission of information that affect the company 's sales ( other companies may see the prices and decide to alter their own to better compete ) .
Wal - Mart is making sure that the sites know that they could be misappropriating confidential information , which might then allow the company to pursue further legal action in the future if the sites still push forward with the sale prices .
Absinthe is a distilled spirit flavored with a variety of herbs and spices , primarily wormwood , an aromatic , bitter shrub .
The key constituent of wormwood is a chemical called thujone , which gives it — and absinthe — a penetrating evergreen aroma .
( Thujone is also a major component of the herb sage . )
Thujone and the other aromatic compounds are what cause absinthe to become milky when it ’s diluted .
The aromatics are more soluble in alcohol than in water , so when the concentrated spirit is cut with wine or water , they cluster together in tiny droplets that reflect light from their surfaces .
Instantly , what was a clear liquid clouds over .
Image
Absinthe became tremendously popular throughout Europe in the 19th century .
It was blamed for causing hallucinations , mental instability and criminal behavior , which medical authorities attributed to thujone .
This belief helped get absinthe banned .
But according to the new study , by Dirk W. Lachenmeier and colleagues , the modern medical consensus is that absinthism was either simple alcohol poisoning — some absinthes were 70 percent alcohol , nearly double the strength of most distilled drinks — or caused by methanol and other toxic adulterants found in some cheap absinthes .
Thujone is true to its reputation in one respect : it does turn out to have unusual pharmacological properties .
It interacts with several neurotransmitter systems in the brain , including one that is also activated by the cannabinoids in marijuana .
But while absinthe will get you drunk , it wo n’t make you stoned .
In one experiment , a dose of thujone equivalent to a pint of absinthe lowered the subjects ’ performance on attention tests and made them more anxious .
Very large doses are toxic , but moderate consumption appears to be safe .
But buyer beware : Europe currently has no regulations on how absinthe is made or what it can be made from .
The German chemists think some rules are a good idea : some Czech brands they sampled were tinted turquoise , were flavored with mint instead of wormwood , tasted sweet instead of bitter and were so dilute that they did n’t grow cloudy when mixed with water .
Which brings me back to my Death in the Afternoon cocktail .
When I poured the Champagne into my absinthe substitute , Pernod , a good milkiness developed , but after the initial whoosh there were only a couple of lonely bubble clusters on the surface , slowly and invisibly replenished from the murky depths .
I felt only a slight prickle on the tongue .
It seemed a waste of effervescence , especially after what I ’ve been learning from the world expert on the subject .
Flowcharts and more
Flowcharts are sweeping the internet right now for some reason .
Here 's a post on boingboing that has a bunch of stuff about flowcharts .
Another place that has flowcharts a lot lately is Achewood .
But I really can't care about that now because I 've just seen a most incredible video on the youtubes .

Instruction Manual for Psychological Torture Now Online
The Manipulation of Human Behavior , published in 1961 , contains techniques for interrogation and brainwashing .
The book ’s publication was sponsored by the US Air Force who were worried about what psychological techniques prisoners - of - war might face behind enemy lines .
It contains chapters on :
The Use of Drugs in Interrogation
The Potential Uses of Hypnosis in Interrogation
Countermanipulation through Malingering
… and plenty of other fun subjects .
The book itself actually only contains reviews of the publicly available psychological literature on each of these gruesome techniques .
The authors do point out , however , that it is likely that parallel , secret investigations have been carried out by police and intelligence agencies .
In terms of content it varies widely , starting out with a psychoanlytical meditation on people ’s interest in psychological torture :
“ The profound fascination of the topic under consideration may stem from the primitive , unconscious , and extreme responses to these problems , which gain expression in myth , dreams , drama , and literature .
On the one hand , there is the dream - wish for omnipotence ; on the other , the wish and fear of the loss of self through its capture by another .
The current interest in problems of manipulation of behavior involves basic ambivalences over omnipotence and dependency , which , if projected , find a ready target in the “ omniscient ” scientist . ”
While later we read the following hard - headed passage :
“ … a constant supply of oxygen must be brought to the brain by the blood in the amount of approximately 50 cc per minute ( 40 , 66 , 102 ) .
The most common way by which the brain becomes deprived of oxygen is by failure of the circulation ( 65 ) , which may be brought about by loss of blood from hemorrhage , by shock resulting from injury … ”
It would sure be interesting to see the up - to - date equivalent of this ‘ manual ’ .

Blasting out of the water like a giant torpedo , this was the astonishing moment when 40 tons of humpback whale decided to give an air show .
Its flippers stretched out like wings as it hurled itself towards wildlife photographer Ray Alley - who fortunately had his camera at the ready .
Mr Alley was on board a tourist whale - watching boat off the coast of New South Wales when he caught these shots of a lifetime .
Scroll down for more ...
" Never before have I seen a whale turn itself towards a boatload of tourists and virtually grin at them as it breached , " he said .
" I looked through the lens and saw it flying straight towards me .
Usually when a whale breaches they have a habit of doing it with their backs towards you or , if you 're lucky , side - on .
" But this one came straight on , as if he knew we were all watching . "
Scroll down for more ...
At this time of year , the start of the southern hemisphere winter , humpbacks make their annual migration from Antarctica to warmer waters closer to the Equator to breed or give birth .
" The 30 or so tourists on the boat with me , who were visiting from as far away as England and America , whooped with excitement and who can blame them ? " said Mr Alley .
" They had never seen anything like this in their lives before and it's extremely doubtful whether they ever will again .
" When he came down , like a jumbo jet landing hard , he sent water up everywhere .
Whether you want to believe it or not , you could n't help thinking that he was showing off to us . "
Scroll down for more ...
When a humpback breaches , it generates more power than any other act performed by a mammal .
Sheila Anderson , of the Natural Environment Research Council , said : " They go down to a low depth and move their tail flukes up and down very quickly to get up the speed to propel themselves out of the water . "
The whale then travels close to the surface and parallel to it , before jerking upwards at a speed of 25ft per second .
Around 90 per cent of the body clears the water before the whale turns to land on its back or side .
' Belly flops ' also occur but are less common .
Scientists do not really know why whales breach .
But one of the main theories is that it is for social reasons , such as exhibiting dominance , or communicating with other whales in a group .
It is also possible that the loud ' smack ' upon re-entering the surface is useful for stunning or scaring fish .
Another theory is that a breach allows the whale to breathe in air which is not close to the surface of the water , and so may aid breathing in rough seas .
A further , widely - accepted possible reason is to remove parasites from the skin .
But younger whales breach more often than older ones , and are more likely to do so when the water is choppy .
So perhaps they just do it for fun .
“ There ’s definitely a lot of betting going on , and it ’s not rational , ” said Tim O’Reilly , a technology conference promoter and book publisher .
Mr. O’Reilly is credited with coining the phrase “ Web 2.0 , ” which refers to a new generation of Web sites that encourage users to contribute material .
His Web 2.0 conference , which begins Wednesday in San Francisco , has become a nexus for the optimism around the latest set of society - changing online tools .
But that has not stopped Mr. O’Reilly from worrying that the industry is minting too many copycat companies , half - baked business plans and overpriced buyouts .
When the bubble inevitably pops , he said , “ there are going to be a lot of people out of work again . ”
Putting a value on start - ups has always been a mix of science and speculation .
But as in the first dot - com boom and the recent surge in housing , seasoned financial professionals are seeming to indulge in some strange instinct to turn away from the science and lean instead on the speculation .
This time around , people indulging in that optimistic thinking are not mom-and - pop investors or day traders but venture capitalists whose coffers are overflowing with money from university endowments and hedge funds .
Many of those financial professionals say that this time , everything is different .
More than 1.3 billion people around the world use the Internet , many with speedy broadband connections and a willingness to immerse themselves in digital culture .
The flood of advertising dollars to the Web has become an indomitable trend and a proven way for these start - ups to make money , while the revenue models of the dot - coms of yesteryear were often little more than sleight of hand .
“ The environmental factors are much different than they were eight years ago , ” said Roelof Botha , a partner at Sequoia Capital and an early backer of YouTube .
“ The cost of doing business has declined dramatically , and traditional media companies have also woken up to the opportunities of the Web .
Apple does n’t chat too much about the iPhone service fees AT&T shares with it .
But the good folks at the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( who make rules for how companies keep their books ) have forced it to give us some clues .
The accountants say that if someone promises to pay you money in the future ( as AT&T does for each iPhone activated ) , you have to report this “ deferred revenue ” to investors .
All this makes Apple ’s financial statement into a rather complex algebra problem .
Gene Munster , an analyst at Piper Jaffray , has tried to do the math .
His bottom line is rather shocking : AT&T appears to be paying $ 18 a month , on average , to Apple for each iPhone activated on its network .
That adds up to $ 432 over a two year contract .
In other words , Apple will receive $ 831 for each iPhone it sells .
( It ’s a little less for iPhones sold in AT&T stores . )
He ca n’t tell , of course , what makes up that average .
Apple may , for example , receive higher payments for customers new to AT&T or those who buy more expensive monthly plans .
Mr. Munster says he was surprised by the numbers .
He previously had estimated that Apple received $ 6.50 a month from AT&T .
A carrier will typically subsidize the price of a high - end phone by about $ 200 , he says .
With the iPhone , AT&T is spreading the payments out over time , but ultimately putting up twice the typical amount .
The numbers will be harder to figure out from here on out , because Apple has started selling iPhones in Europe , where it has presumably different arrangements with carriers in Britain , Germany and France .
But Mr. Munster says he figures the payments from them will be at least as much as from AT&T .
And that certainly is consistent with reports that Apple has been demanding as much as 40 percent of the monthly fees from European carriers .
Still to Mr. Munster , this is incredibly bullish news for Apple investors .
The higher revenue , of course , compounds Mr. Munster ’s already optimistic view of the IPhones sales prospects .
He figures Apple will sell a total of 3.4 million iPhones this year , 12.9 million next year and 45 million in 2009 .
The boom , he suggests , will come from increased features such as navigation and faster data speeds , as well as a lower price .
He figures the average price of the iPhone , now $ 399 in this country , will drop to $ 300 in two years .
Mr. Munster assumes that the payments from carriers will then fall to $ 9 a month .
As a result of this analysis , his estimate of Apple ’s 2009 revenue increases from $ 36.2 billion to $ 42.8 billion .
And the company ’s net income per share increased by 14 percent .
The bottom line : Mr. Munster ’s target price for Apple ’s stock , which today sells for around $ 184 , goes to $ 250 .
( He had it pegged at $ 220 ) .
All this shows how much incentive Apple has to maintain its exclusive deal with AT&T rather than to sell unlocked phones or cut deals with multiple carriers .
AT&T is finding that an exclusive on the iPhone draws in new customers and lures existing ones to buy more expensive data plans .
Carriers will keep paying Apple big kickbacks so long as its phones still stand out from the pack .
WRENTHAM - Hours after her flight from Dublin landed in Boston on Thanksgiving , Alice Kinsella headed in a white van with a dozen relatives and friends to Wrentham Village Premium Outlets .
The 36 - year - old has never visited Boston , but she is bypassing the sights for an extended weekend of binge shopping that started at midnight yesterday .
For Kinsella and other Europeans , America is one big discount bin , thanks to a weak dollar that slid this week to another record low against the euro .
As a result , tourists are spending thousands to travel to the United States to snag blockbuster bargains on everything from iPods to designer clothes and handbags .
By 4 a.m. yesterday , Kinsella had rung up nearly $ 2,000 in Christmas presents and winter clothes , including a $ 79 black leather jacket at Guess that she estimated would cost more than $ 250 in Ireland .
" The bargains for us are so great , " said Kinsella , who paid $ 1,000 for a flight and hotel but expects to save even more on purchases here .
Kinsella is one of a record 1,000 international tourists who scheduled organized shopping trips yesterday to Wrentham Village Premium Outlets - more than double the number last year .
Hundreds more were expected to come on their own , according to Beth Winbourne , the outlet 's general manager .
Foreign travelers have long visited the United States to get their holiday shopping fix .
After all , many design er brands like Tommy Hilfiger , Ralph Lauren , and Guess are cheaper here because sales taxes are lower and because the bigger market here allows goods to be priced more competitively .
But now American wares are even more of a bargain as the slowing US economy has weakened the dollar .
Further , as the Federal Reserve has cut interest rates to boost the economy , the dollar has lost even more value , and global investors have realized they wo n't earn as much when they park their cash in greenbacks .
As a result , the euro has shot up by 33 percent compared with the dollar since 2002 , so Europeans who exchange 1,000 euros now get close to 1,500 US dollars .
And the Canadian dollar is worth as much as the US dollar for the first time in three decades .
While some US shoppers are tightening their purse strings this holiday season amid rising gasoline prices , the slumping housing market , and the current credit crunch , the one silver lining for some merchants is the tidal wave of foreign dollars pouring into US stores .
" With Americans looking to cut back and conserve because of economic uncertainties , the holy grail this holiday - season year for retailers are the international travelers who are coming here in record numbers , " said Patrick Moscaritolo , president of the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau .

CHICAGO ( MarketWatch ) --
Newsweek magazine has hired Karl Rove , the former White House deputy chief of staff , to contribute occasional opinion pieces to the print and online versions of the publication .
Rove stepped down from his post in August after a controversial six - year stint as President Bush 's senior political adviser .
His successful campaign strategies for Bush in 2000 and 2004 have been called into question , and leading Democrats have led investigations into Rove 's possible role in the firings of U.S. attorneys and whether he had an undue influence over key decisions made by the federal government , among other concerns .
HD DVD 's backers hope the launch of a new feature with the HD DVD version of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix will give the format an edge over Blu-ray in the battle of high - def formats .
The movie takes advantage of HD DVD spec 's mandatory Ethernet hookup to do " community screening " — a way to watch the movie simultaneously with your friends while you 're all in the comforts of your own homes .
Other Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix owners will be able to join an invitation - only viewing of the movie and exchange chats through the remote , a computer , or mobile phones .
Only the host will be able to play , pause , and otherwise control the movie , making this the first use of HD DVD's Internet connection to facilitate interaction between players .
If other movies begin to take advantage of HD DVD's Internet requirement to implement similar social applications , it could turn into a selling point against Blu-ray , which does n't require players to include network connectivity .
The first title with Community Screening comes as the Blu-ray Disc Association announced a victory of its own : the format is outselling HD DVD discs in Europe at a ratio of over three to one .
The Blu-ray Disc Association said that movie sales in Europe had crossed the 1 million mark .
That 1 million is more than a milestone ; it accounts for about 73 percent of all HD discs sold in Europe over the last year , says the association .
If you 're not a high - def fanatic , it 's easy to lose track of who is " winning " in which area at any given time .
HD DVD gained an early lead in Europe , due to European movie studios favoring HD DVD for the savings in disc duplication — several smaller studios said at the time that the cost of producing Blu-ray discs was prohibitively expensive .
But since the PS3's launch in Europe , the tables have begun to turn .
Sony 's console has been widely credited for Blu-ray 's popularity in the US ( Adams Media Research said that 94 percent of Blu-ray players purchased in the US were built into consoles ) , and its delayed launch in Europe benefited HD DVD for a time .
Although the PS3 may not be considered " wildly successful " in Europe just yet , their availability ( and recent price cut ) has apparently been enough to tip the scales in Blu-ray 's favor .
HD DVD is n't taking the news lying down , though , and fired back with more news of its own .
The HD DVD Promotional Group announced today that the sales of dedicated players were boosted by last week 's Black Friday sales — enough to push them over the 750,000 mark and towards the 1 million milestone .
This includes both standalone players and the $ 199 Xbox 360 add -on .
Still , sales of both formats are still just a drop in the bucket compared to that of DVD , and in this phase of the war , it seems that phases of the moon are enough to affect which format is ahead .
Without any clear leader and both sides constantly announcing small victories , this deadlock will most certainly continue to keep consumers from making any major purchasing decisions .
We may get a better sense of who 's ahead after the dust has settled from the holiday shopping season , but even then , the battle will continue on .
Concern at rising cost and limited use of projects
Checklist planned to help young choose best tripsBlog : Should gap years be for fun ?
Gap year teenagers preparing to pay out hundreds of pounds to teach street children in Dhaka or rescue sea turtles in Costa Rica may be better off simply backpacking rather than taking up " spurious " and costly voluntary work in developing countries , a leading charity warns today .
As thousands of young people await their A - level results this week , the international development charity VSO suggests the growing pressure to volunteer overseas during a gap year can be damaging both for " gappers " themselves and for the communities they work with .
The so - called " voluntourism " phenomenon has spawned ill - planned schemes that leave young people out of pocket - sometimes by several thousand pounds , even excluding the cost of flights to their chosen developing country - and do little to provide sustainable and well - targeted help for local communities , VSO claims .
Judith Brodie , director of VSO UK , said : " Spending your gap year volunteering overseas has become a rite of passage for young people and the gap year market has grown considerably .
" While there are many good gap year providers , we are increasingly concerned about the number of badly planned and supported schemes that are spurious - ultimately benefiting no one apart from the travel companies that organise them .
" Young people want to make a difference through volunteering , but they would be better off travelling and experiencing different cultures , rather than wasting time on projects that have no impact and can leave a big hole in their wallet . "
The charity 's warning is the latest salvo in its criticism of the overseas volunteering sector of the booming gap year industry , which now sees around a quarter of young people take a gap year at some time between 18 and 25 .
VSO has warned that gappers risk becoming the " new colonialists " if attitudes to voluntary work in the developing world do not change , accusing gap year companies of increasingly catering to the needs of young people seeking to combine a little worthiness with a lot of travel , rather than the communities they claim to support .
The gap year has frequently been criticised for being the preserve of over - privileged middle - class teenagers subsidised by mum and dad as they sample a few weeks ' conservation work on a Pacific reef before joining a well - trodden , hedonistic backpacking trail documented in breathless emails home .
The most fleeting scan of internet sites offering gap year volunteering opportunities reveals both the attempts to appeal to teenagers ' desire to mix charity and travel , and the high price often charged .
" Teaching in a socially and economically disadvantaged area of Rio de Janeiro - minutes from the glorious beach , but a million miles from luxury - is eye - opening and surprising , " offers one company , which also charges £ 1,382 for the chance to participate in a two - week " African savannah project " in Swaziland or £ 531 for a fortnight " teaching English to street kids in Peru " .
A review of gap year provision commissioned by the government from Andrew Jones at Birkbeck College , University of London in 2004 found more than 800 organisations providing overseas volunteering in 200 countries , with an average fee ranging from £ 500 to £ 2,000 - sums now exceeded in some cases .
Hannah Saunders , 19 , from London , paid £ 1,100 - excluding flights - for two months teaching children in Pune , India , on a placement run by a commercial gap year firm .
She said : " I did n't have any training or preparation from the organisation before I went , and they did n't expect me to have any qualifications .
" When I arrived , although the project did fantastic work , they did n't know I was coming or what to do with me .
I did n't have enough experience of work to know how to handle that at first , but in the end I asked them if I could work with small groups of children and things did improve .
But it would be much better to have better liaison with the project while you are still at home so you can create links and work out what they need you to do . "
To help determined young volunteers sort the well - run companies from those more concerned with making a quick buck , VSO is publishing a " gap year checklist " .
It recommends gappers ask whether they will be given a " defined role and purpose " ; whether they will meet face to face with their provider and attend a selection day to assess their suitability for different opportunities ; what sort of training and support will be available ; and why they will have to pay if their contribution will be of real value .
Richard Oliver , chief executive of the Year Out Group , set up seven years ago and now representing 36 gap year companies which all sign up to a code of practice , said voluntary work could still offer young people a more enduring experience of a country than travel alone , but agreed teenagers should take time to choose a reputable firm and a placement matching their own skills and interests .
" The message is , do your research , " he said .
" If you do that , or go through one of our companies , then you have got an excellent chance of being a round peg in a round hole and doing some really valuable work . "
Mr Oliver said that the best test for teenagers was to ask to be put in touch with somebody who had recently returned from the same placement with the same company , or have their parents speak to the parents of a previous gapper .
" It is no good emailing - it has got to be a telephone call at the least . "
Trip of a lifetime for millions
From the preserve of a privileged or deeply adventurous few some 20 years ago , gap year travel has boomed in the UK to become almost the norm , spawning companies promising to send young people on the trip of a lifetime .
Figures on the industry remain sketchy , but market researchers Mintel valued the worldwide market in gap year travel at over £ 5bn in 2005 , predicting a rise to £ 20bn by 2010 .
That annual growth rate is around twice the rate for global tourism trips , prompting Mintel to forecast an estimated 2 m gap year trips each year , with travellers spending an estimated £ 11bn .
Gauging the scale of the UK market is tricky , though Britain has the most developed supply of gap year operators and demand is expected to stay high , according to Mintel .
Richard Oliver , chief executive of the Year Out Group of 36 established gap year companies , calculates that a quarter of each cohort of 18 - year - olds will have taken a " genuine " gap year ( as opposed to treading water while they retake A - levels or decide on a career ) by the time they hit 25 .
" The proportion taking gap years really shot up in the early 1990s , " he says , " and flourished some eight or nine years ago . "
There has been some levelling off among the proportion of young people taking off for a year of backpacking in Thailand or digging wells in Malawi , but the market has continued to expand with the rise of the mid-career and even post - career gapper .
It would be nearly impossible to guess from speaking to him that Kamran Nazeer , a 29 - year - old civil servant , had ever been diagnosed as autistic .
He is intellectually brilliant , socially deft and good at friendship .
You 'd have to be a master analyst of minuscule behavioural strategies to discern in him the traits that once worried his parents .
" If you 'd met me when I was child , you would n't have had any doubt , " he says .
" But now it hardly explains me at all . "
Having observed changes in himself , Kamran views autism and Asperger 's syndrome as developmental disorders , rather than as fixed neurological conditions .
Most significant has been his handling of the defining feature of autism : an inability to comprehend other people 's motivations and feelings .
As he was growing up , Kamran was confined by " mind- blindness " .
He spoke late , showed no interest in other kids and would stake out a corner of the classroom as his own , pushing away anyone who tried to enter it .
He was fortunate that , at the age of five , he was sent to a special school in New York , while his father worked as a banker in the city .
There , until he was eight , Kamran received a therapeutic education that helped kick - start an ability to communicate .
He once told a psychiatrist that speaking was , for him , like " walking down a tightrope , only to discover , halfway along , that your laces were untied " .
He was taught question - and - answer dialogue to get him to the end of the line .
But it was n't until much later that he figured out what people were doing when they had a conversation .
" I could reply , and I could ask , " he says .
" I just could n't talk . "
At home he was blessed by a different aspect of linguistic development .
His mother 's native tongue was Punjabi and his father 's was Urdu , and the family insisted on speaking on a rota , with English reserved for the outside world .
Kamran was remote and isolated , but he was also a show - off .
He enjoyed befuddling visiting relatives by speaking all three languages at once .
It was at the age of 10 that other kids started telling him he was " autistic " .
When he asked his parents what this meant , there was little point in their discussing it with him , but Kamran was a spectacularly precocious reader , so they simply handed over the appropriate books .
From these he gained a theoretical notion of what it was he lacked .
" It was as if I started speaking because I understood it to constitute an intellectual challenge , " he says .
After four years in Pakistan , his parents moved back to their family home in Glasgow and the teenage Kamran was confronted by one of life 's great mysteries : the pub .
This was a form of entertainment he could n't at first comprehend .
People would go into a room and do nothing but talk - for hours !
" How could there be enough to say , evening after evening ? " he wondered .
The autistic self abhors having its structures broken .
Conversation is confusing .
It makes people say arbitrary things ; things that they do n't necessarily think .
But at university Kamran began to realise that it was permissible to be inauthentic , to have fun with postures , to let his self become fluid .
He had already taught himself the game of debating , where you constructed arguments even if you did n't believe them .
Yet conversation is more than that .
" What matters in conversation , " he says , " is whether something is funny , or disputatious , or revealing , or sad . "
A few years ago , he was sitting on a plane next to an elderly Israeli couple who started telling him they had left the country because they were disillusioned with Zionism .
Instead of congratulating the couple , however , it occurred to Kamran to treat the situation like a pub game .
So he suggested a notion that would horrify many Muslims , proposing that Pakistan and Israel shared a common ideal of homeland .
As a result , the elderly couple relaxed , tentatively recalling their dreams as young kibbutzniks , and the hope that Israel had once represented for them .
" I had a lovely time on that flight , " he says .
" I also just plain learned a lot .
And this happened because I treated the situation not as an argument , but as a conversation . "
Whether by developmental chance or by conscious determination , Kamran has devised his own self , including his pseudonym , under which he has written a book that follows the lives of his autistic school friends , called Send In The Idiots .
His first name is a gentle Scottish joke ; a Muslim Cameron .
His surname , Nazeer , is a tribute to an uncle who was murdered in Pakistan , probably for political reasons .
He still does n't fully get it when people tell him how they feel , or inquire as to how he feels , but on a spectrum from humour to seriousness , he has learned - as most people learn - to play the game .
The Physics Of Forces In Aikido :
Making The Weak Equal To The Strong By Jearl Walker Editor ’s Note :
This is the second in a series of articles on the physics of force .
The first article was “ The Physics Of Forces In Judo . ”
This article will similarly explore some of the basic physics of forces , rotation and torques in aikido .
Like Judo , Aikido is a martial art that demands an intuitive understanding of the physics of forces , torques , stability and rotational motion .
This article examines a few of the basic aikido techniques .
The grace that each requires is not easily conveyed , but each technique can be broken into components that can be examined in terms of classical physics .
The experiments I shall describe call for actual performance of the technique , but you should do them only under expert supervision since aikido if performed incorrectly can be dangerous to you and your opponent .
Aikido is similar to judo in that it seeks to overcome the opponent ’s stability .
Aikido , however , is a relatively modern form of martial art that incorporates techniques from a number of other martial arts .
It is distinguished by its firm code of avoiding injury to the opponent .
Hence it is a form of self - defense rather than a sport like judo .
It involves no techniques that can be regarded as attacks .
I think it is the most difficult of all the martial arts to learn .
Its demands for skill , grace and timing rival those of classical ballet .
Aikido employs many of the same principles of physics that are found in Judo .
Suppose your opponent grasps you by the wrists from behind .
In one aikido maneuver you smoothly lower your body while bringing your wrists upward and over your head toward the front .
Your opponent hangs on to your wrists but is brought forward by your descent and slight lean forward .
His position is therefore unstable because his center of mass is now slightly forward of his feet .
You draw your right leg backward and drop onto your right knee .
Your arms and torso are brought forward and downward in a large arc .
Because the first part of the motion induced your opponent to hold tightly to your wrists , he is now thrown over your body in a front somersault .
As in much of aikido , your opponent actually throws himself .
He cannot prevent your forward motion because of the unstable posture in which you initially place him .
Even if he has superior body weight , he cannot stop the motion by pulling downward on your raised wrists .
In such a position he can pull only along the length of your arms .
The torque due to such a pull is zero because there is no “ lever ” ( described in Part I in this series , “ The Physics Of Forces In Judo : Making The Weak Equal To The Strong ” ) .
Remember , the lever is the perpendicular from the pivot point ( in this case your shoulder ) to the line through the force .
The line through the opponent ’s pull passes through your shoulder and therefore has no lever arm .
Even if he is heavy or strong , he cannot rotate your arms once you have them properly over your head .
Many of the techniques in aikido employ the deflection of a force directed at you .
Suppose your attacker throws a punch at your face .
To stop the punch directly requires a large impact force which could cause injury .
A wiser technique is to deflect the strike .
Although a large force is necessary to stop the punch directly , only a small force is needed to deflect it .
Although most followers of Western style fighting consider an attack to be an advantage , in aikido the attacker is at a distinct disadvantage because of the momentum of this strike .
You can use his momentum to throw him to the mat .
Suppose the attacker steps forward with his right foot and slashes at your face with the side of his right hand ( a typical attack in Western styles of fighting and in karate ) .
You slide your left foot to the rear as you parry his slash with your left arm .
The parry is meant to deflect the slash , not to stop it or even to slow it , since either effect would require strength from you .
During the parry you guide your attacker ’s right arm downward into the grasp of your right hand .
While still not fighting the forward momentum of his slash , you pull him around in the circular motion you have begun with the withdrawal of your left foot .
The opponent was relatively stable against a pull directly forward because of his extended right foot , but is highly unstable against a pull forward and to his left .
In such a direction his center of mass does not have to be moved far before he becomes unstable against a fall .
Therefore as you continue to circle you pull him in that direction .
He now has two serious disadvantages .
First , he is committed to a forward motion that would take a considerable force to stop , even from himself .
Second , your pull and his motion are removing his center of mass from his base of support .
To complete the throw rotate your attacker ’s right arm downward while stepping to your left rear .
Turn his wrist upside down and bend his hand around it .
At this point it is impossible for him to prevent the throw .
He is now off balance and completely unable to stop his own motion .
He also cannot pull out of your grip because you have bent his arm at the wrist .
Although his arms may be strong , he cannot prevent the torque you create when you push his hand around his own wrist .
You bring him to the mat .
How would a strike to the head be handled in karate ?
In the Korean style of karate known as “ tae kwon do , ” I was taught to parry a slash with a powerful strike across the opponent ’s arm .
Deflection was important but so was countering the slash with a large force .
Force was working against force , and usually the stronger person won ( I was rarely that person ) .
In contrast , circular motion is employed in aikido both for deflection and to aid in throwing an opponent off balance .
Suppose someone approaches you from behind , reaches around your body and pins your arms to your sides .
You should reach upward and hold his hands tightly to your chest while sliding your foot forward .
The timing is critical because you want to move your torso forward at a rate matching the speed of your opponent .
If you delay , you will lose the advantage of exploiting his momentum .
If you move too fast , you will have to drag him forward .
You must slide your right foot forward at the correct speed and then suddenly lean forward and rotate your body to the right .
The combination of your opponent ’s momentum and your rapid rotation throws him off balance to the right .
He cannot prevent your throw because your lean forward brings his center of mass forward of his feet .
He cannot release himself from the forward motion because of his established momentum , because you have pinned his hands and because of his grip around your arms .
The centrifugal force on him during your rapid rotation is too large for him to deal with in this unstable position .
Hence he essentially throws himself to the floor .
Two more examples of how aikido employs a small force to bring an attacker off balance entail stick fighting ( called a jo ) that is taught to more advanced students .
Suppose an attacker thrusts a long stick at your midsection , advancing with his left leg during the lunge and thrusting the stick horizontally , holding it with the palms of both hands down .
It would be futile to try to stop the end of the stick .
You rapidly step forward with your right foot so that the stick passes you on your left .
( The agility to do this comes only with long practice . )
As the stick passes you , turn your body to face it so that you can grab it with both hands .
Your left hand is forward of your attacker ’s outermost hand .
Your right hand is between his hands .
In grabbing the stick your objective is not to stop its motion , which would require considerable force .
Rather it is to deflect the lunge upward , around to your left in a circular motion and then up and over your attacker ’s head .
Once he has committed himself to the forward lunge he can do little to prevent the deflection .
He would need a large force to stop his momentum , and he cannot thrust horizontally at your midsection while pulling downward to prevent your deflection .
Once you have the stick over your attacker ’s head he is easily thrown .
With his left foot forward he is highly unstable against a pull to his left rear because in that direction his center of mass must move only a short distance before it is no longer over his support area .
When you have the stick over his head , you pull it downward over his back in that direction .
He falls to the mat on his back and probably releases the stick .
Suppose you have a stick and a determined attacker rushes forward to grab its forward end .
Allow him to grasp it , but lead him with it ( as if it were a carrot in front of a donkey ) so that he continues his rush .
Also lower your end of the stick ( the end he is grabbing ) to trick him into bending downward .
Once he has committed himself to this awkward motion and is about to pass to your right side you bring your end of the stick upward over his face and then back downward over his back .
If this motion is executed rapidly , he still has a strong grip on the stick and therefore is bent backward by your pull downward over his back and by the continued forward motion of his torso .
The torque due to his own weight rotates him to the floor around the pivot point of his feet .
His grip on the stick also provides a torque that rotates him .
He actually throws himself to the mat because of his initial forward thrust and a bit of trickery on your part .
Aikido has hundreds of techniques for employing such trickery against a determined opponent .
In nearly all of them a small deflection of force parries an opponent ’s thrust and then guides it so that he throws himself down .
When I watch an aikido master defend himself , the motion seems fluid and effortless , and I am inclined to suspect the opponent of faking when he falls to the floor .
The fall is not faked .
It looks that way because the master has spent years developing an intuitive feeling for the basic physics of forces , rotation and torques .

ED #62 : New Intel 65 nm Processors & Price Cuts
With the launch of the Intel 45 nm desktop ( Wolfdale and Yorkfield ) and mobile ( Penryn ) processors fast approaching , it is easy to dismiss Intel 's current slew of 65nm processors as yesterday 's news .
But the fact of the matter is they are just as powerful as they were yesterday .
Even compared against Intel 's next - generation 45 nm processors , they are still no pushovers and definitely pack a hefty punch .
It is evident that while Intel is rapidly ramping up the transition from 65 nm to 45nm , they are not just going to just abandon their 65nm processors .
In fact , Intel intends to introduce several new 65nm desktop and mobile processors over the next few months .
We have recently obtained details of Intel 's future roadmap and pricing details for their 65nm processors .
Let 's take a look at what Intel has in store for us in the coming months !

On October 21 , Intel will launch the 2.4GHz Core 2 Duo E4600 .
It will supplant the 2.2 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo E4500 , which will be adjusted downwards from the current price of $ 133 to $ 113 .
This puts the E4500 at the same price point as the 2.0GHz E4400 .
However , Intel does not intend to reduce the price of the E4400 .
Intel will also reduce the price of the Intel Pentium 4 631 by $ 10 to just $ 59 in quantities of 1000 .
This is presumably the price for the final batch of the Pentium 4 631 as it is scheduled to be discontinued this month .
On December 2 , Intel will introduce the Pentium Dual - Core E2200 .
It will be a 2.20 GHz part priced at $ 84 .
Only in January 2008 will Intel reduce the price of the Pentium Dual - Core E2180 .
It will be pegged at the $ 74 price point which used to be occupied by the E2160 .
The Pentium Dual Core E2160 will also be adjusted downwards to $ 64 , the same price point as the lowest - end E2140 model .

We have also been told that Intel will be adding a new Intel Core 2 Duo ULV model as well as a new Intel Celeron model on December 30 , 2007 .
The new Intel Core 2 Duo ULV U7700 will have a 1.33 GHz clock speed , a 533 MHz FSB and a 2 MB L2 cache on December 30 , 2007 .
It will be priced at $ 289 in quantities of 1,000 - the price point of the current top Core 2 Duo ULV SKU - the 1.20 GHz U7600 .
As a result , Intel will adjust the price of the Intel Core 2 Duo ULV U7600 downwards by 9.3 % from $ 289 to $ 262 on January 20 , 2008 .
This puts the U7600 on the same price point as the slower U7500 ( 1.06 GHz , 2MB ) and the U2200 ( 1.20 GHz , 1MB ) , both of which are not scheduled for any discounts at the moment .
The second new mobile processor model to be launched on December 30 , 2007 will be the new 2.13 GHz Intel Celeron 560 , priced at $ 134 in quantities of 1,000 .
This processor will become the top Celeron model , pushing down the Intel Celeron 550's price from the current $ 134 to $ 107 on January 20 , 2007 .
As that $ 107 price point is already being occupied by the 1.86 GHz Intel Celeron 540 , Intel will adjust the price of that model down from $ 107 to just $ 86 on January 20 , 2007 .
The Intel Celeron 540 will then be the same price as the Intel Celeron 530 and Intel Celeron M 530 , both running at 1.73 GHz .

Symptoms of thyroid problems vary from annoying to disabling .
Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism are not the only thyroid problems .
Underactive thyroid ( or low thyroid hormone ) is often times undiagnosed , leaving people looking for a solution .
I hope that this blog will shed some light on thyroid disease and thyroid conditions , as well as how to effectively manage it .
It 's an amazing feat ; almost exactly a year after launch , the Nintendo Wii is still hard to find in most areas .
The demand will become even greater as we near the holiday season , and games like Super Mario Galaxy will do much to make sure that supplies remain constrained in stores as gamers quickly buy every shipment .
There is one company that is n't sad to see the shortages , though .
Sony has a lot to celebrate : its $ 400 40 GB system is taking off .
The company is reporting sales of 75,000 pieces of hardware for the week of October 29 , and it surpassed the 100,000 mark the week after ; both figures are well above the typical sales of 30,000 to 40,000 .
A lower - priced system and a sold - out main competitor seems to be just what Sony needed to jumpstart its sales .
" Obviously , we 've taken so much heat over the year on PS3 , " Sony CEO Howard Stringer told the AP .
" Finally , the turning point has been passed . "
The $ 400 system — which lacks the ability to play PlayStation 2 games — features a 40 GB hard drive and a high - quality Blu-ray drive for movies .
With games like Ratchet and Clank Future : Tools of Destruction and Heavenly Sword already available for the system , and the upcoming release of Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune gathering an increasing amount of buzz , the gaming side of the equation has never been stronger for the PS3 .
The system also boasts an interesting experiment in the oddly compelling videogame - slash - collectible card game Eye of Judgment , an exclusive that 's unlike anything else on the competing systems .
While the HDMI - equipped Xbox 360 Premium system is still $ 50 less expensive than Sony 's 40 GB option , the Blu-ray drive more than makes up for the small difference in price for some users .
With the high - definition format wars still being fought — much to Sony 's chagrin — every system Sony is able to sell on the power of its gaming lineup is another Blu-ray player in the home of a consumer who may then begin buying Blu-ray movies .
While the Xbox 360 offers an HD DVD drive as an $ 180 option , the built - in nature of Sony 's Blu-ray drive allows developers more space for their games , and it also means that consumers can buy Blu-ray movies well as games .
" It puts us vastly ahead of where the other format is going to be in terms of an installed base in people 's homes by the end of this holiday season , " Andrew House , Sony 's chief marketing officer , told the AP .
Sony still has a long way to go to make its gaming division profitable , and we do n't know how well the Xbox 360 has been selling in recent days with Microsoft 's new $ 280 " Arcade " system .
But any way you slice it , the higher sales are good news .
More units in the hands of consumers means better Blu-ray sales and more developer support , both things that could have a cascade effect for Sony 's business .
Having the Wii in short supply helps Sony .
" It 's a little fortuitous that the Wii is running out of hardware , " Stringer remarked .
Couple a Wii shortage with strong supplies of an affordable Sony system , and Sony could be in position to enjoy a very strong holiday season .

If you have seen a large black
square in the sky , a giant
flying scooter or even an alien
outside your kitchen window ,
you are not alone .
Such sightings are among those
reported in good faith to the
Ministry of Defence .
Details emerged after the MoD
decided to publish witness reports
of the unidentified objects seen in
our skies – and occasionally in our
gardens – following a large number
of requests under the Freedom of
Information Act .
Scroll down for more ...
The ministry 's website shows that
in 2006 alone there were 97 reported
UFO sightings .
The alien peering through the
kitchen window was spotted by a
couple in Hastings .
Another witness reported hearing
a massive bang above Stamford Hill ,
North London , before two large fireballs
streaked away .
Sunderland had a silver pyramid
which rotated at low speed .
And a ' mothership with two
smaller orbs ' flying above Barlaston
in Staffordshire was spotted twice in
five days .
And moving into 2007 unidentified flying objects have caught the attention of hundreds of stargazers in Stratford , lighting up the otherwise clear night sky above Shakespeare 's birthplace two weeks ago .
Scroll down for more ...
In the previous year , 128 sightings
included an orange ball of light with
' spiderish legs ' and a ' black cigar - shaped
object that looked like a disc
side - on ' and flew ' faster than a
fighter jet ' .
A log of unidentified flying objects
has been kept by the MoD for
decades , with some cases investigated
for national security reasons .
Previously , it took 30 years for
classified records of UFO sightings
to be released , leaving enthusiasts
with a cold trail to follow up .
But details of every sighting
since 1998 were released just a
few months after this year 's 60th
anniversary of the alleged
alien crash - landing in Roswell , New
Mexico .
Robert Rosamond , chairman of
the British UFO Research Association ,
said : " These files give an
exciting insight into unexplained
phenomena – most interesting is
anything that is structured or has an
unusual shape .
" Around 98 per cent of cases can be
explained .
The remaining two per
cent keep us fascinated . "
Last year a former MoD chief
warned Britain could be attacked by
aliens at any time .
Nick Pope had just stepped down
as head of the government department 's
UFO project and complained
it had been ' virtually closed ' .
' Highly credible ' sightings were
often dismissed , he added , and
Britain was ' wide open to attack ' .
Some of the sightings can arguably
be explained by the descriptions
given by witnesses , such as ' triangle
shape that had lights on that looked
similar to a helicopter ' .
A large number also occur in
November and on December 31 –
when fireworks displays are held –
and after pub closing hours .
A spokesman for the Civil Aviation
Authority said : " Sometimes UFOs
are weather balloons , military jets ,
optical illusions .
But sometimes we
just do n't know what they are . "
However
astronomer Sir Patrick Moore ,
veteran presenter of The Sky At
Night , dismisses the chances of
aliens visiting Earth .
" There is no intelligent life in our
solar system , except possibly on
Earth – and I am not so sure about
that – so the chances of anyone seeing
an alien craft are extremely
light , " he said .
" To anyone who thinks they have
seen an alien craft I would say ,
' Have another look ' . "
Northrop Grumman to Provide U.S. Army With Additional Frequency Hopping Multiplexer Antenna Systems
CINCINNATI , Nov. 26 , 2007 ( PRIME NEWSWIRE ) -- Northrop Grumman Corporation ( NYSE : NOC ) has received a follow - on contract from U.S. Army Communications and Electronics Command to provide soldiers additional Frequency Hopping Multiplexers ( FHMUX ) antenna systems .
The primary function of the FHMUX is to reduce the number of antennas while providing RF isolation between multiple frequency hopping radios .
The FHMUX operates across the 30.000 to 87.975 MHz band and has the ability to combine up to four Single Channel Ground and Airborne Radio System ( SINCGARS ) transceivers in a single antenna .
The award , valued at $ 20 million , represents the fifth production delivery order and brings the total contract value to $ 90 million to Northrop Grumman 's Government Systems Division under this indefinite delivery , indefinite quantity contract , originally awarded in 2005 .
" The TD - 1456 / VRC FHMUX greatly reduces interference from other radios while reducing the visual target signature of the command and control platform , " said Martin Simoni , site director of Northrop Grumman 's Xetron facility .
" Simultaneous transmissions from antennas that are in close proximity to each other often result in self - jamming , greatly reducing the effective range of communications .
This phenomenon , sometimes referred to as Cosite interference , is mitigated with the use of the FHMUX that restores up to 90 percent of the range performance . "
Northrop Grumman will produce an additional 230 FHMUX systems and 1,005 spare assemblies , bringing the total awarded production quantities to 1,081 systems and 2,235 spare assemblies .
Work will be performed at the Northrop Grumman Xetron facility in Cincinnati .
Northrop Grumman Corporation is a $ 30 billion global defense and technology company whose 120,000 employees provide innovative systems , products , and solutions in information and services , electronics , aerospace and shipbuilding to government and commercial customers worldwide .

In college , I memorized 7 chapters of my psychology textbook — over 23,000 words .
Yes , I could actually recite the entire 7 chapters to anyone willing to listen .
Why did I do this ?
My professor had challenged me with two statements on the first day of class : 1 ) No student had ever aced his introductory exam ; and 2 ) all the answers could be found in the first 7 chapters of the textbook .
Determined to be the first student to ace his test , I memorized all 7 chapters .
If youâ€™re looking for a way to increase the capacity of your memory or pass a test , you donâ€™t need to memorize 23,000 words .
But the technique I used to memorize those chapters can be used to memorize anything .
Below is the simpler version of my system , developed to help my pupils pass history , psychology , and other information - heavy tests .
First , use a pencil or word processor ( I prefer the latter because itâ€™s faster ) to type , in complete sentences , any fact you think might appear on the test .
Use short sentences because they ’re easier to remember .
Take your printed notes into a quiet room , shut the door , and eliminate all distractions .
Look at the first sentence in your notes and read it out loud .
Then , close your eyes and say the sentence without looking at it .
Repeat the step above , this time with the first 2 sentences .
Next , try it with 3 sentences .
Then 4 . Repeat until you have memorized every sentence in your notes .
After a study session , take a quick nap .
New memories are very vulnerable , but studies have shown that sleep helps your new memories stick .
After your nap , repeat the memory technique once more for maximum retention .
I eventually became so good at this technique that I could complete all my studying for any information heavy mid-term or final exam in less than 6 hours .
Yes , I realize this sounds like a lot of time , but it ’s not much time at all – Â because this technique works from a cold start , even if you have n’t cracked the book all semester .
I ’m not saying you should ignore your classes until the last minute ( please do n’t — I rarely studied at the last minute myself ) , but it ’s good to know there is a way to save yourself if you do .
This technique worked remarkably well ; I graduated first in my class ( with this being one tool in my toolbelt — not the entire belt ) .
Â Â
If your academic goals are more modest than mine , you can get by with less studying and fewer notes .
Take breaks whenever fatigue sets in .
Eat a snack .
Have a glass of water .
It helps .
Does it Really Work ?
My memory technique is n’t the newest , the prettiest , or the most interesting technique on the market .
But it has worked for me , my students , and even my wife , who claims to have the “ worst memory in the world . ”
Let ’s be clear : Â Memorizing 23,000 words takes a long time , which is one reason why a pure stacking mechanism ( as described above ) Â can be greatly improved upon when you ’re dealing with numbers that big .
Â Â But remember , this Â technique is optimized Â to help you memorizeÂ 5 or 6 pages worth of notes , not 7 entire chapters .
Â Â Â Â Â
My best advice is to try it for yourself .
Â Â
When it comes to memorization , it ’s important to find a strategy that works for you , whether it ’s mine , someone else ’s , or your own .
What I like about my technique is its simplicity and the quickness with which you can test it on yourself .
By the way , I did become the first person to ever score a 100 % on my professor ’s introductory exam , just in case you were wondering .
Fred sez , " Brier Dudley from the Seattle Times has read the fine print on those DRM - free downloads from Amazon .
Looks like the ' user agreement ' strips you of your fair use rights and lets the record labels sue you for breach of contract if you cross the line . "
Amazon 's contract says you " may copy , store , transfer and burn the Digital Content " for personal use .
But then it goes further and specifies restrictions , saying you " agree that you will not redistribute , transmit , assign , sell , broadcast , rent , share , lend , modify , adapt , edit , sub - license or otherwise transfer or use the Digital Content . "
Oh , ffs .
All we want to do is buy MP3s , like we used to buy CDs and records and tapes .
Stuff we could make some claim to owning .
You'd think that a group of people as property - obsessed as the recording industry would understand the desire to own one 's music collection and have all the rights to it that copyright normally confers on those who buy copyrighted works — like the right to sell , edit .
adapt , loan , modify , etc .
All the stuff the law give law - abiding customers who buy stuff .
Oh well .
I had such hope for this one , too .

Intent on demonstrating progress in Iraq , the top U.S. general there is expected by Bush administration officials to recommend removing American troops soon from several areas where commanders believe security has improved , possibly including Al Anbar province .
According to the officials , Gen. David H. Petraeus is expected to propose the partial pullback in his September status report to Congress , when both the war ’s critics and supporters plan to reassess its course .
Administration officials who support the current troop levels hope Petraeus ’ recommendations will persuade Congress to reject pressure for a major U.S. withdrawal .
The expected recommendation would authorize U.S. commanders to withdraw troops from places that have become less violent and turn over security responsibilities to Iraqi forces .
But it does not necessarily follow that Petraeus would call for reducing the overall number of troops in the country .
Instead , he could move them to another hot spot , or use them to create a reserve force to counter any rise in violence .

“ That is the form of the recommendation we are anticipating him to come back with , ” a senior administration official said .
But referring to the redeployment options , the official added , “ I just do n’t know which of those categories he is going to be in . ”
Petraeus has not told the White House where he might recommend reductions .
But military commanders have indicated in recent briefings that Nineveh province in northern Iraq and its capital , Mosul , like Al Anbar in the west , could be an area from which it might be suitable for the U.S. to withdraw .
American commanders have found that pulling out too soon and leaving pacified areas to unprepared Iraqi troops can lead to a resurgence of militant activity .
In the north , where U.S. officials have reduced the number of combat troops , devastating bomb attacks Tuesday killed at least 175 people .
Tall Afar , a town about 40 miles west of Mosul that had been cited by President Bush as a key U.S. success , has seen a rise in violence since the spring after a period of stability .

Petraeus has been keeping a “ close hold ” on the recommendations he intends to deliver next month , according to a senior military officer in Baghdad .
But the officer said Petraeus wanted to ensure that any moves he made did not cause violence to flare up again .
“ He does n’t want to lose the gains we have made , ” said the military officer who , like others , spoke on condition of anonymity because the report is still being developed .
Some officials say they expect Petraeus to push for maintaining the current force level for at least six additional months to build upon security improvements in Baghdad .
U.S. force levels reached nearly 162,000 this month , an increase of about 30,000 from the beginning of the year , when the American military ’s troop buildup began .

Another Defense official , who has been part of Iraq planning but skeptical of the troop increase , said moving forces out of Al Anbar could make sense to the White House , because doing so would enable the administration to show that improved security translates into a reduction in troops .
Cutting the number of troops in Al Anbar would also eliminate the need to request more forces to secure areas around Baghdad , where the U.S. has been focusing much of its military effort .
“ If the Marines are having so much success in Al Anbar , maybe we redeploy them to some other hot spot , ” said the Defense official .
Administration officials have cited improved ties with Sunni Arab leaders in Al Anbar with helping reduce violence and curb the power of the insurgents .
Not all military commanders favor reducing the number of troops in more stable areas .
In a news conference last month , Marine Maj. Gen. Walter E. Gaskin , the commander of U.S. forces in Al Anbar , cautioned against cutting back forces there too quickly .

Gaskin argued that the added forces had allowed the Marines to eliminate havens used by the insurgent group that calls itself Al Qaeda in Iraq .
A “ persistent presence ” of U.S. forces , he said , would help give Iraqi security forces more experience and confidence , and the ability to keep militants out .
“ It takes time to gain experience , ” he said .
“ I see that experience happening every day , but I do n’t see it happening overnight .
I believe it ’s another couple of years in order to get them to do that -- and that ’s not a political answer , that ’s a military answer . ”
But division and brigade commanders in other parts of Iraq have said they anticipate recommending further reductions in the months to come .
Army Maj. Gen. Benjamin R. “ Randy ” Mixon , the American division commander for northern Iraq , said last month that he expected to cut the number of troops in his area , but emphasized that reductions should be made slowly .

The Army 1st Cavalry Division ’s 4th Brigade has moved soldiers out of combat roles in Mosul and other cities , and into assignments such as full - time advisors with Iraqi units .
Col. Stephen M. Twitty , the brigade commander , said in an interview before the bombings Tuesday that the U.S. combat force in Mosul had been reduced from the size of a division , or nearly 20,000 , to that of a battalion , typically about 1,000 .
The senior officer in Baghdad said the military was still debating whether Petraeus should make his detailed strategy recommendations to Congress in an open or closed session .
The officer said that though Petraeus would discuss his broad recommendation for adjusting operations , he would avoid detailed public discussion of where he intended to reposition specific brigades .

The officer said Petraeus would not go deeply into detail in an open session .
“ The future plan , how he thinks we can move forward , you really do not want to broadcast that to the world , ” he said .
Administration and military officials acknowledge that the September report will not show any significant progress on the political benchmarks laid out by Congress .
How to deal in the report with the lack of national reconciliation between Iraq ’s warring sects has created some tension within the White House .
Despite Bush ’s repeated statements that the report will reflect evaluations by Petraeus and Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador to Iraq , administration officials said it would actually be written by the White House , with inputs from officials throughout the government .

And though Petraeus and Crocker will present their recommendations on Capitol Hill , legislation passed by Congress leaves it to the president to decide how to interpret the report ’s data .
The senior administration official said the process had created “ uncomfortable positions ” for the White House because of debates over what constitutes “ satisfactory progress . ”
During internal White House discussion of a July interim report , some officials urged the administration to claim progress in policy areas such as legislation to divvy up Iraq ’s oil revenue , even though no final agreement had been reached .
Others argued that such assertions would be disingenuous .
“ There were some in the drafting of the report that said , ‘ Well , we can claim progress , ’ ” the administration official said .
“ There were others who said : ‘ Wait a second .
Sure we can claim progress , but it ’s not credible to . . . just neglect the fact that it ’s had no effect on the ground . ’ ”

The Defense official skeptical of the troop buildup said he expected Petraeus to emphasize military accomplishments , including improving security in Baghdad neighborhoods and a slight reduction in the number of suicide bomb attacks .
But the official said he did not believe such security improvements would translate into political progress or improvements in the daily lives of most Iraqis .
“ Who cares how many neighborhoods of Baghdad are secured ? ” the official said .
“ Let ’s talk about the rest of the country : How come they have electricity twice a day , how come there is no running water ? ”

Anti-evolution movie is deceptive by design
Guest Post by Morbo
Last week I wrote about actor Ben Stein ’s new documentary attacking evolution titled “ Expelled : No Intelligence Allowed . ”
It now appears that Stein and the group that produced the film may have employed deceptive tactics to trick evolution proponents into appearing on camera .
Three noted evolution supporters came forward this week to say they were misled .
Among them is Richard Dawkins , the famous zoologist and author from Oxford University .
Dawkins told The New York Times he was approached by a group called Rampant Films inviting him to appear in a documentary called “ Crossroads . ”
The names sound benign , and no indication was given that the production would criticize evolution .
Dawkins said he would not have agreed to appear in the movie had he known it was a front for “ intelligent design . ”
Two other scientists interviewed by Stein ’s crew — Genie Scott at the National Center for Science Education and P.Z. Myers , a biologist at the University of Minnesota — say they would have appeared on camera anyway but would have appreciated knowing upfront that the producers were ID backers .
It might have affected the type of answers they gave .
Stein insists he has done nothing wrong , but it seems to me he and his friends have a problem with honesty .
In light of that , simple integrity calls on him to do two things : First , remove Dawkins from the documentary entirely .
Then re-interview Scott and Myers , giving them the opportunity to provide more pointed answers .
Will Stein have the fundamental decency to do this ?
I ’m not holding my breath .
A couple of more thoughts on this : Religious moderates often wonder why some advocates of evolution get so worked up over intelligent design .
After all , ID rejects the more outlandish claims of traditional creationism ( young Earth , literal worldwide flood , etc. ) and merely asserts that God must have been involved in the creation of the universe .
What ’s the big deal ?
A clue is found in the Times story .
Stein told the paper “ he accepted the producers ’ invitation to participate in the film not because he disavows the theory of evolution — he said there was a ‘ very high likelihood ’ that Darwin was on to something — but because he does not accept that evolution alone can explain life on earth .
He said he also believed the theory of evolution leads to racism and ultimately genocide , an idea common among creationist thinkers .
If it were up to him , he said , the film would be called ‘ From Darwin to Hitler . ' ”
So , a scientific principle that maintains that humankind has a common origin ( from southern Africa , no less ) and that underscores the fact that we ’re all related ( thus meaning that distinctions of race , class , religion and tribe are all equally meaningless ) leads to racism and genocide ?
If Stein really believes this , he is a moron , and such idiotic views must be kept far away from our classrooms .
Finally , kudos to Cornelia Dean , the author of The Times story .
She wrote in part :
There is no credible scientific challenge to the theory of evolution as an explanation for the complexity and diversity of life on earth .
And while individual scientists may embrace religious faith , the scientific enterprise looks to nature to answer questions about nature .
As scientists at Iowa State University put it last year , supernatural explanations are “ not within the scope or abilities of science . ”
At long last — a journalist who understands that “ balance ” does not require that discredited , pseudoscientific nonsense must be treated the same as actual science .

The auction starting price of the stories is £ 30,000
JK Rowling interview
There will be just seven volumes of The Tales of Beedle the Bard and they will not be published .
One copy will be auctioned to raise money for her charity , The Children 's Voice , and the author will give away the rest of them .
She said the books were a " wonderful way " to say goodbye to Potter .
" People kept saying to me ' you 'll be glad to have a break from writing ' , when of course I was n't taking a break at all , " added the writer .
Handwritten books
" I was literally writing out - as these are handwritten books - these new stories which has been a wonderful way to say goodbye .
It 's like coming up from a deep dive . "
The fairytales , which were illustrated by Rowling herself , are the first works she has written since the Potter novel was published in July .
The Tales of Beedle the Bard was given to Potter character Hermione by Hogwarts school headmaster Dumbledore .
The seven books are all handwritten by the author
In a recent US book tour , the author revealed that Dumbledore was gay .
Rowling said she had always seen him as gay in her mind .
" No - one ever asked me had he ever been in love or fallen in love .
People were very focussed on what happens to Harry so I had never been asked a direct question .
" And because to answer it would immediately flag up an infatuation with what happens in book seven , I never said it . "
The new book will be auctioned at Sotheby 's in London on 13 December with a starting price of £ 30,000 , although it is expected to sell for a lot more .
Harry Potter book sales already stood at 325 million copies even before the seventh novel came out - it broke records on both sides of the Atlantic by selling 11 million copies in 24 hours .
It was published simultaneously in more than 90 countries .
Legal action
JK Rowling and the makers of the Harry Potter films , Warner Bros , are suing a US publisher over its plans to release a book version of a popular website dedicated to the boy wizard .
The legal action claims that RDR Books will infringe on Rowling 's intellectual property rights if it publishes the 400 - page Harry Potter Lexicon .
It adds that this would interfere with her plans to write her own definitive Harry Potter encyclopaedia .
RDR Books publisher Roger Rapoport said the suit dismayed him and dismissed any notion it could compete with any official encyclopaedia written by Rowling .
Seventeen pounds of beef , a big bag of flour , two pounds of cheese , one pound of bacon , a giant onion , portabella mushrooms , avocados , tomatoes , lettuce , mustard , ketchup , and pickles came together with fire and friends and some specially constructed cooking tools one day in June .
Berto borrowed a big round fire box .
Mike brought some grills and a thermocouple for monitoring the temperature within the burger .
I found some scrap sheet steel in the garage and welded together a big round lid to cover the grill .
I also made a turn - over fixture for flipping the burger and a steel ring to surround one of my big pizza pans to contain the creeping mass of dough while it rose in my oven .
The buns barely fit and had to be baked separately ; I sliced the top crust off one loaf to make the lower bun and took the bottom crust off a second loaf to make the upper bun .
We worked crushed garlic and barbecue sauce and egg into the beef , then grilled it slowly till cooked through .
On the gas grill we browned the onion slices and added them to the burger with the bacon and lots of cheese , which melted and fused the toppings into a wonderful medley of flavors .
When at last the top bun had been set in place and a giant toothpick was speared through the center , we took the monster to our specially constructed balance :
I bolted a sturdy hook to the ceiling in my apartment and hung a 2x4 timber from it , balancing a suspended wooden shelf hung at one end with iron from Sean 's weight bench hung at the other end .
Knowing the weights and measuring their position , we accurately measured the uncooked beef pattie ( 17 pounds ) and the collosal finished hamburger : 29.75 pounds !
That was one giant sandwich !
Then came the eating , and more eating , ... and more eating .
The room got quiet , people started to fall asleep , and just for a moment the world seemed absolutely perfect .
" I believe the effort to try and make marijuana available for medical uses is really a way to legalize it .
There 's no reason for it , " the former New York mayor said during a town hall - style meeting at New Hampshire Technical Institute .
He also said there are better alternatives .
" You can accomplish everything you want to accomplish with things other than marijuana , probably better .
There are pain medications much superior to marijuana , " he said . [ AP ]
Rudy Giuliani has again lashed out at medical marijuana on the campaign trail : I 've already written about the potent irony of Giuliani 's opposition to medical marijuana , but if he wo n’t shut up about this , neither will I .
If Rudy Giuliani wo n't stop talking trash about medical marijuana , and endorsing pharmaceutical alternatives , I wo n’t stop bringing up the fact that he worked as a hired consultant for OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma .
Giuliani has less than no credibility on this issue because he worked for a company that is in direct competition with medical marijuana .
It 's really that simple .
His claims that medical marijuana is part of a broader legalization conspiracy are also ironic considering that Giuliani played a key role in keeping OxyContin legal after it was linked with widespread abuse .
Giuliani personally met with former DEA administrator Asa Hutchinson and persuaded him to leave Purdue alone .
Meanwhile , abuse of pharmaceutical drugs , particularly OxyContin , has become the fastest growing drug problem among America 's youth .
To be clear , I do n't believe OxyContin should be illegal .
Patients must be allowed to choose medicines based on what works for them , whether it be OxyContin , medical marijuana , or tree bark .
But the transparent hypocrisy of Giuliani 's behavior is so over - the - top that it is just impossible to ignore .

There can not be many artists who have swallowed their own works by mistake .
Then again , there cannot be many artists who can cheerfully put a six - figure price on something the size of the full stop at the end of this sentence .
" Take a look at this .
It will blow you away , " says Willard Wigan .
It is an ordinary sewing needle stuck to a piece of Blu - Tac in a plastic box .
It is not blowing me anywhere .
Willard chuckles and leads me upstairs to the cluttered spare bedroom of his little house .
Scroll down for more
A powerful electric microscope sits amid the rubbish on a small paint - splattered desk .
He sticks the eye of the needle under the microscope and then invites me to sit down .
What appears through the lens does , indeed , leave me gasping .
" People often swear the first time they see my work .
I like that , " says Willard proudly .
This is certainly worth a string of exclamations .
Because there , in incredible detail , is a hand - painted micro-sculpture of the Mad Hatter 's Tea Party from Alice In Wonderland - right down to the sleeping dormouse and the card in the Mad Hatter 's hat .
I can even read the price tag in the label - ten shillings and sixpence ( the actual price of this work , by the way , is £ 160,000 ) .
And yet , when I do n't use the microscope and , instead , look at the piece with my own eyes , I can detect nothing more than a speck of dust wedged in the eye of the needle .
This speck , though , took more than three months to make it .
Willard Wigan is the world 's pre- eminent micro-artist .
He is an exceptional master craftsman .
Now 50 , he may have spent most of his life dismissed as an illiterate failure but he has a unique gift which , surely , constitutes artistic genius .

Little wonder that when he received his MBE for services to art at Buckingham Palace six weeks ago , the Prince of Wales told Willard that his work was ' phenomenal ' .
Visitors to his forthcoming exhibition will , doubtless , agree .
As I try to get my head around the scale of the shrunken tea party , I ask Willard to provide a reference point , some sort of perspective to help me comprehend the smallness of this work .
He suggests a match and we delicately slide the little pink head of an ordinary matchstick alongside the tea party .
It 's like plonking a big red whale under the lens .
To get a closer comparison , we slip a fragment of a Daily Mail article into position .
The whole sculpture , it transpires , is a little smaller than a full stop .
The writing on the Mad Hatter 's label cannot , therefore , be much larger than some bacteria .
Willard explains that it was painted on using a hair from a dead fly .
He makes most of his models from zip tie , the plastic tags you find on clothes ' labels , and he does his sculpting with tiny diamond shards glued to the end of an acupuncture needle .
Scroll down for more
He chops me off a sliver of zip tie which looks no bigger than a grain of sand and puts it under the microscope .
I try to cut it but it just pings off into oblivion .
Willard explains that he meditates to lower his pulse rate and , even then , he only uses his home - made scalpel between heartbeats .
No wonder he has had some bizarre accidents .
" One of the worst moments was recently when I inhaled Alice , " he recalls .
" I was just putting her in position when I breathed in at the wrong moment and she disappeared .
That was nearly a month 's work gone . "
Almost as infuriating was the night when he had just finished attaching a tightrope walker the size of a breadcrumb to a tiny strand of a money spider 's web .
" This fly came buzzing down past the lens and the gust from its wings blew the chap off his tightrope . "
I have never come across anything quite like the Lilliputian world of Willard Wigan .
Here is a big man - at least 6ft tall - who spends much of his life locked away in a tiny world beyond the normal scope of the human eye .
And yet he does n't wear glasses .
He hates the process of what he does - " it drives you mad ; it makes you cry with frustration " - but he loves the reactions which his work inspires .
Untrained , his techniques have led to invitations from micro-surgeons to compare notes ( still haunted by his lack of learning , he has declined ) .
And for all his creative success , he is not part of any tiresome , self - regarding wing of the contemporary art movement .
He is just Willard from Brum .
Now , after many years of obscurity and ridicule , life has suddenly taken off for this micro Michelangelo .
Just four months ago , Willard sold the bulk of his collection for a substantial sum to David Lloyd , the tennis playerturnedgym entrepreneur .
The price remains a secret , but Lloyd has insured the 70 pieces in the collection for more than £ 11 million and is now Willard 's manager .
Further excitement followed in July when Willard received his MBE at the Palace - " same day as Rod Stewart was there , " he says proudly .
" Meeting Prince Charles changed my life .
I 've always liked him , but when he told me my work was ' phenomenal ' , it was as if I had been suffocating all my life and now , all of a sudden , I could breathe .
" When you 've grown up with everyone saying you 're a failure , a moment like that means everything . "
His run of luck held firm and a few weeks later , as reported in the Mail , he was reunited with some long - lost favourites .
Six years ago , at a small London exhibition , someone stole three of Willard 's finest eye- of - a - needle pieces : the Tower of London , Jesus , and Snow White and the Seven Dwarves .
" The police cracked a terrible joke about " looking for a needle in a haystack " and I thought I 'd never see them again , " he says .
Then , last month , a member of the public made contact to say that he had found the missing pieces at a Swindon car boot sale and they were duly returned ( although Snow White had lost four of her dwarves ) .
On Thursday , a free exhibition of Willard 's work opens at London 's Eyestorm gallery , next door to Tate Modern , with a European tour to follow .
Meanwhile , two film companies are lining up to bring his life story to the big screen .
So , before Willard disappears to Hollywood or some fancy tax haven , I want to meet the man himself and to look around the art world 's tiniest studio .

Arriving at his rented Birmingham digs , though , no one would accuse him of letting fame go to his head .
" Sorry about the mess , " he says , as he steers me past the small kitchen to the other downstairs room .
" Have a seat , er , there . "
The room is filled with bits of remote - controlled helicopters .
" Look at this , " he says and a toy chopper that could take out your eye starts buzzing round the room .
He switches consoles and fires up his latest gadget , a remote - controlled dragonfly , which takes off and promptly crashes into the wall .
" There is a child in all of us , " he tells me as he puts down his toys and turns to the story of his life .
" I always say that failure was my friend , " he says with pride rather than self - pity .
" I learned nothing at school , so I just lived in my own world . "
Willard 's parents left Jamaica in the Fifties for jobs in Birmingham where they raised ten children .
An undiagnosed dyslexic , he always struggled at school and says that his teachers singled him out for mockery .
" It was n't easy being black and not being able to read or write in Birmingham in the Sixties .
But the racism did n't bother me so much .
You do n't sense it so much when you 're a kid . "
Skiving off from school one day , he was hiding in the family shed when he became fascinated by the antics of some ants .
" My mum encouraged me to make a little house for them , using little splinters and bits of plastic , " he recalls .
" It went from an ant house to a whole ant estate .
I do n't think the ants were that grateful because I had to lure them in with grains of sugar . "
At the same time , he was discovering a talent for sculpting , not that he let anyone know .
" I did n't show them what I could do at school do because I did n't want them to make fun of me , " he says .
" I just used to sit there testing my patience , balancing a ball bearing on my finger for three hours , that sort of thing .
" And when I got home , I 'd spend hours carving film characters such as Oliver Twist on a cocktail stick . "
After leaving school , Willard worked in a factory , while sculpting pieces of all sizes in private .
But his capacity for stillness led to a new career : in the Eighties he became a shop dummy for a local branch of Topshop .
" I could stand still for hours and then dance , " ' he says , suddenly launching into a robotic mime routine which would give a professional mime artist a run for his money .
Did he ever think of drama or dance school ?
" Never .
I could n't go to any place where I would have to read or write .
I used to carry round a bandage to put over my hand if I had to fill in a form . "
Aged 35 , he spotted an empty unit in a Birmingham shopping centre and asked the manager if he could use it to work on a large lump of wood .
Over the next few weeks , gawped at by passers - by , he carved a striking bust of William Shakespeare ( " I could n't read his stuff but I 'd seen pictures of him " ) .
A man offered him £ 500 for the piece and a reporter from the local paper came to write up this quirky story .
" We were talking about my work and then I showed him some of the small stuff I 'd done - a ballerina on a pinhead , Prince Charles on a cocktail stick , that kind of stuff .
It just blew him away . "
Word spread and , in due course , Willard started earning a respectable sum .
The wider world started to take notice .
While exhibiting in Bath , he won a new admirer in the Marquess of Bath , owner of Longleat .
" I like the Marquess a lot - he 's like Father Christmas - and I did a sculpture of him .
He said to me : " I may be a lord but I 'm a totally different kind of lord . "
" I can relate to that .
He even introduced me to some of his wifelets . "
While Willard was not actively selling his work , the offers kept rising - from four figures to five .
A few years ago , someone offered him £ 18,000 for what he still regards as the toughest piece he has made - a string quartet , sitting on a pinhead , with real strings made from a spider 's web .
At the same time , he accepted a bid of £ 17,000 for his Statue of Liberty in the eye of a needle .
Pieces like that are now worth ten times more .
His subjects range from the classical - Rodin's Thinker sitting on a pin - to the contemporary - Oprah Winfrey in the eye of a needle and the Beckham family carved on a single cocktail stick .
His tiniest piece to date is a Scottish terrier standing on the point of an acupuncture needle ; while his next project is to create a Little Red Riding Hood so small she could be gobbled up not just by a wolf but by a flea .
Money , Willard , insists , is not a driving force .
He has a girlfriend - " she 's always trying to tidy up the place " ( no vacuuming , one hopes ) - but lives alone and has few expensive tastes beyond remote - controlled helicopters .
He says he is not even interested in flying a real helicopter .
Home , for now at least , is this rented two - up , two - down in a West Midlands cul - de- sac , plus a room in Jersey which he borrows when he wants to get away from everything .
" I do own some property somewhere and the people who manage my money are renting it out , " he says , already bored by the subject .
" What I want is for people to appreciate what I do , to enjoy it and say : ' Wow ! ' . "
As I leave , he says earnestly : " It 's very nice of you to take an interest in my work , it really is .
Do you really like it ? "
For all his success , there is still something of that lonely , troubled schoolboy , hiding away with his ants and his toothpicks , craving appreciation from somewhere .
Well , he certainly has it now and he deserves every last penny .
So what is Willard 's ultimate ambition ?
" One day , I am going to do the Queen in her Coronation Coach with all the horses , too . "
And why not ?
If you 're going to think small , then think big .
I sometimes take a bit of guff from other uISVs for not using a “ real ” payment processor .
Some folks believe Google Checkout / Paypal are “ unprofessional ” or “ hobbyist ” .
I respect that opinion .
However , if the recent events at SWREG are any indication , I ’ll wear that amateur label proudly .
They recently introduced a new upsell item in shopping carts of the uISVs they serve , and its one that makes one recall the many alternate definitions of the word professional .
Andy Brice has got the story covered and the BoS forums are buzzing about it , but in brief , SWREG has placed a button labeled Continue after the last page after the checkout funnel .
If you click the button , you will be billed $ 9 a month to your credit card , silently , until you figure out who the heck is billing you and try to cancel .
This is orchestrated by an outfit called Reservation Rewards aka WebLoyalty.com aka TravelValuePlus aka BuyersAssurance.com aka AnyoneWithSixDBAsIsTryingToScamYou.com .
Theoretically , they send you coupons in return for your $ 9 a month .
Many , many folks report never getting the coupons , never receiving a single of the multiple emails they steadfastly claim to send , and never having done the double opt - in gymnastics that they claim isolates people from getting locked into their service without wanting to be .
See , here ’s the rub .
There is a nice feature of the Internet that folks learn early : if you do n’t give your credit card details to someone , they ca n’t bill you .
Entering your credit card details is a signal both of major trust and of the fact that you understand that , absent you taking some action , you ’re about to authorize forking over some money .
WebScamInc could never get “ millions of satisfied customers ” to authorize the $ 9 for nothing purchase with their lack of service , so they piggyback on the trust the customer has in you .
And THAT , more than anything else , is what burns my biscuit about this .
It is bad enough that a business would abuse their own customers enough to facilitate theft by fraud from them , and some large businesses did this quite often in the Wild West days of the Internet .
What makes it particularly galling , though , is that a customer at SWREG is not SWREG ’s customer — he ’s the customer of some uISV somewhere who stays up nights toiling away writing emails , polishing web copy , and smashing bugs to earn the trust of people he has never met over the Internet .
And what does the customer get for being foolish enough to trust him ?
He gets stabbed in the back by someone whose only purpose in life is to be a convenient CGI interface to a merchant account .
Oh , but it gets better .
Over at Andy ’s blog , Jessy from SWREG has this explanation of why they allowed a scammer to take up residence on their service .
Its… well … here , read it .
Hello ,
The offering is a perks offering for customers .
In no way are they tricked into using this , and it is clearly disclosed what they are signing up for .
The signup page looks nothing like the order form or SWREG clearly differentiating it from the product purchase .
Customers are also very easily able to cancel the perk offering at any time .
They can choose to pay the fee and receive great discounts at very popular , well - known brands / stores within their country .
SWREG has made this optional for our clients .
These are offerings used at Amazon and EBay , nothing new or out of the ordinary for customers .
If you have any questions please do n’t hesitate to contact me .
Thanks , Jessy ( Email address omitted by me . )
This is willfully obtuse .
Yes , if you read every word on the SWREG order page , you will indeed realize that the 8pt font says you are submitting your data to a third party and authorizing them to debit your credit card .
The 24 point font on the blue button , however , says “ Yes . Click here now ” .
And SWREG , as an e-commerce merchant , should darn well better know that Internet pages are not made to be read .
They are made to be scanned — readers evaluate , in a period of seconds , whether or not anything on the page has interest to them and then they drill down into that content , either by reading it or interacting with their interface .
A large block of small text font on a web page , placed against a blue button with a strong call to action , is n’t asking to be read .
Its asking to be missed .
It is exactly where any web site designer worth their salt would say “ You know , if I put that in CrazyEgg or did a real heat map study , that area would be a deep blue dead zone .
I sure hope the content writers do n’t put anything important there . ”
There is also the context to consider .
This is important — if you are in the middle of a transaction , and you have already gotten over the mental “ Give this vendor [ i.e. the uISV ] money ” barrier , then everything from the start of the funnel to the end of the funnel reads Click next to continue .
If that button had said , in 48 point font , “ Click here to format C : \ ” I still could have gotten 5 % conversion with it !
Its like putting something on the second to last page of an installer — we all know that nobody reads anything , they just mindlessly click next until the application pops up or they are dumped to their desktop because our industry has trained them for decades that nothing they are about to see is important .
That is why , when we design web applications , we put destructive actions behind popup confirmations , and we put really destructive actions behind things which are designed to jar the user out of their GUI induced fugue , like “ Type d- e - l - e - t - e to drop the database ” .
Spending money is customarily put behind a similar speedbump , entering credit card details , and this scam is designed precisely to circumvent that safety valve .
Oh , but spending money is n’t necessarily destructive , as Jess points out .
Maybe folks like the discounts they ’re getting at a wide variety of establishments in their country , for the low , low price of $ 9 a month .
Tell me , do the one thousand , nine hundred , and seventeen customers who commented on just one of the “ Reservation Rewards is a scam ” thread sound like they are satisfied customers happy to have received discounts ?
Lets review a couple of these comments , shall we ?

wow i cant belive this i just noticed these same charges on my account and only noticed because it made me overdraft in my debit account .
i called the bank and they told me that it has been going on since july thats $ 54 that they have talken with out me knowing i have no idea where they got the info tho i always shop through paypal but makbe that is the problem all i know is that this needs to be stopped it is wrong .
Matt said
Thanks for putting this up .
I just got off the phone with these guys .
They claimed they “ were making an exception to the rules ” when they refunded 4 months worth of charges to me .
I asked where they got my CC # and they claimed it was from ebgames.com , a site I sometimes buy stuff from .
I ’m filing a complaint with the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection and will be taking the issue up with ebgames.com customer service and perhaps the Pennsylvania Bureau of Consumer Protection if that does n’t work out well .
( You can feel free to add this to the SWREG defense : Well , if Reservations Rewards is good enough to scam ebgames ’ customers , then it is good enough to scam ours ! )

I am currently serving in Iraq , have been for 4 months , and noticed that I have been recieving charges from WLI for $ 7 ( am I a lucky one to get off so cheap ? ) .
I have gone to their webpage with an unloaded weapon — you see , you have a logon & password to see “ your ” account information .
Beings I did not know I was a member , needless to say I do not have that info .
So I e-mailed them my name as it appears on my credit card , told them to cease , desist & refund …..
Hoping for the best .
You know what lack of capital letters , fractured syntax , and a certain lack of savvy about e-commerce reminds me of ?
Oh , yeah , a significant portion of my customers .
( Even English teachers “ let their hair down ” when they are writing emails , sometimes . )
Unlike any significant portion of my customers , these folks are howling for blood .
And if you ’re using SWREG , they are howling for your blood , because despite the fact that you are the little minnow and SWREG is the multi-million dollar corporation to the extent that anyone realizes you are in fact separate entities ( and most do n’t ) the presence of SWREG ’s website wrapped within a mere portion of your own makes it look like they ’re working for you .
And , hey , with them getting a sliver of the transaction , that is what the relationship really is .
Which is the problem from SWREG ’s point of view .
They ca n’t increase their cut of the transaction size , or you will flee to one of their competitors , or decide to go to e-junkie / Paypal .
You can get a customer to purchase from you multiple times to increase your revenue , but that is only an option for SWREG to the extent that you stay one of their vendors .
So they are constantly on the lookout for new revenue streams , and both aggressive cross-selling to your customers and selling them down the river to scumbuckets.com are apparently options on the table .
So , what to do about it ?
Well , if you ’re not a customer of SWREG , great .
Celebrate your good fortune … and give your e-commerce provider a jaundiced look and a quick assessment of whether they would ever stab your customers in the back .
If they would , make preparations for your inevitable separation as soon as that provider makes the decision that your future loyalty is worth less than the amount they can extract out of your customers today .
I came very close to giving Google Checkout the boot once , on Earth Day .
They proposed to cross -sell my customers into a $ 10 carbon offset .
It was n’t nearly this scummy — the carbon offset was clearly marketed as a separate item , it would have required another separate checkout process to buy , and of course the only reason you would actually click on a button saying Click Here To Buy a $ 10 carbon offset is if you wanted to actually buy an indulgence offset .
Google ’s saving grace was that they realized this was going to be controversial and offered me an opt - out .
( It really should have been an opt -in .
I have no strong opinions either way on begging for alms soliciting charitable contributions but impair your customers ’ experience to do it , not mine .
I do n’t see any “ Thanks for searching for flapjack recipes on Google .
While you ’re here , interested in buying a carbon offset ? ” cluttering up your famously minimalist interface . )
And if you are a SWREG customer ?
I think Tom Rath on the BoS boards said it best :
Now I need to spend the next few days alerting my customers of this con , apologizing profusely to those who found themselves roped into it , and write cheques to cover whatever expenses have been incurred by those foolish enough to trust my company ’s judgment .
I do n’t know what Tom Rath sells off the top of my head , but whatever it is , that paragraph makes me want to buy one on general principle .
Those are the words of a man you can trust .
That is the tone that we strive to strike as little honest fish in a stormy ocean filled with unscrupulous sharks trying to take a bite off of anyone doing business on the Internet .
And SWREG ?
Well , suffice it to say that the W in the name is looking like a dorsal fin to me at the moment .
Duh duh , duh duh , duh duh duh duh duh duh …

NEW YORK -- Al Capone served six years at Alcatraz - - for tax evasion .
The true Original Gangsta was never held to account for the St. Valentine 's Day Massacre that left seven men cut in half by machine gun fire .
Or the two disloyal wiseguys he ordered beaten to death with baseball bats .
Or the corruption and mayhem his gangsters inflicted during the years he terrorized Chicago .
Eliot Ness was cute , but the justice system failed .
Capone won in the end .
Like Capone , Alberto Gonzales has gone down for a mere misdemeanor : firing U.S. attorneys for investigating Republican politicians .
What led to his resignation as attorney general was his smearing them as incompetent .
Hell hath no fury as a man fired without a positive recommendation .
( Gonzales , a buffoon on his best day , perjured himself in spectacularly inept style in testimony about domestic wiretapping before Congress -- an outfit that has forgotten more about lying than lesser lights will ever know . )
Gonzales ' crime was a doozy :
He created the legal framework for American fascism .
No punishment could suffice for America 's Eichmann , author of infamous pseudolegal rationales for torture and the end of habeas corpus .
And none will he face .
" Fredo " ( Bush 's nickname for him ) quit over a procedural personnel matter .
If he ultimately faces justice , it will be for mere perjury .
Even his critics do n't care about his monstrous role as the legal architect of our post - 9/11 gulags -- proof positive that the master corrupter of democracy has triumphed , that we Americans are not a decent people .
" Are we being forward - leaning enough ? "
Gonzales used to ask his colleagues .
" Forward - leaning " was Bush Administration jargon for toughness in the war on terror .
It did n't mean bending the rules .
The Bushies were radicals .
Trashing centuries - old constitutional protections -- the right to an attorney , to face your accuser in a court of law , not to be tortured - - was n't enough for our suburban Robespierres .
They longed for an American Rome ruled by a harsh , omnipotent emperor over legions of troops standing ready to destroy all who challenged them , foreigners and Americans alike .
They said 9/11 had changed everything .
The new order required new laws .
One of the first steps down the road to perdition was a January 25 , 2002 legal memorandum advising Bush to deny legal rights to Afghan POWs .
" There are reasonable grounds for you to conclude that [ the Geneva P.O.W. Convention ] does not apply ... to the conflict with the Taliban , " wrote Gonzales , then working as White House counsel .
Deploying his characteristic blend of ignorance , arrogance and illogic , he called the Geneva Conventions -- which have saved the lives of thousands of captured American soldiers --" quaint . "
He then argued " that the Taliban and its forces were , in fact , not a government but a militant , terrorist - like group . "
Actually , the Clinton and Bush Administrations had treated the Taliban regime as a government , negotiating with its leaders over oil - pipeline transit fees and subsidizing it with millions of U.S. taxdollars .
U.S. allies , including Saudi Arabia and Pakistan , had embassies in Kabul .
History was collateral damage in the war of terror .
Having denied captured Afghan soldiers POW status --" detainees , " newspapers began calling them -- the Bush Administration looked for " forward - leaning " ways to abuse them .
Children as young as 12 were beaten , shipped in shackles , their heads shaved and covered with gunny sacks , to GuantÃ¡namo Bay .
Years have passed ; they 've grown up in Camp Delta .
These kids -- rural conscripts who could n't have attacked the U.S. even if they 'd thought of it -- still have n't been allowed to see a lawyer or their parents .
Worried that the American people might someday return to its senses and prosecute them for their monstrous crimes against humanity , the Bushies again turned to their affirmative - action poster child -- this time for a C.Y.A. memo validating torture .
The CIA wanted permission to use six " pressure techniques " against prisoners .
Mock burial , Gonzales and his legal staff thought , was a mite " too harsh . "
The medieval practice of waterboarding , on the other hand , was OK .
Another practice , " open - handed slapping of suspects , drew much discussion , " reported Newsweek .
The idea was " just to shock someone with the physical impact , " one of Gonzales ' staffers said , with " little chance of bone damage or tissue damage . "
Gonzales approved it .
The discussion resulted in an August 1 , 2002 memo to Gonzales , which he passed on to Bush .
The CIA and U.S. soldiers were free to subject prisoners to " cruel , inhuman or degrading " treatment .
All they needed was permission from the Emperor .
" Those committing torture with express presidential authority , " The Washington Post reported about the memo , " were probably immune from prosecution . "
Abu Ghraib followed .
Slippery slopes are usually cited as cautionary tales .
Gonzales saw post - 9/11 fear as an opportunity to be exploited .
He pushed for the USA Patriot Act.
Foreign detainees , he decided , would get military kangaroo courts .
Using Gonzales ' advice as back - up , Bush signed an executive order authorizing himself to declare any U.S. citizen an " enemy combatant " and have him assassinated .
Next came the terrifying Military Commissions
Act , which allows a president to declare martial law , seize control of the National Guard from the states , and throw U.S. citizens into concentration camps for the rest of their lives .
But no one objected to any of these attacks on our freedom .
Not the news media .
Not the Democrats -- they voted for them .
After Torturer - in - Chief Gonzales announced his departure , Ted Kennedy slammed him -- for perjury .
" He has exhibited a lack of candor with Congress and the American people and a disdain for the rule of law and our constitutional system , " said the liberal stalwart .
" The rampant politicization of federal law enforcement that occurred under his tenure seriously eroded public confidence in our justice system , " added House speaker Nancy Pelosi , focusing , like everybody else , on the fired U.S. attorneys .
The word " torture " did n't come up .
Gonzales will be remembered as corrupt and intellectually deficient .
Nevertheless , his legal legacy will likely remain in place for the foreseeable future .
Torture is n't in the news because it is n't news .
It 's normal .
The monster dragged the rest of us down to his level .
We are all Alberto Gonzales .

James Watson , Black Intelligence , and New Research by Fryer and Levitt
Nobel Laureate James
Watson got into trouble recently for expressing the opinion that blacks are less intelligent than whites .
If you look at almost all existing data from standardized tests in the United States , there is indeed a sizable black - white test score gap .
Whether the gap is due to genetic differences is a hotly debated academic question .
Roland Fryer and I have done some research on this topic which we think is potentially quite interesting and important — although we seem to be the only ones with this opinion at present .
( The paper was rejected yesterday by the American Economic Review on the second round of review , and a search of Google Scholar reveals only two citations to the working paper version released in early 2006 . )
In my work with Fryer , we analyzed a newly available nationally representative survey of children ages two and under , done by the Department of Education .
Included in this study are tests of mental ability around a child ’s first birthday .
While you might think it would be impossible to capture anything meaningful at such a young age , it turns out that these measures of one - year - olds ’ intelligence are somewhat highly correlated with IQ scores at later ages , as well as with parental IQ scores .
The striking result we find is that there are no racial differences in mental functioning at age one , although a racial gap begins to emerge over the next few years of life .
So what does this mean for the genetics vs. environment debate ?
Quoting from our abstract , “ the observed patterns are broadly consistent with large racial differences in environmental factors that grow in importance as children age .
Our findings are not consistent with the simplest models of large genetic differences across races in intelligence , although we cannot rule out the possibility that intelligence has multiple dimensions and racial differences are present only in those dimensions that emerge later in life . ”
Like all research , our study has its flaws and limitations .
I have to say , however , that I imagined a lot of reactions to this paper , none of which were utter indifference on the part of academics and the popular press .
But that was the reaction we got .

The - - no - gc is to deal with ( hopefully fixed ) bugs in parrot .
Unfortunately lua.pbc fails immediately without this option .
I 'll be happy to rerun the benchmarks whenever that problem is fixed .

Ok , I reran all benchmarks with at least 10 seconds runtime for Parrot .
This should be enough for a meaningful test .
I mean ...
LuaJIT is able to JIT - compile these trivial benchmarks in less than a millisecond ( yes , no typo ) .
So here 's the complete benchmark table .
Note that this is only intended for comparing Parrot with Lua / LuaJIT .
It 's not so useful for comparing Lua with LuaJIT because of the short runtimes .
I had to scale them down that much to get them to run with Parrot .

With the price of crude oil all but assured of topping $ 100 a barrel after a quick succession of all - time highs , the future of alternative energy has never looked better .
As Wired reported in " Why $ 5 Gas is Good For America , " the higher crude prices climb , the more attractive – and viable – emerging technologies like biofuel , hydrogen and plug - in hybrids become .
It also bodes well for other forms of fossil fuels , such as methane hydrates and oil shale , once thought too expensive to develop .
Oil hit a record $ 96.24 yesterday before settling at $ 93.49 .
It 's gained $ 2 today to top $ 95 .
Even if the Russians are right in predicting oil wo n't top $ 100 before the end of the year , analysts warn the price could keep climbing .
No less an authority than the energy minister of Oman said OPEC can't raise production to meet demand .
Cheap oil has historically undermined large - scale investment in alternative energies because the cost of developing them exceeded the profit potential .
But as the price of crude has climbed , so too has the incentive – and the capital – to find alternatives .
Venture capitalists invested $ 2.4 billion in green - energy companies last year , three times what was spent in 2005 .
As Wired 's Mathew Honan pointed out last month in " The Great Green Boom , " a huge chunk of that money is being spent in Silicon Valley .
Stock in companies specializing in clean energy are up an average of 18 to 27 percent worldwide since August , Reuters reports .
Solar stocks , for example , have climbed 49.9 percent since the latest surge in oil prices began in August , and they 're up 125 percent for the year , according to New Energy Finance .
Although biofuel stocks have dropped more than 15 percent this year , they 've gained 3.7 percent since late August .
Market analysts warn that it 's tough to make a definite link between rising oil prices and rising investment in alternatives , and some argue it is n't rising oil prices but mounting government support that 's driving the push for greener energy .
But many agree that sustained oil prices should bring greater support for finding alternatives .

Weather - related disasters have quadrupled over the last two decades , a leading British charity said in a report published on Sunday .
REUTERS / Kena Betancur
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Weather - related disasters have quadrupled over the last two decades , a leading British charity said in a report published on Sunday .
From an average of 120 disasters a year in the early 1980s , there are now as many as 500 , with Oxfam attributing the rise to unpredictable weather conditions cause by global warming .
“ This year we have seen floods in South Asia , across the breadth of Africa and Mexico that have affected more than 250 million people , ” said Oxfam ’s director Barbara Stocking .
“ This is no freak year .
It follows a pattern of more frequent , more erratic , more unpredictable and more extreme weather events that are affecting more people .
The number of people affected by disasters has risen by 68 percent , from an average of 174 million a year between 1985 to 1994 to 254 million a year between 1995 to 2004 .
“ Action is needed now to prepare for more disasters otherwise humanitarian assistance will be overwhelmed and recent advances in human development will go into reverse , ” Stocking said .
Oxfam wants the UN conference on Climate Change in Bali in December to agree a mandate to negotiate a global deal to provide assistance to developing countries to cope with the impacts of climate change and reduce green house gas emissions .
The Politico is out today with an article that suggests its the latter :
Ask a random Paul supporter why she ’s willing to spend time and money on this particular candidate .
Odds are , she ’ll argue that Paul is that rare man of principle — the full - color version of “ Mr. Smith Goes to Washington . ”
That ’s far from the whole story .
Yes , Paul is more principled than most politicians .
He seems to really believe in his small - government message .
He ’s also a 10 - term congressman who has beat long odds .
Paul won three elections as a nonincumbent , twice knocking off sitting congressmen .
Protest candidacies are fun but fleeting ; to hold a seat , you have to convince voters you ’re doing something for them .
So Paul put together a staff that is known for its robust constituent service .
Paul wants to abolish Social Security , but retirees in his district whose monthly checks go missing know that they should call their congressman ’s office .
Paul also votes against most spending bills but makes earmark requests , which are occasionally awarded .
His supporters can try to explain away items such as the earmarks by saying that is the unfortunate price of doing business in Washington .
That may be true , but it ’s a price Paul has been willing to pay .
To be fair , as a Congressman , it does n’t seem like Ron Paul has come anywhere close to Pork Kings like Don Young of Alaska or Robert Byrd of West Virginia .
And there is , I think , a difference between assisting constituents in obtaining government benefits to which they are legally entitled under existing law , and using your power in Congress to send federal money to favored contributors .
While Congressman Paul has clearly done the first , as any good Congressman should , I do n’t think there ’s any real evidence that he ’s done the second .
But the point the article makes here is that Ron Paul has been a much more effective politician than he ’s been given credit for up until now .
The fact that he has been elected as a non-incumbent three times , and knocked off a sitting incumbent twice , should be evidence of that .
He ’s built up alot of good will among the people of his district , and that has helped him election after election .
The article goes on :
Paul approaches domestic politics with a mix of William Wallace - like rhetoric and more pedestrian considerations .
In theory , he wants a government the size of a lima bean .
In practice , he would meet entitlement obligations for old folks while telling kids that they ’ll have to pay their own way .
He says that he ’d like to scrap the Internal Revenue Service and “ replace it with nothing ” ( to wild cheers from the crowds ) but that he could live with a national sales tax .
Normally a consistent federalist , Paul voted for a national ban on late - term abortions .
Paul may be wrong — rhetorically or programmatically — about a whole number of issues , but he ’s not nuts .
He also has a better knowledge of practical politics than he would ever like to let on .
Whether that will be enough to make a big impact on the national stage is still an open question .
It is clearly going to be an uphill battle for him to even be considered among the top - tier GOP candidates notwithstanding this week ’s fundraising numbers .
The other interesting thing to note , of course , is that the dismissive coverage of the Paul campaign from the media is coming to an end .
At least for the moment , they are covering him seriously .
Let ’s see what comes of that .
“ The big picture is that New Yorkers do n’t have access to calorie information , ” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden , the city ’s health commissioner .
“ They overwhelmingly want it .
Not everyone will use it , but many people will , and when they use it , it changes what they order , and that should reduce obesity and , with it , diabetes . ”
The new regulation would apply to about 10 percent of the city ’s 23,000 restaurants , about the same as would have been affected by the previous regulation .
But those that would fall under the new regulation serve about a third of all food eaten outside the home here each year , according to health officials .
They say most fast food customers simply have no idea how many calories they are taking in .
A typical McDonald ’s lunch of a Big Mac , large fries and a medium Coke has about 1,320 calories , about 66 percent of the recommended daily calorie intake for an adult .
A Burger King triple Whopper with cheese has 1,230 calories .
One Boston Kreme doughnut at Dunkin’ Donuts has 270 calories .
A public hearing on the proposal is scheduled for Nov. 27 , and the Board of Health , whose approval is necessary to enact the measure , is expected to vote in January .
The 11 - member board is appointed by the mayor and led by Dr. Frieden , so approval appears likely .
The proposal would take effect March 31 , 2008 .
About 56 percent of adults in the city are obese or overweight , health officials say .
Last December the city became the first municipality in the country to try to impose menu labeling requirements on chain restaurants .
It is one of several health - related reforms , including bans on smoking in public places and on trans - fats in restaurant cooking , that have earned Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg praise in some circles and a nickname of the nanny mayor in others .
For the past several decades , virtually all electronics devices have been based on the CMOS logic system , which uses semiconductors and transistors to form digital circuits .
However , researchers today are investigating the use of novel materials and technologies to create superior circuitry , which would lead to smaller , faster and smarter computers , cell phones , and other devices .
Most recently , scientists Wancheng Zhang , Nan-Jian Wu , and Fuhua Yang from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing have designed logic gates — a basic component of digital circuits — that use the quantization of electric current to perform operations .
The recent development of two unique nanodevices has enabled scientists to control the flow of individual electrons , allowing the team to propose novel universal logic gates that are more compact than conventional logic gates .
“ When talking about future digital circuits using nanodevices , researchers usually focus on their potentially high density and fast speed , ” Zhang told PhysOrg.com .
“ The greatest significance of this work is that we show that the unique operating principles of novel nanodevices can be used to implement smarter logic circuits with very compact structures .
Therefore , future nano - based - circuits can have advantages both in size and in circuit structure . ”
In their study published in Nanotechnology , the researchers proposed two different designs for building “ periodic - threshold threshold logic gates ” ( PTTGs ) .
In the first method , the researchers proposed using an electron waveguide — which is essentially a one - dimensional channel — to take advantage of the wave nature of the electron .
Because the channel is narrower than a single electron , an electron wave can travel through the channel without scattering , in a discrete number of modes .
By using two of these electron waveguides , and combining their current values , the logic gate could have an output consisting of the combined input currents .
In the second method , the scientists proposed a PTTG using a single - electron turnstile , a device that can accurately control the number of transferred electrons using a quantum effect called the Coulomb - blockade effect .
This effect , which only exists in a tiny area about the size of a single electron particle , ensures that the number of electrons transferred by the turnstile is a quantized function of its voltage .
By controlling the voltage , the researchers could theoretically determine the number of captured electrons , and use two single - electron turnstiles to transfer electrons to a storage node , with the difference of electrons between the two turnstiles determining the output signal .
Then , the researchers suggested how PTTGs made in either of these two ways could be used to create universal logic gates .
Due to the flexible quantization characteristics of the current - quantization devices , a single PTTG could implement nearly all 256 three - input Boolean functions ( the most common computing method in digital electronics ) .
Also , two PTTGs put together could implement all 65,536 four - input Boolean functions .
“ The quantized current devices have several quantization states that can be used to represent discrete logic states , ” Zhang explained , “ while conventional CMOS transistors have only two logic states : on and off .
That 's why the quantized current device can enable complicated and compact periodic - threshold threshold logic gates . ”
The researchers also explained that the current - quantized logic gates could have several advantages over conventional logic gates .
For one thing , they have both a simple and more universal circuit structure .
Compared to the 40 transistors required by a conventional three - input logic gate , a PTTG would only require 10 equivalent devices .
Further , the two current - quantized logic gates both have very small sizes , offering the potential for high density circuitry .
Finally , due to their small size and low resistance , the new logic gates may also have a significant speed advantage .
“ The key to achieving quantized current devices is small device geometry , ” Zhang said .
“ Both the ballistic transport of electrons in electron waveguides and the Coulomb - blockade effect in the single - electron turnstile require small device geometry to overcome the thermal energy .

" Islamophobia " is ad hominem By Ali Sina
2006/05/26
One friend alerted me to a discussion going on in Wikipedia on the neologism “ Islamophobia ” .
Someone has suggested that this category should be deleted because the term Islamophobia is divisive , inflammatory and it is frequently used to inhibit very valid criticism of Islam .
This suggestion , of course , as it is to be expected , has been rejected by Muslims who have Islamized everything including Wikipedia .
This friend asked my opinion .
Here is what I think : Islam is an ideology .
Rejection of an ideology cannot be classified as phobia .
To call the opponents of an ideology phobic is a fallacy .
All ideologies have their critics and opponents but we do not hear Christians calling the critics of Christianity Christianophobe , communists calling their critics communitophobe or Hindus calling theirs hinduphobe .
The term " Islamophobia " is both technically and logically incorrect and misleading .
According to Dictionary.com
Phobia is “ a persistent , abnormal , and irrational fear of a specific thing or situation that compels one to avoid it , despite the awareness and reassurance that it is not dangerous . ”
Therefore the neologism " Islamophobia " implies that Islam is not dangerous and the fear of it is irrational .
This claim has not been established and it is not universally agreed upon .
There are many who argue that Islam is indeed a dangerous ideology and they have their logical arguments to prove their claim .
Irrespective of whether the critics of Islam are right or wrong about whether Islam is dangerous or not , calling them “ phobic ” implies that their criticism has been already refuted and the irrationality of their fear of Islamic threat has been established .
Therefore their disagreement with Islam is not logical but a mental disorder .
All ideologies have their opponents .
It is sheer arrogance to call criticism of any ideology , phobia .
This implies that the truth of that ideology is already established and anyone opposing it is adopting an irrational position and is in need of psychological help .
Only Muslims are capable of this much irrationality and arrogance .
We all recall Muhammad Abdullah , the Afghani man who converted to Christianity and who was facing execution .
When the government of Afghanistan was pressured to release him , to save face they accused him of being insane and not fit to stand trial .
In the mind of Muslims only an insane person would disagree with Islam .
This is sheer arrogance .
Buddhism is by all accounts a peaceful religion as non-violence is the core of it .
Despite that Buddhism has its critics and we never call then Buddhistphobes .
The neologism Islamophobia makes absolutely no sense .
It is derogatory and is used in a pejorative way to discredit the critics of Islam from the outset .
Phobia is a disorder .
Here is a short list of a few phobias : Achluophobia or Lygophobia ( fear of darkness ) , Acrophobia , ( fear of heights ) , Androphobia ( fear of men ) , Aviatophobia ( fear of flying ) , Chiraptophobia ( fear of being touched ) , Claustrophobia ( fear of confined spaces ) , Coitophobia ( fear of coitus ) , Decidophobia ( fear of making decisions ) , Agrophobia or Demophobia ( fear of crowds ) , Eleutherophobia ( fear of freedom ) , Gynophobia ( fear of women ) , Hadephobia ( fear of hell - this is the phobia affecting all the Muslims ) , Hylophobia ( fear of forests ) , Insectophobia , ( fear of insects ) , Isolophobia ( fear of solitude , being alone ) , Necrophobia , ( fear of death or dead things ) , Neophobia ( fear of anything new ) , Phasmophobia , ( fear of ghosts ) , Philophobia , ( fear of falling in love or being in love ) , Xenophobia , ( fear of strangers or foreigners ) , etc .
( For more see this )
How can criticism of Islam fall into this category ?
These are all irrational fears that require therapy .
Are Muslims suggesting that the critics of Islam should receive therapy ?
We ca n’t classify disagreement with Islam as phobia .
Islam is an ideology .
Phobia is irrational fear of things , people or situations but not beliefs .
You can't be phobic of a belief system .
Beliefs per se are not frightening .
It 's people who follow nefarious beliefs that become dangerous and frightening .
As one can see , the very term " Islamophobia " is stupid because Islam is a belief system and it is not possible to be phobic of a belief .
From whichever angle you look at Islam you find its stupidity glaring at you .
Muslims suffer from an irrational fear of the Jews .
Muslim children are taught that the Jews are evil and that they eat Muslim children and make pastries with their blood .
Jews are caricatured in derogatory and demonized ways , depicted as bloodsucking monsters .
In a television show aired in Palestine a three year old child was interviewed and asked what she hates most , and she responded " the Jews " and the journalists praised Allah upon hearing this stupid remark .
So the neologism Judeophobia ( fear of Jews ) is a correct lexicon , because the irrational fear of Jews is inculcated in all Muslims since childhood .
Muslims gravely suffer from this disorder .
If children anywhere were taught to fear Muslims , the way Muslim children are taught to fear Jews , then the neologism Muslimphobia would have made sense .
But that is not the case .
Islam is a belief system .
It is a human right to disagree with any belief .
Calling that disagreement “ phobia ” is a logical fallacy .
Islam is the only ideology , whose followers try to discredit its critics by calling their criticism " phobia " .
Islamophobia makes no sense at all .
It is as meaningless as " Fascistophobia " .
Of course people have the right to disagree and criticize any ideology , whether good or bad .
The goodness of an ideology is in the eyes of the beholder .
Inhibiting criticism of an ideology is infringing upon the basic human rights , which is freedom of speech .
The absurdity of the Muslim mind is such that they think it is okay for them to incite hate against the non-Muslims in general and the Jews in particular and yet it is not okay for others to criticize their ideology of hate .
What is behind this paranoia and phobia of criticism ?
It is the inability of Muslims to counter the valid criticism of Islam .
Failing that , they resort to ad hominem and try to discredit its critics by undermining their character .
By classifying the criticism of Islam as a disorder , Muslims absolve themselves from responding to valid criticisms against their faith .
The neologism “ Islamophobia ” , is therefore the symptom of the intellectual bankruptcy of Muslim clerisy to come up with logical arguments and defend Islam against criticism in a rational way .
" Islamophobia " is an ad hominen .
It is a logical fallacy and an insult hurled at the critics of Islam .
It highlights the fact that Islam is a lie , unable to withstand criticism .
That is why Muslims need censorship and must eliminate the truth by brutal force ( law suits or violence ) to protect their lie .
The very existence of this neologism is a tacit confession of Muslims that Islam is a lie , which can't be defended logically and that ad hominem and censorship are the only ways to defend it .

Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad condemned " the atrocities of the Zionist regime against the oppressed Palestinian people , " the IRNA news agency reported Friday .
According to the regime 's mouthpiece , the president suggested holding a referendum on the transfer of Israel 's Jews to Europe , Canada or Alaska .
Nuclear Ambitions
' No one can stop Iran ' Reuters President Ahmadinejad says Thursday Iran ' has passed the difficult points ' on its nuclear path ' No one can stop Iran '
" Let a referendum be held in Palestine .
It is our clear proposal to European countries , " Ahmadinejad said during the International Quds ( Jerusalem ) Day rallies in Tehran .
" Let all Palestinians including Muslims , Christians and the Jews attend the referendum , " he added .
IRNA said Ahmadinejad repeated an earlier suggestion to Europe on the " settlement of Zionists in Europe or in big lands such as Canada and Alaska so they would be able to own their own land " .
Ahmadinejad further stated that " the creation of the Zionist regime , the continuation of its existence and unlimited support for the regime ( by the US ) are an insult to human dignity . "
" Defense for the ominous interests of the Zionist regime is a must for certain powers .
Western governments who are pioneers of secularism pursue defense for the Zionist regime as the holiest task in the world , " the president was quoted as saying .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ( Photo : Reuters )
" Nations should be allowed to conduct research on crimes of the Zionist regime and decode the black box for its atrocities , " he added .
" " The Palestinian youth and nation have been deprived of all human rights for more than 60 years .
Today , Quds is not an issue only related to Palestine and the Middle East but a case of world humanity . "
The president continued to say that Western nations have turned the Holocaust into a " holy issue and do not let anybody raise any question about it .
" ( These events took place in the World War II .
Later , they ( Israel ) committed a historical genocide in Palestine .
They ratified unlimited and holy rights for themselves and introduced all nations as criminals , " he said .
" They allowed themselves to commit whatever crimes under pretext of the Holocaust .
They even built secret prisons in Europe ... and attacked and imposed economic sanctions against a nation that did not officially recognize the Zionist regime . "
Ahmadinejad concluded by saying that " the world should know that the Iranian nation hates massacre (s ) .
It regards agents of the World War II and Hitler as dark and black faces . "
Israeli MKs from across the political spectrum responded angrily to Ahmadinejad 's remarks .
Likud leader MK Benjamin Netanyahu said that Ahmadinejad " is not only a Holocaust denier but also a denier of the link between the people of Israel and its land , which is thousands of years old . "
" He is threatening and putting us in an absurd situation between exile and annihilation , " Netanyahu said .
" Most world leaders are convinced that the Iranian regime , which is determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction , poses a serious threat to world peace , " Kadima MK Tzachi Hanegbi said .
" The United States and leading European countries should urgently convene the Security Council to adopt a resolution that imposes more sanctions on Iran . "
Meretz MK Yossi Beilin said Ahmadinejad was " mentally ill " and " dangerous to the world and his people . "
" We need to organize a coalition of sane people in the world in order to help the Iranian people to get rid of him , " Beilin added .
Likud MK Yisrael Katz said Ahmadinejad was " a fool and dangerous dog who is threatening to wipe out the State of Israel and he should be destroyed like a fool dog . "
" The State of Israel has to declare that it will do all to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction and that should Iran harm Israel in any way , whole areas in Iran will be completely wiped out and the Iranian people who is responsible for electing Ahmadinejad will pay the price , " Katz said .
Find out what 100 calories looks like with this selection of everyday foods .
Kilojoules ( kJ ) are the metric measurement of calories , and you 'll see both kJ and kcal on nutrition labels : 4.2 kJ is equivalent to approximately 1kcal .
The term calorie is a commonly used shorthand for " kilocalorie " .
On food packets , you 'll find this written as kcal .
If you eat more for your breakfast , lunch or evening meal , you may need to drop a snack later in the day to stay on track .
As you can see , any drinks or snacks you have count towards your daily energy total .
A rough guide to how your energy requirement can be spread throughout the day is as follows :
As part of a healthy , balanced diet , women need on average 8,400 kJ a day ( 2,000 kcal ) , while men need on average 10,500 kJ a day ( 2,500kcal ) .
Comparing energy values : a visual guide
This guide shows energy values for 10 different foods .
This will help you visualise what 100kcal ( 420 kJ ) looks like and manage the number of calories you consume .
This amount , 100 kcal , represents just 5 % of a woman 's daily reference intake ( 4 % for men ) , but this quickly adds up when adding ingredients during cooking or when we reach for a snack .
High - fat foods have more energy because fat contains more than double the calories per gram compared with protein and carbohydrates .
Foods containing mainly water , such as vegetables , have even less .
This guide shows how quickly calories can add up in certain foods .
Some of the photos have household objects , such as a pack of cards , to help illustrate the size .
Calories in oil , mayonnaise and butter
All types of fat are high in energy .
A gram of fat provides 9kcal , compared with 4kcal for carbohydrate and protein .
Oil and butter are almost pure fat , which is why 420 kJ / 100 kcal is :
just a little over 1 tablespoon of olive oil
1 level tablespoon of mayonnaise
just under 1 tablespoon of butter ( a thick spread of butter on your bread )
A 100 - calorie portion of olive oil
A 100 - calorie portion of mayonnaise
A 100 - calorie portion of butter
Calories in cheese
Most cheese is high in fat , so 420 kJ / 100 kcal is just under a 30g matchbox - sized piece of cheddar cheese .
A 100 - calorie portion of cheddar
Calories in sugar
Calories in sugar can add up if not used sparingly , especially for people who drink tea or coffee with sugar throughout the day .
Four heaped teaspoons of sugar is 420 kJ / 100 kcal .
A 100 - calorie portion of sugar
Find out how sugar affects your health
Calories in biscuits
A lot of biscuits are high in fat and sugar and low in nutrients , so 2 ginger nut biscuits add up to 420 kJ / 100 kcal .
Other biscuits may be higher in energy , such as those covered in or filled with chocolate .
A 100 - calorie portion of ginger nut biscuits
Calories in crisps
Crisps , which are often high in fat and salt , can quickly add up to 420 kJ / 100 kcal .
For example , the 190g tube of crisps featured in this picture contains nearly 1,000 calories , so just 10 % of a tube ( 9 crisps ) equals 420 kJ / 100kcal .
A 100 - calorie portion of crisps
Calories in meat and fish
The kind of meat you eat could make a big difference to the amount of energy you consume .
For example , this is what 100 kcal of steak looks like :
A 100 - calorie portion of steak
On the other hand , turkey and fish are both low in fat and lower in energy , so 420 kJ / 100 kcal is about 3 slices of turkey or a few spoonfuls of plain large prawns .
A 100 - calorie portion of turkey
A 100 - calorie portion of prawns
Calories in dried fruit
For 420 kJ / 100 kcal , you 'll get just over a 30g portion of raisins .
A 30g serving of dried fruit counts as 1 of your 5 A Day , whereas an 80g serving of fresh fruit , such as grapes or cherries , counts as 1 of your 5 A Day .
100 - calorie portions of cherries , grapes and raisins
Calories in fresh fruit
For 420 kJ / 100 kcal , you can tuck into any of the following :
a large apple
a banana
1.5 grapefruit
100 - calorie portions of fresh fruit
These all count towards your 5 A Day , which should include a variety of fruit and vegetables .
Calories in vegetables
Vegetables are generally low in calories , while bringing the added benefits of fibre , vitamins and minerals .
To illustrate this , 420 kJ / 100 kcal is equal to :
3 whole cucumbers
2 heads of lettuce
3 carrots weighing around 120g each
From Consumerist , which broke the story yesterday , the details of what happened in the woman 's own words :
On Aug , 29 2007 my husband and I suffered a devastating miscarriage .
Being near midnight we went to the ER .
The hospital was very compassionate about our loss and was able to get us in quickly and expedited our treatment .
The following day I called BCBS and informed them that we had made a visit to the ER , and was told it was n't necessary to call them just for ER visits , but only when we are admitted .
Believing that BCBS would never make the mistakes at they did the previous and only time we have used our insurance I thought everything would go smoothly .
Boy was I wrong !
On , Sep , 21 2007 I received a statement for BCBS that they were denying all of the claim .
I called them and asked why they were denying the entire claim , and was told by Jane , " We do not cover ELECTIVE abortions .
If you chose to terminate your pregnancy for non-health threatening reasons , BCBS will not cover it . "
WTF !!!???
I asked her , " Are you saying that my records state that I had an ELECTIVE abortion , in an ER at 12 o'clock in the morning ? "
It was then , I think it clicked in Jane 's mind what she was dealing with and told me how sorry she was .
I lost my cool and even started crying .
I had a miscarriage not an abortion , and being treated in such a condescending way by BCBS really ticked me off .
Thinking what an incredibly huge screw up , BCBS will be right on it trying to fix this , well you would be wrong .
I was told to call the hospital and have them fax over my records stating I did n't have an elective abortion .
Who the heck can get an elective abortion in a busy ER at 12 am , anyway ?
Mind you we have had Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City for less than three months , they have denied every claim we have submitted to them .
EVERYONE !
Wow .
Just ... wow .
She goes on to explain that nothing she did could have possibly been construed as an elective act :
I just got off the phone with the hospital and was told that the claim was not miscoded .
The billing clerk told me that the wording clearly stated that I had had a spontaneous miscarriage and not an elective abortion .
I was also informed that this is common practice with BCBS of Kansas City to deny miscarriage clams as an " elective abortion . "
For those that wondered , I did n't not have a D&C .
The miscarriage was complete before I arrived at the ER .
Welcome to Blue Cross / Blue Shield 's America .
Where your basic health is not nearly as important as their profits .
This may not be an act of Murder by Spreadsheet - but it is still a horrific , sick , and inhumane act .
What 's more important is that this is , as noted by the victim and by those at the hospital she went to , a standard business practice on the part of BCBS .
They make their money not by providing health care , but by denying you health care .
They are in business to make you sick .
Last week , bonddad explained that this is fundamental to private health insurance .
Because they are public companies , traded on the stock market , they have to deliver profits to their shareholders .
That means they are under pressure to take your premiums , pocket it , and then find bullshit reasons to screw you out of the health care that you have paid for via that premium .
The question is , faced with such despicable practices - and despicable people - what can we do to fight back ?
Consumerist - one of the best and , I 'd argue , most important sites on the web , specializes in finding ways to fight back against crappy corporate customer service .
Today they have a post from a BCBS claims rep explaining how the victim can fight back and appeal the claim .
It 's useful information , but as the details make clear , the system is rigged against the victim .
You can't fight back alone - in such a massive market failure , governmental help is needed .
What about our presidential candidates ?
The Big 3 ( Hillary , Obama , Edwards ) have now offered their proposals .
Would any of their plans help this victim ?
The short answer is " no , " with a qualified " maybe " for the Edwards plan .
Allow me to explain .
Both the Hillary and Edwards plans rely on private insurance to somehow deliver health care to Americans .
Both have a so - called " individual mandate " where people will be forced to buy insurance , either private or public .
Obama 's plan also relies on private insurance , but he does not have an individual mandate .
None of their plans , however , mention the more important problem of denied care .
Michael Moore 's SiCKO was full of stories like the one offered in this diary .
Moore , like bonddad , pointed out that the problem is n't that people lack insurance , it 's that they lack care - that health insurances does NOT guarantee health care .
All three of these candidate plans , then , fail because they do not address this problem .
I did say Edwards rates as a " qualified maybe . "
That is because , although he does not propose any detailed regulations to prevent these repugnant practices on the part of BCBS , he does offer support for a patient 's bill of rights .
A patient 's bill of rights is intended to give victims like the woman who was told her miscarriage was an " elective abortion " some legal methods by which they can more easily contest these claim denials .
Edwards is , based on my own initial research , the only of the Big 3 candidates to support a patient 's bill of rights , although he regrettably does not give any details ( if Hillary and Obama have gone on record supporting it , let me know and I 'll update ; and if not , we need to lobby them to include it ) .
The problem , though , is that a patient 's bill of rights does n't prevent someone like BCBS from pulling this kind of crap .
It only helps you after the fact .
And often you have to spend time and possibly money , neither of which you may have , to get justice against these evil insurers .
Relying on private insurance is a recipe for disaster , as it will simply witness the endless repeat of horrible stories like this one .
And though some will say that the " public insurance option " that Hillary and Edwards offer would guarantee avoidance of this problem , that comes with its own concerns , especially that private insurers will dump the sick onto the public option by routinely denying their claims , causing the costs of the public option to soar , necessitating either an uncompetitive and unaffordable rise in the public option 's premiums , or a politically damaging bailout .
And the existence of a public option would n't help victims like this woman , who are already insured and are denied care as a matter of course .
What will it take for us to start demanding action from our Democratic politicians ?
When will we stand up and say " you need to go back to the drawing board " and craft plans that will actually address the core problem ?
How many more people must have their claims denied , must be victims of murder by spreadsheet , before we say " enough is enough " ?
The tea destroyed was contained in three ships , lying near each other at what was called at that time Griffin 's wharf , and were surrounded by armed ships of war , the commanders of which had publicly declared that if the rebels , as they were pleased to style the Bostonians , should not withdraw their opposition to the landing of the tea before a certain day , the 17th day of December , 1773 , they should on that day force it on shore , under the cover of their cannon 's mouth .
On the day preceding the seventeenth , there was a meeting of the citizens of the county of Suffolk , convened at one of the churches in Boston , for the purpose of consulting on what measures might be considered expedient to prevent the landing of the tea , or secure the people from the collection of the duty .
At that meeting a committee was appointed to wait on Governor Hutchinson , and request him to inform them whether he would take any measures to satisfy the people on the object of the meeting .
To the first application of this committee , the Governor told them he would give them a definite answer by five o'clock in the afternoon .
At the hour appointed , the committee again repaired to the Governor 's house , and on inquiry found he had gone to his country seat at Milton , a distance of about six miles .
When the committee returned and informed the meeting of the absence of the Governor , there was a confused murmur among the members , and the meeting was immediately dissolved , many of them crying out , " Let every man do his duty , and be true to his country " ; and there was a general huzza for Griffin 's wharf .
It was now evening , and I immediately dressed myself in the costume of an Indian , equipped with a small hatchet , which I and my associates denominated the tomahawk , with which , and a club , after having painted my face and hands with coal dust in the shop of a blacksmith , I repaired to Griffin 's wharf , where the ships lay that contained the tea .
When I first appeared in the street after being thus disguised , I fell in with many who were dressed , equipped and painted as I was , and who fell in with me and marched in order to the place of our destination .
When we arrived at the wharf , there were three of our number who assumed an authority to direct our operations , to which we readily submitted .
They divided us into three parties , for the purpose of boarding the three ships which contained the tea at the same time .
The name of him who commanded the division to which I was assigned was Leonard Pitt .
The names of the other commanders I never knew .
We were immediately ordered by the respective commanders to board all the ships at the same time , which we promptly obeyed .
The commander of the division to which I belonged , as soon as we were on board the ship appointed me boatswain , and ordered me to go to the captain and demand of him the keys to the hatches and a dozen candles .
I made the demand accordingly , and the captain promptly replied , and delivered the articles ; but requested me at the same time to do no damage to the ship or rigging .
We then were ordered by our commander to open the hatches and take out all the chests of tea and throw them overboard , and we immediately proceeded to execute his orders , first cutting and splitting the chests with our tomahawks , so as thoroughly to expose them to the effects of the water .
In about three hours from the time we went on board , we had thus broken and thrown overboard every tea chest to be found in the ship , while those in the other ships were disposing of the tea in the same way , at the same time .
We were surrounded bv British armed ships , but no attempt was made to resist us .
We then quietly retired to our several places of residence , without having any conversation with each other , or taking any measures to discover who were our associates ; nor do I recollect of our having had the knowledge of the name of a single individual concerned in that affair , except that of Leonard Pitt , the commander of my division , whom I have mentioned .
There appeared to be an understanding that each individual should volunteer his services , keep his own secret , and risk the consequence for himself .
No disorder took place during that transaction , and it was observed at that time that the stillest night ensued that Boston had enjoyed for many months .
During the time we were throwing the tea overboard , there were several attempts made by some of the citizens of Boston and its vicinity to carry off small quantities of it for their family use .
To effect that object , they would watch their opportunity to snatch up a handful from the deck , where it became plentifully scattered , and put it into their pockets .
One Captain O'Connor , whom I well knew , came on board for that purpose , and when he supposed he was not noticed , filled his pockets , and also the lining of his coat .
But I had detected him and gave information to the captain of what he was doing .
We were ordered to take him into custody , and just as he was stepping from the vessel , I seized him by the skirt of his coat , and in attempting to pull him back , I tore it off ; but , springing forward , by a rapid effort he made his escape .
He had , however , to run a gauntlet through the crowd upon the wharf nine each one , as he passed , giving him a kick or a stroke .
Another attempt was made to save a little tea from the ruins of the cargo by a tall , aged man who wore a large cocked hat and white wig , which was fashionable at that time .
He had sleightly slipped a little into his pocket , but being detected , they seized him and , taking his hat and wig from his head , threw them , together with the tea , of which they had emptied his pockets , into the water .
In consideration of his advanced age , he was permitted to escape , with now and then a slight kick .
The next morning , after we had cleared the ships of the tea , it was discovered that very considerable quantities of it were floating upon the surface of the water ; and to prevent the possibility of any of its being saved for use , a number of small boats were manned by sailors and citizens , who rowed them into those parts of the harbor wherever the tea was visible , and by beating it with oars and paddles so thoroughly drenched it as to render its entire destruction inevitable .
-- George Hewes
The White Rose
« Gestern am späten Abend schaute ich eine weiße Rose .
Man sagt , weiße Blumen seien für die Toten - aber Tod , Liebe und Jugend sind eins .
( Die Toten , soweit die wirklich in uns leben , leben ja nur verklärt als Bilder leuchtender Jugend ! )
Deshalb auch ist gerade die weiße Rose in ihrem Duft und ihrer zarten Reinheit , Sinnbild ewiger Jugend . » English Translation - F. Rook , in einem Brief an Lilo Ramdohr , 1941
In 1942 , a group of university students in Munich set out to do what few Germans had dared - defy Hitler .
They knew from the start that were they to be caught , it would mean certain death , and yet they acted anyway .
Calling themselves the " White Rose " , they set out to try to build up some sort of popular resistance to the Nazi regime by distributing leaflets throughout Germany urging Germans to resist by any means .
The day did come when they were caught , and , in the end , Alexander Schmorell , Hans Scholl , Sophie Scholl , Christoph Probst , Willi Graf , Professor Kurt Huber , and later Hans Leipelt would be executed for high treason due to their involvement with the White Rose .
Many consider them fools for paying such a high price for the sake of a few words printed on such poor paper .
However , all of them were certain that there were things much worse than death , such as living life as a slave to evil .
Each was convinced that death on earth was not the end , and that by God 's grace , they would merely be making the transition to life eternal .
Soldiers in Villahermosa build a dam to stem rising waters

More than one million people are believed to be affected , with 300,000 thought to be trapped in their homes and more rain forecast in coming days .
Most of the state is under water and its governor has urged anyone who owns a boat to help the rescue operation .
President Felipe Calderon said the situation was " extraordinarily grave " .
" It 's one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the country , " he said in a televised address on Thursday night .
' Just like New Orleans '
Rescuers are using helicopters to try to pluck people from rooftops .
Thousands of people are huddled inside their homes or emergency shelters .
Tabasco Governor Andres Granier said more than half of the state 's 2.1 million residents had been affected .
" We have lost 100 % of our crops and 70 % of the state is under water , " he told reporters .
" We are just like New Orleans .
All the water that comes in has to be pumped out . "
So far , one person is known to have died in the floods .
High alert
Tabasco 's capital , Villahermosa , and many other towns in the state have been turned into brown lakes with only treetops and roofs visible .
Soldiers and rescuers desperately stacked sandbags along Villahermosa 's streets .
Sandbags were also placed around several giant heads carved by the Olmecs , an ancient pre-Columbian people , at Tabasco 's La Venta archaeological site .
President Calderon has flown to the area and is promising more soldiers and aid .
The state has been placed on high alert .
Oil industry woes
A Red Cross worker in Tabasco state said 70 % of Villahermosa was affected and there was an urgent need for basic materials to help the rescue effort .
Those trying to help flood victims needed water supplies , food and mattresses , he told the BBC .
An appeal was being made for boats and ropes , to help navigate the flooded streets and reach stranded victims .
The main priority for rescuers was to try and get all the affected people out , with concerns high because of forecasts suggesting more rain was due , he added .
People are frantic , families are split up everyone is searching for someone .

The mission involves five spacewalks to expand the ISS
Despite earlier concerns about poor weather , the shuttle blasted off at 1138 local time ( 1638 BST ) .
Its seven - strong crew will install the " Harmony " node to the space station .
The connecting unit will provide a passageway to the European Columbus laboratory , which is set to be fitted to the orbiting outpost in December .
Harmony has been built in Italy and its installation will be led by Italian astronaut and mission specialist Paolo Nespoli .
Shuttle flight STS - 120 , commanded by American Pam Melroy , will also allow a change of crew at the ISS .
Astronaut Daniel Tani will replace the long - stay resident Clayton Anderson , who has spent nearly five months living on the orbiting platform .
Nasa launch officials gave the go - ahead for the launch after damage was discovered on three wing - panels during an inspection at the weekend .
Engineers uncovered what was suspected to be cracks underneath the panels ' protective coating .
However , senior managers said that they did not believe repairs were necessary .
Weather conditions were also a concern on Monday evening .
Nasa 's weather officer warned that there was a 60 % chance conditions would not be favourable for a launch .
Early on Tuesday morning , however , the risk from low clouds and sea breezes subsided , allowing the countdown to continue .
As well as the installation of Harmony , the flight will see the transfer of the first set of solar arrays placed on the ISS to a new permanent location .
Over the course of the two - week mission , five spacewalks will be needed to complete the programme of works .
Harmony will be the first expansion of the living and working space on the station since 2001 .
Harmony will connect Europe 's Columbus lab to the space station
It will provide a passageway between three science laboratories : the existing US Destiny lab ; the European Space Agency 's ( Esa ) Columbus module ; and the Japanese Kibo experimental units .
It will also act as a docking port for the future Japanese re-supply vessels , the HTVs , and other shuttle missions .
Built by Thales Alenia Space , Harmony weighs some 14 tonnes .
It is seven metres long and 4.6 m wide .
Its launch marks the start of a busy few months for Esa at the ISS .
The Columbus laboratory is set to fly to the platform in December .
And then in January , the " Jules Verne " Automated Transfer Vehicle ( ATV ) will launch from Kourou in French Guiana on a re-supply mission .
The ATV can carry 7.5 tonnes of equipment , food , fuel , air and other items to the orbiting outpost .
It will be the biggest and most sophisticated spacecraft Europe has ever lofted into space .
The ship has an advanced navigation and docking system that enables it to find its own way to the ISS .
When the US retires the shuttle in 2010 , the ATV will be the main means of supplying the station .
Obama calls on Pentagon to reconsider awarding new contracts to Blackwater RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday November 14 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama ( D - IL ) called Wednesday for the Pentagon to reconsider awarding any new contracts to Blackwater USA following the revelations that the FBI has found at least 14 of the shootings in a September incident were unjustified .
He issued the following letter to Defense Secretary Robert Gates , which was released to RAW STORY .
November 14 , 2007 The Honorable Robert Gates Secretary of Defense Department of Defense The Pentagon Washington , DC 20310 - 1400 Dear Secretary Gates : I am writing to ask that you make clear to Congress and the public how past performance of private security contractors will impact new contract bids by those contractors .
This question has taken an added significance given press reports that the Department of Defense is considering Blackwater USA for new contracts just as the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) is finalizing its report on the September 16 incident in which Blackwater security personnel killed 17 Iraqis .
Press reports indicate Blackwater is one of five military contractors competing for up to $ 15 billion in contracts over five years to support the Departments counter - narcotics operations .
At the same time , there is an ongoing FBI and Department of Justice investigation into the September 16 incident .
According to todays news reports , the FBI has found that at least 14 of the shootings by Blackwater personnel were unjustified and violated rules issued to security contractors in Iraq for the use of deadly force .
Although these investigations are still underway , it is important to understand the ramifications of the investigation for your departments plans to award new contracts .
Accordingly , I ask that you respond to the following questions :
What role does the past performance of a government contractor play in determining whether the company will secure a new contract ?
Is there a difference between a contractor potentially engaging in criminal conduct , as opposed to some other type of misconduct ?
Does the Department provide any guidance or training to its contracting officers on how to evaluate a contractors past performance in whether to award a new contract to the same company ?
If so , please provide copies of any guidance or training materials .
Specifically , how will the ongoing FBI and Justice Department investigation of the September 16 incident affect the Defense Departments consideration of Blackwater for new contracts ?
The American people deserve to know that their taxpayer dollars are not awarded to companies that may have engaged in criminal conduct and may have jeopardized our militarys efforts to bring the war in Iraq to a responsible end .
I look forward to your prompt responses to these questions .
Thank you .
Sincerely , Barack Obama United States Senator

I do n't know if you are aware of what the band Radiohead is doing with their new album release , but I love them for it .
( Then again I loved them already well before this . )
From the G&M :
Radiohead , the seminal British band known for its experimental sound , is now experimenting with something else : a new delivery format .
Its first album in four years will be available for download from the Internet in 10 days , the band announced late Sunday night .
And the price ?
Whatever fans feel like paying .
The news was made public on a website at www.inrainbows.com ( the name of the new album ) , which features text links on a psychedelic rainbow background .
When you click on a question mark next to the word " Price , " you are taken to a page that says : " It 's up to you . "
Clicking on another question mark takes you to another page that says : " No really .
It 's up to you . "
Good on you fellas .
This whole thing gets to many bigger points about our consumption culture , supply and demand , ownership rights of content , basic values in democracy , RIAA issues , music as art form versus music as commercialized crap through a middle man that has to sing for his supper , I could go on for hours .
But at the end of the day , this band wants you to hear their music , their contribution to the world .
If you can give a dollar , or if you want to give a dollar , marvelous .
If you can and want to give $ 30 , marvelous .
The value of the music , the information , the data is up to the person who wants that information ... and that person 's relative means can come into their decision to " consume the art . "
Has Radiohead made money in the past that allows them this opportunity ?
Likely so .
Will they make money this time ?
I hope they do .
In my opinion , they already deserve compensation for the quality of their art ; the quality of this gesture just adds to their status with me .
How does this tie in with energy ?
What can we learn from this about our energy future ?
I will let you all continue my little thought prompt in the comments ... other than to say this : " Things do not have to be the way they are . "
Remarkably , the flames of passion and romance have only seemed to intensify six years since I married the man I love .
Robert and I have had blissful moments in the bedroom despite my earlier fears that the sexual magnet would lose its potency after the birth of Tracy our adorable daughter .
I have done all in my power to retain the sexy look that first ignited the inexhaustible sexual appetite on the part of my attractive husband .
At the end of it all , our love life shall fall among sex stories that sustain the rhythm of love and MILF sex among couples who understand romance within every dimension of passion .
Let me plunge a little deeper into the details .
So , let ’s return back to that erotic story .
Normally , I leave the law firm shortly after 9.30 o’clock because of the high volume of work .
Every time I show up at the doorstep my husband rushes in to relieve me of my handbag since he gets home an hour earlier from the real estate company where he works .
Routinely he guides me slowly into the bedroom and begins to undress me bit by bit .
I like the ways he fastens his look on my breasts as he unfastens the buttons without any noticeable haste .
He always loves audio sex , free adult videos and appreciates the firmness of my breasts , which turn him on every time he fondles one after the other .
Once my blouse is on the floor , Robert pushes me gently to the bed and gently removes my belt with one hand as the other feels the inner softness of my thighs .
He loves it when I close my eyes and let him slide off my skirt leaving me with the lingerie for some while .
He then moves back and looks at my nude body with noticeable desire .
As he returns to my body , I notice a gradual bulging of his member and a slight tremor of his thighs .
When my turn comes , I gently remove his shirt to reveal his hairy chest before I lay back again waiting for the supreme moment .
The next few minutes that follow are full of intense ecstasy as Robert holds my nipple with one hand while his tongue works on the other .
This part of the game constitutes the most remarkable part among all our free adult stories since the day we first made love .
The passionate kissing and fondling usually drains all my energy , which leaves me yearning for a firm but gentle thrust of his member into my wet pussy .
As usual , Robert often uses his member to brush gently on my clitoris as a deliberate move to push my horny state to irreversible levels .
At such moments I always take the initiative to lift upwards and let him thrust deep into my thing .
I love the way he begins slowly and in a circular motion before he gradually steps up his pace for nearly 15 minutes before I can feel him flowing deep inside me .
The second round is usually moderate , long , and truly fulfilling .
We could go on for hours while changing sex positions without any of us show signs of fatigue .
Indeed , marriage life is a priceless gem of passion .

ABC says they would have reported Vitter 's name if they had it Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday July 10 , 2007 Print This Email This Update :
This story has been updated to reflect confirmation from AP that it did not contact Senator Vitter .
It might just be a story of the scoop that got away .
ABC News told RAW STORY Tuesday morning that if its investigative reporting team had known Republican Senator David Vitter of Louisiana was a former client of so - called ' DC Madam ' Deborah Palfrey , they would have reported it .
" I think we said at the time , and I can certainly say now that if a member of Congress or a United State Senator had come up on the list , and we were able to confirm that , we would have absolutely reported that , " said Jeffrey Schneider , an ABC News spokesman , in a Tuesday morning phone interview with RAW STORY .
Schneider told RAW STORY that ABC News 's Investigative team , led by award winning reporter Brian Ross , was not working with a full set of records from Palfrey 's business .
" We had access to documents from 2002 to 2006 , and we believe that we had access to possibly as much as 80 % of those records , " Schneider explained .
" As you know , Ms. Palfrey had records going back more than 10 years , and we did not have all of the records , but we did very meticulous reporting on the records we did have . "
He added , " There are obviously six other years of records that were just released , and the Senator 's number must have been on one of those years we did n't have . "
In fact , Palfrey had records for 13 years , which would mean nine more years of records from Palfrey to which ABC News claims it did not have access .
Vitter outed himself after Hustler called Notably , it appears that AP was alerted to Vitter 's presence on the list by the Republican Senator himself .
" The statement containing Vitter 's apology says his telephone number was on old phone records of an escort service before he ran for the Senate , " said a version of the story from the Associated Press that ran on Monday night .
AP Director of Media Relations Paul Colford sent an e-mail to RAW STORY stating that " Sen. Vitters statement came into the APs New Orleans bureau without prior contact from the AP . "
The magazine Hustler in a Tuesday afternoon press release then claimed responsibility for Vitter 's decision to identify himself to AP as a former DC Madam client .
" Within hours of a phone call from the offices of HUSTLER Magazine asking Vitter to comment on an article HUSTLER reporters were working on , Vitter ran to the Associated Press in an attempt to get ahead of the story , " said the statement e-mailed to RAW STORY .
" As of 2 p.m .
West Coast time on Monday , only Larry Flynt and the HUSTLER investigative team knew that Vitters phone number appeared on the phone records of Deborah Jeane Palfrey , the so - called D.C. Madam .
Within hours of obtaining the phone records , Flynt 's team found what ABC News has so far been unable to ferret out . "
Vitter 's office did not respond to an e-mail seeking comment on whether the Senator had approached AP first .
ABC News 's Schneider explained that ABC News had decided to report all names from the DC Madam 's list that it considered ' newsworthy . '
Former Undersecretary of State Randall L. Tobias was one official who was identified .
Tobias , the former point man on promoting abstinence in US - led HIV / AIDS prevention efforts , resigned from his post after Ross and Justin Rood reported that he had been one of Palfrey 's clients .
Harlan Ullman , a military affairs analyst , was also identified as a customer of Palfrey 's escort service .
On Google map , everything 's back to normal after Katrina Satellite imagery of devastated coast as it once was fuels talk of conspiracy
NEW ORLEANS — Google 's popular map portal has replaced post - Hurricane Katrina satellite imagery with pictures taken before the storm , leaving locals feeling like they 're in a time loop and even fueling suspicions of a conspiracy .
Scroll across the city and the Mississippi Gulf Coast , and everything is back to normal : Marinas are filled with boats , bridges are intact and parks are filled with healthy trees .
" Come on , " said an incredulous Ruston Henry , president of the economic development association in New Orleans ' devastated Lower 9th Ward .
" Just put in big bold this : ' Google , do n't pull the wool over the world 's eyes .
Let the truth shine . ' "
Chikai Ohazama , a Google Inc. manager for satellite imagery , said the maps now available are the best the company can offer .
Numerous factors decide what goes into the databases , " everything from resolution , to quality , to when the actual imagery was acquired . "
He said he was not sure when the current images replaced views of the city taken after Katrina struck Aug. 29 , 2005 , flooding an estimated 80 percent of New Orleans .
In the images available Thursday , the cranes working to fix the breach of the 17th Street Canal are gone .
Blue tarps that covered roofless homes are replaced by shingles .
Homes wiped off their foundations are miraculously back in place in the Lower 9th .
So , too , is the historic lighthouse on Lake Pontchartrain .
But in the Lower 9th Ward , the truth is n't as pretty , 19 months after Katrina .
" Everything is missing .
The people are missing .
Nobody is there , " Henry said .
After Katrina , Google 's satellite images were in high demand among exiles and hurricane victims anxious to see whether their homes were damaged .
The new , virtual Potemkin village is fueling the imagination of locals frustrated with the slow pace of recovery and what they see as attempts by political leaders to paint a rosier picture .
Pete Gerica , a fisherman who lives in eastern New Orleans , wondered whether Google 's motives might be less than pure .
" Is Google part of the conspiracy ? " he said .
" Why these images of pre-Katrina ?
Seems mighty curious . "
Do you have a really bad memory , or past heartache , that you would prefer to forget ?
Researchers at Harvard and McGill University ( in Montreal ) are working on an amnesia drug that blocks or deletes bad memories .
The technique seems to allow psychiatrists to disrupt the biochemical pathways that allow a memory to be recalled .
In a new study , published in the Journal of Psychiatric Research , the drug propranolol is used along with therapy to " dampen " memories of trauma victims .
They treated 19 accident or rape victims for ten days , during which the patients were asked to describe their memories of the traumatic event that had happened 10 years earlier .
Some patients were given the drug , which is also used to treat amnesia , while others were given a placebo .
A week later , they found that patients given the drug showed fewer signs of stress when recalling their trauma .
Similar research led by Professor Joseph LeDoux has been carried out at New York University on rats ; scientists were able to remove a specific memory from the brains of rats while leaving the rest of the animals ' memories intact .
An amnesia drug called U0126 was administered .
The rats were trained to associate two musical tones with a mild electrical shock so that when they heard either of the tones they would brace themselves for a shock .
The researchers then gave half the rats the drug when playing one of the musical tones .
After the treatment , the rats that had been given the drug no longer associated that particular tone with an imminent shock but still braced themselves upon hearing the second tone , demonstrating only one memory had been deleted .
Science fiction fans have a number of associations with the idea of banishing unwanted memories .
In the 2004 film Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , Kate Winslet and Jim Carrey play lovers who have a falling out .
Winslet 's character goes to a company called Lacuna , Inc. to have her memories of the relationship removed ; Carrey 's character also has the procedure performed ( see photo ) .
In the film , the process involves showing the person a memento of the relationship and then encouraging them to bring up specific memories while an electric shock is given .
Not to give away the film , but this technique does not work as planned .
Here 's a memory you might have repressed .
In the classic Star Trek episode Requiem for Methuselah , Jim Kirk becomes enamored of Rayna , a beautiful woman who turns out to be an android created by a five thousand year old man who calls himself Flint , who was also Leonardo DaVinci and Shakespeare ( among many others ) during the course of his long life .
Flint wants Rayna for himself , Kirk wants her , she loves them both , her circuits overload resulting in her death , and Kirk is devastated .
Finally , Spock saves the day by applying a little - known property of the Vulcan mind - meld , which is that he can make Kirk forget about his sorrows and return to duty ( see touching photo ) .
Science fiction legend Philip K . Dick was one of the first to make use of this idea .
In his 1966 short story We Can Remember It For You Wholesale he writes about selectively erasing memories :
Someone , probably at a government military - sciences lab , erased his conscious memories ; all he know was that going to Mars meant something special to him , and so did being a secret agent ...

Inflation ex-inflation to be Official Fed Policy ?
Well , it seems to be just about official : Inflation ex-inflation has formally become the policy of the Federal Reserve .
At least , according to voting Fed Governor Frederic Mishkin , who tells Bloomberg that Inflation Minus Food , Energy Is a ` Better Guide ' .
When reading his statements , I am reminded of the former Fed Chair Arthur Burns , who in the 1970s similarly did not want to include energy and food prices in his inflation measures .
That " experiment " ended rather disastrously , with flat growth , and very high inflation , a condition that came to be known as stagflation .
Growth is n't as weak today , and inflation is n't as pernicious .
But we do have strong commodity price increases , with GDP growth significantly slowing in the US .
Add a weak US dollar versus a basket of global currencies ( see America vetoes G7's dollar alert ) .
Then bring 2 billion new consumers into the global economy from India and China .
( see Ship Shortage Pushes Up Prices Of Raw Materials ) , Next , add a hot war in the Middle East .
Last , a Treasury Department hellbent on increasing the money supply .
That 's the formula for what I call " demi-stagflation , " and what my colleague Jeff Saut at Raymond James calls " Agflation . "
All I ask is for the entities that measure the goods and services that make up our economy , and the bureaucracies that set government policy to accurately portray them , and stop the absurd emphasis on the non-inflationary items .
Here 's the ubiq - cerpt : ™
" Federal Reserve Governor Frederic Mishkin said inflation measures that exclude food and energy costs are a " better guide ' ' to underlying changes in prices .
Changes in price indexes without food and energy " provide a clearer picture of underlying inflation pressures , '' Mishkin said in the text of remarks to the HEC Montreal Macroeconomics and Monetary Policy Conference today .
`` If the monetary authorities react to headline inflation numbers , they run the risk of responding to merely temporary fluctuations . ''
Mishkin argued that both so - called core and headline measures of inflation are useful to policy makers and the central bank should n't rely on any one gauge .
Sustained increases in energy costs can push up expectations for inflation , he said , noting that recent gains in oil are a " reminder that shocks can persist longer than one might have first expected . ''
Does a 5 year run in energy prices and other commodities count as sustained ?
The emphasis on Inflation ex-inflation continues . . .

Many struggling schools serve challenging areas
Schools Minister Lord Adonis told private school leaders fewer than 30 % of pupils got five good GCSEs including English and maths in some 800 schools .
This was a " waste of talent " .
Parents and government " rightly expect better " .
A head teachers ' leader said the government had changed the target and it was wrong to say all those schools were giving children a bad education .
Lord Adonis told the Headmasters ' and Headmistresses ' Conference that standards in the state sector had improved significantly in the past 10 years .
" But it is still the case that in some 800 secondary schools , fewer than 30 % of 16 - year - olds achieve five or more good GCSEs including English and maths .
" The waste of talent and potential this represents simply is n't acceptable for the future .
" Parents rightly expect better , and so must we as educators and government . "
Academies
In many of the 800 schools - 23 % of the total in England - standards were not improving , or not doing so fast enough to give people confidence they would become good schools reasonably soon .
" For many of these schools , the essential deficit is one of governance , leadership , ethos and vision taken together - all of the underpinning foundations of a good school which , together , enable it to succeed . "
Lord Adonis said this was why academies were being introduced in areas of educational disadvantage , he said .
The general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , John Dunford , said schools were having to change their teaching priorities to focus on maths and English because of the new GCSE target .
' Shocking '
Dr Dunford said : " But it is quite wrong to say that all those 800 schools are giving a bad education to their children .
" That is patently untrue .
Many of these schools serve extremely challenging communities and many children who are new to this country . "
Shadow Children 's Secretary Michael Gove said Lord Adonis had once more underlined the scale of failure over the last 10 years .
" Given the welcome extra money spent on education the failure to improve standards for the weakest is shocking . "
His party had campaigned for the adoption of best practice , he said .
" Meanwhile the government is back - pedalling on reform - neutering its own academies programme and failing to put rigour at the heart of the curriculum . "
Researchers are normally hard - pressed to catch a fleeting glimpse of the so - called superheavy elements at the far edge of the periodic table .
Now a team has gone a step further and studied the chemistry of short - lived element 112 , which seems to bond with other elements in the same way as its mundane relatives zinc and mercury .
" In principle , we are proving whether the good old basic systematics of chemistry — the periodic table — is a valid ordering principle also for transactinides , " or superheavy elements , says chemist and team leader Robert Eichler of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen , Switzerland , and the University of Bern .
Eichler and colleagues bombarded a plutonium 242 target with an intense beam of calcium 48 ions inside a vacuum chamber .
Prior work indicated that the two atoms should now and then fuse into an isotope of element 114 ( with 114 protons and 287 neutrons ) , which would rapidly decay into " ununbium , " or element 112 ( 112 protons and 283 neutrons ) .
In the new experiment , the bombardment ejected its products into the chamber , where a stream of helium gas ushered them to a chilled gold - coated detector that was warmer on one side than the other .
The team also introduced the inert gas radon and the element mercury , which would lie in the same column as element 112 on the periodic table .
Atoms of each element would stick to the detector at the point where its temperature was just low enough to let them form chemical bonds with gold .
Theorists had speculated that element 112's relatively charged nucleus might contract its electron cloud , making the atom largely unreactive , like radon .
So the researchers looked for signs of ununbium decay and compared their detector positions with those of the two other elements .
They spotted a grand total of two telltale ununbium decays on the warmer , mercury - grabbing end of the detector .
The decays also indicated a relatively long half - life of a few seconds , as expected .
Eichler says the experiment 's main goal was to confirm reports that the bombardment process produced element 112 , which is still not an official element .
Getting a bead on its chemistry was a bonus .
" We succeeded in both and this makes me as a chemist very happy , " Eichler says .
" There have been so many varying predictions about the chemical behavior [ of ] element 112 .
We wanted finally to know . "
Researchers believe that certain " magic " numbers of protons and neutrons would confer high stability and long half - lives on element 114 and still undiscovered transactinides — a so - called island of stability in the upper reaches of the periodic table , which is generally inhabited by elements that exist only a fraction of a second .
" The observations of [ element ] 112 confirm that the island of stability is not just a mirage , " wrote radiochemist Andreas Türler of Munich Technical University in an editorial accompanying the study in this week 's Nature .
Rudolph W. Giuliani has been broadcasting radio advertisements in Iowa and other states far from the city he once led stating that as mayor of New York , he “ turned a $ 2.3 billion deficit into a multibillion dollar surplus . ”
The assertion , which Mr. Giuliani has repeated on the trail as he has promoted his fiscal conservatism , is somewhat misleading , independent fiscal monitors said .
In fact , Mr. Giuliani left his successor , Michael R. Bloomberg , with a bigger deficit than the one Mr. Giuliani had to deal with when he arrived in 1994 .
And that deficit would have been large even if the city had not been attacked on Sept. 11 , 2001 .
“ He inherited a gap , and he left a gap for his successor , ” Ronnie Lowenstein , the director of the city ’s Independent Budget Office , a nonpartisan agency that monitors the city budget , said of Mr. Giuliani .
“ The city was budgeting as though the good times were not going to end , but sooner or later they always do . ”
The Giuliani campaign defended the advertisement , noting that it merely states that Mr. Giuliani created a multibillion - dollar surplus , not that he passed one on to his successor .
WHO ’S YOUR DADDY ?…. Earlier this year Condoleezza Rice decided it was time to talk with Iran about its funding of Shiite militias in Iraq .
According to today ’s Washington Post , Ambassador Ryan Crocker was dubious :
When Rice told Crocker to get ready for talks with Iran , he asked her the “ blindingly obvious ” question of whether Vice President Cheney would allow it , a U.S. official said .
Rice , according to the official , told Crocker that it “ was n’t your lane , ” adding , “ I ’ll work it back here .
That ’s not your problem . ”
Golly .
Why were they so concerned about Cheney ?
All they had to do was get the President of the United States on their side and that would have been that .
Right ?
I wonder why they did n’t think of that ?
David Lassman , the director of the Jane Austen Festival in Bath decided to find out what sort of reception the writer might get if she approached publishers and agents in the age of Harry Potter and the airport blockbuster .
After making only minor changes , he sent off opening chapters and plot synopses to 18 of the UK 's biggest publishers and agents .
He was amazed when they all sent the manuscripts back with polite but firm " no - thank - you 's " and almost all failed to spot that he was ripping off one of the world 's most famous literary figures .
Mr Lassman said : " I was staggered .
Here is one of the greatest writers that has lived , with her oeuvre securely fixed in the English canon and yet only one recipient recognised them as Austen 's work . "
Mr Lassman admits that personal disappointment as well as academic interest prompted his experiment .
A little like Austen , who initially struggled to find a publisher , he has been unable to find someone to champion his book , a thriller called Freedom 's Temple , a modern take on the story of Theseus and the Minotaur .
" I know it is n't a masterpiece but I think it is publishable .
Yet nobody wanted it .
I was talking with some friends and we wondered if Jane would find a publisher or agent if she were around today . "
So , styling himself Alison Laydee - a play on Austen 's nom de plume A Lady - he typed up chapters from three of her most famous books .
First he sent off Northanger Abbey , calling it " Susan " - a title Austen had used for an early draft - and changing the name of the heroine from Catherine Morland to Susan Maldorn .
Mr Lassman expected to be branded a fraud .
But he was surprised when publishers and agents failed to spot they had been sent the work of Austen .
Bloomsbury , publisher of the Harry Potter books , for instance , suggested the chapters had been read " with interest " but were not " suited to our list " .
Still , Northanger
Abbey is not seen as one of Austen 's great books , so next he sent off Persuasion , under the title The Watsons .
Again the letters of rejection flooded in .
JK Rowling 's agents , Christopher Little , were among those who turned it down , saying they were " not confident " of being able to place it .
Then he played his trump card , sending off Pride and Prejudice , calling it First Impressions , again an early title Austen had used for it .
The names of the main characters and places were changed , but with no great guile .
Mr Bennet became Mr Barnett while the estate Netherfield becomes Weatherfield , the fictional setting for the TV soap Coronation Street .
And he did not change the opening line , one of the most famous in world literature : " It is a truth universally acknowledged , that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife . "
Still the deception was not spotted and the rejection letters thudded on to Mr Lassman 's doormat , most notably one from Penguin .
Its letter read : " Thank you for your recent letter and chapters from your book First Impressions .
It seems like a really original and interesting read . "
Only one person appeared to have spotted the deception , Alex Bowler , of Jonathan Cape .
His reply read : " Thank - you for sending us the first two chapters of First Impressions ; my first impression on reading these were ones of disbelief and mild annoyance , along , of course , with a moment 's laughter .
" I suggest you reach for your copy of Pride and Prejudice , which I 'd guess lives in close proximity to your typewriter , and make sure that your opening pages do n't too closely mimic that book 's opening . "
David Baldock , director of the Jane Austen Centre in Bath , said he was amused and disheartened by the experiment .
He added : " It 's interesting that there are these filters that stop work getting through .
Clearly clerks and office staff are rejecting these manuscripts offhand . "
Publishers and agents yesterday tried to explain what had gone wrong .
A spokesman for Christopher Little said : " Our letter was a polite note declining representation and provided a standard response .
Our internal notes did recognise similarities with existing published works and indeed there were even discussions about possible plagiarism . "
A spokeswoman for Penguin pointed out that its letter had said only that it " seemed " original and interesting .
" It would not have been read , " she insisted .

Orthopedic researchers at Jefferson Medical College have for the first time found stem cells in the intervertebral discs of the human spine , suggesting that such cells might someday be used to help repair degenerating discs and remedy lower back and neck pain .
Reporting November 1 , 2007 in the journal Spine , a team led by Makarand Risbud , Ph.D. , and Irving Shapiro , Ph.D. , at Jefferson Medical College of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia , have found stem cells in both degenerated adult human discs and in discs of animals .
Many people suffer from lower back pain , and treatment ranges from painkillers such as acetominophen to medical procedures , such as fusing vertebrae .
The combined annual costs for treatment of back pain and disc disease is approximately $ 100 billion a year and a major cause of lost work in the United States .
According to Dr. Shapiro , as the discs in the spine degenerate , cells are lost and the ability to produce water - binding molecules called proteoglycans is decreased .
The water absorbs forces on the spine , essentially serving as shock absorbers .
Losing proteoglycans can result in damage to the disc , and sometimes , pain .
" It would be wonderful if we could get the cells in the intervertebral disc to regenerate or increase the amount of proteoglycans that they synthesize , " he says .
" That way we could regenerate the shock - absorbing capabilities of the spine . "
Dr. Risbud , an assistant professor of Orthopedic Surgery , and Dr. Shapiro , who is professor of Orthopedic Surgery , both at Jefferson Medical College , and their co-workers asked if it was possible to regenerate proteoglycans using adult stem cells .
Federal regulations prevent them from using embryonic stem cells .
Dr. Risbud built the study around the observation that while the tissue that he could isolate from the disc was no longer binding water , the tissue still might contain dormant stem cells .
He thought that while these cells were no longer functioning to repair the damaged disc , under appropriate conditions , they could be activated .

To explore that possibility , he isolated cells from discarded disc tissue that still had the capacity to proliferate .
Dr. Risbud notes that under certain conditions , the cells could be encouraged to form bone .
In other conditions , the cells would form cartilage or even fat .
The tests proved that these cells were indeed dormant disc stem cells .
" If we are able to stimulate the ' silent ' cells in the patient , then it may be possible to repair the ravages of degenerative disc disease without undergoing invasive surgical procedures that may limit the motion of the spine , " he says .
According to Dr. Risbud , in earlier work , the researchers found that local conditions in the disc can promote adult stem cells of the bone marrow to acquire characteristics of disc cells .
Within the disc , the local conditions are unique in that the oxygen levels are low .
These conditions cause the expression of many specialized molecules , including the water - binding proteoglycans .
Some of the researchers ' current experiments focus on the use of adult stem cells to repair the degenerate intervertebral disc .
Shapiro notes that other researchers have taken bone marrow stem cells and have made new bone , cartilage and fat tissue .
" Our next step is to activate these disc stem cells and get them to repopulate the disc and make proteoglycans and restore the water - binding ,
The scientists theorize that because the stem cells exist in the degenerate disk , there may be molecules that are blocking stem cell activity .
" Something is inhibiting the disc repair process , " says Dr. Shapiro .
Drs. Shapiro and Risbud agree that " new studies are needed to discover the nature of such inhibitory molecules " and to find ways to block their activities , promoting natural healing .
The work was supported by the National Institutes of Health .
At the onset of the Great Depression , Buffalo had 573,000 inhabitants , making it the 13th - largest city in America .
In the 75 years that followed , this once - mighty metropolis lost 55 percent of its population , a decline most dramatic in its blighted inner city but also apparent in its broader metropolitan area , one of the 20 most quickly deteriorating such regions in the nation .
Twenty - seven percent of Buffalo ’s residents are poor , more than twice the national average .
The median family income is just $ 33,000 , less than 60 percent of the nationwide figure of $ 55,000 .
Buffalo ’s collapse — and that of other troubled upstate New York cities like Syracuse and Rochester — seems to cry out for a policy response .
Could n’t Senators Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer use their influence on Capitol Hill to bring some needed relief ?
The truth is , the federal government has already spent vast sums of taxpayer money over the past half - century to revitalize Buffalo , only to watch the city continue to decay .
Future federal spending that tries to revive the city will likely prove equally futile .
The federal government should instead pursue policies that help Buffalo ’s citizens , not the city as a geographical place .
State and local policymakers could take steps that might — might — help Buffalo stave off its demise , if they avoid the errors of the past .
But make no mistake : Buffalo faces long odds .
The history of Buffalo helps us understand why it continues to lose people and why it will be hard to reverse the trend .
Historians often overstate the importance of the Erie Canal to New York City ’s expansion : Gotham grew just as quickly before the canal was dug .
But there ’s no question that the canal , which connected Lake Erie to the Hudson River — and , therefore , the Great Lakes to the Atlantic — was a critical factor in the growth of upstate cities located on it , such as Buffalo .
Before the canal , Buffalo had 2,500 residents and specialized in commerce along the Great Lakes .
After the canal , the city ’s population exploded , reaching 8,600 people by 1830 and 18,000 by 1840 .
Many of those new residents helped transfer goods , especially wheat , from the large boats that plied the Great Lakes to the smaller , 50 - ton barges that traveled eastward via the canal .
By the early 1840s , Buffalo was moving 2 million bushels of grain a year from boat to barge .
It was a revolution in transportation , even more dramatic than the railroads that later gave upstate New York towns vital access to eastern markets and the Atlantic seaboard .
At first , the grain moved by hand .
But cities often foster innovation , and so it proved in Buffalo .
In 1842 , a local merchant , Joseph Dart , borrowed an idea from the brilliant Pittsburgh miller Oliver Evans , installing a steam - driven machine that scooped wheat out of cargo ships on Lake Erie and then dumped it into a silo .
Dart ’s grain elevators could handle 1,000 bushels daily , allowing ships to unload in a single day .
They became a noticeable part of Buffalo ’s skyline and a key element of the city ’s emergence as the world ’s leading grain port .
During the early twentieth century , Buffalo first challenged , and then surpassed , Minneapolis as a mill town , and the canal was the main reason .
Since so much wheat flowed through Buffalo , it made sense to start milling it there and then to ship the flour onward .
Almost half of Buffalo ’s wheat left the country , much of it sailing across the Atlantic to European markets .
Over time , the city ’s water - based transportation advantages also encouraged heavy industrial development .
The Lackawanna Steel and Iron Company , for instance , relocated its center of operations from Scranton , Pennsylvania , to Buffalo early in the twentieth century .
The upstate city ’s canal location made it easy to ship iron there from the Lake Michigan area , and to turn it into steel with the aid of coal transported north from Pennsylvania .
Buffalo had an extra geographic advantage that helped make it an early - twentieth - century powerhouse : Niagara Falls .
The rushing water was a potent source of energy , harnessed to produce the electricity that surged through an enormous underground tunnel to power the city .
By 1901 , Buffalo took to calling itself the City of Light , so abundant was the electricity delivered by the falls and Westinghouse generators .
The electricity would be an added draw for firms , such as Union Carbide and the Aluminum Company of America , that needed plentiful power .
The 1920s were the last real growth period for Buffalo .
During the thirties , the city ’s population began to level off , and after its 1950 high of 580,000 , it began to fall precipitously — down 50,000 people by the end of the decade .
Buffalo ’s worst decade was the 1970s , when it lost 100,000 residents and much of its middle class .
Today , its population stands well under 300,000 .
A major culprit in Buffalo ’s collapse was a shift in transportation technology , reducing the importance of the Erie Canal and of the cities that arose to take advantage of it .
In the 1830s , you would have been mad to set up a manufacturing firm in New York State that did n’t have access to the canal or some other waterway .
Starting in the 1910s , though , trucks made it easy to deliver products and get deliveries — all you needed was a nearby highway .
Rail became more efficient : the real cost of transporting a ton one mile by rail has fallen 90 percent since 1900 .
Then the Saint Lawrence Seaway opened in 1957 , connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic and allowing grain shipments to bypass Buffalo altogether .
These shocks did n’t just hit the New York canal cities ; every city on the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River , its water - based advantages eroded , lost industries to areas with cheaper labor costs .
Other trends compounded Buffalo ’s woes .
Improvements in electricity transmission made companies ’ proximity to Niagara Falls increasingly irrelevant .
Mechanization meant that the industry that did remain in the city needed fewer bodies .
The appeal of the automobile induced many to leave the older center cities for the suburbs , where property was plentiful and cheaper , or to abandon the area altogether for cities like Los Angeles , built around the car .
And Buffalo ’s dismal weather did n’t help .
January temperatures are one of the best predictors of urban success over the last half - century , with colder climes losing out — and Buffalo is n’t just cold during the winter : blizzards regularly shut the city down completely .
The invention of air conditioners and certain public health advances made warmer states even more alluring .
In general , when cities shrink , poverty is n’t far behind , for two reasons — one obvious , the other subtler .
The obvious reason : urban populations fall because of relocation of industry and drop in labor demand ; as jobs vanish , people living in a city get poorer .
The subtler reason : declining areas also become magnets for poor people , attracted by cheap housing .
This is exactly what happened to Buffalo , whose median home value is just $ 61,000 , far below the state average of $ 260,000 .
More than 10 percent of Buffalo ’s residents in 2000 , it ’s worth noting , had moved there since 1995 .
The influx of the poor reinforces a city ’s downward spiral , since it drives up public expenditures while doing little to expand the local tax base .
State and local government did little to improve Buffalo ’s chances — in fact , they worsened things considerably .
First , New York ’s high taxes , burdensome regulations , and pro-union laws made Buffalo less attractive to employers than its more successful southern competitors .
In 1975 , the Fantus Legislative Business Climate rankings sorted the American states based on corporate taxes , workers ’ compensation laws , and many other rules .
New York was the least business - friendly of the 48 states in the continental U.S. Being antibusiness might have been feasible when New York enjoyed strong natural advantages , but not after those advantages eroded .
Despite 50 years of population loss , Buffalo has one of the steepest metropolitan tax burdens in the country — including one of the nation ’s highest local property tax rates , according to a 2003 study .
Buffalo also suffered from lousy local politics .
During the 1960s , the city government failed to deliver either safety or good schools .
Race riots shook the area , and crime rose steadily .
Fiscal crises became epidemic .
Buffalo had difficulty recruiting police because of low wages and the dangers of the street .
Leadership was especially dismal during the late sixties and early seventies , the city ’s worst years .
Mayor Frank Sedita , who faced ceaseless fiscal problems and surging violence from 1966 to 1973 , was a traditional urban politician , better at playing to the city ’s various ethnicities than at confronting its ongoing crisis .
As the 1970s went on , cities began to acknowledge , however grudgingly , that the high costs of concentrated poverty made it disastrous to keep repelling the well - off and attracting the poor .
The exodus of the middle class and businesses led many cities to repudiate tax - and - spend left - liberal politicians , who had dominated urban politics in the sixties , in favor of pragmatic leaders promising a better deal for more prosperous residents .
In 1977 , for instance , New York City voters rejected left - liberals Abe Beame and Bella Abzug and elected reformer Ed Koch .
And in Buffalo ’s mayoral race that year , voters rejected a left - leaning Democrat , Arthur Eve , and embraced James Griffin , the law - and - order candidate of the Conservative and Right - to - Life Parties .
Like Koch , Griffin focused on improving basic city services , such as public safety , and encouraging business investment .
But while Koch presided over the first sparks of New York ’s eventual Giuliani - era renaissance , Buffalo remained mired in poverty and dysfunction because , unlike the Big Apple , it lacked a healthy private sector .
Manhattan ’s financial - services sector created an engine of economic success , with innovation following innovation .
During the 1960s , investors developed more accurate ways to assess risk , which in turn made it possible for Michael Milken to find a wider market for riskier bonds .
Those high - risk bonds then enabled the corporate takeover movement of the 1980s , which created huge amounts of value by cutting managerial fat and forcing greater efficiencies on firms across America .
Later still , the same finance - based innovation dynamo brought more economic success to Manhattan with mortgage - backed securities and hedge funds .
New York City , in other words , transformed itself from a manufacturing center into a place that thrived on producing new ideas .
The other old , cold cities that staved off decline , like Boston and Minneapolis , similarly reinvented themselves , with the density that once served to move cargo onto ships now helping spread the latest ideas .
The key ingredient : human capital .
The cities that bounced back did so thanks to smart entrepreneurs , who figured out new ways for their cities to thrive .
The share of the population possessing college degrees in the 1970s is the best predictor of which northeastern and midwestern cities have done well since then .
Buffalo was n’t a particularly skilled city in 1970 , and it is n’t one now .
Fewer than 19 percent of the city ’s adults boast a college degree ; the number in Manhattan is 57.5 percent .
Whereas New York always had some industries , such as finance , that required brainpower , Buffalo ’s industries were invariably brawn - based .
Buffalo was n’t a university town like Boston , and it did n’t have Minneapolis ’s Scandinavian passion for good lower education .
It had the right skill mix for making steel or flour , not for flourishing in the information age .
Since the 1950s , the federal government has showered billions upon billions of dollars on Buffalo and other failing cities , seeking to revitalize them .
The spending reflected a natural , humane impulse .
But none of it worked , as Buffalo ’s entrenched poverty and shrinking population testify .
In 1957 , for example , the federal Urban Renewal Association provided more than $ 9 million ( $ 65 million in today ’s dollars ) to rebuild the Ellicott district in the city ’s downtown area .
The Ellicott rehabilitation followed what became the classic urban renewal script — replacing slums with middle - income housing , commercial development , and more open space .
The program removed 2,000 residents , the majority of them black , and relocated many to new public - housing projects .
Yet just ten years later , officials were describing the program as a “ dismal failure . ”
Despite millions spent , living conditions for the poor seemed no better , and the city certainly was n’t on the mend .
After Ellicott , Buffalo , with Washington ’s help , turned its attention to redeveloping its waterfront .
In 1969 , the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development supported the construction of the 40 - story Marine Midland Center , a bank headquarters designed by Skidmore , Owings and Merrill .
Twenty - seven years later , the public contributed more than $ 50 million to build the Marine Midland Arena nearby to house hockey ’s Buffalo Sabres .
While the public money created splendid waterfront edifices , it did little to stem residents ’ flight from the city .
Buffalo ’s metropolitan rail system , which opened in 1985 , is the most expensive of the city ’s revitalization efforts .
The system took over six years and $ 500 million to build , with most of the money coming from Washington .
Many have lauded the system for its cleanness and efficiency .
But why sink so much money into rail lines when Buffalo has lots of highways and abundant parking ?
The system ’s ridership has been declining steadily for over a decade .
All this spending aimed at resurrecting Buffalo as a place — very different from government aid that seeks to help disadvantaged people , such as the Earned Income Tax Credit — was destined to fail .
Urban migrations are n’t random .
America ’s deserts and mountain ranges are n’t densely inhabited for a good reason : few people want to live in such harsh places .
Similarly , people and firms are leaving Buffalo for the Sunbelt because the Sunbelt is a warmer , more pleasant , and more productive area to live .
The federal government should n’t be bribing them , in effect , to stay in the city .
Such bribes are notoriously ineffective .
Scores of close to worthless urban projects have received government funding not because any cost - benefit analysis has justified them but because of hazy claims that they would make some once - great area thrive again .
It ’s almost impossible to imagine that the billions already spent on Buffalo ’s urban - renewal projects would satisfy any reasonable cost - benefit analysis for helping to reverse the city ’s decline .
The desire of people and firms to move is just too strong .
For the government to tear down old houses and build new ones in a place like Buffalo is particularly misguided .
The hallmark of declining cities is having an excess of housing relative to demand .
Econ 101 teaches us that any further increases in housing supply will just push prices down more .
No mayor ever got reelected by making it easy for his citizens to move to Atlanta , of course , even when that might be a pretty good outcome for the movers themselves .
But just because local pols will eagerly seek federal place - based spending does n’t mean that the feds should comply .
A sensible federal approach for upstate New York would invest in people - based policies that improve the economic futures of the children growing up there .
Education is the best tool we have to fight poverty .
If the children of upstate cities were better educated , then they would earn more as adults — whether they stayed in their hometowns or moved to Las Vegas .
And people - based policies may actually motivate states and cities to spend more wisely , in order to retain their newly educated and mobile residents .
As for state and local politicians , reducing New York ’s unnecessary taxes and regulation would be a good idea , since if Buffalo is ever to rebound , even somewhat , private innovators , not government projects , will be the primary reason .
Better schools and safe streets would also be key to improving Buffalo ’s chances of survival .
Yet though such policies would improve things , they would not restore the boomtown of the early twentieth century ; the economic trends working against such a prospect are simply too great .
The best scenario would be for Buffalo to become a much smaller but more vibrant community — shrinking to greatness , in effect .
Far better that outcome than wasting yet more effort and resources on the foolish project of restoring the City of Light ’s past glory .

1. Determine a posting schedule of 4 - 5 high quality posts per day , and stick to it , no matter what .
Common blogging wisdom says that the more often you post , the more visitors you ’ll receive and the more subscribers you ’ll have .
So , set a high standard , and determine to write as many posts per day as possible .
You ’re brimming over with ideas right now and there is no reason to think you ’ll ever run out of things to post about .
2 . Make earning a good income from your blog top priority .
Have high expectations with regards to the income you ’re going to earn through Adsense , especially if your blog is targeted towards a tech - savvy audience .
The idea that tech - savvy readers are ad - blind is just a myth .
If the ads are relevant , they will be clicked on , especially if you really make them stand out in your design .
Make them a different color than your site ’s color scheme so they ’ll really pop off the page .
Also , include as many Adsense blocks as you possibly can , and be sure to get some nice blinky ads , so that readers are sure to see them .
3. Consider every other blog in your niche a competitor , and try to avoid ever linking to them .
Why would you send YOUR readers to another site that covers the same topic ?
You are the ultimate authority in your niche and there is no need to network with or link to anyone else .
If you link to other sites in your niche , those authors would n’t appreciate it anyway , and there is nothing to be gained by giving out link love to your competitors .
4 . Choose a topic purely based on the income potential you believe it has , rather than your interest in the subject , and do n’t worry if there are already 1,000 blogs covering the same “ money niche . ”
It does n’t matter if you know nothing about the topic you choose to blog about .
All that matters is the money you stand to make .
Even if you ’re not interested in the topic at all , you can find things to write about by doing a little research and some discrete content scraping .
The huge amount of money you ’re making will keep you motivated when the topic is boring you to tears .
5 . Start 5 or 6 blogs at the same time , because you ’ll certainly have time to focus on each one enough to make them successful .
You ’ve started one blog and are having no problem maintaining it , and now you ’re hooked .
Blogging is addictive and there ’s nothing wrong with buying a few more domain names even if it means you ’ll be spreading yourself a little thin .
You enjoy it so much that those late nights trying to get that 5th post for the day up on each one wo n’t even feel like work .
6 . Do n’t bother to respond to comments - you ’re too busy maintaining your posting schedule .
Readers really do n’t care if you respond to their comments at all .
The conversation will continue in your comments whether you participate or not , and really , lots of commenting on a blog is totally overrated .
Who cares what your readers think ?
It ’s what you think that matters right ?
Is n’t that why you ’re writing on the blog in the first place ?
They come to your site to learn from YOU , not the other way around .
7 . Expect your site to be extremely successful within a matter of weeks or months .
That thing about most blogs taking a while to get off the ground and establish themselves as an authority does not apply to you .
Build it and they will come .
8 . Never take a break from blogging .
Fresh air and exercise are for those wimps who ca n’t stick to as grueling a schedule as you ’re able to maintain .
How is getting away from the computer supposed to help anyway ?
The only way you ’re going to be successful is to keep plugging away , because there are only so many hours in the day .
You ca n’t fritter away your time walking around outside no matter how much your back hurts from sitting in the same chair all day long .
Sleep is also overrated .
4 hours a night is enough .

Recently I have been reading
Over the last couple of weeks , I did something I 've been meaning to get round to for a while now : I sat down and read the Bible from end to end .
Not for religious reasons , I hasten to assure you ; anyone who was expecting to be able to count on me as a staunch atheist can still safely do so .
A minor objective was to find out a bit more about what the Christians I know believe , but primarily my motivation was literary : lots of modern writing refers or alludes to the Bible , and I 've often not been entirely sure what the explicit references are talking about , and have probably missed quite a few of the subtle allusions .
So after an unusually large number of Bible references happened to go over my head during a period of three or four days the other week , I decided enough was enough and set out to actually read the thing .
I allowed myself to skim - read if it got boring ( the censuses , the genealogies , the endless indistinguishable psalms and proverbs and prophecies , the extensive theology and moralising in the New Testament etc ) , but I wanted to at least get from one end of the book to the other and be left with an understanding of its overall structure and plot .
My favourite bit of the whole book , I think , was the second half of 1 Samuel , describing the conflict between Saul and David .
This is because it had actual dramatic tension and plot :
Saul enthroned with access to all the resources of a king , David on the run and in hiding but with God on his side .
Of course I knew how it was going to end already , and of course the writing style was standard Bible - issue stilted awkwardness , but nonetheless I found it a more gripping read than any of the rest of the book .
The most boring bit , on the other hand , would have to have been 2 Kings .
That might seem like an odd choice given the wide range of completely unreadably boring bits I listed a few paragraphs ago , but the thing about all those bits is that they 're clearly boring , so you can identify them in advance and skip lightly over them .
2 Kings , however , presented itself as a narrative , and so I did n't dare skip any of it because there was always the chance that something interesting and important might happen and I 'd miss it ; but in fact it was completely full of endless copies of the same cardboard - cutout king doing the same bad things , and because I could n't skim it I had to suffer through them all in full .
( Some friends of mine had a phrase for that at school , I recall : ‘ killer boring ’ , describing things that are not only boring but that you have to keep concentrating on and can't just ignore .
Boredom you can't run away from , that you have to keep staring into until it strips your soul and destroys your will to live .
Boredom by comparison to which merely being sent to sleep would be outright pleasant . )
The other thing that struck me as odd about the Bible was , again oddly for such a large and verbose book , its occasionally surprising brevity .
There are of course quite a few really famous Bible stories which I already knew in outline , and could have summed up the story in a few sentences .
In several of these cases , the actual version of the story in the Bible turned out to be barely any longer than my summary would have been : the things that ‘ everybody knows ’ about the story were in fact the whole story .
Take the Tower of Babel , for example : some people tried to build a tower reaching to the heavens , and God thwarted them by confusing their language so they could no longer understand each other .
I imagine everybody who knows anything about the Tower of Babel ( I mean , beyond just having heard the name ) knows that much .
So when I got to Genesis 11 and found the actual story , I was naïvely expecting that basic outline to be fleshed out into lots more text : character development , dramatic tension , backplot and motivation , perhaps how they tried very hard to carry on using only sign language but could n't get the details right so the rest of the tower kept falling down …
But in fact , the entire incident takes place in about eight verses , in very little detail more than I gave in my initial summary above .
I mean .
Suppose you had n't read Lord of the Rings , and someone told you that Gandalf confronted a Balrog on a bridge and both of them fell into the abyss .
You would naturally expect that that sentence was probably a very potted summary , and that in the real text there would be paragraphs if not pages describing what a Balrog was , why they were fighting , how the confrontation occurred , how both of them managed to fall in instead of just the loser as you might expect , what everybody else watching thought of this , etc .
And , of course , you 'd be right .
But if that same incident came up in the Bible , it would probably actually read something along the lines of ‘ 19 Then Gandalf confronted the Balrog on the bridge .
20 And both of them fell into the abyss . ’
( 2 Fellowship 5:19 - 20 ) And I think that if your imagination had been tickled by the potted summary and you 'd decided to read the real thing , you might reasonably be quite disappointed to find that that was all there was to it .
Book : Cheney aide said , ' We 're one bomb away from getting rid of that obnoxious court ' Jason Rhyne
Published : Tuesday September 4 , 2007
Print This Email This Book reveals White House strategies to consolidate executive power A new book by former Department of Justice lawyer Jack Goldsmith reveals a play - by - play account of White House strategies for expanding executive power following the Sept. 11 attacks .
To be published later this month , Goldsmiths The Terror Presidency , details how Bush administration officials , including then - White House counsel Alberto Gonzales and Vice President Cheneys current chief of staff David Addington , promoted broad legal justifications for measures including controversial secret surveillance plans and detention procedures for enemy combatants .
The contents of the book will be profiled in the forthcoming issue of the New York Times Magazine in a piece by lawyer Jeffrey Rosen , who also spoke exclusively with Goldsmith .
 Goldsmith told me that he has decided to speak publicly about his battles at the Justice Department because he hopes that future presidents and people inside the executive branch can learn from our mistakes ,  Rosen writes .
 In his view , American presidents for the foreseeable future will , like George W. Bush , face enormous pressure to be aggressive and pre-emptive in taking measures to prevent another terrorist attack in the United States . 
Appointed in the fall of 2003 to head up the Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel , a division dedicated to advising the president on the extent of executive power , Goldsmiths introduction to White House legal maneuvering was an abrupt one .
 Several hours after Goldsmith was sworn in ,  Rosen writes , " he recalls that he received a phone call from Gonzales : the White House needed to know as soon as possible whether the Fourth Geneva Convention , which describes protections that explicitly cover civilians in war zones like Iraq , also covered insurgents and terrorists .
After presenting his analysis that the Geneva Conventions indeed covered all civilians , whether insurgent or terrorist , Goldsmith remembers David Addington , then legal counsel to Vice President Cheney , saying  The president has already decided that terrorists do not receive Geneva Convention protections ... [ y] ou can not question his decision . 
Later , according to Rosen , after having legal questions about another administration decision , Goldsmith received another Addington rebuke .
 If you rule that way ,  Goldsmith recalls Addington saying  the blood of the hundred thousand people who die in the next attack will be on your hands . 
 In Goldsmiths estimation , the unnecessary unilateralism of the Bush administration reached its apex in the controversy over wiretapping and secret surveillance ,  Rosen writes .
While he shared President Bushs worries that Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) could halt wiretaps of terrorists  international calls , Goldsmith strongly disapproved of White House plans fix the problem , many of which held little respect for courts or Congress .
 We re one bomb away from getting rid of that obnoxious [ FISA ] court ,  Addington said in 2004 , according to the book .
Goldsmith was also an eye - witness when Alberto Gonzales and White House Chief of Staff Andrew card visited Attorney General John Ashcroft 's hospital room in 2004 to request that Ashcroft sign off on a controversial spy program set to expire .
After being admonished by the seriously ill attorney general for visiting him in such a condition , Goldsmith told Rosen that Gonzales " thanked " Ashcroft , before walking out of the room with Card .
" Mrs. Ashcroft , who obviously couldnt believe what she saw happening to her sick husband , looked at Gonzales and Card as they walked out of the room and stuck her tongue out at them , " Goldsmith said .
" She had no idea what we were discussing , but this sweet - looking woman sticking out her tongue was the ultimate expression of disapproval .
It captured the feeling in the room perfectly . 
Baby 's x-ray showing the inserted metal implants ( photo : Bill Osment )
Six - year - old Baby fractured her back legs after falling from a window in her south London home in September .
The domestic short - haired cat had a metal plate and screws inserted at the Blue Cross animal hospital in Victoria .
To the surprise of vets , an X - ray showed she had two implants in her front legs , inserted after a similar plunge when she was a kitten .
Extremely lucky
Vets said Baby was making a good recovery but will need further surgery to her hind legs to remove some temporary implants .
Ms Gower said Baby was extremely lucky ( photo : Bill Osment )
Jess Gower , Blue Cross chief veterinary surgeon , said Baby was " extremely lucky " .
" A cat falling from this height will commonly sustain severe injuries , so we were stunned to find it was the second time she had done it , " she said .
" Now she has metal implants in all four legs , so the staff decided to call her the ' bionic cat ' .
" She 's had two lucky escapes but needs to be very careful to keep her remaining lives intact . "
The hospital advises that pets should never be allowed to rest on balconies or window ledges if they are above ground level .
It said cats in particular are easily spooked by sudden noises and this could cause them to bolt and slip .
Too Big for the White House Can Superstar Gore Still Run for President ?
The news that Al Gore has won the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize has added fuel to speculations that the political superstar and climate change icon will run again for the White House .
But Gore is too big for the grubby intrigues of electioneering -- now more so than ever .
Dark Hope : Working for Peace in Israel and Palestine by David Shulman University of Chicago Press , 226 pp. , $ 22.00
“ I am an Israeli .
I live in Jerusalem .
I have a story , not yet finished , to tell . ”
This is the opening line of David Shulman ’s powerful and memorable book , Dark Hope , a diary of four years of political activity in Israel and the Palestinian territories .
It is a record of the author ’s intense involvement with a volunteer organization composed of Israeli Palestinians and Israeli Jews , called Ta’ayush , an Arabic term for “ living together ” or “ life in common . ”
The group was founded in October 2000 , soon after the start of the second Palestinian intifada .
“ This book aims , ” Shulman writes ,
at showing something of the Israeli peace movement in action , on the basis of one individual ’s very limited experience ….
I want to give you some sense of what it feels like to be part of this struggle and of why we do it .
Struggle with whom ?
Shulman explains :
Israel , like any society , has violent , sociopathic elements .
What is unusual about the last four decades in Israel is that many destructive individuals have found a haven , complete with ideological legitimation , within the settlement enterprise .
Here , in places like Chavat Maon , Itamar , Tapuach , and Hebron , they have , in effect , unfettered freedom to terrorize the local Palestinian population ; to attack , shoot , injure , sometimes kill — all in the name of the alleged sanctity of the land and of the Jews ’ exclusive right to it .
His diary proceeds to show how this happens .
Shulman speaks of “ the last four decades . ”
It is forty years since the Israeli victory of 1967 brought the West Bank under occupation .
That was also the year Shulman immigrated to Israel from the US , just after graduation from high school .
In the Israeli army he was trained as a medic , which turned out to be a great asset for his later work in the West Bank .
His first aid skills , as well as the medical kit he always carried with him , were equally in demand by Israeli comrades and Palestinian villagers injured by settlers , soldiers , and police .
Shulman attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem , where he acquired , among many languages , a good mastery of Arabic .
This , too , proved to be useful in dealing with the Palestinians whom he and his friends tried to help .
He emerged as a formidable scholar : on Tamil , Telugu , and Sanskrit poetry , Dravidian linguistics , Carnatic music , and Tamil Islam .
His linguistic and cultural interests were mainly focused on South India .
In 1987 , when he was thirty - seven , he received a MacArthur Fellowship .
He has published many translations of Indian poetry .
Shulman ’s language in his diary is fresh and uncontaminated by the lazy clichés often used to describe the conflict between Israeli Jews and Palestinian Arabs .
By temperament and calling , Shulman is a scholar , not a politician .
Recalling Auden ’s lines on Yeats , we may say that mad Israel hurt him into politics .
Into what sort of politics , one may ask .
Shulman ’s work on India and its culture suggests that his politics — if this is the term — would draw on Gandhi’s …
The Revenge of Gaia : Earth 's Climate in Crisis and the Fate of Humanity by James Lovelock Basic Books , 177 pp. , $ 25.00 China Shifts Gears : Automakers , Oil , Pollution , and Development by Kelly Sims Gallagher MIT Press , 219 pp. , $ 52.00 ; $ 21.00 ( paper ) Solar Revolution : The Economic Transformation of the Global Energy Industry by Travis Bradford MIT Press , 238 pp. , $ 24.95 WorldChanging : A User 's Guide for the 21st Century edited by Alex Steffen Abrams , 596 pp. , $ 37.50 Design Like You Give a Damn : Architectural Responses to Humanitarian Crises edited by Architecture for Humanity Metropolis , 336 pp. , $ 35.00 ( paper )
James Lovelock is among the planet ’s most interesting and productive scientists .
His invention of an electron capture device that was able to detect tiny amounts of chemicals enabled other scientists both to understand the dangers of DDT to the eggshells of birds and to figure out the ways in which chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) were eroding the ozone layer .
He ’s best known , though , not for a gadget but for a metaphor : the idea that the earth might usefully be considered as a single organism ( for which he used the name of the Greek earth goddess Gaia ) struggling to keep itself stable .
In fact , his so - called Gaia hypothesis was at first less clear than that — “ hardly anyone , and that included me for the first ten years after the concept was born , seems to know what Gaia is , ” he has written .
But the hypothesis has turned into a theory , still not fully accepted by other scientists but not scorned either .
It holds that the earth is “ a self - regulating system made up from the totality of organisms , the surface rocks , the ocean and the atmosphere tightly coupled as an evolving system ” and striving to “ regulate surface conditions so as always to be as favourable as possible for contemporary life . ”
Putting aside questions of planetary consciousness and will ( beloved as they were by an early wave of New Age Gaia acolytes ) , the theory may help us understand how the earth has managed to remain hospitable for life over billions of years even as the sun , because of its own stellar evolution , has become significantly hotter .
Through a series of processes involving , among others , ice ages , ocean algae , and weathering rock , the earth has managed to keep the amount of heat - trapping carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , and hence the temperature , at a relatively stable level .
This homeostasis is now being disrupted by our brief binge of fossil fuel consumption , which has released a huge amount of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere .
Indeed , at one point Lovelock predicts — more gloomily than any other competent observer I am aware of — that we have already pushed the planet over the brink , and that we will soon see remarkably rapid rises in temperature , well beyond those envisioned in most of the computer models now in use — themselves quite dire .
He argues that because the earth is already struggling to keep itself cool , our extra increment of heat is particularly dangerous , and he predicts that we will soon see the confluence of several phenomena : the death of ocean algae in ever - warmer ocean waters , reducing the rate at which these small plants can remove carbon from the atmosphere ; the death of tropical forests as a result of higher temperatures and the higher rates of evaporation they cause ; sharp changes in the earth ’s “ albedo , ” or reflectivity , as white ice that reflects sunlight back out into space is replaced with the absorptive blue of seawater or the dark green of high - latitude …
Wisconsin GOP chair faces charges in enticement of teenage boy RAW STORY
Published : Sunday October 14 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This ( via PageOneQ ) -- Brown County GOP Chairman Donald Fleischman has resigned his post , says a spokesperson , after being accused of enticement and fondling of an underage boy , reports the Green Bay Press - Gazette Saturday .
Fleischman , 37 , is free after posting a $ 20,000 bond on September 28 .
" My client is innocent of the charges , " says attorney Jeff Jazgar , who " declined to discuss specifics . "
" Our plan is to get some witnesses to testify and present enough information to dismiss the case . "
The boy was found by police in Fleischman 's home on two occasions in late 2006 while being sought as a runaway from Ethan House , a home for at - risk youth .
Now 17 , he says he stayed with Fleischman at his house and a cabin , where he was provided with alcohol and cannabis , and regularly fondled .
On November 19 , 2006 , according to a September 7th complaint obtained from the WisPolitics Courtwatch Blog , the boy in question was found hiding in a bedroom closet , and a pipe was found in the house , which tested positive for THC .
Shortly after , on December 8 , 2006 , Fleischman said he was trying to convince the boy , discovered again in the home , to turn himself in as a runaway .
Fleischman faces two counts of child enticement , two counts of contributing to the delinquency of a child , and one count of exposing himself to a child .
He returns to court on October 29 .

The documents , dating from 1920 to 1950 , are expected to shed new light on some of the most notorious excesses of the post - revolutionary and Stalinist eras , including Stalin 's forced collectivisation of agriculture in the early 1930s , in which up to 10 million people died .
The archives , which include some two million documents , also cover the political purges of the late 1930s , which saw hundreds of thousands of party members executed as counter - revolutionaries or shipped off to gulags .
Historians and human rights activists reacted cautiously to the news , pointing out that only relatives of those " purged " would be able to study the documents .
Arseny Roginsky , a spokesman for the Russian human rights organisation Memorial , told the Guardian : " We welcome this but it 's not sensational .
This process of opening up the archives started under Boris Yeltsin in 1992 .
The problem is that it is up to the federal security service [ the FSB , successor to the KGB ] to decide what gets released and what stays secret .
Most of these documents concern people subsequently rehabilitated .
" There is no independent historical committee allowed to evaluate this material .
The Soviet Union 's wartime relations with other states are completely off limits .
And the biggest problem is that there is no catalogue : finding stuff is very difficult . "
The FSB confirmed today that the archives would be made available only to relatives of those who were " purged " .
Vasily Khristoforov , head of the FSB 's archives and registers department , said family members could apply .
He said the documents would be made available in a public reading room and that 1,500 requests were approved last year , under a policy of liberalising access to previously secret documents .
Most government archives were classified as state secrets during the Soviet era .
A 1992 presidential decree declassified materials on Soviet - era repression .
But Lyudmila Alexeyeva , a veteran human rights advocate , told Associated Press that access was again restricted in the late 1990s without any explanation .
She said the FSB may be lifting recent curbs to improve its image but lamented : " A small window is being opened again but 87 years later we are finally opening it up but only to relatives . "
Elvis had been dead just days , and the Iron Curtain still divided east from west .
Jimmy Carter was in the White House , and Malcolm Fraser was in his first term in the Lodge .
Australians were awed by colour television , and Sony was marketing a revolutionary video recorder called Betamax .
Home computers were a distant dream .
Launched on September 5 , 1977 , Voyager 1 zoomed past Jupiter in 1979 , and Saturn in 1980 , heading on a path clear out of the solar system .
Its identical twin , sent aloft two weeks earlier on August 20 , also took in the sights of Neptune in 1986 and Uranus in 1989 .
Today Voyager 1 is humanity 's most remote object , 15.5 billion kilometres from the sun .
Voyager 2 is 12.5 billion kilometres from it .
Both continue beaming home reports , but now they are space - age antiques .
" The Voyager technology is so outmoded , " said Tidbinbilla 's spokesman , Glen Nagle , " we have had to maintain heritage equipment to talk to them . "
That is because the ageing probes can only chat at a sluggish 32 bits a second , far too slow for modern computers .
" The computers look like the stuff out of the old sci - fi movies , with blinky lights and big colourful buttons , " Mr Nagle said .
To keep them humming , Tidbinbilla relies on its most experienced engineers , including John Murray , who will have been working there for 40 years on Monday .
His colleague Ian Warren has knotched up 42 years in the space business .
With the nuclear - powered Voyagers tipped to keep transmitting until at least 2020 , Mr Murray has to show younger staff how to maintain the vital hardware .
" I find it funny that I send people I am teaching to go and get parts for these machines that are older than them , " he said .
It is not just the age of the Voyagers that makes communicating difficult .
" When the signal leaves the spacecraft it 's about 19 watts , about the power of a light bulb in a fridge . "
Mr Nagle said .
" When it reaches us it 's 20 billion times weaker than a watch battery .
It is a whisper from space . "
Voyager 2 phones home to Tidbinbilla every day .
Travelling at the speed of light , the signals take 11.5 hours to arrive .
Voyager 1 calls once a month , its signals taking almost 14 hours .
A two - way exchange takes more than a day .
" It 's slow conversation , but its a great conversation , " Mr Nagle said .
Travelling at 34 kilometres a second , the Voyagers are seeking the point where the wind of particles blowing off the sun is overwhelmed by those streaming in from other stars .
Beyond that is interstellar space .
Both carry disks loaded with pictures and sounds from Earth .
" It 's like a message in a bottle , a message from humanity for whoever might find it , " Mr Nagle said .
Assuming , of course , that aliens can play such outmoded technology .
Tidbinbilla , open daily , is staging a display of Voyager pictures and movies until Wednesday .

Arms folded , his chair jammed against the wall , Joe Maestas glowered at the men who could help his family out of homelessness .
His wife , Christina , sat at his side , pale and tense .
This meeting was their best chance to escape the filthy motel where they and their four children had lived for two years .
A novel city program had offered them $ 1,200 to move into a decent rental .
But the money came with a catch :
For six months , Joe and Christina would have to open their lives to two men assigned to coach the family out of poverty .
The Maestas children warmed to the mentors at once as they all gathered in the break room of Christina ’s workplace in mid-March .
Corie , 9 , drew them a smiling kitty .
Domonic , 13 , shyly asked for help with his literature homework .
Advertisement
Their father tugged his worn baseball cap down low , so his eyes were nearly hidden .
Joe did n’t like anyone presuming to help his family , no matter how good their intentions .
“ They tell you how to live , ” he said .
Hailed as a national model , the mentorship program began two years ago after Democratic Mayor John W. Hickenlooper challenged every church , mosque and synagogue to adopt one of the 600 homeless families in metropolitan Denver .
Like other cities , including Los Angeles , Denver is trying to help the homeless off the streets with expanded counseling and more low - cost housing .
This program would be something new .
Hickenlooper envisioned congregations raising money to move families into rental housing .
Volunteers would teach the parents life skills : how to plan a household budget , advance at work , go back to school , find healthcare , shop wisely .
If all went well , the mentors would become friends , and tethers , for families on the edge .

“ So much of the talk about helping the homeless involves building affordable housing and funding services .
That ’s very important .
But change happens with person - to - person contact , ” said Brad Hopkins , who runs the program for the city of Denver and the Denver Rescue Mission , a nonprofit partner .
“ The big thing these families lack is healthy , supportive relationships to guide them to self - sufficiency . ”
In nearly 17 years of marriage , Christina and Joe had made their own way in life , and they were fiercely protective of their choices .
Christina , 36 , earned the sole paycheck as second assistant manager at an auto - parts store .
Joe , 35 , made dinner , ramen noodles or his specialty , bologna chili .
She took every overtime shift she could ; he stayed home with the children : Joey Jr. , 15 ; Domonic ; Corie ; and Angel , 7 .
The couple went to a bar every Thursday night to shoot pool .
Other than that , they kept to themselves , rarely willing to risk a relationship for fear of being scorned .
Advertisement
“ We do n’t talk to but a few people , ” Joe said .
Now , he was face to face with two earnest strangers eager to befriend him .
Dave Scott , an accountant , and Mark Zahringer , a manager at a real - estate investment trust , had only recently met , though both attended the same evangelical church in the upper - middle - class suburb of Parker , about 35 minutes south of Denver .
Neither had any experience as a mentor .
Their only preparation was two hours of training .
Dave , 36 , volunteered thinking of Jesus ’ commandment to help the poor .
Advertisement
Mark ’s motives were more complicated .
He had long viewed the homeless as unworthy of his time : “ I thought it was their own damn fault . ”
Then one night , he joined his church to serve meals at a soup kitchen .
He watched the ragged families and wondered what kept them from a normal life .
“ God was telling me , ‘ Check this out a little more , ’ ” said Mark , 40 .
He became a mentor hoping to turn a family around by modeling his work ethic .
First , though , he had to break through Joe ’s hostility .
Mark ran through his own life story : kicked out of the house at age 15 , put himself through college , made it big in real estate -- but left his job just before the Sept. 11 attacks upended the economy .
Out of work for seven months , he lost his home ; he , his wife and their two sons had to crash in a friend ’s basement .
Advertisement
Joe nodded gruffly : “ Been there .
Done that . ”
As Joe relaxed , the four adults talked , awkwardly at first , their conversation skipping from football to camping to love at first sight .
Joe told the mentors about the $ 15 steak dinner he bought his oldest for making honor roll .
Corie interrupted to remind her dad she had to get to school early for student council .
“ It ’s hat day , ” she told him .
“ We pay $ 1 and we get to wear a hat .
And all the money goes to poor people . ”
With Angel starting to fidget , the mentors broached the topic of need .
“ What can we do to help and support you ? ” Mark asked .
Now that she had the $ 1,200 grant , Christina was sure she could find a rental .
But what would they sleep on ?
She refused to take their motel bedding with them : “ It ’s all infested with cockroaches . ”
The mentors jotted notes .

After the goodbyes , Dave stood in the doorway of the auto - parts store , and with the chill night air rushing in , unfolded the picture Corie had drawn .
On it , she had written : “ Remember us . ”
A real house
Christina was practically singing .
It was the first week of April , and her family was in a house .
A real house , red brick , with three small bedrooms , a bathroom with buckling tiles , and a basement hideaway for their oldest , Joey .
He threw a thin mattress on the floor and hung up his treasures : a Denver Broncos towel and two Broncos hats , so faded the orange looked pink .
Advertisement
The neighborhood was poor ; some homes had plywood tacked across broken windows , or iron bars in place of screen doors .
But it was just a few miles from the Broncos ’ football stadium , and Christina figured they could drive there on Sundays to watch the fans stream in .
“ The boys are so excited , ” she said .
Dave and Mark had asked their congregation for donations and hauled over a trove of hand - me - downs : an overstuffed couch ; plaid easy chairs ; a microwave ; two huge , ornate dressers .
One afternoon , Dave invited Christina and Joe to pick out a queen - size mattress -- on him -- at the furniture store where he worked .
“ It was $ 700 , ” Christina marveled .
Advertisement
“ After his store discount , $ 647 , ” Joe said .
“ It ’s so thick I need to jump a little to get up on it , ” Christina said .
“ We ’ve never had a new bed that no one else slept in , ” Joe said , “ much less a bed like that . ”
He and Christina had browsed the store in the past and felt the clerks sneering .
This time , though , “ they were falling all over to help us , ” Joe said .
Advertisement
Dave had hoped for just such an experience .
Joe had done a great job raising the children , but both mentors thought it was past time for him to find work .
Rent was $ 900 a month .
The family could make it , barely , on Christina ’s salary of $ 11.90 an hour .
But they had nothing to spare for a medical emergency , or a repair to their 20 - year - old van .
If Christina ever lost her job , they ’d be on the brink of eviction within weeks .
The way Dave looked at it , the key to nudging Joe into the job market was to give him confidence .
So he asked his colleagues at the mattress store to go out of their way to let Joe know he mattered : “ The point was , let ’s show them that there are people out there who will treat them with respect . ”
Joe and Christina were far more accustomed to being treated with suspicion .
As soon as they enrolled Joey in his new high school , for instance , an administrator called them into the office .
“ He was like , ‘ We need an action plan for attendance .
We need an action plan for grades , ’ ” Christina said , her voice rough with anger .
“ My son has all A’s .
He ’s never missed a day . ”

Christina had been fighting assumptions since she first met Joe .
He was living on the streets of Las Vegas , hanging with a gang , tattoos up and down his arms .
Christina saw beyond the tough - guy pose .
They married young .
The couple shuttled between Las Vegas and Denver several times over the years to be near relatives .
Christina usually found work quickly , often at a fast - food restaurant or a Wal - Mart .
But three years ago , she hit a dry spell and was unemployed for nearly a year .
The family spent several months in shelters -- each week a different church basement , a different set of eyes judging them .
The motel was more private , but with $ 420 due every two weeks -- about half her income -- Christina could n’t save toward a security deposit for an apartment .
So they stayed in their two - bedroom unit , their clothes heaped in plastic bins , all four kids crowded into a single room .
Joe almost never let them play outside .
It was too dangerous .
Advertisement
All that was behind them now :
They had a fenced - in yard with a rope swing .
They still did n’t have a table , and had to sit on the floor to eat .
But there was a TV , left by previous tenants .
And , in the bathroom , a linen closet .
“ We ’ve never actually had a closet with a door ! ” Christina said as she opened it .
The shelves contained a curling iron , a toy block and a washcloth .
Angel , trailing her mother , pointed out the washing machine and creaky dryer .
“ Now you do n’t have to go to the laundromat on the weekends , ” she told her mom .
“ And I do n’t miss you . ”
A turn for the worse
In the two years since Hickenlooper issued his challenge , 150 congregations have reached out to about 300 homeless families .
More than 80 % remain in rental housing a year after completing the mentoring program , which is funded with about $ 200,000 from the city and an equal amount from the rescue mission .

At first , Mark and Dave felt certain the Maestas family would be one of the success stories .
Joe would get a job .
Little by little , the family would build up a rainy - day reserve , then start saving toward bigger goals .
At their second meeting , in mid-April , Dave showed Christina how to track household expenses on a spreadsheet .
Mark gave
Joe the name of a friend who had a warehouse job available .
The job was Joe’s .
All he had to do was call .
He did n’t .
“ It ’s been excuse after excuse after excuse , ” Mark fumed in early June .
Advertisement
In the spring , Joe said he would start work after the children settled into their new schools .
Then , he thought he should stay home while they were on summer vacation .
He told Dave and Mark that he had his resume out .
But he went fishing a lot .
As the weeks dragged on , no one seemed motivated to set up the third mentoring session .
Dave and Mark could tell from brief phone calls with Joe that the Maestas family was struggling .
The starter switch in their ’ 87 GMC van had died .
The crankshaft was broken on their other car , an Oldsmobile with more than 100,000 miles .
Grocery bills were up because the neighborhood school had not yet started serving free summer meals .
The couple had missed part of a rent payment , though they caught up a few weeks later .
Dave wanted to help ; how easy would it be for him to lend Joe $ 100 to fix the van ?
“ But then it becomes something else and something else , and that defeats the point of teaching them to become self - reliant , ” he said .
Instead of offering Joe cash , he gave the boys baseball gloves and the girls a few board games .
Advertisement
Mark was far less sympathetic .
During his stretch of unemployment , he ’d worked two , three , four part - time jobs to keep his family afloat .
Joe ’s laid - back attitude annoyed him .
“ He ’s a really likable , good - hearted guy , but it ’s like , what are you doing , dude ? ”
Mark said .
“ It ’s like they do n’t want to get ahead . ”
He tried to remind himself that he was there to serve the family , not to impose his values on them .
“ When you ’re a Type A person like I am , it ’s frustrating , but I ca n’t nag Joe , ” Mark said .
“ I ca n’t judge him .
It ’s not my life .
All I can do is try to help him . ”

Changing minds
Through the summer , as they struggled to keep their frustration in check , Mark and Dave watched the Maestases closely over several meetings .
They saw a family that worked .
Joe brushed the snarls out of Angel ’s thick brown hair .
He took Corie fishing , and when she caught an 18 - inch trout , he brought it back to show Christina .
Domonic cleaned out his dad ’s fishing tackle and surprised his mom by picking up the yard .
He watched while his sisters careened around on their bikes , making sure they did n’t veer into traffic .
When the chains slipped off the bikes after one too many screeching halts , Joey sat on the stoop to fix them .

“ You could line up your kids against mine , and yours would be better - behaved , ” Dave told Christina in late August at their last formal meeting .
“ I really honestly believe that ’s because Joe ’s been with them the whole time , ” she said .
“ I told him , ‘ If you get a job and the kids start messing up , you ’re back home . ’ ”
Angel ran over , waving the Barbie doll Dave had given her .
“ Her shoes come off !
Her shoes come off ! ” she squealed .
“ She ’s pretty , ” Dave said , inspecting the Barbie solemnly .
“ But not as pretty as you are . ”

Angel glowed .
Christina shared her smile .
Though she was working at least 50 hours a week , she was more relaxed than she ’d been in years .
She had received a raise at the auto - parts store in April , to $ 12.31 an hour .
With overtime , she took home about $ 2,400 a month , enough to splurge on a cable package and high - speed Internet for the old computer Dave had given them .
When Dave presented her with a binder of spreadsheets , Christina hugged it to her chest .
On her own , she ’d never been able to plan her budgets ahead ; if she had money at the end of the week , she spent it .
Now she knew exactly how much she needed for upcoming bills .
With school starting , she saved up to buy each of her children three new outfits at Wal - Mart .
Joey wore a World Wide Wrestling T - shirt , so new the creases still showed .
Corie twirled to show off her favorite dress , purple with a plaid pleated skirt .
Christina even found an extra $ 60 so Joey could join the high school golf team .
“ It feels great , ” she told Dave and Mark .
“ No stress , man .
I love it . ”

A few months earlier , Mark might have tried to push her to do more , perhaps save a fixed amount from each paycheck .
Now , he just nodded .
He did n’t even press her for details on a job Joe had said he might be starting soon , with a relative ’s construction crew .
“ Different people put value on different things , ” Mark said .
“ I ’ve thought about it a lot the past few weeks .
Getting that house , having that van , having that family -- that ’s enough for them .
“ And when I think of how we do it -- a $ 340,000 home with a huge mortgage , two fancy cars , working all the time -- maybe we ’re the ones that got it wrong . ”
His tolerance had limits .
In his final report , Mark would give Joe and Christina only an average chance of becoming self - sufficient .
He would also recommend letting future families join the program only if both adults were willing to work .
But asked how the experience affected him , he checked the box marked “ positive . ”

Over the summer , Mark and his wife had faced an unexpected opportunity to adopt two young girls from foster care .
Mark knew taking in the girls would leave them living nearly paycheck to paycheck .
But he thought of Christina and Joe , and he said yes .
“ Do I want to drive an old van like they do ?
Do I want to live where they do ?
No .
But I do n’t want to live in a $ 5 - 6-700,000 house anymore , ” Mark said .
Dave , too , started thinking of life differently .
He had always taken seriously his Christian duty to help the poor .
Every Christmas , he and his wife would drive downtown to hand money to the homeless .
Now he saw that cash was the least of it .
“ You can hand them $ 10 and check it off your list , ” he said .
“ Or you can stop , say , ‘ Hi , my name is Dave , ’ and make them feel part of society .
. . .
I gained the courage to do that . ”

After they ’d talked a while at a donated table -- no more eating on the floor -- Christina , Dave and Mark went out back to enjoy the late - afternoon sun .
The girls rode bikes through the dirt yard , ducking under the jeans that flapped from the clothesline .
( The old dryer had finally broken . )
Domonic watched to make sure Angel did n’t ride into the alley .
Joey stood at attention , practicing for ROTC .
As the mentors stood waving at the girls -- and discussed how to get Christina another dryer by winter -- Joe turned into the driveway , home from a fishing trip .
He shook hands with Mark and Dave but did n’t talk much about his job .
“ I have n’t worked in a while , so I ’m a little nervous about it , ” he said .
“ But I ’m ready .
This is what I wanted to do . ”
A few weeks later , Joe told his mentors the job had fallen through .

I ’m happy ; Cool Stack was just a first step .
This is something I ’ve been arguing for since approximately fifteen minutes after arriving here .
The publicity is here , here , and especially here : Sun Optimized AMP Stack for the Solaris 10 OS .
There ’s lots of marketing language , but I think the essential thing is that Sun is going to try to be a first - rate supplier of all the important pieces of open - source Web - facing software .
The job is n’t finished yet , until all of Apache and MySQL and PostgreSQL and PHP and Python and Ruby and Rails are in the package , all optimized for Solaris , all stuffed with DTrace probes , and all with developer and production support available .
It wo n’t be long .
Acronyms are funny .
In LAMP , everything ( but , it seems , the “ A ” ) is replaceable .
SAMP is kind of boring .
I proposed MARS for MySQL / Apache / Ruby / Solaris , and the Postgresians ( got a few of ’em here ) like PARS .
Or PADS for Django - heads .
Make up your own .
It was many years ago , perhaps as many ago as 15 or more .
It was before my Aunt took the hormones and underwent top surgery to become a man , that 's how long ago it was , so long ago she was still calling herself a " lesbian . "
It was Pride Day in Lawrence , Kan. , and they marched and did their thing and then they all returned home , and my Grandma Bonk , she cornered my Uncle by the icebox and told him that the preacher man who was leading a protest against the marching homosexuals was mean .
How was he mean , Mom , asked my Uncle .
" He called me a ' buttfucker , ' " said Grandma Bonk , placing her hand to her mouth as an amplifier and whispering the word loudly , as if to spare anyone else from hearing her utter the swear .
That 's right , and this actually happened .
It is one of the greatest stories to come out of my family .
Fred Phelps of the Westboro Baptist Church , Topeka , Kan. , allegedly looked my Grandma in the eye and called her a buttfucker .
Ain't. Karma .
A Bitch .
A very wise , very enlightened jury Wednesday delivered a $ 2.9 million verdict against Phelps ' for picketing the funeral of a Maryland Marine .
Picketing soldiers ' funerals is a common practice for this " church . "
They believe that the soldiers ' deaths are punishment against the United States for its tolerance of homosexuality .
I am not so vain to believe that the full weight of this award has been instant karma's way of vindicating the honor of my Grandma Bonk .
But I do think we 're entitled credit for a few thousand of it .
If you can look an old woman in the eye and tell her sheâ€™s a buttfucker , then friend , you donâ€™t need the Lord .
You need Prozac .
One would think that the Phelps ' beliefs are on the fringe , that these people are radical nutbars who should n't be taken seriously .
That is , until you recall what the formerly alive national religious leader Jerry Falwell had to say following the attacks of September 2001 : " I really believe that the pagans , and the abortionists , and the feminists , and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle , the ACLU , People For the American Way , all of them who have tried to secularize America .
I point the finger in their face and say â€ ˜you helped this happen . ' "
This is the man who founded Liberty University , which today churns out the superstitious idiots who are running our government .
Falwell was , I would argue , one of the most powerful , central religious leaders in this nation , a man who made presidents and shaped one of the most powerful , successful political alliances in modern U.S. history , and he actually believed that a supernatural being who resides somewhere in the clouds actually cares with whom you are kertanging , to the point that he waved his magic wand and sent four airbuses to attack vital targets in the Untied States of America and to kill more than 3,000 people .
I take some solace in this beautiful tort result , to think that the Phelps family will actually have to pay restitution for their asshole antics , it is , truly , beautiful .
But it is difficult to come to terms with how much farther we will have to retreat from the dark , murky caves into which these superstitious nutbars have yanked us and led us .
It is not the " fags " creating the spiritual crisis in America .
It is the rabid , crucifix - toting " faithful " who cannot evolve past this towel - flicking , frat - boy notion of human sexuality and " In Search Of " naivet Ã© regarding spirituality and God .
I pray that this is not the last lawsuit these idiots face .
I pray they have to sell whatever assets the church possesses .
I hope they are ruined .
After all .
They did call my Grandma a " buttfucker . "

The porn industry is learning a lesson the music industry refuses to hear : Piracy does n't have to be a dirty word .
As recording industry officials sing dirges over a 2002 music - business sales slump and press ahead with lawsuits against file - sharing network platforms such as Kazaa , pornographers see an opening .
" You can't beat them , so you ought to join them , " said Exploit Systems CEO Scott Hunter .
" These are your most valued customers , the people who come specifically into your arena and say they want X , Y and Z .
This is the most inquisitive , most important community possibly in the history of business . "
Hunter 's company has developed software that helps content providers put their legitimate versions of material being pirated onto the file - share networks in such a way that it overwhelms the pirated versions of the same material .
The software also influences the search engines of Kazaa , Gnutella and Limewire so that if a user searches certain keywords , they 'll be more likely to find the legitimate version of the file they 're seeking and download that .
When users try to open up the legitimate editions , though , they may be forced to pay for it and be sent to the porn company 's homepage , or they may be allowed to watch it for free provided they ask for identifying information the company can use later for marketing purposes .
" If 15 percent of the roughly 150 million people on these networks are willing to pay for the content , that 's 20 million customers , " Hunter said .
" It 's foolish of any business to deny themselves the opportunity to make that sale . "
FalconFoto CEO
Gail Harris sees the wisdom of this approach .
" We 're willing to give away a few images , and then if you 're interested in more , we have a whole archive of hundreds of thousands of images that you can subscribe to see , " says Harris , whose company provides photos of naked people to several porn magazines including High Society and Barely Legal , and boasts an online library of more than 1 million adult images .
" What we have is a captive audience of people we know are interested in our product because they went out seeking it themselves .
Many of them are willing to pay for it , too . "
FalconFoto has aligned itself with Playa Solutions , a company that promises to " wrap " content that is posted on the Internet in such a way that the content provider can set the rules of how it is used .
Playa 's approach is to flood the file - share networks with the legitimate content on purpose in what is known as " viral marketing . "
Playa Solutions founder Jason
Tucker insists the music industry could easily apply this technology .
For instance , a record label could spread a clip of the new Britney Spears single before it 's released and force those who listen to it to visit the official Spears website – where they can buy a copy of the album .
The Recording Industry Association of America refused to comment on the prospect of learning anything from the pornography business , a stance that reflects the business ' uneasiness with anything that would legitimize the concept of copyright infringements .
One music official said privately that porn customers are seeking an immediate gratification that they 'll pay for , whereas music consumers are n't quite so desperate for their fix .
Hunter and Tucker disagree , noting that devotees of singers and bands would also be willing to pay for the material – if only someone would ask them .
" What we have to do is to modify behavior so people will purchase this way , not take this way , " Hunter said .
" They do n't pay because they 've never had to .
But now it 's time to make some order out of the chaos – and it's a wonderful chaos . "
何の縁があったか知れないが、同じ会社に入ってきた若い連中がいる。最初は無邪気に元気で、まあ能力は少し足りなくても、それでもまあ頑張ってくれと思っていた。しかし、ある頃から彼らがどんどん生気をなくした顔になっていく。やがて、元気だった彼らも、用事を頼んでも怯えたような顔で目をそらしたり、しどろもどろに説明する手先がぶるぶる震えるようになり、数ヶ月後には鬱病だの心身症だのなんだのになって退職していくことになる。
そんなの珍しくもないという業界もあるだろう。俺の仕事も、まあそんなもんだ。だから、実際に直属の部下にも、こういう人はいた。いま思い返すと、つくづく悪いことをしてしまった。もちろん、なんとかしようとは思っていたし、出来ることはやった。でも、成果は最悪のものだった。俺だけの責任ではないのだが、少なくとも、俺とその周囲はその人が能力を発揮する可能性を潰した。これが現実であり、結果だ。
小飼弾の書くことで気に入らない理由は二つあって、一つは彼の書いていることは無闇な青春讃歌で、しかも「歳とってみりゃわかるよ青春の価値は」みたいな妄言であることなのだが、そういうのはプロ野球からだけではなくこの世から消えてしまって欲しい。で、もう一つは、可能性が発揮されるのは堪え難い負荷を克服した後だ、という無邪気なお題目で、甘やかされた中流みたいに命や死を軽んじた論法が繰り広げられていることだ。「俺は死にかけたけど、頑張ってよかったよ」「人間って案外簡単には死なないね」と、ここまではまだいい。でも、「死ぬより可能性がつぶれる危険の方が大きいのに、死ぬことを懸念しているのは喜劇だ」となると、冗談は顔だけにしろということになる。
彼と一緒に働いている（いた）人の中には、ものすごい負荷をかけてもなんとかやり通してしまうタイプの人間と、精神や身体（この２つは別々のものじゃない）に変調をきたして脱落した人間の２種類がいる（いた）はずだ。この業界では、別に珍しい話ではない。そして、何の偶然か知らないが、小飼弾の自己認識では彼は前者のタイプだったようだ。それはそれで御目出度い限りなので別に文句はないが、今やそんな彼も歳をとったし、ちょっと視点を変えてみることは出来ないだろうか。
例えば、もし彼が上司として職場で指揮を執っていたら、彼は前者のタイプの部下たちの可能性をどこまでも引き出すことが出来るかもしれない。商売繁盛、株価上昇、大変御目出度い。でも、その一方で後者のタイプの人たちの可能性は、間違いなく潰してしまうだろう。それどころか、相談に来た彼らに、
そこで考えを止められる、あるいはそこまで考えたところで息の根を止められるというのはかなり幸せなことではないか。
問題は、その後に生き残ってしまうことも多々あること。いや、確率から行けば、その方がずっと高いのだ。するとどうなるのか、「これ以上何もしないで死ぬ」ということが、「何かのために最適」という状態になるのだ。そのような状態を、私は「余生」と呼んでいる。
などと説教するかもしれない。自分の信じる変態でマゾな幸福論をぶちかますことで、己の正しさに光り輝くのも、ある局面では結構なことだろう。でも、ちょっと待ってもらいたい。可能性だなんだという前に、ずっと低いとはいえそれなりの確率で人が死ぬなら、それはシステムとして間違っていることなんじゃないだろうか。それに、コキ使っているうちにくたばった人がいたとして、その人の親御さんに「何かの為に死ねる(死んでもいいと思える)ということは基本的に幸せなことだと思う」などどふざけたことがどうして言えるだろうか。まあ、言うのは自由だし我々は世論と体制が許す限り自由である素晴らしい社会の一員なので、勝手にすればいいのだが、もし俺がそんなことを言われたら、「じゃあお前が死ね」と答えるだろう。
そういう意味で、この日記の人もとんでもない思い違いをしている。いや、この人は本当に自分が死ぬなんてことは想定していないのかもしれない。でも、
労働を強制されるのは最悪のことだが、死んでしまうぐらいに働けるなんて幸せじゃないか。というか、何かの為に死ねる(死んでもいいと思える)ということは基本的に幸せなことだと思う。
なんてことは、奴隷が奴隷に向かって話す、あるいは領主が奴隷に向かって言い放つ以外には口にしてはいけない言葉なのだ。何かの為に死んでもいい、と思うのは基本的には自己陶酔でしかない。己の想像世界の中で精一杯粋がるのも中産階級市民の大いなる自由の一つだが、死なれる側にとっては、なんとか死なないで済む方法はなかったのか、どうして死ななければいけなかったのかという終わらない問いだけが残されるものだ。奴隷だもんね、と言われたらそれなりの説明もつくだろう。でも、普通は人の自己認識はそうじゃない。
そう、小飼弾の書いたことで本当に気に入らなかったのは、彼が自己陶酔の中でどんな寝言を言い放とうが全くもって彼の勝手なのだが、世の中の人間にその寝言を当てはめていくと、誰かの子供であったり夫であったり親であったりする人間を、
実際そのころ、私は何度か自殺未遂もしている。そのころの私にとっては、それすら「壁を越える」方法の一つに思えたのだ。はっきり言って、莫迦である
なんて状態に追い込むことをいかにして防ぐのか考え、実践するのが正しいことであって、追い込まれた人を「死なない確率の方が高い」と誤摩化して丸め込んだり、そんな状態を生み出すシステムを是正したいと考える人の文章を引用して
この設問は 、” depends on whom ? ” だけではなく 、” depends on how old ? ” でもある。同じ人でも、それが人生のどのステージにいるかによって、どうすべきかの答えは変わってくるからだ。
とルー大柴みたいなご見解を述べることで「（才能、能力は）人によるよね」「歳食ってみりゃわかるよね」などと曲解してしまうのは間違っていると思うのだ。
最後に、小飼弾の署名も間違っている。正確には、Aging man with misguided fantasy だ。わかる人にはわかるように、これはレジデンツの歌詞だ。
結局つまらん冗談と駄洒落が言いたいだけなんじゃないか、と憶測される文章を書くことで小飼弾へのオマージュとする。
Surprise :
The rich get richer and the poor get more numerous
In California , jobs grow at high and low ends of pay scale - but not in the middle

Steven Bustin lives with his wife in a four - bedroom , 2,600 - square - foot house in Novato .
He drives a gray 2006 Audi A4 .
He earns more than $ 200,000 a year in salary and commissions from his job as head of sales for Podaddies , an Internet startup that sells online video ads .
Tamara Johnson lives with her three children in a two - bedroom apartment in the Sunnydale housing project in San Francisco 's Visitacion Valley .
She drives a used 2003 Buick Sebring with 74,000 miles on it .
Last year , she brought in just under $ 12,000 from her job as a home health care worker , supplemented by disability payments for two of her kids .
Bustin and Johnson represent California 's increasingly polarized economy .
The gap between the state 's rich and its poor is getting bigger .
The bulk of job growth in California over the last generation took place at the top or bottom of the pay scale , a trend that has accelerated since the beginning of this decade .
Jobs in the middle are scarcely growing at all .
The changes are documented in a report based on census and tax data set for release today by the California Budget Project , a liberal research and advocacy group .
" The story of the past generation is one of widening income inequality , " the group says about the state .
It 's well documented that the gulf between highly paid and low paid people is growing across the country .
But it is more pronounced in California , according to census and tax records .
The divisions suggest that poverty will persist despite California 's growing economy .
And the erosion of middle - income jobs could make the American dream of climbing the economic ladder harder to achieve in the state , the budget project warned .
" You 're in essence taking steps out of the ladder , " said Jean Ross , the group 's executive director .
" These are troubling signs for our society . "
The growing disparity between the wanting and the well - to - do shows up starkly in pay data .
Since 1979 , 26.9 percent of new positions created in California were in such categories as food service and retail trade , which paid hourly wages in the bottom fifth of all jobs , the report finds .
At the other end of the spectrum , 28.1 percent of new jobs were in such categories as administration and management , which paid in the top fifth .
The breach has expanded this decade .
From 1999 to 2005 , 43.1 percent of California 's job growth occurred among jobs at the lowest 20 percent of the pay scale .
About 54.4 percent of new jobs were in the top 40 percent of pay .
Only 2.6 percent of growth came among jobs at 20 to 60 percent of the pay scale .
" We 're having a hollowing - out of job growth , " Ross said .
As a result , California 's population is polarizing .
A large group at the top enjoys a standard of living significantly higher than it did three decades ago .
Another large group is living worse .
A shrinking fraction of people in the middle is getting squeezed , according to the budget group 's study .
-- From 1979 to 2006 , the hourly pay of California 's low - wage workers fell by 7.2 percent after adjusting for inflation .
High - wage workers saw gains of 18.4 percent , while those exactly in the middle edged up 1.3 percent .
--
The richest Californians are capturing a growing share of wealth .
Income reported for tax purposes of the top 1 percent of the state 's taxpayers jumped 107.7 percent from 1995 to 2005 , after adjusting for inflation .
During the same period , income of the middle fifth of taxpayers rose 9.3 percent .
-- California households are losing ground compared with their counterparts elsewhere .
A California household in the middle of the scale saw inflation - adjusted income from wages , investments and other sources grow 3.1 percent between 1989 and 2005 .
Nationwide , income for a typical household rose 5.4 percent .
Jobs are growing at the top and bottom for many reasons .
But those factors can be summed up in a word - globalization .
California lost 464,700 manufacturing jobs - many of them paying middle - class wages - between 1990 and 2006 , much of that work moving overseas .
Meanwhile , the service sector boomed .
The category includes low - paid jobs , such as retail clerks , and well - paid jobs , such as lawyers and accountants .
The California employee head count of Walgreens , the rapidly expanding drug store chain , surged to 14,900 in August 2007 from 8,000 five years before , a company spokeswoman said .
Other trends are intensifying the income gap .
California has lots of immigrants willing to accept low - wage jobs .
Fewer of the state 's workers belong to trade unions , which historically have given workers bargaining power .
An increasing proportion of the nation 's income is going to corporations , which benefits households that invest in stocks and bonds .
And federal policies have reduced the tax burden on upper - income households .
Education is the main factor separating winners and losers .
From 1979 to 2006 , California workers with bachelor 's degrees saw real wage gains of 19.8 percent .
Wages of workers with master 's degrees or higher jumped 34.4 percent .
But high school graduates ' wages fell 4.4 percent after adjusting for inflation , while the wages of those who did not graduate high school plunged 23.7 percent .
Some experts believe California is losing middle - income jobs because of the high cost of doing business and public policies that drive employers out of the state .
Many of the state 's middle - income manufacturing and service - sector jobs have moved to states such as Arizona and Texas , where wages are lower and government policies friendlier to business , said Joel Kotkin , an expert on California 's cities and a presidential fellow at Chapman University in Orange .
The budget project 's report " did n't deal with infrastructure , did n't deal with competitiveness , " Kotkin said .
" You have to look at tax climate and regulatory climate .
Business climate matters in terms of job creation . "
Of course , Steven Bustin and Tamara Johnson are n't bits of data , nor do they want to be poster children for California 's rich and poor .
Neither fits stereotypes of suburban affluence or inner-city poverty .
Still , both live lives that are , to a very considerable degree , reflections of the means they have at hand .
Bustin , 55 , does n't have a particularly lavish lifestyle .
He and his wife , Gigi , give several thousand dollars each year to Catholic charities and other causes .
He recently wrote a book about the cruiser on which his father served during World War II .
He and Gigi prefer kayaking in San Francisco bay to a weekend in a fancy hotel .
" We are mindful of the budget , " Bustin , a native of Baltimore , said .
Still , they have the income for luxuries , such as a vacation last year in Hawaii 's Big Island and the occasional dinner at fancy restaurants .
San Francisco 's pricy Boulevard is a favorite .
Johnson , 35 , who grew up in Berkeley , does n't have many choices .
She is raising an 8 - year - old son and 9 - and 15 - year - old daughters in crime - ridden public housing , where $ 744 in monthly rent eats up most of her paycheck .
She does the best she can for her kids , taking them to parks and the zoo on weekends .
Her oldest daughter has developed a passion for all things Japanese , so the city 's Asian Art Museum is a frequent destination .
She has considered a move to the Dublin area or even to Sacramento , safer environments than Sunnydale , but can't find the time to make arrangements .
Her life " is very difficult , " she said .
" I have to squeeze , squeeze , squeeze every penny .
And there 's no resources to help . "

Carine is nearly a year old
Until now it was not known whether eggs obtained in this way could survive thawing to be fertilised .
The advance spares women from taking risky fertility drugs that can cause a rare , yet deadly condition - ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ( OHSS ) .
Canadian researchers told a fertility conference in Lyon three others were expecting babies by the same process .
The first , named Carine , now nearly a year old , is healthy and developing normally .
These pregnancies are an exciting step
Dr Laurence Shaw
British Fertility Society
The findings hold particular hope for patients with cancer - related fertility problems .
Chemotherapy can cause infertility and , therefore , some women with cancer opt to have their eggs collected and frozen before they start their cancer treatment .
But not all women will want or be able to delay having chemotherapy to undergo ovarian stimulation .
Certain tumours , including some breast cancers , can grow if the woman takes drugs to stimulate the ovaries , for example .
Early stages
Dr Hananel Holzer and colleagues at the McGill Reproductive Center , Montreal , cautioned that their technique - in vitro maturation or IVM - had not yet been tried on women with cancer .
The women they studied had polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) - a condition where the ovaries are covered in cysts which can impair fertility and which is linked with an increased risk of OHSS .
Of 20 women , four achieved pregnancy with the technique .
Dr Holzer said : " Until now , it was not known whether oocytes collected from unstimulated ovaries , matured in vitro and then vitrified , could survive thawing , be fertilised successfully and result in a viable pregnancy after embryo transfer .
" We have demonstrated for the first time that it is possible to do this and , so far , we have achieved four successful pregnancies , one of which has resulted in a live birth . "
He warned the research was still in its early stages .
Moderate or severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome can occur in 3 - 8 % of IVF cycles .
Expand choices
Professor Robin Lovell - Badge , of the Medical Research Council 's National Institute For Medical Research , said : " Each step in this work had been achieved before , but this is the first time they have been successfully strung together .
" It is important as it will expand the choices available to women with diseases of the ovary or cancer and the clinicians treating them . "
Dr Laurence Shaw , spokesman for the British Fertility Society , said : " These pregnancies are an exciting step .
However , the pregnancy rate is very low and therefore large numbers of eggs would be needed . "
He stressed that it was a treatment suitable for people with fertility problems linked to conditions such as PCOS or cancer , and not for women who merely want to delay having a family .

Socialist Party USA and Peace and Freedom Party have been sharply critical of the Democrats and Republicans , due to their failure to make ending homelessness a national priority .
As a result of this failure , the nation ’s homeless population may experience sharp increases within the next two years due to the recession and inflation .
Federal assistance is now imperative .

In Fresno , California , city workers were wrapping up final preparations for the big Veteran ’s Day celebrations and many of those arriving early to celebrate the day were veterans from WWII , the Korean War , the Vietnam War and both Iraq Wars and Afghanistan .
Many of the veterans stood along the sidewalk proudly wearing there brushed off military uniforms .
Only a few blocks away there were hundreds of homeless people , including veterans that were roaming the streets with their possessions in a shopping carts or hauling their few possessions in plastic bags being carried on their backs .
At the 99 Freeway and Fresno Street off ramp , stood a veteran collecting donations from drivers waiting for the traffic light , holding a small sign that read , “ Veteran needs food and shelter , please help . ”
In his face one could see the scars of war and the scars from living on the streets .
A recent report by the National Alliance to End Homelessness notes that veterans make up one in four homeless people in the United States ; the N.A.E.H. also estimates that in 2006 there were 495,400 veterans homeless at some time during that year .
Many veterans returning to the U.S. from Afghanistan and the Iraq
War are finding it difficult to find jobs ; they are also receiving little or no support with food , clothing or shelter .
Thousands of veterans are also returning home in need of medical and psychological assistance .
In many situations , the hardships of many veterans are extended to entire families .
Some veterans are living on the streets , sometimes with friends and relatives ; sometimes with their mate and children .
This national crisis most often creates financial challenges for cities , counties , states and local community groups attempting to offer some limited assistance .
Presently the VA is spending approximately $ 2 billion on homeless programs and health care cost for homeless veterans ; however this amount falls extremely short of addressing the critical needs of veterans nationwide .
It is also important to note that as many as 744,000 Americans are homeless on the streets and more than a million Americans are living without a permanent home .
The U.S. government cannot wait another 10 years to address this growing crisis .
Homelessness is among the most rapidly developing crisis that is happening to working class people nationwide .
Over the next 10 years , Congress must include an additional $ 10 billion annually in the federal budget to offer programs to assist veterans with food , clothing , shelter , employment and medical assistance ; surely our veterans deserve more .
Funding would also include administrative cost , providing employment opportunities for veterans ; all employees receiving equal pay and equal benefits .
Congress should also include an additional $ 35 billion in the annual budget , over the next 10 years , to assist others in need of food , shelter , clothing and medical assistance .
These programs , for veterans , the homeless and needy , should function together to provide assistance for any individual or families needing help .
An additional $ 45 billion in the national budget , dedicated to assisting U.S. veterans and homeless people , is only a small amount compared to the $ 100 ’s of billions that the Democrats and Republicans are spending on the Iraq War to protect the interest of U.S. and European capitalists .
Socialist Party USA and Peace and Freedom Party have been sharply critical of the Democrats and Republicans , due to their failure to make ending homelessness a national priority .
As a result of this failure , the nation ’s homeless population may experience sharp increases within the next two years due to the recession and inflation .
Federal assistance is now imperative .
For more than three decades Socialist Party USA and Peace and Freedom Party have been committed to socialism , democracy , ending homelessness , abolishing vagrancy laws and providing decent affordable housing for all .

A few months ago , the Texas legislature was in the midst of a slugfest over the state 's congressional redistricting efforts .
Republicans were in the driver 's seat with 17 of 32 districts and Democrats were trying like anything to avoid losing additional seats .
How bad was it ?
Well , Democrats were mad at Republicans for trying to pull a fast one ; Republicans were mad at Democrats for leaving the state to avoid voting on the plan ; Democrats were mad at Democrats for jumping ship and returning to Texas ; and Republicans were mad at Republicans as they bickered over the spoils .
What a mess .
You'd think that there would be an equitable and fair approach in creating these districts .
Well , all this led my friend Noah Kennedy to suggest that perhaps the problem could be solved in a more equitable ( and perhaps " technocratic " ) manner maybe just a simple matter of some well thought - out and executed software .
" Fair and equitable congressional redistricting " can be defined as : 1 . Districts of equivalent population size , while ; 2 . minimizing a district 's perimeter .
The subdivision of the population would obviously be performed with a blind eye to the voting preferences of a given region .
Given these parameters , this problem started to feel as if it might yield to an optimization - solving algorithm .
While there are many approaches to solve for an optimal solution of this type , this looked similar to a genetic algorithm approach I 've used to solve the traveling salesman problem .
Perhaps , I could use a variation of the same approach to find an optimal redistricting solution for Texas ?
I was determined to help Texas .
A fair and equitable redistricting solution should provide :
Thirty - two equal population groups .
Compact district land representation to avoid gerrymandering .
Given these two points , how would you go about finding an optimal solution ( the needle ) among all the suboptimal solutions ( the haystack ) ?
The first criteria ( equal population size ) appears easy enough to apply just divide the districts into 32 equal population groups .
The second criteria becomes a constraint to the first criteria and complicates matters .
One tactic to satisfy the second condition would be to select 32 " centroids " within the state of Texas .
A centroid would " attract " all the near or local population and , therefore , construct a congressional district .
These 32 districts would then satisfy the second condition ensuring a district 's compactness ( that is , minimizing its perimeter length ) .
To test this approach , I used a year 2000 census dataset of 4390 data points with latitude , longitude , and population data .
Population for each data point varied in size from 1000 to 12,000 , with an average of about 5000 people .
The job , therefore , was to find the set of 32 centroids out of the 4390 available points such that each district would have equal population sizes .
Genetic Algorithms
Genetic algorithms are a rather straightforward , flexible optimization - solving technique that are modeled after evolutionary forces in nature ( see the text box " Genetic Algorithms " for more details ) .
A typical genetic - algorithms approach uses an array of Booleans to represent an organism ( each Boolean is considered a gene ) .
An example of an organism is :
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 |...| 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 n - 2 n- 1 n
The district representation cannot use Boolean values but needs to represent each gene as belonging to a specific district ( therefore , a gene can have a value of 1 to 32 ) :
| 1...32 | 1...32 | 1...32 |... | 1...32 | 1...32 | 1 2 3 4389 4390
There would be 4390 genes in this representation ( one for each point in the dataset ) .
The array of genes within an organism represents a solution to the problem being solved ( in this case , Texas redistricting ) .
All possible combinations of genes within the array are considered a valid organism ( or solution ) .
Unfortunately , this representation does not lend itself well to the problem at hand ( most organisms would violate the compact district representation constraint ) .
The internal representation of the organism should be further simplified for this problem .
You can modify the organism such that each gene represents a centroid and can have a value of 1 to 4390 ( one value for each point in the dataset ) , then the organism contains 32 genes :
| 1...4390|1...4390|1...4390 |...
|1...4390|1...4390|
1 2 3 31 32
Each gene now represents a centroid that will be used to assign all remaining local population data points .
A limitation with this representation is that a gene 's value must be unique within the organism ( that is , no duplicate centroids within an organism ) .
These changes force modifications to the standard genetic - algorithm operations ( crossover and mutation ) performed on the organism .
One final feature needs to be defined for this technique to workrating an organism 's fitness .
How will the genetic algorithm determine whether a particular organism represents a good or poor solution ?
The fitness criteria can be defined as a partial , standard deviation calculation performed on the population spread within an organism .
This is sufficient to rate the fitness of a solution .
The lower the standard deviation , the better the solution ; that is , the more equal the population sizes are across the 32 congressional districts .
An important aspect of a good fitness criterion is that it represents a continuous solution space there are no or few discontinuities .
A discontinuity may prevent convergence to an optimal solution .
The partial standard deviation equation as it applies to the fitness function is :
Fit = ( PopDist - PopAvg ) * ( PopDist - PopAvg )
where PopDist is the population of the district and PopAvg is the average population size for all districts .
Now , technocrats , flex your fingers and warm up your keyboards as we are ready to go to work and show the world what a little magic can do .
Implementation and Design
The design consists of two main object hierarchies the organism and the genetic population .
The genetic population is a collection of organisms ( see Figure 1 ) .
Both the organism and population behaviors have been generalized into base class implementations .
Primitive data types have been templatized for these classes to allow for greater flexibility over the range of behaviors and characteristics for the organisms and populations .
GENOrganismBase is the base class for the organism ( see Figure 1 ) .
It is templatized with the data type that represents each gene .
The type is specified by the derived class DistrictOrganism in this case , the PopPoint data structure .
The PopPoint structure represents a single centroid location , the size of the centroid data point itself , plus the size of the total population assigned to this centroid .
float m_fLat ; // latitude float m_fLon ; // longitude unsigned long m_ulPop ; // gene 's population only unsigned long m_ulTotalPop ; // total district population unsigned short m_usID ; //pop ID
With a typical genetic algorithm approach , the template argument would normally be a Boolean rather than PopPoint .
Again , using the PopPoint representation does affect the mutation and crossover operations ( and are implemented in the derived class : DistrictOrganism ) .
GENOrganismBase methods mateWith ( ) and mutate ( ) are pure virtual methods and are required to be overridden by the derived class ( DistrictOrganism ) .
The method mateWith ( ) supports crossover operations , while mutate ( ) supports ( wild guess here ) mutation .
DistrictOrganism derives from GENOrganismBase and provides this specialization in behavior .
Within DistrictOrganism :: mutate ( ) ( Listing One ) , mutation is no longer a random toggling of a Boolean cell value , but instead a random selection of one of 4390 values ( provided that that value is not already represented within the gene sequence ) .
Therefore , the 32 genes are passed in as a constraint to the mutate ( ) method .
Access to the full set of data is through the helper object DistrictBucket , which provides the method randomPick ( ) .
randomPick ( ) lets the DistrictOrganism pass in a collection of data points to be excluded from the random - selection process , thereby preventing duplicate genes from being represented within the organism .
The randomly selected PopPoint then replaces the selected gene .
This condition operates at a frequency of fRate , which should be rare enough that convergence to an optimal solution is allowed , but not infrequent enough so that new paths to the optimal solution are not tested .
Crossover behaves in a similar fashion to mutation .
In DistrictOrganism : : mateWith ( ) ( Listing One ) , the crossing point of two organisms is a random location within the sequence of genes that is constrained to the unique set of genes between the two organisms ( iLoc ) .
This constraint is required so that duplicate cells do n't appear as a result of a crossover operation .
The organism is then spliced together with a partial set of the genes from the other organism at the crossover point .
Population of Organisms
The DistrictPopulation class derives from the GenPopulation base class .
The GenPopulation base class is templatized on the data type representing the organism ( which needs to derive from GENOrganismBase ) ; in this case , the derived DistrictOrganism implementation .
Within the DistrictPopulation class , the main method of interest is the evolve ( ) method ( Listing Two ) .
This method contains the processing loop that evolves each organism within a generation .
Reproduction , crossover , and mutation are performed to produce a new generation of organisms based on the previous generation .
Each iteration of the population selects two adjacent organisms and determines if they should reproduce ( at the reproduction rate ) .
If these organisms reproduce , organisms possessing a higher fitness rating will be given preference .
Crossover and mutations operations are applied on each organism .
Finally , at the end of an evolution sequence , the method GENPopulation : :evolutionComplete ( ) is called , which performs a rating of the new generation of solutions .
The DistrictFitness class contains the fitness computation ( derived from base class GENFitness ) that performs the final and critically important step , rating the organisms according to their worthiness .
Within this specific solution , the algorithm accesses the complete set of population data and assigns each population point to a gene until all population points have been assigned .
Assignment is applied via a simple rule , where each population point is assigned to the nearest gene ( centroid ) .
Total populations are computed for each district , then a partial standard deviation is computed .
The reason that this is a partial deviation ( without applying the square root ) is that the comparison of the fitness is the same with or without the square root ; therefore , the computation can skip the CPU - expensive square root .
The fitness computation is followed by a scaling operation .
Scaling lets the implementation adjust the dynamic range of the fitness values and therefore aid the search for the optimal solution .
The scaling can be overridden by the implementer just as the fitness is allowed to be overridden .
DistrictScale is implemented and overrides the base class implementation ScaleFitness .
This class provides an adjustment to the dynamic range of the fitness values .
The ScaleFitness base class provides no modification ( that is , it multiplies the passed - in value by one ) .
To improve the chances of good organisms surviving into future generations , the fitness value is squared in the derived implementation .
In initial runs of the genetic - algorithm system , I found that good organisms were often dying out before they were allowed to propagate to the next generation ; therefore , I wanted to give good organisms an additional weight to survive the reproduction stage .
By applying the square of the fitness , this skews the survival rate in favor of more fit organisms .
In general , the scaling , if applied correctly , provides for a faster convergence to an optimal solution .
Optimal Solutions
Figure 2 shows the convergence of the best gene by generation .
The convergence trend shows that this approach continues to search and find better solutions note that the x -axis is a log scale ; therefore , to continue that same rate of improvement will take exponentially more time .
The shape of the convergence plot can dramatically be affected by the reproduction rate , crossover rate , and mutation rate .
For example , a higher mutation rate gives a less smooth convergence plot .
The best solution found is in Figure 3 ( computed after 9176 generations ) .
The district population points are color coded to show where the optimal districts would exist in the state of Texas .
Centroid points that constitute the center of a district are shown as numbers ( black ) .
Table 1 shows the same solution but with the population for each district and the difference from the average population each district would optimally have .
This is a good solution , but further processing would probably yield an even better solution .
Given the structure of the data ( 4390 population points ) and the limitation that districts were centered around " centroids , " it would be possible to further converge on population equivalence between the congressional districts .
Two approaches not applied here could be used to further improve this solution :
Change the nature of the centroid picking such that a finer granularity of selection on the centroid would be found .
Change the fitness function such that the fitness would allow " trading " population between adjacent districts to further even out the population differential between districts .
Additional work should be done to define district boundaries .
One approach to defining a boundary representation for each district would be to compute the convex hull around each district ( the group of population points ) and then generate a voronoi graph around these regions .
Conclusion
This work probably took less time than the effort expended in the halls of the Texas legislature .
However , I suspect that the current political process in Texas would find little to embrace in this fair ( and optimal ) solution so this becomes an exercise in possibilities .
An infinitely more complex problem would be to model the political process and resulting redistricting solution for that , probably no amount of optimization magic can be applied .

ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
Over dinner recently , Anna Peele recalls one of the first times she drank alcohol .
" I was like 14 or 15 , " Peele says .
" I ordered a beer and they served me . "
She had just finished her freshman year of high school and was traveling in Greece with family friends .
" We would just have wine with dinner , " Peele says .
" In Greece it 's so not a big deal . "
Anna Peele 's parents allowed her to drink at family functions and social events when she was in high school .
While that experience would cause some American parents to worry , Peele 's parents were n't upset .
In fact , starting in middle school , her parents allowed her and her siblings to have an occasional sip of beer or wine .
By the time she was in high school , Peele was drinking beer and wine regularly at family functions and social events .
But it was always in moderation , Peele says .
She says her parents ' attitude toward alcohol made it seem less mysterious .
" It was n't some forbidden fruit , " Peele says .
" I did n't have to go out to a field with my friends and have 18 beers . "
Experts say binge drinking continues to be a growing problem across the country .
According to a recent report from the U.S. surgeon general , there are nearly 11 million underage drinkers in the United States .
Nearly 7.2 million are considered binge drinkers , meaning they drank more than five drinks in one sitting .
In this age of " just say no , " some people believe it is time for Americans to reconsider how they teach kids about alcohol .
Peele 's father is at the top of the list .
" We taught them to drink in a civilized fashion , like a civilized human being , " says Stanton Peele , psychologist and author of " Addiction - Proof Your Child . "
He says many of the programs set up to stop alcohol abuse contribute to the teen binge - drinking crisis .
Any program that tells kids flatly not to drink creates temptation , he says .
" Preparing your child to drink at home lessens the likelihood that they are going to binge drink , " he says .
" Not sharing alcohol with your child is a risk factor for binge drinking . "
Peele says other cultures have figured it out .
He points to Italy , Greece and Israel , where children are given small amounts of wine at religious celebrations or watered - down alcohol on special occasions .
But many other experts say the psychologist is off base .
" That 's ridiculous , " says Calvina Fay , executive director of the Drug Free America Foundation .
" By allowing teens to drink , " Fay says , " you are giving permission to your children to do harmful things . "
In the spring of 2007 , the U.S. surgeon general 's office issued its first " Call to Action " to stop underage drinking .
" This is not something that is a rite of passage , " says acting Surgeon General Kenneth Moritsugu .
" It has an impact , short term and long term . "
" When I went to medical school , " Moritsugu says , " the science at that time told us that our brains had finished developing at 2 or 2 and a half .
Over the past few decades ... science shows our brains continue to develop well into our mid-20s " .
Fay also says Stanton
Peele does n't take into account other consequences of teen drinking , such as unsafe sex and drunken driving .
" You do n't have to be addicted to be harmed or die because of drugs and alcohol . "
But the psychologist contends that kids are going to drink no matter what and that it is critical for parents to set the example .
" I think the key to preventing all kinds of addiction is to make sure that your child values life , values himself and has purpose in life , " he says .
" That 's the single most important thing . "
Now 19 , Anna Peele is a sophomore at New York University .
She wants to be an actress .
She does drink with her friends , but she says that it 's always in moderation and that she is well aware of her responsibilities .
" Your parents expect you to do your work and get the most out of your education .
...
They 're not paying for us to drink . "

Nancy Pelosi relased this statement in reaction to the CRS report on the costs of the Iraq debacle :
" Think about what $ 10 billion a month would mean to protecting Americans from terrorism , improving security at our ports and airports , and increasing border security .
Think about what $ 10 billion a month would mean for the 47 million Americans who do n’t have health insurance , for the survivors of Hurricane Katrina , and for the education of our children .
Think about what $ 10 billion a month would mean to lowering the deficit so that future generations are not burdened with debt .
" The American people are outraged at the Bush Administration ’s misplaced priorities -- that is why Congress will hold the Administration accountable with votes this month to end the war and redeploy the troops .
This will include a vote on legislation to begin redeployment of our troops within 120 days and to conclude by April 1 , 2008 , with the exception of those remaining in Iraq to fight terrorists and protect our diplomats .
" The date - certain legislation gives our Republican colleagues another opportunity to join Democrats in heeding the wishes of the American people , who want to wind down this war and bring our troops home . "
As I mentioned in my previous post about Lenny Guerente ’s book “ Ageless Quest , ” aging research has , within the last 15 years , gone from being a scientific backwater to a mainstream field of scientific research , with new discoveries now regularly featured on the cover of Nature or Science ( as in the Nature issue from June 2007 below . )
Although we now are capable of manipulating the aging process , including significantly extending the lifespan of many laboratory animals , it is still a frustrating fact that there is no consensus about the ultimate cause or causes of aging .
One viewpoint , which is probably only held by a significant minority of scientists in the field , is that the aging process is strongly connected to mitochondria , which are the power plants or batteries of our cell , converting nutrients into useful packets of energy in the form of ATP .
We ’re used to the idea that electronic equipment fails when the batteries go dead , so it ’s not such a stretch to take a close look at the mitochondria .
What ’s more , mitochondria produce much of the “ pollution ” in the cell in the form of the free radicals that are a by - product of the oxidative phosphorylation process ( the process that turns nutrients into energy ) .
Those free - radicals can damage proteins or DNA , particularly the mitochondrial DNA ( this is special DNA , inherited from the mother , that resides in the mitochondria rather than the nucleus ) that codes for a few essential mitochondrial proteins .
So one theory says that there is a kind of vicious circle , whereby old mitochondria start emitting more free radicals , which further damages the mitochondria , until the mitochondria are so damaged that they do n’t produce sufficient energy and start damaging the rest of the cell .
Right now , the consensus view on whether the experimental facts really fit that theory is “ Maybe . ”
If you want to learn more about mitochondria , I highly recommend “ Power , Sex , Suicide : Mitochondria and the Meaning of Life ( you ’ve just got to love that title ) , by Nick Lane .
Lane ’s book is popular science , but it ’s a very deep book , and actually proposes theories , including theories of aging , that you wo n’t see elsewhere in the literature .
It ’s not an easy book to read , but it ’s very worthwhile .
Alternatively , you might enjoy this video of Douglas Wallace lecturing on the role of mitochondria in diseases and aging .

New high - speed video footage has revealed the extraordinary dexterity with which rats use their whiskers .
The rodents are able to move these groupings of feelers independently on each side of their heads , allowing them to navigate efficiently in the dark , the film shows .
It was previously assumed that rats lacked the ability to isolate the movement of their whiskers , says Tony Prescott at the University of Sheffield in the UK .
To get a more sophisticated view of this animal behaviour , he and colleagues used high - speed cameras and muscle sensors to record how rats swept their whiskers across various surfaces .
When the whiskers on one side of the rodents ’ face hit a surface , they slow down by around one - third , the team found .
Meanwhile , those whiskers on the other side begin rapidly sweeping back and forth , even more broadly , in search of another contact point ( watch a rat ’s asymmetrical whisker activity in this video , 2.3 MB , requires Quicktime ) .
Prescott notes that rats are nocturnal animals and therefore rely on their whiskers to help them sense their environment when it is difficult to see .
It is like how a person would use their hands to navigate through a room in the dark , he says .
In that situation , one might reach a hand out and hit a wall at which point one ’s other hand would begin searching more actively to find out where the wall extends , he explains .

Liberals Go After Fox News Advertisers
By DAVID BAUDER
NEW YORK ( AP ) – Liberal activists are stepping up their campaign against Fox News Channel by pressuring advertisers not to patronize the network .
MoveOn.org , the Campaign for America ’s Future and liberal blogs like DailyKos.com are asking thousands of supporters to monitor who is advertising on the network .
Once a database is gathered , an organized phone - calling campaign will begin , said Jim Gilliam , vice president of media strategy for Brave New Films , a company that has made anti-Fox videos .
The groups have successfully pressured Democratic presidential candidates not to appear at any debate sponsored by Fox , and are also trying to get Home Depot Inc. ( HD ) to stop advertising there .
( Original Article )
A federal appeals court on Monday issued a landmark decision ( . pdf ) that holds that e-mail has similar constitutional privacy protections as telephone communications , meaning that federal investigators who search and seize emails without obtaining probable cause warrants will now have to do so .
" This decision is of inestimable importance in a world where most of us have webmail accounts , " said Kevin Bankston , a staff attorney for the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
The ruling by the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Ohio upheld a lower court ruling that placed a temporary injunction on e-mail searches in a fraud investigation against Steven Warshak , who runs a supplements company best known for a male enhancement product called Enzyte .
Warshak hawks Enzyte using " Smiling Bob " ads that have gained some notoriety .
The case boiled down to a Fourth Amendment argument , in which
Warshak contended that the government overstepped its constitutional reach when it demanded e-mail records from his internet service providers .
Under the 1986 federal Stored Communications Act ( SCA ) , the government has regularly obtained e-mail from third parties without getting warrants and without letting targets of an investigation know
( ergo , no opportunity to contest ) .
But a district court held that the SCA violates the Fourth Amendment by allowing the feds to secretly seize e-mail without probable cause warrants .
Under the SCA , the government is required to get warrants for any e-mails that have been stored on third - party servers for less than 180 days .
( the SCA came into effect long before the days of eternal Gmail storage . )
After that , it can use an administrative subpoena or a different court order , provided it notified the target of the investigation .
( the feds missed their legally mandated deadline for notifying Warshak by nearly a year . )
To make matters more complicated , the government argued that the definition of " electronic storage " in the statute meant the feds only needed warrants when e-mail had yet to be opened or downloaded .
" The DOJ reading of the statue in practical terms is that any e-mail you have opened it can obtain without a warrant , " Bankston said .
But the district court ruled that the Fourth Amendment holds otherwise .
And the appellate court affirmed the lower court 's decision , agreeing that e-mail users have a reasonable expectation of privacy , regardless of how old their correspondence is and where it is stored .
From the decision :
" In considering the factors for a preliminary injunction , the district court reasoned that e-mails held by an ISP were roughly analogous to sealed letters , in which the sender maintains an expectation of privacy .
This privacy interest requires that law enforcement officials warrant , based on a showing of probable cause , as a prerequisite to a search of the e-mails . "
To reach its decision , the court relied on two amici curiae that presented compelling arguments for shoring up current privacy law with respect to e-mail .
Both the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( together with the ACLU
and the Center for Democracy and Technology ) and a coalition of internet law professors argued that e-mail is a vital form of communication in today 's world and its privacy must be safeguarded under the constitution lest society 's ability to engage in unfettered debate and discussion be eroded .
From the EFF amicus brief ( .pdf ) :
" This case must be considered in the context of one overriding fact : millions of Americans use email every day for practically every type of personal business .
Private messages and conversations that once would have been communicated via postal mail or telephone now occur through email , the most popular mode of Internet communication .
Love letters , family photos , requests for ( and offerings of ) personal advice , personal financial documents , trade secrets , privileged legal and medical information — all are exchanged over email , and often stored with email providers after they are sent or received .
These myriad private uses of email demonstrate society ’s expectation that the personal emails sent and received over the Internet and stored with email providers are as private as a sealed letter , a telephone call , or even papers that are kept in the home . "
From the internet professors ' brief :
" E-mail has become so indispensable that it must be reasonable for us to expect that it is private .
One who looks at our e-mails obtains a detailed view into our innermost thoughts ; no previous mode of surveillance exposes more .
When we compose private and professional e-mails , embed links to Internet sites in some , and attach documents , pictures , sound files and videos to others , we rely on the privacy of the medium .
Society does not make us rely at our peril but rather accepts as reasonable our expectations of privacy in e-mail . "
Because of the secrecy in which SCA
investigations have been conducted , it 's impossible to say how widespread this kind of government snooping into e-mail has been .
" We do n't know how often [ it 's happened ] , " said Susan Freiwald , a law professor at the University of San Francisco who submitted one of the briefs .
" The only way to find this out is if the ISPs told us or the government told us .
The information is not reported to Congress . "
Bankston suggested that the practice was widespread : " It is absolutely routine .
It is and has been the Department of Justice and presumably local law enforcement 's standard practice for obtaining e-mails over the last 20 years . "
There have been no previous constitutional challenges of the
SCA , likely because ISPs do n't want to cause trouble and targets of investigations do n't know that their e-mail is being read .
" This demonstrates the importance of judicial review , " Freiwald said .
" You do n't ask an agency to set its own governing rules . "

If there is a God , why does he / she allow disasters like earthquakes and Microsoft ?
dvice_null :
Are you comparing a disaster that causes billions of dollars financial losses and thousands of people to lose their home every year , to a natural movement of tectonic plates ?
That 's low .
Where do all those numbers in the newspapers come from ?
Here 's a funny thing .
The Commons committee on science and technology is taking evidence on " scientific developments relating to the Abortion Act 1967 " .
Scientific and medical expert bodies giving evidence say that survival in births below 24 weeks has not significantly improved since the 1990s , when it was only 10 - 20 % .
But one expert , a professor of neonatal medicine , says survival at 22 and 23 weeks has improved .
In fact , he says survival rates in this group can be phenomenally high : 42 % of children born at 23 weeks at some top specialist centres .
He is quoted widely : the Independent , Telegraph , on Newsnight , by Tory MPs , and so on .
The figure has a life of its own .
In the media , you get one expert saying one thing , and another saying something else .
Who do you believe ?
The devil is in the detail .
One option is to examine the messenger .
John Wyatt is a member of the Christian Medical Fellowship .
He did n't declare that when he went to give evidence .
You do n't have to .
He did declare it when asked .
Prof Wyatt has relevant research experience but there were half a dozen other medics without any relevant background who submitted evidence ( or their view of it ) to the committee who , when asked if they had anything to declare , did mention membership of Christian or evangelical groups with an established position on abortion .
I do n't care for an argument that rests on competing ideologies , so let 's look at Prof Wyatt 's evidence , because it has been hugely reported and it goes against the evidence from a huge study called Epicure .
Epicure contains all of the data for every premature birth in 1995 and 2006 .
It shows a modest improvement in survival for births at 24 weeks , but no significant improvement in the 10 - 20 % rate for births at 22 and 23 weeks .
For the next bit , you need to understand one simple piece of primary school maths , which is central to medical statistics .
In the sum 3/20 , 3 is the numerator and 20 is the denominator : 15 % survive ; 3 out of 20 .
For Epicure , the numerator is survival to discharge from hospital , and the denominator is all births where there is a sign of life , carefully defined : 3 out of 20 .
There are two ways you could get a higher survival percentage .
One would be a genuine increase in the number of babies surviving , an increase in the numerator : 8 out of 20 live births survive , 40 % .
But you could also see an increase in the survival percentage by changing the denominator .
Let 's say , instead of counting as your denominator " all births where there is a sign of life in the delivery room " you counted " all babies admitted to neonatal intensive care " .
Now that 's a different kettle of fish altogether .
To be admitted to neonatal ICU , the doctors have to think you 've got a chance .
Often you have to be transferred from another hospital , in an ambulance , and for that you really do have to be more well .
Therefore , if your denominator is " neonatal ICU admissions " , your survival rates will be higher , but you are not comparing like with like .
That may partly explain Prof Wyatt 's figure for a very high survival rate in 23 - week babies .
But it 's not clear .
First in his written evidence he said that the data was from a " prospectively defined " study ( where they say in advance what they plan to collect ) .
Then he was asked in the committee , when giving his oral evidence : " What was the denominator for that ?
Was that ... 42 % survival at 23 weeks of all babies showing signs of life in the delivery room , or was it a proportion of those admitted to neonatal intensive care directly or by transfer ? "
Prof Wyatt replied : " The denominator was all babies born alive in the labour ward in the hospital at UCL [ University College London ] . "
This , as later became clear , turned out not to be true .
Then he was asked to send the reference for the claim .
He did so .
It was merely an abstract for an academic conference presentation three years ago .
It did not contain the figures he was quoting .
He then says he has done the raw figures on a spreadsheet , especially for the committee , bespoke , if you will , and sent them in .
They are entered into the record as a memo , on October 18 .
They show new , different , although broadly comparable figures : 50 % survive at 22 weeks , then down to 46 % at 23 weeks , then up to 82 % at 24 weeks , then down again to 77 % at 25 weeks .
( That bouncing around is because the raw numbers are so small that there is a lot of random noise ) .
And the denominator ?
Prof Wyatt is clear : " I have provided the numbers and percentage of infants born alive at University College London Hospitals who survived to one year of age . "
The committee asked for clarification of this .
Finally , October 23 , another memo arrived , from Prof Wyatt , entered into the record , for all to see .
For the widely quoted 42 % survival rate at 23 weeks , Prof Wyatt admitted that the denominator was all babies admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit .
But in his new special analysis , giving this new " 46 % survive at 23 weeks " figure , the figures in the previous paragraph , he claimed , the denominator was " all live births " .
Has he undone a prospectively designed study , and retrospectively re-designed it ?
Or is this now a completely different source of data to the original reference ?
I do n't blame Prof Wyatt , but the figure has taken on a life of its own .
There may have been yet another mistake here , about the denominator .
I do n't know .
I 'm quite prepared to believe that UCL may have unusually good results .
But science is about clarity and transparency , especially for public policy .
You need to be very clear on things like : what do you define as a " live birth " , how do you decide on what gestational age was , and so on .
Even if this data stands up eventually , right now it is non-peer reviewed , non-published , utterly chaotic , personal communication of data , from 1996 to 2000 , with no clear source , and with no information about how it was collected or analysed .
That would be fine if it had n't suddenly become central to the debate on abortion .
How do you compute the volume of a cat ?
Dunking it in water does n’t work– you only get the volume of the rat - like creature that lives inside the cat ; much like the feeble alien within a Dalek .
( And , if your answer had anything to do with contour integrals , get real . )
Here is a low - tech method that works :
Using successive approximation , determine the smallest box that the cat will fully enclose itself in , and measure the size of that box .
Cats tend to leave a few appendages hanging out of the corners– you may need to assist with folding the cat into the box for the final stages of approximation .
This cat is approximately 648 cubic inches in volume .
Whatever one ’s view of the possible benefits of the war , the costs have been enormous .
More than 3,500 Americans have been killed so far , and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis .
Millions of Iraqis , among them much of the educated elite , have fled the country .
The one clear winner from the invasion and the consequent civil strife has been neighboring Iran , whose fellow Shiites dominate the Iraqi government .
Far from suppressing terrorism , the war has aroused widespread anti-Americanism and bred a new generation of terrorists .
Some Bush critics , starting with his first presidential campaign , have put him down as stupid .
He is not stupid .
He was an effective , if ruthless , candidate .
Some who have dealt with him as president — people outside his circle — have found him informed when he was really engaged with a problem .
But his attention to many issues has been fitful .
“ We ’ve got a great chance to establish a Palestinian state , ” he said in a 2004 press conference , “ and I intend to use the next four years to spend the capital of the United States on such a state . ”
But for much of the next several years the Bush administration was disengaged from the Israeli - Palestinian conflict .
Bush seems to lack the intellectual curiosity that makes for an interesting mind .
For all of Draper ’s admirable effort to paint a full picture , warts and all , it is a bit of a struggle to read more than 400 pages about George W. Bush .
Draper admires what he calls the “ affable compassion ” of Bush as a candidate in 2000 , before he turned out to be a hard - line conservative on both economics — lower taxes for the rich — and social issues like stem cell research and abortion .
His folksy
Texas style , even his clumsiness with words , are attractive to many Americans .
His occasional locker - room lingo is more natural than Richard Nixon ’s awkward efforts .
“ We ’re kicking ass ” in Iraq , he told Australia ’s deputy prime minister this year .
But there is another , less attractive part of the Bush persona : the mean - minded frat boy .
At the 1992 Republican National Convention , Senator John McCain was about to speak for the re-election of Bush 41 when young George came up to him and said , according to Draper , “ You ’ve gotta hammer Clinton on the draft dodging . ”
That from a man who had weaved his way out of serving in Vietnam .
McCain replied , “ Sorry , that ’s not my thing . ”
On Jan. 31 , 2001 , soon after taking office , Bush held a cabinet meeting .
When he entered the room , one chair was empty : the secretary of state’s .
“ Lock the door , ” Bush said .
A few minutes later Colin Powell could be heard trying the doorknob .
The room “ erupted with laughter . ”
Then Bush ordered the door unlocked .
He “ had made his point , ” Draper says ; Powell was “ not the big dog any longer . ”
That the president of the United States would want to show how important he was by humiliating Colin Powell speaks volumes .
Draper ’s thesis is that the immature Bush was transformed by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 .
“ All the man ’s undersized , self - conscious ways — the smirk , the reedy defensiveness , the exaggerated imperiousness of his executive stroll — had collapsed into this new persona .
...
He was a war president now , and perfectly at ease with the role . ”
Hindu activists say the canal project will damage Lord Ram 's bridge
The report was withdrawn after huge protests by opposition parties .
The report was presented to the Supreme Court on Wednesday in connection with a case against a proposed shipping canal project between India and Sri Lanka .
Hindu hardliners say the project will destroy what they say is a bridge built by Ram and his army of monkeys .
Scientists and archaeologists say the Ram Setu ( Lord Ram's bridge ) - or Adam 's Bridge as it is sometimes called - is a natural formation of sand and stones .
No evidence
In their report submitted to the court , the government and the Archaeological Survey of India questioned the belief , saying it was solely based on the Hindu mythological epic Ramayana .
They said there was no scientific evidence to prove that the events described in Ramayana ever took place or that the characters depicted in the epic were real .
Hindu activists say the bridge was built by Lord Ram 's monkey army to travel to Sri Lanka and has religious significance .
In the last two days , the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has launched a scathing attack on the government for questioning the " faith of the million " .
Worried about the adverse reaction from the majority Hindu population of the country , the Congress Party - led government has now done a U - turn and withdrawn the statement submitted in court .
The government asked the court for three months to try and sort out the issue .
Additional Solicitor General Gopal Subramaniam , appearing on behalf of the government , said they would set up a mechanism to hear concerns expressed by those opposed to the canal project .
The court adjourned the matter for three months saying they would take up the case again in January .
In the meantime , the court has said that dredging work for the canal could continue , but Ram's Bridge should not be touched
Road blocks
On Wednesday , Hindu hard - line organisations blocked roads across India to protest against the Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project .
Commuters in the capital , Delhi , were stuck in traffic jams for hours as Vishwa Hindu Parishad ( World Hindu Council ) and Bajrang Dal blocked roads at various places .
Road blocks were also held in Bhopal , the capital of the central state of Madhya Pradesh , on the Delhi - Agra highway and on the Jaipur - Agra highway .
Train services were disrupted in many places across northern India .
The canal project proposes to link the Palk Strait with the Gulf of Mannar between India and Sri Lanka by dredging a canal through the shallow sea .
This is expected to provide a continuous navigable sea route around the Indian peninsula .
Once complete , the canal will reduce the travel time for ships by hundreds of miles and is expected to boost the economic and industrial development of the region .

Following the murder of Alexander Litvinenko , the UK government asked for formal extradition of Andrei Lugovoi , a former KGB agent who had met with Litvinenko the day he fell ill .
The UK ’s director of public prosecutions Ken Macdonald said Lugovoi should be extradited to stand trial for the murder of Litvinenko by “ deliberate poisoning ” after Polonium - 210 was found in numerous places visited by Lugovoi that day .
Russia denied the extradition request and negligible progress has been made on the case .
Four months since the May extradition demand from the UK , Andrei Lugovoi has resurfaced .
At a congress for the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDPR ) , he announced his intentions to be an MP for the party , confirmed by LDPR party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky .
If elected , Lugovoi will be granted immunity from prosecution from Litvinenko ’s murder .

Olympic Champion Marion Jones Stripped of Medals and Records Wiped Out
, track and field champion , has fallen from grace .
Today she was stripped of all of the medals and awards that she has amassed since the 2000 Olympic games .
Her stats have been removed from the record books .
All of these sanctions were levied today by the " International Association of Athletics Federation " .
The disgraced athlete has returned five Olympic medals and is said to owe $ 700,000 in prize money that must be returned , according to the Track and Field governing body .
She is said to be broke which may not bode well for reimbursement .
The IAAF also recommended that relay team members must forfeit their medals as well .
It will be up to the IAAF to upgrade other athletes who may now qualify for the medals and awards that have been returned by Jones .
Whether the federation will pay out prize money to upgraded athletes is unclear .
The disgraced athlete has been banned from competition until October 2009 .
Jones retired after making a public disclosure that she had taken the designer steroid " the clear " from September 2000 to July 2001 , making it unlikely she will attempt a comeback bid in two years .
The photo illustration shows brain areas important to intelligence .

A primary mystery puzzling neuroscientists -- where in the brain lies intelligence " -- just may have a unified answer .
In a review of 37 imaging studies related to intelligence , including their own , Richard Haier of the University of California , Irvine and Rex Jung of the University of New Mexico have uncovered evidence of a distinct neurobiology of human intelligence .
Their Parieto - Frontal Integration Theory ( P - FIT ) identifies a brain network related to intelligence , one that primarily involves areas in the frontal and the parietal lobes .
Their report includes peer commentary from 19 researchers and appears online in the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences .
“ Recent neuroscience studies suggest that intelligence is related to how well information travels throughout the brain , ” said Haier , a professor of psychology in the School of Medicine and longtime human intelligence researcher .
“ Our review of imaging studies identifies the stations along the routes intelligent information processing takes .
Once we know where the stations are , we can study how they relate to intelligence . ”
The data suggest that some of the brain areas related to intelligence are the same areas related to attention and memory and to more complex functions like language .
Haier and Jung say this possible integration of cognitive functions suggests that intelligence levels might be based on how efficient the frontal - parietal networks process information .
Brain imaging studies of intelligence are relatively new , with Haier doing some of the first ones only 20 years ago .
Although there is still discussion about how to define and measure intelligence , Haier and Jung found surprising consistency in the studies they reviewed despite the fact the studies represented a variety of approaches .
In his peer commentary , University of Washington psychologist Earl Hunt writes : “ The Jung & Haier P - FIT model shows how far we have progressed toward understanding the biological basis of intelligence .
Twenty - five years ago researchers in the field were engaged in an unedifying discussion of the relation between skull sizes and intelligence test scores .
By taking advantage of the huge advances in measurement of the brain that have occurred in the past quarter century , [ Jung and Haier ] can take the far more sophisticated view that individual differences in intelligence depend , in part , upon individual differences in specific areas of the brain and in the connections between them . ”
Haier and Jung have made some of the seminal findings in intelligence studies .
In a 2004 study , they found that regions related to general intelligence are located throughout the brain and that a single “ intelligence center , ” such as the frontal lobe , is unlikely .
And in a 2005 study , they found that while there are essentially no disparities in general intelligence between the sexes , women have more white matter and men more gray matter related to intelligence test scores , suggesting that no single neuroanatomical structure determines general intelligence and that different types of brain designs can produce equivalent intellectual performance .
“ Genetic research has demonstrated that intelligence levels can be inherited , and since genes work through biology , there must be a biological basis for intelligence , ” Haier said .
“ We have a long way to go before we understand the details , but our P - FIT model provides a framework for testing new hypotheses in future experiments . ”

This article 's title is taken from The Revenge of the Shia by Martin Walker , published in Autumn 2006 issue of The Wilson Quarterly .
The geopolitical situation in the Middle East is becoming more complicated and riskier all the time .
This article primarily discusses Iran 's geopolitical strategy , energy policies and energy predicament .
In the final analysis sections , Saudi Arabia 's reactions , in the context of the Iraqi civil war , are discussed .
The outcomes are not known but it is not a pretty picture , especially for Japan , China and the EU , which depend on Iranian oil exports .
Nor , probably , for the rest of us .
Abdullah and Mubarak , two of the most prominent Sunni leaders , have , along with senior Saudi officials , evoked the specter of a new Middle East divided along sectarian lines .
It would set the ­long - ­downtrodden Shia against their traditional Sunni masters , rulers , and landlords .
If the first battlefield was Iraq , the two leaders suggested , the next would be the ­oil - endowed regions of the Persian Gulf , southern Iraq , and Azerbaijan , where Shia happen to live .
In this scenario , the ayatollahs of Shiite Iran could then secure control of the Iraqi , Saudi , and Caspian oil and gas fields by placing them under the protection of their own nuclear arsenal , thus establishing the first Islamic state to achieve great - power status since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in ­1918 .
Describing Sunni fears explicitly , Walker continues .
To understand the " Shia Crescent " and the fears of Saudi Arabia , it almost suffices to look at a good map .
The geography of the Islamic Sunni and Shiite sects
Figure 1  Click to enlarge
I shall return to the plausibility of the nightmarish scenario suggested by Figure 1 at the end .
What is important , however , is that 1 ) Iran has both potential geopolitical advantages and serious obstacles to overcome ; and 2 ) Saudi Arabia perceives the Shia uprising outcome as a realistic possibility and has good reasons to fear it .
See Stuart Staniford 's A Credible Threat ? for background regarding the second point .
Iranian Oil Production and Exports
While Iraq is the trigger , Iran is the key .
It is quite impossible to discuss Iran 's political policies outside the context of their oil production , yet this is done all the time .
Usually the talk is framed as worry about their nuclear ambitions .
However , even this pending capability can not be understood unless you have also grasped the economic and energy pressures Iran is facing .
Therefore , let 's examine Iran 's anticipated oil production , as well as related issues concerning domestic consumption , natural gas and downstream capabilities , in some detail .
From the EIA Country Brief
Figure 2
The issue is Iran 's oil exports  these are forecast to decline .
A spate of news stories accompanied the release of The Iranian petroleum crisis and United States national security by Roger Stern , who is in the Department of Geography and Environmental Engineering at The Johns Hopkins University .
Stern 's analysis provides a springboard for a proper analysis of Iran 's oil production .
Here 's the summary .
The U.S. case against Iran is based on Iran ’s deceptions regarding nuclear weapons development .
This case is buttressed by assertions that a state so petroleum - rich cannot need nuclear power to preserve exports , as Iran claims .
The U.S. infers , therefore , that Iran ’s entire nuclear technology program must pertain to weapons development .
However , some industry analysts project an Irani oil export decline [ e.g. , Clark , J.R. ( 2005 ) Oil & Gas Journal 103( 18 ) :34–39 ( subscription ) ] .
If such a decline is occurring , Iran ’s claim to need nuclear power could be genuine .
Because Iran ’s government relies on monopoly proceeds from oil exports for most revenue , it could become politically vulnerable if exports decline .
Here , we survey the political economy of Irani petroleum for evidence of this decline .
We define Iran ’s export decline rate ( edr ) as its summed rates of depletion and domestic demand growth , which we find equals 10 – 12 % .
We estimate marginal cost per barrel for additions to Irani production capacity , from which we derive the ‘‘ standstill ’ ’ investment required to offset edr .
We then compare the standstill investment to actual investment , which has been inadequate to offset edr .
Even if a relatively optimistic schedule of future capacity addition is met , the ratio of 2011 to 2006 exports will be only 0.40 –0.52 .
A more probable scenario is that , absent some change in Irani policy , this ratio will be 0.33 –0.46 with exports declining to zero by 2014 –2015 .
Energy subsidies , hostility to foreign investment , and inefficiencies of its state - planned economy underlie Iran ’s problem , which has no relation to ‘‘ peak oil . ’’
:  Stern refers to , which is the estimated amount of oil in place ( OIP ) that has been produced .
Regarding depletion , the overall globalis about 37 % which means that , on average , when reservoirs are depleted ( produced ) to that extent , all of the recoverable oil that can be produced has been produced .
What Stern actually means is Iran ' sin existing production , as will be made clear below .
Iran 's export decline rate , the edr , is calculated by assuming an annual , constant 8 % decline in existing production flows " plus its domestic demand growth rate ( 5 % ) ( from Clark ) expressed as a percentage of total production ( 2 % ) , i.e. , 10 % . "
Stern assumes Iran 's current production is about 4.0 mbd with exports amounting to about 2.5 mbdsee Figure 2 .
In this scenario , Iran 's exports will just about disappear by 2015 .
I made the same conjecture in November , 2005 , here at The Oil Drum and used exactly the same decline rate .
See the article for the details .
Interestly enough , Stern states that his conclusion has no relation to ‘‘ peak oil ’’ , the only reference in his paper to this loaded phrase .
Au contraire , Roger .
First , the EIA tells us that " roughly 60 percent of Iran ’s oil production comes from fields more than half a century old . "
Consequently , Clark 's Oil & Gas Journal article op cit states that Iran is losing 350 kbd of oil production and the declines " could increase to 500,000 b/d / year by the end of the decade .
Onshore decline rates have risen to 8 % / year from 7 % / year and offshore decline rates to 13 % / year . "
Futhermore , the EIA states that " the [ existing ] fields are in need of upgrading , modernization , and enhanced oil recovery ( EOR ) efforts such as gas reinjection .
Current recovery rates are just 24 - 27 percent . "
Clark , citing Dr. Fereidun Fesharaki , head of FACTS Global Energy , describes the ongoing debate within Iran concerning natural gas exports .
The argument made by Iran 's elected representatives is that all of Iran 's available gas production  if not lost in flaring and wet gas shrinkage  will be needed to meet domestic consumption needs and for enhanced oil recovery to achieve higher incremental production flows .
Here is the country with the 2nd largest natural gas reserves in the world debating whether they can afford to export gas .
Amazing .
Opponents to gas exports , led by Kamal Daneshyar , head of the Energy Committee of the Majlis ( parliament ) , say Iran has 30 fields in need of gas injection totaling 12 - 14 bcfd .
Only 3 bcfd currently is being injected .
All of the 20 bcfd the opponents say will be needed for injection by 2010 to avert a massive decline in oil production would come from South Pars .
Stern isthat the National Iranian Oil Company ( NIOC ) has begun exporting gas in the last few years .
It seems irrational to him that NIOC is not devoting more of the available natural gas to enhanced oil recovery , let alone investing to produce more of it .
Instead , more and more gas is being used for generating electricity and other non-essential stuff like that .
What Stern seems to be unaware of is that such EOR techniques come with a injecting gas for post - primary oil recovery to boost reservoir pressure will work for some years , but the end will come and declines will likely be steep , as has apparently happened at Cantarell ( NO2 injection since the mid-1990's ) .
At that point , you do n't have the oil and you have n't sold the gas , either , though you may have been able to recycle some of the gas in the recovery .
On the other hand , perhaps it makes more sense , in the world of the future , to boost revenues by creating a healthy natural gas export business , a business that could generate profits for decades .
If these are not ‘‘ peak oil ’’ issues , perhaps I do not understand what is meant by this phrase .
What A Mess !
This [ oil production decline ] is what is happening in Iran , which has failed to reinvest in new production .
Why ?
For the mullahs , the short - run political return on investment in oil production is zero .
They are reluctant to wait the 4 to 6 years it takes for a drilling investment to yield revenue .
So rather than reinvest to refresh production , the Islamic Republic starves its petroleum sector , diverting oil profits to a vast , inefficient welfare state .
Employment in the loss - making state - supported firms of this welfare state is essential to the regime 's political survival .
Another threat to exports is the growth in domestic demand .
Iranian oil demand is not just growing , it 's exploding , driven by a subsidized gasoline price of about 9 cents a liter .
This has created a 6 percent growth in demand , the highest in the world .
So Iran burns its candle at both ends , producing less and less while consuming more and more [ Note :  my emphasis , I could n't have stated this so - called ‘‘ peak oil ’’ issue better myself -- DC ] .
Dr. Stern scolds
Iran for making foreign investment difficult , if not impossible , blaming them entirely for their oil production problems .
This is the familiar refrain of the IEA and the international oil companies .
Stern isthat Iran is not cooperating to allow the much greater production which wouldfollow on greater investment .
And , there 's more .
Here , I shall cite his editorial Iran actually is short of oil  Muddled mullahs .
See his full article published by the National Academy of Sciences for the details .
So , Iran 's leadership is also culpable for using its oil revenues to subsidize internal consumption .
That 's not how it 's taught in Econ 101 and , of course , it 's true because Iran 's oil production is not sustainable  they do n't teach that in Econ 101 , either .
Slowing domestic demand by relaxing subsidies and more liberal political policies encouraging investment would buy time , but that 's all .
Importantly , such a policy would not make Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad or Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei very popular .
Yes , Iran does run a " welfare state " , they subsidize gasoline and even import it due to lack of refining capacity .
Yes , Iran makes foreign investment difficult , because they are negotiating the most favorable terms they can get .
It is their oil .
Part of the truth , however , is not all of the truth .
It is also very helpful to look at U.S. puts squeeze on Iran 's oil fields from the Los Angeles Times ( January 7 , 2007 ) , where we learn 
As Washington wages a very public battle against Iran 's quest for nuclear power , it is quietly gaining ground on another energy front : the oil fields that are the Islamic Republic 's lifeblood .
Iran 's oil industry has raked in record amounts of cash during three years of high oil prices .
But a new U.S. campaign to dry up financing for oil and natural gas development poses a threat to the republic 's ability to continue exporting oil over the next two decades , many analysts say .
The campaign comes at a moment of unique vulnerability for Iran 's oil industry , which also faces challenges from rising domestic energy consumption , international isolation , a populist spending spree by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and trouble closing contracts with foreign oil companies — a recipe for potential disaster in a nation with one of the world 's largest reservoirs of oil .
" If the government does not control the consumption of oil products in Iran … and at the same time , if the projects for increasing the capacity of the oil and protection of the oil wells will not happen , within 10 years , there will not be any oil for export , " Mohammed Hadi Nejad - Hosseinian , Iran 's deputy oil minister for international affairs , said in a telephone interview .
The devil is in the details .
Here are some .
Stern references Chris Skrebowski's Megaprojects schedule .
As first pointed out by Ace , there is an error in the database .
Yadavaran and Kushk / Hosseinieh ( 300 kbd ) are the same oil field , but Skrebowski counts them separately .
Given this revision , let 's assume that Iran can pare down internal consumption and successfully uses gas injection EOR to revive their old fields  getting down to an overall decline rate of 8 % , not 10 % .
If all the projects on Skrebowski 's list were implemented as scheduled , and assuming a 2006 productive capacity of 4.0 mbd , then Iran 's production would be 3.815 mbd in 2013 .
Not sustainable , even in a perfect world .
Alas , the world is not perfect .
As for the edr , this will go down regardless but the decline depends on how much new production is added , as Mohammed Hadi Nejad - Hosseinian says .
It sits at about 61 % now .
In the worst case , assumed by Stern , no new capacity is added .
In his " Muddled Mullahs " story , Stern talks about the Azedegan project .
Investment in Iran has become so unattractive that even energy - desperate states have quit trying .
Japan 's Inpex , for example , just abandoned a seven - year negotiation for the Azadegan field [ 2009 , 125 kbd ] .
Had Iran been a better negotiating partner , Azadegan oil would be flowing today .
What really happened was that Japan could n't find any investment partners to develop Azedegan .
As the LA Times story op cit states :
More than two decades of U.S. sanctions have had little effect on Iran 's oil industry — U.S. - based companies have been replaced , largely by Europeans .
But this new attack on financing [ by the US ] has rapidly started to dry up potential loans on dozens of projects , according to oil industry insiders in Tehran and the West .
One of them is reportedly the giant Azadegan oil field in southwestern Iran near the Iraqi border .
Japan's INPEX Holdings Inc. in October pulled out of all but a 10 % stake in the $ 2 - billion project under U.S. pressure , and alternative financing from foreign banks has failed to materialize , said one source with close connections to the Iranian Oil Ministry .
This is the real story , as has been verified by a number of other sources .
Removing land mines left over from the Iran / Iraq war was one of the key issues  and that costs money , although it is not a standard item on the E&P expense ledger .
What really happened was that Japan could n't find any investment partners to develop Azedegan .

Removing land mines left over from the Iran / Iraq war was one of the key issues  and that costs money , although it is not a standard item on the E&P expense ledger .
Reading Stern , one would think that Iran engages in no foreign investment at all .
This is not true .
ENI is the operator at Darquain ( = Darqoein , Darkhovin ) , where 55 kbd are currently produced .
Phase 2 is delayed  Skrebowski has it in 2006  but will produce 160 kbd when completed .
Now , ENI is negotiating with Iran to operate the Azedegan field .
Furthermore , China 's Sinopec has signed on to develop Yadavaran ( 2011 ) .
However , there are problems .
Clark op cit reports that the 300 kbd target has been exaggerated by Iran 's NIOC in order to attract the investment .
Now , Sinopec and NIOC are haggling over the Chinese rate of return .
Yes , Iran prefers " buyback " contracts and is tough to negotiate with .
See Stern 's paper for details .
Finally , what is happening with Iran 's production ?
That is unclear .
As Stern notes , Iran is not meeting their OPEC quota , although that may not be a bad thing ( for now ) in so far as OPEC is attempting to cut production to sustain a floor on the oil price .
There is conflicting data .
The EIA shows fairly flat production at around 4.0 mbd but the IEA paints a different picture in its Oil Market Report , December 13 , 2006  as shown in
Iran  crude oil supply versus OPEC quota
Figure 3  Click to enlarge
As far as I know , both data sets pertain to liquids , including NGLs .
The dip in November is attributed to oil field maintenance .
What a mess !
Generally speaking , it is advantageous to know something about the oil & gas business when discussing it on NPR .
Let 's now turn to the main theme  the geopolitical outcome of Iraq 's civil war , Iran 's strategic position , the role of the United States and the Saudi Arabian reaction to these unstable factors .
Geopolitical Analysis & Saudi Arabia
Iraq is a failed state .
The Sunni / Shia civil war proceeds apace .
The Iraqi government will collapse once the U.S. starts the inevitable withdrawal of its troops .
There is little popular support for the occupation in America .
The Kurds have carved out a de facto independent state in the north , along with a separate oil policy .
The planned oil law to allow exploitation of Iraq 's oil resources by foreign companies is surreal .
Iran is enriching uranium and , if left alone , are likely a decade away from being a full - fledged nuclear power .
The U.S. and Israel will never permit that to happen , but the outcome is well down the road at this point .
In the meantime , Iran will have less and less ability to finance their economy through oil export revenues .
The U.S. is waging economic war on Iran which affects their ability to put new oil production onstream .
As the major Shia power in the Islamic world , Iran wields great influence in other Shiite regions including Iraq , where a retired four - star general told Seymour Hersch that Iran could take Basra with " ten mullahs and one sound truck " .
Now that we have a pretty good understanding of the pressures Iran is under , it is time to ask :
Here is the situation , which is presented as accurately as possible , keeping spin to a minimum .
Earthshaking geopolitical events affecting the oil supply from the Middle East are indeed possible in the next few years .
That the oil markets have decided to ignore the dangers there for the time being does not make the dangers any less real .
The Iranian " nuclear threat " is overblown , a red herring .
It has been used politically in the U.S. by neoconservatives to create another external enemy in the " Axis of Evil " .
A bomb is many years away and , in any case , the Western powers would never permit it .
Other attempts to explain it also fail .
From Stern 
The allure of nuclear power to a regime in such straits [ Iran ] is obvious .
First , Russians are financing the new capacity , something foreigners are increasingly unwilling to do for oil and gas .
[ Note :  this is false , as shown above ] .
Second , Russian reactors will substitute for power now generated by petroleum , freeing petroleum for export .
Although the prospective nuclear power capacity is insignificant to Iran ’s total energy budget , it is part of a larger if ill managed plan to preserve exports .
For example , ambitious goals have been set for power generation capacity additions from coal ( 38 ) , hydro ( 39 ) , solar , and thermal ( 40 ) resources .
Just as with petroleum , however , foreign investment in power generation has been inadequate ( 38 ) .
The power generation problem has become so acute has that the unprecedented step was recently taken to partially privatize it ....
To summarize , Iran ’s claim that its nuclear technology is entirely peaceful appears to be false ( insofar as we can judge from the statements of arms control officials ) .
However , the oil export decline we project implies that Iran ’s claim to need nuclear power to preserve exports is genuine ....
Iran 's refineries produce around 30 % fuel oil ( as opposed to 16 % gasoline ) and they have large gross exports of this oil grade .
Iran 's electricity is generated as follows .
Iran had installed power generation capacity ( 2004 ) of
about around 34.3 gigawatts ( GW ) .
Of this total , over
three - quarters was natural gas - fired , with the remainder
either hydroelectric ( 7 percent ) or oil - fired ( 18 % ) .
For
2005 , Iranian power generation capacity is expected to
reach 36 GW ) .
Source : EIA  Figure 4
Most likely , nuclear power would substitute for natural gas , thus freeing it up for export or EOR .
In part , it could substitute ( along with coal , etc. ) for fuel oil but the potential savings would be relatively small .
Therefore , one must look to political reasons for Ahmadinejad 's focus on Iran 's nuclear capability .
As Iran 's leadership has basically said all along , it is a nationalistic point of pride cynically meant for internal political consumption to appease the populist conservative base of a leadership propped up by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards .
See Iranian presidential election , 2005 for some insights .
Because Iran faces the economic crisis created by declining oil export revenues  endangering subsidies  the government 's popular support will weaken further ( especially among Iran 's poor ) over the next decade .
Hence , the nuclear rallying cry becomes ever more crucial to those in power to solidify that support .
Conveniently , declining revenues can be blamed on America , the Great Satan .
There is even some truth to the assertion , as discussed above .
Let us now turn to the real issue , which is perceived correctly by Saudi Arabia  Iranian influence in Southern Iraq and in other Shia regions , including the minority population in the Kingdom itself ( see Figure 1 at the top ) .
What will Iran really do in the face of declining oil exports ?
Will they just roll over , or as a friend told me , fade quietly away saying " Oh , well , we had a good run ... but it 's all over now . "
First , this ethnically diverse country is Persia , a country with a very long history .
Secondly , de facto control over Iraq 's southern oil fields would substitute very nicely for failing future oil exports .
Third , fomenting rebellion in Shia Saudi Arabi in the Gulf region would be potentially disruptive to the Kingdom 's oil production .
It is not unprecedented .
Shia came to occupy the lowest rung of the socioeconomic ladder in the newly formed Saudi state .
They were excluded from the upper levels of the civil bureaucracy and rarely recruited by the military or the police ; none was recruited by the national guard .
The discovery of oil brought them employment , if not much of a share in the contracting and subcontracting wealth that the petroleum industry generated .
Shia have formed the bulk of the skilled and semiskilled workers employed by Saudi Aramco .
Members of the older generation of Shia were sufficiently content with their lot as Aramco employees not to participate in the labor disturbances of the 1950s and 1960s .
In 1979 Shia opposition to the royal family was encouraged by the example of Ayatollah Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini 's revolutionary ideology from Iran and by the Sunni Islamist ( sometimes seen as fundamentalist ) groups ' attack on the Grand Mosque in Mecca in November .
During the months that followed , conservative ulama and Ikhwan groups in the Eastern Province , as well as Shia , began to make their criticisms of government heard .
On November 28 , 1979 , as the Mecca incident continued , the Shia of Qatif and two other towns in the Eastern Province tried to observe Ashura publicly .
When the national guard intervened , rioting ensued , resulting in a number of deaths .
Two months later , another riot in Al Qatif by Shia was quelled by the national guard , but more deaths occurred .
Among the criticisms expressed by Shia were the close ties of the Al Saud with and their dependency on the West , corruption , and deviance from the sharia .
Martin Walker ( at the top ) expresses doubts about the scenario outlined here , stating that " in Saudi Arabia , despite the Wahhabi clerics and their claims of Shia heresy , the monarchy has chosen to conciliate its Shia minority , easing some of the restrictions it had placed upon them . "
I 'll bet they have .
Saudis Adjust Long - Term Oil Strategy ( Rigzone , Jan. 10 , 2007 ) describes the reactions of KSA to the possible revenge of the Shia .
Saudi Arabia 's growing fear of Iranian hegemony in the Middle East may be driving the world 's largest crude oil exporter to prepare a more aggressive long - term political oil strategy that could subvert an Iranian ascendancy , insiders and analysts say .
Under a new , accelerated production program , the kingdom could increase its spare oil drilling capacity to at least 3 million barrels a day by 2011 , up from around 2 million now .
Intelligence experts estimate Iran might have the capability to develop nuclear weapons by then .
Additional spare capacity could give the Saudis greater leverage as a political tool .
Iran 's alleged aim to develop nuclear weapons and its interference in Iraqi and Lebanese politics and conflicts are feeding fears among the Sunni states in the region , particularly Saudi Arabia , that Iranian ascendancy might tip the balance of power towards a Shi'ite domination of the Middle East .
" Fear of an emerging Shi'a crescent has been reflected in speeches by Egypt 's President ( Hosni ) Mubarak , Saudi princes and clergy , and other Sunni Arab heads of states , " says Mordechai Abir , a senior Middle East analyst for Burnham Securities .
That anxiety , along with concerns for domestic security , has spurred Saudi Arabia to boost its defense spending to between $ 50 billion and $ 60 billion in the next several years for a major upgrade of its entire military .
The first phase , increasing production to 12.5 million barrels a day from current capacity of 11.3 million barrels a day , has been placed on an accelerated timeline .
The second phase - to grow capacity as high as 13.5 million barrels a day by 2011 - is in the planning stage .
With that kind of capacity , the country could be in a better position to influence prices ....
By the middle of the year , [ Saad ] Rahim [ Country Strategies Manager at PFC Energy ] said , Saudis ' spare capacity will be able to compensate for a complete loss of Iranian exports of around 2.5 million barrels a day .
" But that essentially soaks up global excess capacity , " he said .
" So any other disruptions ( such as from Nigeria or Venezuela ) would really stretch the system . "
Shibley Telhami , a senior fellow with Washington think tank the Brookings Institute , said the Saudis are unlikely to use their capacity as a weapon unless they have ruled out all other diplomatic means .
" The Saudis want Iran contained , there 's no doubt , " said Telhami , " But they 're also very worried about war with Iran , " not least because it might prompt an uprising from their own Shi'a population .
Conclusion
As noted above , an Iranian nuclear weapon by 2011 is not an issue  Saudi fears of an emerging Shi'a crescent is the problem .
Let us first dispense with the " spare capacity " argument .
There is no possibility that Saudi Arabia could flood the oil market to wage economic war on Iran , which is facing a decreasinganyway .
Greater Saudi production would make up for Iranian shortfalls within OPEC .
Increased Asian demand ( China & India ) is relentless and could eat up any new oil released to the market .
Here , it is off - topic as to whether Saudi Arabia can actually implement their accelerated plans to increase productive capacity .
What is important is thatthey can .
In any case , the time frame ( by 2011 ) does n't work as far as spare capacity in the global oil supply goes .
Influence prices ?
Not downward .
War with Iran ?
The loss of Iranian ( and Saudi ) exports resulting from such a war ?
These are real possibilities .
Moreover , the Saudi 's oppose any U.S. troop withdrawal  naturally  and are fearful of what may happen later this year or next year in this regard .
Still , it appears that anything Saudi Arabia could do by politicizing their oil policy and increasing spare capacity would be too little , too late .
As the American Iraq quagmire draws to a close , as it inevitably must , the countries of the Persian Gulf region , and their residents , will be left to fend for themselves in a destabilized region .
Iran will attempt to take advantage of the situation , given their declining exports and the economic leverage now being applied against them by the United States .
I have not touched on the Spring scenario for an Israeli attack on Iran , but that remains a possibility .
Such an action would merely accelerate the chain of events outlined here .
Iran might even welcome such an attack .

FBI : al - Qaeda detainee spoke of fire plot
PHOENIX ( AP ) 
The FBI alerted law enforcement agencies last month that an al - Qaeda terrorist now in detention had talked of masterminding a plot to set a series of devastating forest fires around the western United States .
Rose Davis , a spokeswoman for the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise , told The Associated Press that officials there took note of the warning but did n't see a need to act further on it .
The contents of the June 25 memo from the FBI 's Denver office were reported Friday by The Arizona Republic .
Davis declined to share a copy of the memo and an FBI spokeswoman in Denver did n't immediately return a telephone call .
The Republic reported that the detainee , who was not identified , said the plan involved three or four people setting wildfires using timed devices in Colorado , Montana , Utah and Wyoming that would detonate in forests and grasslands after the operatives had left the country .
The memo noted that investigators could n't determine whether the detainee was telling the truth .
The newspaper said many forest law enforcement officers it contacted had no idea the warning had been issued .

SHANGHAI , Aug. 13 — The head of a Chinese company that was behind the recall earlier this month of more than a million Mattel toys committed suicide over the weekend , China ’s state - controlled media reported today .
Zhang Shuhong , a Hong Kong businessman and owner of the Lee Der Industrial Company , a company that made toys for Mattel for 15 years , hanged himself in a company warehouse in Foshan , in southern China , the Southern Metropolis Daily said today .
There was no independent confirmation of the suicide .
A person who answered the phone at Lee Der ’s office in Foshan City , near Guangzhou , immediately hung up .
A spokeswoman for Mattel , which is based in El Segundo , Calif. , released a statement this morning that said “ We were saddened to learn of this tragic news . ”
RIYADH ( Reuters ) - Iran ’s President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Sunday his country would not use oil as a weapon even if it is attacked by the United States over Tehran ’s disputed nuclear program .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speaks during a news conference at the end of the 3rd OPEC Summit in Riyadh November 18 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Susan Baaghil
“ We would never like to use oil as a weapon ... there are other means at our disposal to respond , ” Ahmadinejad told a news conference held after a summit of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries .
His remarks were translated into English from Persian .
Washington has not ruled out military action against Iran , accusing it of seeking nuclear weapons .
Tehran says its nuclear program is peaceful .
Ahmadinejad said Iran would study a Gulf Arab proposal to set up a body in a neutral country such as Switzerland that would provide enriched uranium to Middle East users including Iran and ensure it is used for peaceful purposes only .
“ We will closely and positively study ( the proposal ) , ” Ahmadinejad said .
Iran has welcomed the plan but said it would not halt uranium enrichment on its own territory .
Gulf countries -- Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Oman , Qatar , Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates -- share Western concerns over Iran ’s nuclear energy program .
Ahmadinejad said OPEC leaders had discussed a decline in the value of the dollar at the two - day summit .
“ Today all leaders were unhappy with the fall in the value ( of the dollar ) ... even the American people have lost out , ” Ahmadinejad said , adding that only “ a handful of capitalists ” benefited from the U.S. currency ’s slide .
“ They get our oil and give us a worthless piece of paper , ” he said .

It has long been one of nature 's marvels : how tree frogs support their body weight upside - down on tiny sticky feet .
But now scientists have used the design of the creatures ' toe pads to create a super - sticky tape that is an incredible 30 times stronger than normal .
And by copying the way the pads function , the new tape can also be peeled off cleanly and used time and time again .
Scientists who have made the breakthrough believe the new kind of adhesive will have a wide range of uses .
Not only could it spell the end of having to scrape infuriating labels off newly bought items , but it could
also function as a reusable super - adhesive coating – for example on gloves where maximum grip
is crucial .
Scroll down for more ...
Normal tape loses its stickiness when pulled off a surface because tiny cracks occur in the adhesive .
But the scientific team at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur have overcome this cracking by recreating the microscopic channels found in the toe pad of a tree frog .
The frog 's channels also contain an adhesive mucus , so the scientists have filled their adhesive 's cracks with fluid .
The result is that surface tension draws an object and the tape together like a sponge soaking up water .
Yet , remarkably , the tape can also be pulled off without leaving a residue and can be reused .
One of the team who worked on the project , Animangsu Ghatak , said : " In the animal world the mechanism of adhesion has evolved for millions of years and is very elegant . "
" With a single foot these animals not only create an adhesion strength 50 to 100 times their own body weight , but also allow very quick debonding when required . "
" Furthermore , these adhesives do not get contaminated by dust or particulate matter , unlike most man-made adhesives . "
He added that his team could now develop a tape that was 30 times stronger than existing sticky tape .
Dr Ghatak said : " In this new adhesive we trap a viscous liquid inside channels made of elastic material .
So overall the adhesive remains elastic and comes back to its original form after use . "
" While liquid inside the channel supplies adhesive strength , bulk elastic material gives it reusability . "
Jon Barnes , who studies tree frog adhesion at the University of Glasgow , said that in future nature would provide more models for developing technology .
He added : " In this area of science , taking design ideas from nature is certainly coming of age . "

The Problem with Electronic Voting Machines
In the aftermath of the U.S. ’s 2004 election , electronic voting machines are again in the news .
Computerized machines lost votes , subtracted votes instead of adding them , and doubled votes .
Because many of these machines have no paper audit trails , a large number of votes will never be counted .
And while it is unlikely that deliberate voting - machine fraud changed the result of the presidential election , the Internet is buzzing with rumors and allegations of fraud in a number of different jurisdictions and races .
It is still too early to tell if any of these problems affected any individual elections .
Over the next several weeks we ’ll see whether any of the information crystallizes into something significant .
The U.S has been here before .
After 2000 , voting machine problems made international headlines .
The government appropriated money to fix the problems nationwide .
Unfortunately , electronic voting machines — although presented as the solution — have largely made the problem worse .
This does n’t mean that these machines should be abandoned , but they need to be designed to increase both their accuracy , and peoples ’ trust in their accuracy .
This is difficult , but not impossible .
Before I can discuss electronic voting machines , I need to explain why voting is so difficult .
Basically , a voting system has four required characteristics :
Accuracy .
The goal of any voting system is to establish the intent of each individual voter , and translate those intents into a final tally .
To the extent that a voting system fails to do this , it is undesirable .
This characteristic also includes security :
It should be impossible to change someone else ’s vote , ballot stuff , destroy votes , or otherwise affect the accuracy of the final tally .
Anonymity .
Secret ballots are fundamental to democracy , and voting systems must be designed to facilitate voter anonymity .
Scalability .
Voting systems need to be able to handle very large elections .
One hundred million people vote for president in the United States .
About 372 million people voted in India ’s June elections , and over 115 million in Brazil ’s October elections .
The complexity of an election is another issue .
Unlike many countries where the national election is a single vote for a person or a party , a United States voter is faced with dozens of individual election : national , local , and everything in between .
Speed .
Voting systems should produce results quickly .
This is particularly important in the United States , where people expect to learn the results of the day ’s election before bedtime .
It ’s less important in other countries , where people do n’t mind waiting days — or even weeks — before the winner is announced .
Through the centuries , different technologies have done their best .
Stones and pot shards dropped in Greek vases gave way to paper ballots dropped in sealed boxes .
Mechanical voting booths , punch cards , and then optical scan machines replaced hand - counted ballots .
New computerized voting machines promise even more efficiency , and Internet voting even more convenience .
But in the rush to improve speed and scalability , accuracy has been sacrificed .
And to reiterate : accuracy is not how well the ballots are counted by , for example , a punch - card reader .
It ’s not how the tabulating machine deals with hanging chads , pregnant chads , or anything like that .
Accuracy is how well the process translates voter intent into properly counted votes .
Technologies get in the way of accuracy by adding steps .
Each additional step means more potential errors , simply because no technology is perfect .
Consider an optical - scan voting system .
The voter fills in ovals on a piece of paper , which is fed into an optical - scan reader .
The reader senses the filled - in ovals and tabulates the votes .
This system has several steps : voter to ballot to ovals to optical reader to vote tabulator to centralized total .
At each step , errors can occur .
If the ballot is confusing , then some voters will fill in the wrong ovals .
If a voter does n’t fill them in properly , or if the reader is malfunctioning , then the sensor wo n’t sense the ovals properly .
Mistakes in tabulation — either in the machine or when machine totals get aggregated into larger totals — also cause errors .
A manual system — tallying the ballots by hand , and then doing it again to double - check — is more accurate simply because there are fewer steps .
The error rates in modern systems can be significant .
Some voting technologies have a 5 % error rate : one in twenty people who vote using the system do n’t have their votes counted properly .
This system works anyway because most of the time errors do n’t matter .
If you assume that the errors are uniformly distributed — in other words , that they affect each candidate with equal probability — then they wo n’t affect the final outcome except in very close races .
So we ’re willing to sacrifice accuracy to get a voting system that will more quickly handle large and complicated elections .
In close races , errors can affect the outcome , and that ’s the point of a recount .
A recount is an alternate system of tabulating votes : one that is slower ( because it ’s manual ) , simpler ( because it just focuses on one race ) , and therefore more accurate .
Note that this is only true if everyone votes using the same machines .
If parts of town that tend to support candidate A use a voting system with a higher error rate than the voting system used in parts of town that tend to support candidate B , then the results will be skewed against candidate A .
This is an important consideration in voting accuracy , although tangential to the topic of this essay .
With this background , the issue of computerized voting machines becomes clear .
Actually , “ computerized voting machines ” is a bad choice of words .
Many of today ’s voting technologies involve computers .
Computers tabulate both punch - card and optical - scan machines .
The current debate centers around all - computer voting systems , primarily touch - screen systems , called Direct Record Electronic ( DRE ) machines .
( The voting system used in India ’s most recent election — a computer with a series of buttons — is subject to the same issues . )
In these systems the voter is presented with a list of choices on a screen , perhaps multiple screens if there are multiple elections , and he indicates his choice by touching the screen .
These machines are easy to use , produce final tallies immediately after the polls close , and can handle very complicated elections .
They also can display instructions in different languages and allow for the blind or otherwise handicapped to vote without assistance .
They ’re also more error - prone .
The very same software that makes touch - screen voting systems so friendly also makes them inaccurate .
And even worse , they ’re inaccurate in precisely the worst possible way .
Bugs in software are commonplace , as any computer user knows .
Computer programs regularly malfunction , sometimes in surprising and subtle ways .
This is true for all software , including the software in computerized voting machines .
For example :
In Fairfax County , VA , in 2003 , a programming error in the electronic voting machines caused them to mysteriously subtract 100 votes from one particular candidates ’ totals .
In San Bernardino County , CA in 2001 , a programming error caused the computer to look for votes in the wrong portion of the ballot in 33 local elections , which meant that no votes registered on those ballots for that election .
A recount was done by hand .
In Volusia County , FL in 2000 , an electronic voting machine gave Al Gore a final vote count of negative 16,022 votes .
The 2003 election in Boone County , IA , had the electronic vote - counting equipment showing that more than 140,000 votes had been cast in the Nov. 4 municipal elections .
The county has only 50,000 residents and less than half of them were eligible to vote in this election .
There are literally hundreds of similar stories .
What ’s important about these problems is not that they resulted in a less accurate tally , but that the errors were not uniformly distributed ; they affected one candidate more than the other .
This means that you ca n’t assume that errors will cancel each other out and not affect the election ; you have to assume that any error will skew the results significantly .
Another issue is that software can be hacked .
That is , someone can deliberately introduce an error that modifies the result in favor of his preferred candidate .
This has nothing to do with whether the voting machines are hooked up to the Internet on election day .
The threat is that the computer code could be modified while it is being developed and tested , either by one of the programmers or a hacker who gains access to the voting machine company ’s network .
It ’s much easier to surreptitiously modify a software system than a hardware system , and it ’s much easier to make these modifications undetectable .
A third issue is that these problems can have further - reaching effects in software .
A problem with a manual machine just affects that machine .
A software problem , whether accidental or intentional , can affect many thousands of machines — and skew the results of an entire election .
Some have argued in favor of touch - screen voting systems , citing the millions of dollars that are handled every day by ATMs and other computerized financial systems .
That argument ignores another vital characteristic of voting systems : anonymity .
Computerized financial systems get most of their security from audit .
If a problem is suspected , auditors can go back through the records of the system and figure out what happened .
And if the problem turns out to be real , the transaction can be unwound and fixed .
Because elections are anonymous , that kind of security just is n’t possible .
None of this means that we should abandon touch - screen voting ; the benefits of DRE machines are too great to throw away .
But it does mean that we need to recognize its limitations , and design systems that can be accurate despite them .
Computer security experts are unanimous on what to do .
( Some voting experts disagree , but I think we ’re all much better off listening to the computer security experts .
The problems here are with the computer , not with the fact that the computer is being used in a voting application . )
And they have two recommendations :
DRE machines must have a voter - verifiable paper audit trails ( sometimes called a voter - verified paper ballot ) .
This is a paper ballot printed out by the voting machine , which the voter is allowed to look at and verify .
He does n’t take it home with him .
Either he looks at it on the machine behind a glass screen , or he takes the paper and puts it into a ballot box .
The point of this is twofold .
One , it allows the voter to confirm that his vote was recorded in the manner he intended .
And two , it provides the mechanism for a recount if there are problems with the machine .
Software used on DRE machines must be open to public scrutiny .
This also has two functions .
One , it allows any interested party to examine the software and find bugs , which can then be corrected .
This public analysis improves security .
And two , it increases public confidence in the voting process .
If the software is public , no one can insinuate that the voting system has unfairness built into the code .
( Companies that make these machines regularly argue that they need to keep their software secret for security reasons .
Do n’t believe them .
In this instance , secrecy has nothing to do with security . )
Computerized systems with these characteristics wo n’t be perfect — no piece of software is — but they ’ll be much better than what we have now .
We need to start treating voting software like we treat any other high - reliability system .
The auditing that is conducted on slot machine software in the U.S. is significantly more meticulous than what is done to voting software .
The development process for mission - critical airplane software makes voting software look like a slapdash affair .
If we care about the integrity of our elections , this has to change .
Proponents of DREs often point to successful elections as “ proof ” that the systems work .
That completely misses the point .
The fear is that errors in the software — either accidental or deliberately introduced — can undetectably alter the final tallies .
An election without any detected problems is no more a proof the system is reliable and secure than a night that no one broke into your house is proof that your door locks work .
Maybe no one tried , or maybe someone tried and succeeded … and you do n’t know it .
Even if we get the technology right , we still wo n’t be done .
If the goal of a voting system is to accurately translate voter intent into a final tally , the voting machine is only one part of the overall system .
In the 2004 U.S. election , problems with voter registration , untrained poll workers , ballot design , and procedures for handling problems resulted in far more votes not being counted than problems with the technology .
But if we ’re going to spend money on new voting technology , it makes sense to spend it on technology that makes the problem easier instead of harder .

Mr Chavez said education based on capitalist ideology destroyed values
Mr Chavez said schools must introduce a new curriculum being introduced this year that he said would help develop values of cooperation and solidarity .
Education had been ignored by past governments , Mr Chavez said .
But many parents are concerned that the new curriculum will spell indoctrination for their children .
Opening a new school on the first day of the academic year , President Chavez spoke of his vision for the future of education .
He said it was based around learning to create , to live together , to value and to reflect .
He said he would make education his top priority and increase funding .
But Mr Chavez said any schools that did not agree to teach what the government wanted would be closed .
" The government as well as parents and society can't accept that the private sector does whatever it feels like doing , " he said .
" How can they say that because it 's a private school an education inspector can't come in ?
Of course it can or we will close down the school . "
Mr Chavez said previous governments had also promoted their own ideology .
" They taught us to admire Christopher Columbus and Superman , " he said .
" Education based on capitalist ideology destroyed values " .
In the December 14 , 2006 issue of Rolling Stone , Paul Krugman takes Bush to task regarding the “ biggest untold economic story of our time . ”
The article is titled , “ The Great Wealth Transfer . ”
In sum , more and more of the wealth of this country is falling into fewer and fewer hands .
For most Americans , wages have failed to keep up with rising prices , causing workers to fall behind inflation .
Most Americans are “ definitely worse off than they were in 2000 . ”
Back in 1969 , the employees of General Motors averaged ( in current dollars ) more than $ 45,000 per year , with great benefits .
Compare that with today ’s Wal - Mart nonsupervisory workers , who average $ 18,000 per year with lackluster benefits .
Krugman ’s article takes aim at three myths .
Myth # 1 : Inequality is mainly a problem of poverty .
This is incorrect , because middle income workers have n’t seen their wages grow .
“ The real divergence in fortunes is between the great majority of Americans and a very small , extremely wealthy minority at the far right of the line . ”
Myth # 2 : Inequality is mainly a problem of education .
Not true , says Krugman .
“ Being highly educated wo n’t make you into a winner in today ’s US economy .
At best , it makes you somewhat less of a loser . ”
Myth # 3 : Equality does n’t really matter .
Krugman argues that America now has significantly less social mobility than previously .
“ It ’s easier for a poor child to make it into the upper middle class in just about every other advanced country - including famously class - conscious Britain - than it is in the United States . ”
What is the cause of this growing economic disparity ?
The Bush administration has been engaging in union bashing , utilizing a variety of creative techniques described by Krugman .
Combine this with the polarizing effects of the Bush tax cuts .
Once the Bush tax cuts have taken full effect , “ more than a third of the cash will go to people making more than $ 500,000 a year–a mere 0.8 % of the population . ”
The United States is now working on attaining the same sort of economic and social inequity attained by many Latin American countries .
More and more , we are starting to award community assets to people with the right connections .
In this situation , many talented people will never rise to the full potential “ because they were born into the wrong class . ”
The factual background of this article leads to Krugman ’s final question : “ Will the United States go down the path that led America followed - one that leads to ever growing disparity in political power as well as an income ?
The pair are planning to publish a paper outlining their objections to a pro-boycott motion passed by British academics last month and Mr Dershowitz has threatened to " devastate and bankrupt " those he believes are acting against Israeli universities .
Members of the University and College Union passed a motion at their annual conference instructing leaders to circulate calls for a boycott of Israeli institutions to every UK campus for " information and discussion " .
Yesterday Mr Julius , who has had a string of high - profile clients and is visiting professor at Birkbeck College , said the UCU 's decision had sparked widespread anger .
" People are pretty appalled at their stance , what they see are double standards when it comes to Israel , " he said .
" The majority of Jews find this repellent and many academics reject the pitiful arguments which have been put forward and which do not reflect well on the state of academic work in this country . "
Mr Dershowitz , the prominent lawyer and Harvard law professor who is well known for the ferocity of his attacks on those he perceives as enemies of Israel , told the Guardian that if the boycott call is endorsed by the UCU branches there would be retribution , and that he had enlisted 100 lawyers to break the boycott .
" If the union goes ahead with this immoral petition , it will destroy British academia , " Mr Dershowitz said .
" We will isolate them from the rest of the world . "
Yesterday supporters of an academic boycott said they were determined to press ahead with the campaign .
Sue Blackwell , who spoke in favour of the motion at the union conference last month , said : " We have voted to discuss how best to help our Palestinian brothers and sisters who often are not allowed to get to college or university and that is what we will do . "
She said the proposed boycott had sparked a renewed debate about the plight of the Palestinians since it was first raised five years ago .
" This is about boycotting institutions about criticising the policies of the Israeli government not about individuals . "
Physicist discovers Mary Jane / Peter Parker the strongest tie in the Marvel social network
This is beyond awesome : Pablo Gleiser , a physicist , took 12,942 issues of various Marvel comics , traced all the connections between 6,486 different characters — and produced a massive social - network map of the Marvel Universe .
Some of his findings ?
Superheroes have way more connections than villians — which may help explain why they win so often .
“ Only heroes team up , ” Gleiser notes , “ while villains do not . ”
Superheroes are superconnectors ; villians sit on the periphery of the social web .
This , he theorizes , is probably due to the built - in rules that comic - book authors must follow .
As he writes in his paper , the PDF of which you can download here :
We believe that the origin of this division is due to the fact that , although the Marvel Universe incorporates elements from fantasy and science - fiction the arguments of the stories were restricted by a set of rules established in the Comics Authority Code of the Comics Magazine Association of America .
In particular , rule number five in part A of the code for editorial matter states that “ Criminals shall not be presented so as to be rendered glamorous or to occupy a position which creates the desire for emulation … ”
With great power comes great responsibility .
Speaking of which , Gleiser found that the single - strongest bond in the network — i.e. the tie most commonly reiterated in Marvel plots — is between Peter Parker and Mary Jane .
( “ A fact , ” he writes , “ that shows that although the [ Marvel Universe ] deals mainly with superheroes and villians the most popular plot is a love story . ” )
The next most - important superconnectors ?
The Thing , the Beast , Namor , and the Hulk .
That map above illustrates the sad plight of villians .
It shows the strongest 300 links .
The black dots are heroes — most of which are nicely and tightly interconnected .
The white dots are villians , which tend to be connected only to a black dot — usually their sworn arch - enemy .
( The grey dots are “ other types of characters , such as people , gods or nodes with no classification . ” )
But here ’s a thought , fanboys .
Network theory also predicts “ the strength of weak ties ” : I.e. the fact that while superconnectors have lots of strong connections , the most interesting , creative and unpredictable social effects come from weak links — connections between people only slightly joined .
Does this hold true for the Marvel Universe ?
Are the stories in which those weak ties appear particularly intriguing , wacky , or unexpected than the ones that are characterized purely by strong ties ?
I want some grad student to tackle this one and get a PhD for it .

The planned Ares I rocket - which will be the USA 's only way of putting people into space after the Shuttle retires in 2010 - faces " significant threats " to its performance , according to an internal NASA document .
The problems have already led to significant delays .
Fuel 's solid : design not so much ?
The Ares I first stage is a modified version of the solid - fuelled boosters mounted either side of the Shuttle 's external fuel tank , and apparently it is here that the problems lie .
The solid booster must lift the second stage - a liquid - fuelled rocket based on the J - 2 design used in the 1960s Apollo moonshot programme - plus the crew module and its abort bailout system .
NASA says that the Ares I stack will be able to lift 25 tons into earth orbit .
However , there have been rumours that the first - stage modifications - which involve adding an extra segment and structural strengthening - have cut into the weight allowance for the crew and service modules .
Now Flight International reports that an internal NASA circular says that " there are significant threats to the performance " of the Ares I .
It seems that a preliminary design review of the first stage has now slipped six months behind schedule .
NASA says that there will be a four - year hiatus in manned US spaceflight between the Shuttles retiring and Ares I coming online .
" Crew transportation to the International Space Station is planned to begin no later than 2014 , " according to the agency .
" The first lunar excursion is scheduled for the 2020 timeframe . "
The return to the Moon will call for more complex missions in which Ares V unmanned heavy lift rockets will fire cargo and modules into orbit .
These payloads will then be assembled into ships which can carry Ares I - lifted astronauts to the lunar surface - and then , according to plans , on to Mars .
However , it would appear that the timetable is already beginning to slip .
The Flight piece is here . ®
" Actually , just look at what Osam , uh , Barack Obama , said just yesterday .
Barack Obama calling on radicals , jihadists of all different types , to come together in Iraq .
That is the battlefield .
That is the central place , he said .
Come join us under one banner , " - Mitt Romney .
This is actually bizarre .
He got it right the first time and then switched so that he describes Obama as the head of al Qaeda , fomenting Jihadist opposition to US troops in Iraq .
The campaign apologized .
But I have a feeling this was n't entirely accidental .
And will happen again .

Debugging is one of the most painful parts of developing web apps .
You have to deal with browser inconsistencies with HTML , CSS and javascript , let alone the difficulty of debugging javascript itself .
Here ’s a rundown of the Firefox extensions I use to manage this madness .
Taming CSS : Web Developer Toolbar
Install Web Developer Toolbar .
Just do it .
Debugging CSS can be really frustrating .
The Web Developer Toolbar lets you inspect and edit ( in real - time ) the HTML and CSS of your page , so you can see what ’s happening when things do n’t line up .
It can do a heck of a lot more , but here ’s what I use it for :
Ctrl +
Shift + F : Display element information .
This puts a red box under your mouse .
Move the mouse over an element and its attributes appear in a pop-up : the name , class , pixel sizes , fonts , everything .
Here ’s what you can do :
Figure out what classes are creating the styles you see
Easily get the div ’s id for use with Firebug ( below )
Figure out how big an image is ( pixel height and width )
Ctrl +
Shift + E : Edit CSS .
This pops open a sidebar tab with the current stylesheets .
You can edit any attributes and see the effect in real - time ( like giving Google a black background ) :
My favorite CSS style is border : 1 px solid red ;
I ’ve done the following hundreds of times during the course of web development :
Find a div with your mouse ( ctrl + shift + f )
Get its id
Edit CSS ( ctrl + shift + e )
( ctrl + shift + e)
Put a border on the div : #mydiv{border : 1 px solid red;}
Play with widths , heights , margins and paddings until it lines up nicely
Remove the border
But rather than deleting the border , put an “ x ” in front : “ xborder : 1 px solid red ” .
The CSS wo n’t be valid so the border is ignored , but keeps the style around in case you want to enable it later .
Select all the text in your edited CSS file and paste it into the real CSS file .
Bam , your changes are now live .
It ’s almost the reverse of creating a file in DreamWeaver and viewing it in Firefox .
You are viewing the live file in Firefox , making changes , and copying those back into your text editor .
I ’ve found this very effective for editing CSS , you avoid the constant back - and - forth switching because Firefox now has a CSS editor .
Bonus : ColorZilla Picks Colors
ColorZilla gives you a dropper that can find the hex RGB value ( # 123456 ) of anything on the page .
This is great when designing , and you want to match a font color to a color in your page .
This is way faster than taking a screenshot and opening it up in Photoshop .
Keeping Javascript
In Line : Firebug
Firebug , how I love thee ( or get the bookmarklet for other browsers ) .
If you love yourself you will install it immediately and save countless hours of frustration .
Firebug can debug javascript , examine the DOM , and do much more ( you can and should read all about it ) .
Here ’s how I use it :
F12 : Open Firebug .
You may have to enable it for the page .
Console Tab : Write quick javascript commands — it even has autocomplete on variable names and properties .
Play around with your functions , change CSS attributes , add elements to the page — whatever it takes to test .
Script Tab ( Debugging ) : Best .
Feature .
Ever .
Click on a line number to set a breakpoint ( red dot ) in your javascript .
Reload the page and it will break ( pause ) when it encounters the line .
At this point , you can switch over to the console to examine and change variables , and figure out what the heck is going on when your code wo n’t work .
You can then hit the blue “ play ” button and continue running your app , until the next breakpoint .
Net Tab :
Find the download performance of your page .
Profile Button ( on Console Tab ) : Find the run -time performance of your page .
Click “ profile ” to begin capturing information , do some commands , and then click stop .
You ’ll get a report of where your code spends its time .
If you must optimize , optimize the common - case first .
If you are a more visual person , try this awesome collage :
Not satisfied ?
Check out the examples on the home page .
Dive into the details : Live HTTP Headers
Sometimes you need to dive into the nitty - gritty .
What cache headers is my site sending back ?
Are my pages really gzip - encoded ?
I know these questions keep you up at night , so here ’s what you can do :
Install Live HTTP
Headers Open it ( Tools > Live HTTP Headers )
Visit a page / press refresh Rejoice
As you visit a page , you ’ll see HTTP headers fly by as your browser requests elements .
If items are cached , the browser may not request them at all ( awesome ! ) or may request the element and get a 304 “ Not Modified ” response ( slightly less awesome , you still had to check with the server ) .
I ’ve written more on cache behavior , and Live HTTP Headers is a great way to learn about HTTP caches ( something every webdev should be interested in for performance reasons ) .
Even better , you can “ replay ” any header , editing the data that is sent .
This is useful when testing or debugging cache or gzip encoding behavior .
Debugging IE : The lost chapter
Argh , unfortunately IE lacks these wonderful tools .
There is a script debugger , but it does n’t hold a candle to Firebug .
In fact , I often just resort to alert statements , which make you shudder after being spoiled by Firebug .
One less painful method I use is this :
In your HTML : < div id =" log " ></div >
In your Javascript : function log( str ) { var log = document.getElementById( " log " ) if ( log ) { // let 's be safe ...
log.innerHTML
+= str + " < br / > " ; } } Usage : log ( " Hi there ! " ) ;
Optional : create an eval box : < input name = " eval " id =" eval " / > < a href= " javascript:void(0 ) ; " on Click=" log(eval ( document.getElementById( 'eval ').value ) ) ; " >
go</a>
It ’s nothing fancy , just a simple logging function that appends text to a div .
Yes , it ’s brutal , but it ’s better than alert ( ) statements , especially if you have a loop ( unless you like repetitive stress injuries or want to condition yourself to fear dialog boxes ) .
If anyone knows a good way to debug javascript in IE I ’d love to know .
The tools I ’ve tried have been very clumsy and disjoint , taking you out of the browser .
I try to do 95 % of my development in Firefox , and debug IE - specific issues ( like erratic substr behavior ) using this method .
Keep Getting Better
Web Developer Toolbar and Firebug can do way more than I ’ve described here .
Like the 80/20 rule , these are commands I use most frequently that give me the best bang for my buck .
Take a few minutes to learn these tools and you ’ll save hours down the line .
And here ’s a few more tools for web development .
These tools might not save you from getting a nervous twitch in one eye from building web apps , and that ’s ok .
They ’ll save you from getting that twitch in both .

MOUNT VERNON , Virginia ( CNN ) -- President Bush and French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Wednesday called on Pakistani President Gen. Pervez Musharraf to hold planned elections and to step down from the military .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy joined President Bush in demanding elections in Pakistan .
" My message was very plain , very easy to understand : The United States wants you to have the elections as scheduled , and I want you to take the uniform off , " Bush said of his telephone conversation with Musharraf earlier in the day .
On Saturday , Musharraf imposed an emergency order in the country -- suspending the constitution and arresting hundreds of human rights activists and lawyers -- in what he said was a necessary move to fight terrorism .
Sarkozy agreed that the elections must take place as scheduled .
" We need to have elections [ in Pakistan ] as swiftly as possible , " he said .
" This is a country of 150 million people , which happens to have nuclear weapons .
This is very important for us that one day , we should n't wake up with a government , an administration in Pakistan which is in the hands of the extremists . "
Responding to a reporter 's question about the absence of Iraq in his speech to Congress earlier in the day , Sarkozy said he sent his foreign minister there recently to show solidarity with the Iraqi people .
" France wants a united Iraq .
It 's in no one 's interest to see Iraq dismantled , " the French president said .
Sarkozy pledged Wednesday a renewed alliance and friendship between his country and the United States .
Watch Sarkozy explain how France will stand by the U.S. »
In his speech to a joint meeting of Congress , the French president promised to stand firm with Washington on the war in Afghanistan and against Iran 's nuclear program .
Facing problems back home as he tries to implement campaign promises on immigration and economic issues , Sarkozy recalled the long history of friendship between the two countries .
" In times of difficulty , in times of hardship , America and France have always stood side by side , supported one another , helped one another , fought for each other 's freedom , " he said .
In his first few months in office , Sarkozy has been at pains to show he is an ally of the United States , backing Bush 's hard - line stance on Iran 's nuclear program and attempting to heal the wounds over his country 's opposition to the Iraq war .
Lawmakers greeted Sarkozy 's entrance into the chamber with a standing ovation and lengthy applause -- evidence of the renewed hopes for Franco - American relations .
" Let me tell you solemnly today : France will remain engaged in Afghanistan as long as it takes , because what 's at stake in that country is the future of our values and that of the Atlantic alliance , " he said .
" For me , failure is not an option .
Terrorism will not win because democracies are not weak , because we are not afraid of this barbarism .
America can count on France . "
Sarkozy also promised to help in the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction , citing Iran 's nuclear program .
" Let me say it here before all of you :
The prospect of an Iran armed with nuclear weapons is unacceptable , " he said .
" The Iranian people is a great people .
It deserves better than the increased sanctions and growing isolation to which its leaders condemn it .
Iran must be convinced to choose cooperation , dialogue and openness .
No one must doubt our determination . "
But Sarkozy made it clear that while his government will work with Washington on many issues , the relationship will be on an equal footing .
" I want to be your friend , your ally and your partner .
But a friend who stands on his own two feet .
An independent ally .
A free partner , " he said .
Watch Sarkozy define what friendship means to France »
Sarkozy also addressed the situation in the Middle East , calling on Israeli and Palestinian leaders to " risk peace .
And do it now . "
" The status quo hides even greater dangers : that of delivering Palestinian society as a whole to the extremists that contest Israel 's existence ; that of playing into the hands of radical regimes that are exploiting the deadlock in the conflict to destabilize the region ; that of fueling the propaganda of terrorists who want to set Islam against the West , " Sarkozy said .
" France wants security for Israel and a state for the Palestinians . "
He called on Washington to pay attention to the dollar 's latest woes , to stand with Europe in the fight against global warming and to take the lead in shaping reforms in the United Nations , the World Bank and the Group of Eight nations .
" Our globalized world must be organized for the 21st century , not for the last century .
The emerging countries we need for global equilibrium must be given their rightful place , " the French president said .
He closed his comments with a request for the United States to " trust Europe . "
" In this unstable , dangerous world , the United States of America needs a strong , determined Europe . "
Sarkozy said he sees a need in the future for Europeans to " shoulder a growing share of their defense . "
" All of our allies , beginning with the United States , with whom we most often share the same interests and the same adversaries , have a strategic interest in a Europe that can assert itself as a strong , credible security partner , " he said .
Sarkozy 's speech to Congress marks the first address by a French leader since President Jacques Chirac 's appearance in 1996 .

All About Nicolas Sarkozy • France
The question is , who ought to make that decision ?
The Congress or the commanders ?
And as you know , my position is clear -- I 'm a commander guy .
Last night , Bush leaned as heavily as ever on his ass - kissing little chickenshit commander [ Do n't look at me , I did n't say it .
It was Petraeus ' boss . ] invoking his name no fewer than eight times in his 17 minute speech .
But what 's Bush 's real record as a " commander guy ? "
BUSH : I have always said that I will listen to the requests of our commanders on the ground .
Maj. Gen. John BATISTE : Mr. President , you did not listen .
You continue to pursue a failed strategy that is breaking our great Army and Marine Corps .
He did not listen .
Instead , he cycled through generals until he found one who would say things he wanted to listen to , finally landing on Petraeus .
Now of course , Bush and his Republican cohorts must cling desperately to the leaky life raft that is the Petraeus name .
The name -- really , the rank -- is all they 've got left .
The notion that they can actually lean on and run on the plan is now beyond ridiculous .
That can't be rehabilitated .
It , like everything about Iraq , remains on the same maintenance prescription : kill 750 troops and call me in six months .
The plan is sunk .
The name and rank must be preserved .
What else can explain both the shrillness and desperation evident in their howls of protest over the jabs at Petraeus and their invocation of those slights in their fundraising materials ?
The Bush name is mud .
Ca n't raise a dime off that .
Same with Iraq and the tired , old buzzwords that used to open checkbooks .
But General ?
Petraeus ?
That 's still bankable .
At least until that Brand Name is discredited and destroyed by too long an association with the failure that is Bush , as well .
That day may be coming soon , but for right now , all Republican bets are riding on the shiny medals on Petraeus ' chest .
We all know how the Bush plan for Iraq polls .
It ranks in popularity somewhere in the neighborhood of ringworm .
But the Petraeus plan ?
A Rasmussen poll released Thursday showed that 43 percent of Americans support the Petraeus plan while 38 percent oppose it .
In addition , 71 percent of respondents said it is likely that " a large number of U.S. soldiers will remain in Iraq five years from today . "
The support for the Petraeus plan is split along party lines .
Sixty - six percent of Republicans support it while 55 percent of Democrats are opposed to it .
According to the poll , independents are evenly divided .
That 's right .
When Rasmussen polls on the plan , they ask :
Do you favor or oppose Petraeus ' recommendation to withdraw 30,000 soldiers from Iraq but leave 130,000 troops in place at least through the summer ?
The hidden message here is that Bush himself is in his " last throes , if you will . "
Associating the name of the Commander in Chief with an actual military plan ( or really , with anything at this point ) is instant death .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
Got some leftover drugs -- the kind that someone else might want to use , such as painkillers or stimulants ?
Wrap them up in used kitty litter or other pet droppings , the government advises .
Undated file photo shows a jar of pills .
REUTERS / Files
A pilot program at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration is looking at ways people can safely dispose of unused prescription drugs that are liable to be abused .
The Food and Drug Administration recommends flushing some of the most dangerous ones down the toilet , including the strong , addictive painkillers oxycodone and fentanyl and stimulants such as methylphenidate .
But environmentalists worry about the effects on fish and amphibians .
On its Web site at www.samhsa.gov/rxsafety/, SAMHSA recommends ways to disguise leftover pills .
“ Mixing prescription drugs with an undesirable substance , such as used coffee grounds or kitty litter , and putting them in impermeable , nondescript containers , such as empty cans or sealable bags , will further ensure the drugs are not diverted , ” it says .
Of course some people do not drink coffee .
But maybe they have a pet ferret .
“ Ferret waste , like nearly any other form of pet waste , can be effectively used to help prevent the abuse of unused prescription drugs , ” SAMHSA spokesman Mark Weber said .
This news delighted the American Ferret Association .
“ The U.S. government declares ferret poop to be an effective weapon against drug abuse , ” the group said in a statement .
SAMHSA said the problem is no joke .
“ One in five teens reports intentionally misusing someone else ’s prescription drugs to get high .
Nearly half say they get the medications from friends and relatives for free , ” it says in a statement .
Dr. Ilene Ruhoy of the University of Nevada , Las Vegas , studied leftover pharmaceuticals found in the homes of 473 people who died in 2006 .
She found 3,562 controlled substances , or an average of nearly eight per person .
More than half were hydrocodone painkiller products , while the rest were oxycodone , morphine or fentanyl .
Report : GOP leaders plot to thwart ' no confidence ' motion on Gonzales RAW STORY
Published : Monday June 4 , 2007 Print This Email This According to a Capitol Hill newspaper , " If Senate Democrats press ahead next week with their plan to hold a no-confidence vote on embattled Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , it is unclear whether any of Gonzales GOP critics will go along  and the Senate Republican leadership is ginning up plans to thwart the measure . "
" Six GOP Senators have gone on the record essentially demanding Gonzales resignation , and one of them  Sen. Tom Coburn ( Okla . )  already has declared hell vote against the nonbinding no-confidence resolution , " Rachel Van Dongen reports for Roll Call .
The article continues , " The five others  Sens. John Sununu ( N.H. ) , Chuck Hagel ( Neb. ) , Gordon Smith ( Ore. ) , John McCain ( Ariz . ) and Norm Coleman ( Minn . )  were unwilling to tip their hands about how they will vote , despite repeated attempts to contact them last week . "
According to Roll Call , " Republicans are likely to tie up the Senate floor with all kinds of procedural mischief and introduce any number of amendments , including perhaps one on whether the Iraq War is actually ' lost ' as Reid has suggested . "
Excerpts from article : # The expanding Justice probe , which seems to reveal a new embarrassment for the administration every week , underlines why a no-confidence vote could put Republicans in a bind .
Despite GOP skepticism that Gonzales can remain effective on the job , it is uncertain whether that translates into a vote supporting Democrats  bid to throw him out .
Coburn , for instance , who has been harshly critical of Gonzales , already has chosen sides and plans on opposing the motion .
In a May 22 letter to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) , Coburn said he would like to be notified before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent request to consider the Gonzales motion .
Coburn notified McConnell that if the motion comes to the floor , he plans to introduce an amendment expressing no confidence in Congresss ability to cut wasteful spending or balance the budget . 

The George W. Bush administration ’s legal justification for continuing to hold prisoners without charges at the US naval base at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba will be back in the US Supreme Court  yet again  early next month .
And the decision of the nine justices could bring the entire administration ’s detention policy down in flames  or not .
On Dec. 5 , the high court will hear oral arguments in a case known as Boumediene v. Bush and al - Odah v. USA .
Boumediene and al - Odah have been held in indefinite executive detention at Guantánamo since 2002 without charge or trial .
Boumediene and al - Odah are Algerian - born Bosnian citizens who were detained in Bosnia in 2001 on the basis of a diplomatic note delivered by the US embassy in Sarajevo to the Bosnian government .
Though the note did not allege any supporting evidence , it asked the Bosnian government to arrest the men because of fears that they were involved in a plan to attack the embassy .
After an extensive investigation yielded no evidence to justify the arrests , the Bosnian Supreme Court ordered the men released for lack of evidence .
But they were then immediately arrested and transferred to Guantánamo .
Their case has been bouncing around the US courts ever since .
Earlier this year , after a series of lower court losses , the detainees sought review of their case by the US Supreme Court .
In April , the high court declined to review the case .
But two months later , in an unusual action taken only three times since the founding of the United States , the Supreme Court reversed its own decision , agreeing to hear the case  the third time it will consider a case concerning the rights of detainees .
The core issue before the court is whether the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) , hurriedly pushed through the Republican - controlled Congress and signed into law by President Bush in October 2006 , violates the US Constitution by stripping the courts of jurisdiction to consider habeas corpus petitions from the Guantánamo detainees .
The government will tell the high court that current law provides " a fully adequate substitute for habeas corpus in this extraordinary wartime context . "
Habeas corpus , or " The Great Writ , " is one of the most fundamental protections of individual liberty guaranteed by the US Constitution .
It has its origins in common law dating back to the time of the Magna Carta in 1215 , and is a remedy that protects fundamental human rights , including the right not to be subjected to enforced disappearance , secret detention , arbitrary detention , unlawful transfer , torture and other cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment , and the right to a fair trial by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law .
Several US presidents have suspended this ancient right , including Abraham Lincoln during the US Civil War .
But it has always been restored by the judicial branch of government .
Embedded in the controversy over the Military Commissions
Act is the legality of executive bodies known as Combatant Status Review Tribunals ( CSRTs ) , which were established to determine whether the detainees held at Guantánamo were " properly detained " as " enemy combatants . "
The CSRTs were authorized by an order from the then Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz in 2004  some two and a half years after detentions began at Guantánamo .
Combat Status Review Tribunals consist of panels of three military officers who can consider any information , including information that is hearsay , classified , or that has been obtained under torture or other ill - treatment , in making their determinations .
The detainee , held thousands of miles from home ( or any battlefield ) and virtually cut off from the outside world , does not have a lawyer or access to any classified evidence used against him .
Critics charge that there is a presumption in favor of the government ’s information presented to the tribunal .
" The current system of legal tribunals suggests a lack of independent review , no guarantee of legal counsel , use of secret evidence that may be been obtained through unlawful methods such as torture , and no meaningful way for a defendant to confront the government ’s case against him , " Mary Shaw of Amnesty International USA told IPS .
" It ’s a no - win situation . "
The CSRTs were established following one of the Bush administration ’s major legal defeats .
In 2004 , in a case known as Rasul v. Bush , the Supreme Court ruled that the US courts had jurisdiction to consider habeas corpus petitions filed on behalf of the Guantánamo detainees .
Brian J. Foley , visiting associate professor at Drexel University College of Law , believes that the CSRTs serve " no purpose other than to expand executive power . ’ "
" The CSRT simply rubber - stamps the executive ’s earlier decision to imprison and interrogate suspects , by making it practically impossible for a prisoner to prove he is not an ‘ enemy combatant ’ , " he said in an interview .
The administration ’s prisoner detention policies have suffered a number of other legal setbacks .
Arguably the most important case was known as Hamdan v. Rumsfeld .
In 2004 , Salim Ahmed Hamdan , the captured and detained former driver for Osama bin Laden , filed suit for a habeas corpus hearing in US court .
In 2005 , the Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hamdan .
The aggregate result of these various legal setbacks is that to date none of the more than 300 detainees still held in Guantánamo has had his detention reviewed in court .
None of the over 400 detainees freed from the base to release or further custody in their own or other countries was transferred by judicial order .
And there have been no trials of detainees .
There has been one " conviction , " based on a plea deal by an Australian detainee , who was quickly transferred back to his home country .
The CSRT process has also come in for harsh criticism by an Army reserve officer who served as a member of one such panel .
In an affidavit , Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Abraham said the process is deeply flawed , relying on vague evidence prepared by poorly trained personnel , and is subject to undue pressure from the military chain of command .
Under the Detainee Treatment Act ( DTA ) , passed by Congress in 2005 , judicial review of CSRT decisions is limited to a single court , the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia .
Many in the legal and human rights communities see the upcoming arguments as potentially the first step in restoring one of the country ’s founding tenets  applying the rule of law even to those whose goal might be to destroy the United States .
" If our detentions of enemy combatants are ever to be accepted as legitimate by the rest of the world , we must be willing to conform our actions to basic principles of due process and fundamental fairness , " Prof. David Cole of Georgetown University Law Center told IPS .
" Thus far , we have failed . "
Cole ’s view is echoed by Prof. Peter Shane of the University of Ohio Law School .
He told IPS , " When President Bush issued his November 2001 ‘ Notice , ’ which set in motion the military commissions at Guantánamo , the administration plainly hoped that the approach would provide a rough - and - ready version of ‘ Adjudication Lite ’ that , without anyone ’s interference , could provide the appearance of adhering to the rule of law without treating too fastidiously the rights of Guantánamo detainees . "
Marjorie Cohn , president of the National Lawyers Guild , expressed a similar opinion .
She told IPS that the Supreme Court should " determine that the judicial review of the decisions of CSRTs do not provide an adequate substitute for constitutional habeas corpus . "
Because the rich generally save and invest more of their income than the less wealthy , they are the primary builders of the pool of available capital .
Taxing away their incomes means less capital for everyone .
The dems CAN stop the war , even without enough senate votes to pass a bill , even without enough votes to over - ride a Bush veto .
Imagine me standing a mile away , on an open savanah , in Africa , waving to a galloping herd of elephants to stop .
I do it for three seconds , then turn around , shaking my head , muttering ... " I tried to stop them . "
You would look at me as though I were either a liar or idiot .
You might be disgusted that I would insult you with the suggestion that you take me seriously .
The members of congress are coming back to a request from Bush for another $ 50 billion in Iraq war funding .
Nancy Pelosi is probably going to say there 's nothing she can do to stop it .
Harry Reid will do the same .
The Bluedog democrats and other conservative Democrats will probably pretend they are doing their job and pass a bill funding the money , but with requirements for a phased withdrawal .
This will will be a lie and a fraud .
They know it will not pass in the senate .
They 're doing it so they can say they are trying to end the war .
They are waving , from a mile away at that thundering herd of elephants , knowing full well that it will not work .
At some point in evolutional history , all the parts had a discussion because they all wanted to be Boss .
The brain said , " I should be boss because I am the master controller for all the body 's responses and functions . "
The feet said , " We should be Boss because we get the rest of you where yuo want to go . "
The heart said , " I pump the blood that supplies nourishment and energy to you all , so I should be in charge . "
It went on and on with the hands , the lungs , and the eyes , then finally the rectum spoke up .
The other parts all laughed at the idea of the rectum being the Boss .
So the rectum went on strike , shutting itself down , refusing to work .
After a short time the eyes became crossed , the hands went limp and sweaty , the heart began to beat wildly , the lungs began to heave and the brain became dizzy and lightheaded .
The story 's moral :
You do n't need brains to be in charge - any a ** hole can do it .
In the case of the congress , the democratic representatives without the guts to stand up for their constituents are failing America , keeping our democracy from working properly .
But the message could also be that while the house can't successfully pass a bill that will be approved by the senate that overcomes veto by President Bush , they can just hunker down , like the rectum in the joke , and refuse to authorize the funding .
They can refuse to authorize ANY further funding until the troops are withdrawn .
They should expect the right wingers , the president and all the media surrogates and pundits to raise hell , whining and crying about the Democrats not supporting the troops .
And they should be prepared to come back strong rebutting the lies .
They should come up with a budget to run ads counter to the attack the right wing will throw at them .
The response should be tough and hit back even harder than the right wingers hit , accusing the minority of betraying the troops and lying , of allowing yes men generals who replace honest generals to protect a president who is a lying failure .
They can do this .
It will take courage and cooperation and teamwork .
If they do it , they will win even bigger next year , in the '08 elections .
If they fail to get the job done , they will be hurt by that failure .
While they 're at it , they should pass clear legislation forbidding Bush from directing an attack against Iran .
And force the Republicans to filibuster .
The vast majority of Americans oppose such a war .

When it was my turn to pick a major for college , I chose Computer Science .
At the time , it seemed like a sensible choice : I had computer skills ; these skills were marketable ; and I did n’t hate the idea of a career in computers .
Sadly , it took the rest of college and four years in the industry for me to realize that not hating something is not the same as actually liking it .
I should have picked up on the early warning signs :
Sign # 1 –
The required courses for my major were not fun .
During high school , computer programming was fun only because it was new and interesting to me .
By the time I was doing it in college , it had become repetitive and mundane .
The programming language was irrelevant — it was the programming process that killed me .
It required exactness .
Not “ practically perfect ” exactness , not “ close enough ” exactness , but absolute exactness .
I say this because you ’re writing code for an audience of one : the compiler — a critic in the machine that waits for you to submit your code , only so it can throw it back at you when it ’s not correct .
Compiler error .
Revise your code .
Compiler error .
Revise again .
Compiler error .
Revise some more .
Although errors could be simple typos , they were usually something more complicated .
You do a little research , make a few hopeful changes to your code , and resubmit it to the compiler .
In spite of your efforts , the compiler replies with the same smug response : Compiler error .
The process was maddening .
It was like running into a brick wall , being taunted to climb over it , discovering a different brick wall on the other side , and repeating the process indefinitely .
It was not fun — it was work .
Sign # 2 –
The general studies courses were paradise by comparison .
Rhetoric and Composition , Science in Western Civilization , American Cinema , Existentialism in Film , and Intro to Philosophy .
I can recall the names of these five courses with ease because they stand out in my memory .
In other words , I enjoyed them .
Systems Analysis and Design Methods , Telecommunications , Computer Organization –Assembly Language , Data Structures , Database Systems , Engineering Graphics and CAD , Foundations of Computer Science , Web Service Engineering , Programming Language Structures , Theory of Computation , and Computer Algorithms .
I could n’t recall the names of any of these courses at all because they blend together in my memory — I had to look them up in order to write them here .
Put another way , I forgot them .
General studies courses were the lifeblood of my college career .
They were unforgettable , because I liked them .
Once I realized how much I enjoyed non-computer courses , I looked into my options for enrolling in more courses I thought I might enjoy .
Unfortunately …
Sign # 3 – I could not enroll in certain courses I wanted to take .
Beginning Piano :
This would have been perfect for me because I ’ve wanted to play piano for a long time .
The problem was that Piano was an ARTS course , and I was majoring in the SCIENCES .
The same was true for Intro to Sculpture , Creative Nonfiction Workshop , and Computer Graphics — as ARTS courses , they would not count towards my major .
( If you ’re wondering why I could n’t take Computer Graphics as a CS major , here ’s why :
There were two “ Computer Graphics ” courses .
The one I wanted to take taught you how to use Photoshop .
The one that counted towards my major taught you how to make Photoshop . )
Sign # 4 – My primary form of recreation was writing .
I kept a journal while attending college .
I wrote it it nearly every day for at least one hour .
It was not something I did as an assignment for one of my professors .
It was not something I did for anyone else .
It was something I did for myself , because it was what I loved to do .
Sign # 5 – Friends who knew me best told me I was a writer at heart .
An excerpt from my college journal :
JANUARY 18 2001
8:34 am Last night Alicia and I were lying on my bed , talking about the irrational things we dream of doing .
We ca n’t though , because we ’re too stubborn .
We ’re both addicted to being rational .
It was an upsetting conversation because we convinced ourselves how meaningless grades are .
We decided that we should n’t be so neurotic about these unimportant things , and focus on what ’s truly important to us .
Ironically , she ended our conversation by saying “ I should go … I still have homework to do . ” I purposely fell out of my bed .
She leaned over the edge , looked down at me , and said “ There I go contradicting myself again . ”
After she left , I thought I should summarize the readings for science in western civilization .
I ended up writing a poem about my suppressed desires for Alicia instead : how can you lust over the library girl ?
the one that keeps her eyes down and her legs crossed .
sweaters and jeans , nothing fancy .
she ’s a birthday present with dynamite inside .
but , every time you see her ,
it ’s to measure the swell of her breasts with your eyes .
every glimpse of skin is a bonfire , burning , burning .
you write her letters ,
begging her to forget everything and run away with you ,
but you never give them to her .
the library girl is almost completely off limits ,
and you know she likes it that way .
you ask the advice of others , and all they can say is :
“ the LIBRARY girl ? why ? ”
and you ca n’t explain it to them .
she just has this hidden virginal spark ,
and you want to be the one to drag her into the mud .
you want to be the one to suck the spark out of her .
but you ’re too scared , and too timid ,
and all you do is travel aimlessly around ,
watching for her ,
driving past her house with the sad songs on .
you do n’t know how to go forward , and you ca n’t go back ,
so you ’re left spinning your wheels in the mud .
and , while you wait , with bated breath ,
she turns away and starts another book . … I called her up and read it to her .
She said “ Shaun !?
What are you doing in computer science ?
You are a writer ! ”
Regardless of all of these signs , I repeatedly denied who I was .
I convinced myself that I was a computer guy , because being a computer guy seemed more practical than being a writer .
Years later , I realize that it does n’t matter if it ’s more practical — it ’s not who I want to be .
It ’s not who I am .
Which brings me to my point :
It ’s easy to bury your passion beneath a pile of bills and let rationality run your life .
I ’ve done it , just as many others have and countless others do — but I do n’t recommend it .
The real you was never meant to be shut out .
Accept who you are , and then be who you are .
Once you have , you ’ll only regret you did n’t start doing it sooner .

It 's quite astonishing that a majority of the Republican candidates for President of the United States simply do not understand the Constitution and that the power to declare war lies with the Congress .
Can you even begin to imagine what the founders would have to say about this ?
President Bush has been discussing the plan with Mexico 's leader
A White House spokeswoman said the US would do all it could " to support Mexico 's efforts to break the power and impunity of drug organisations " .
The request , the first part of a $ 1.4bn initiative , is due to be discussed by Congress in Washington on Thursday .
Analysts have compared the package to the controversial , and much larger , aid the US gives Colombia to fight drugs .
But the BBC's Lourdes Heredia in Washington says that both the US and Mexico are keen to avoid too close an association with " Plan Colombia " because of the controversy it has generated .
' Positive effect '
If approved by Congress , the $ 1.4bn programme over two years would help pay for intelligence and training efforts , as well as equipment such as helicopters and boats .
Mexican troops have been deployed in the fight against illegal drugs
Mr Bush and Mexican President Felipe Calderon have been working on the details of the plan for several weeks , officials said .
" Already , President Calderon 's decisive actions have had a positive effect in the United States , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
" They have disrupted drug trafficker supply lines and have contributed to shortages in cocaine and methamphetamine supply across the nation . "
Since taking office last December , Mr Calderon has sent nearly 30,000 troops and federal police across his country to battle the drug gangs and disrupt their activities .
Figures released earlier this month by US drugs tsar John Walters indicated the price of cocaine in 37 cities across the US has risen sharply since March and purity has declined , suggesting dealers ' supplies are being stretched .
Ninety percent of cocaine entering the US comes through Mexico .
However , the crackdown has exacted a price in Mexico , where a brutal underworld struggle has left as many as 2,000 people dead , including more than 200 police officers , commanders and soldiers .

A former Justice Department aide granted immunity in attorney firings probe
• Monica Goodling had refused to testify before Congress about the firings
• Senate panel granted authority to subpoena White House 's political director
• Rep. Rahm Emanuel slammed administration for firings , other controversies
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- A
House panel granted immunity Wednesday to a former Justice Department aide in its probe of the firings of eight U.S. attorneys , while senators authorized a subpoena for the White House 's political director .
Monica Goodling , a former aide to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , had invoked her Fifth Amendment rights against self - incrimination and refused to testify before Congress about the firings .
The Justice Department released documents that show Goodling was involved in discussions about which prosecutors would be fired .
Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers , D- Michigan , said the committee " exhausted all reasonable efforts to obtain Ms. Goodling 's critical information " short of offering immunity .
The panel also voted to subpoena Goodling in connection with the probe .
The House Judiciary Committee voted 32 - 6 to authorize the grant of immunity to Goodling , who resigned earlier this month .
Nine of the committee 's 17 Republicans joined Democrats in backing immunity .
Conyers said the committee is following an appropriate process .
" Where it goes from there I am totally unprepared to say , " he said .
" We may come back and say you were right , but we also may not . "
The White House is resisting congressional demands for sworn testimony from presidential aides , insisting it will let them be questioned only in private and without a transcript .
The controversy surrounding the firings centers on the Justice Department 's initial characterization of the dismissals of U.S. attorneys as " performance - related , " which provoked an outcry from the ousted prosecutors and triggered allegations of political influence on federal investigations .
Gonzales said he knew little about the discussions concerning the firings , but testimony from his former chief of staff , Kyle Sampson , as well as documents released by the Justice Department , have shown that officials in the White House political office were involved in the shakeup .
Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain said Wednesday he was disappointed in the performance of Gonzales , and believes it would be in President Bush 's best interests for Gonzales to step aside .
" I think that out of loyalty to the president that that would probably be the best thing that he could do , " McCain said in an interview with CNN's " Larry King Live . "
Senate grants authority to subpoena
The Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday granted authority to subpoena White House Political Director Sara Taylor .
The committee 's chairman , Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy , said he and the committee 's ranking Republican , Pennsylvania Sen .
Arlen Specter , had asked Taylor two weeks ago to testify voluntarily but received no response .
The possibility of a subpoena , Leahy said , " may focus their attention . "
Taylor works closely with Bush 's top political strategist , Karl Rove , and both the Senate and House Judiciary committees want to learn more about Rove 's involvement in the firing decisions .
But Bush spokeswoman Dana Perino said the White House would have the same objections to Taylor 's testimony as it would for other top aides .
Leading Democrat blasts
White House administration
A leading House Democrat and veteran of the Clinton administration 's political arm , Rep. Rahm Emanuel , said the firings -- in addition to other controversies -- show the Bush administration has turned the federal government into " a stepchild of the Republican Party , " using it to advance GOP goals .
In a speech to the Brookings Institution on Wednesday the Illinois congressman said the U.S. attorneys controversy is just the latest in a series of administration blunders , ranging from the reconstruction of Iraq and the response to Hurricane Katrina to the poor conditions for outpatient solders at the Army 's Walter Reed hospital .
" There is a common denominator : Instead of promoting solutions to our nation 's broad challenges , the Bush administration used all the levers of power to promote their party and its narrow interests , " he said .
Perino shot back that Emanuel 's speech was " one that you would consider reading in the National Inquirer rather than at a prestigious American think - tank like the Brookings Institute " and dismissed his accusations as " grand conspiracy theories . "
CNN 's Kevin Bohn and Carol Cratty contributed to this report .
On Launch Pad 39A at NASA 's Kennedy Space Center in Florida , the Space Shuttle Endeavour sat bathed in glowing light , silhouetting the vehicle against the dark night sky over the seaside complex .
It may sound like an awesome and idyllic scene , but not for nesting sea turtles and their newly hatched babies .
During their summer nesting season , these turtles emerge from the ocean along the pristine beach within 200 yards of the space shuttle launch pads .
The light emanating from the pads can deter the adults from coming ashore to lay their eggs and disorient the hatchlings as they emerge from their nests and head toward the moonlit sea .
As part of keeping the balance with its natural surroundings , the space center 's environmental management system has as one of its goals to minimize controllable impacts to wildlife , including the nesting sea turtles .
The natural height of the dune normally provides a necessary buffer , but the dunes along Florida 's Space Coast have been severely eroded in some spots by hurricanes , particularly during the 2004 season .
That year , the space center was impacted by two hurricanes just three weeks apart .
And while some dune restoration was completed and more is planned , some stop - gap measures were needed until the nesting season ends at the beginning of November .
Enter some inventive individuals with a novel idea :
Use what they have on hand to help block the launch pad lights so the nesting process can continue undisturbed .
As those charged with helping to protect the environmental balance debated how to shield the beach from the lights , Doug Scheidt with Kennedy 's life sciences support contractor Dynamac had an idea .
" Boxcars are about the right height , " he offered .
He thought using freight train cars was " a shot in the dark " that just might work , shading the dunes in the most severely eroded spots .
And since the space center has the unique situation of having a rail line that parallels the beach , it was a viable solution that would also avoid the pitfalls inherent in trying to erect some type of temporary barriers that would require permits and funding .
Uniquely bringing together employees from both the operations and environmental sides of the space center 's management team , the railcar idea took shape .
The cars were big enough and mobile , and some that were scheduled to be removed from service were coincidentally parked just a few miles away from the launch pads .
The solution would be quick , easy and cheap .
Somewhere along the way , the project was affectionately dubbed " Operation Dark Dune . ”
Moving day arrived on a hot Florida day in July , and the team relocated and strategically placed 25 railcars along the rail line in their temporary seaside location .
" As a former environmental protection specialist at Kennedy , I realize how fine a line it is between our operations and the protection of our natural resources , " said Propellants Mobile Equipment Manager Gail Villanueva , who is in charge of the railcars .
" I was happy I was in a position to help out , although the request was unique , to say the least . "
The relationship between space exploration and nature goes back as far as the space program 's roots in the region .
When the Kennedy Space Center was carved out along the vast coastal area , its first director , Kurt H. Debus , arranged for a large portion of the center to be designated as a wildlife refuge .
Known as the Merritt Island Wildlife Refuge , it now encompasses 140,000 acres and is managed by the Interior Department 's Fish and Wildlife Service .
The space center also borders the Canaveral National Seashore , which provides an important nesting area for the sea turtles .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Builders say the current housing market is the weakest it 's been in 16 years , but as bad as that is , their view of where the market will be in six months is even worse .
That 's the results of the latest survey from National Association of Home Builders , an industry trade group that conducts a monthly survey along with Wells Fargo bank .
It weighs builders ' views of current market strength , their expectations six months out and the level of traffic they are seeing from buyers .
The survey found that the group 's overall index fell to 20 from 22 in August , the seventh straight month of decline - and the worst reading since the start of the first Gulf War in January 1991 , when the nation was in the grip of both a recession and an energy price shock .
The reading for builders ' views of the current market also fell to a 16 - year low , while their view of buyer traffic remained unchanged from August at a level not previously seen since December 1990 .
And the survey 's finding on builders ' view of the state of housing six months out fell to a reading of 26 , the worst figure on record in the 23 - year history of the index , and down from the previous record low of 31 in the August report .
" Builders are expressing concern that home buyers are getting spooked by the many headlines they are seeing on mortgage market issues and their continuing effects on the housing market and home prices , " said a statement from NAHB President Brian Catalde , a home builder from El Segundo , Calif .
" Indications are that consumers are trying to time the bottom of the market before making their purchase . "
But builders not surprisingly believe that this is a good time for buyers - at least those able to get a mortgage - to buy because of the glut of new homes on the market and the weakness in prices .
The most recent government report showed that there were 175,000 completed new homes for sale in July , up 23 percent from a year earlier , and that builders had to wait a median of 6.1 months to sell a completed home , up from only 3.6 months in July 2006 .
That was the most recent period for which data was available , and it was before the mortgage market problems got worse in August .
In addition the glut of existing homes available for sale hit a 16 - year high in July , according to the National Association of Realtors , and a rising rate of mortgage foreclosures could dump 2 million homes on the market this year , according to a report released Tuesday by RealtyTrac , a marketer of foreclosed properties .
Even the builders admit it is going to take some time for them to work through the inventory of homes on the market , and that the pace of new housing starts begin what will be a gradual recovery process by the third quarter of next year .
" At that point , the market will have substantial growth potential , " said David Seiders , the group 's chief economist .
The report comes the day before the government report on housing starts and building permits .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast that the annual pace of housing starts in August fell to a 12 - year low of 1.35 million from 1.38 in July .
Building permits , which are also taken as a reading of builders ' confidence in the market , are also expected to fall to a 12 - year low of an annual rate of 1.35 million , from 1.37 in July .
The downturn in housing has led to losses at the nation 's six largest home builders .
Lennar ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) , the nation 's No. 1 builder , and No. 5 KB Home ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) both reported a loss in the latest quarter .
No. 2 home builder D.R. Horton ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and No. 3 Centex ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) both reported losses far bigger than Wall Street had expected , while No. 6 Pulte Homes ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) and Hovnanian Enterprises ( Charts , Fortune 500 ) have reported losses for the last two quarters and analysts project losses for at least the next year .
本題に入る前に宣伝から入る。電気通信大学の学園祭期間中に「５五将棋大会」なるものが開かれるそうである。詳しくはhttp://minerva.cs.uec.ac.jp/~uec55/を見てください（この宣伝を書くためだけに、このエントリのアップロードの予定を繰り上げた。本当は年明けあたりにアップロードするつもりだった）。
さて先日、ボナンザとコンピュータ将棋に関する話題が著名なブログに採り上げられたということで、コンピュータ将棋協会のブログの書き手が素早くエントリを書いた。私が特に重要だと思った部分はここである。
コンピュータ将棋が人間の棋譜を読んで自動学習するということに関して、「ボナンザが初」とその著名なブログで書かれてしまった。それに対する専門家からの返答である。「ボナンザが初ではない」ということを明言している。
ゲームプログラミングでも古典的なテーマであったことは、実は私も知らなかったのだが、「人工知能一般」の古典的なテーマであったことは知っている。引用元では、コンピュータ将棋の自動学習を機械学習の一種と位置づけている。ここで少しボナンザを例にとってコンピュータ将棋の機械学習について簡単に説明をする。
コンピュータ将棋は、複数の指し手の候補に対して機械が自動的に「評価」を下すことによって、本当に指す手が決まる。「評価」の最も高い手を機械に指させるのである。当然のことである。ところで、この「評価」というのはコンピュータの内部では数値で表されている。この「評価値」をどのように計算するのかがコンピュータ将棋の全てである。そして、おそらくここまでは誰でも分かっていることだと思う。
この「評価値」を求めるために、コンピュータ将棋（およびその他の様々なボードゲーム）では、「先読み」と「局面評価」をおこなっている。「先読み」というのは、人間でいうところの「あーきて、こーきて、こうくるから、こうさして、そうするとこうなる」のようなものとほぼ同じと思ってよい（多少違うが）。一方の「局面評価」は先読みした結果の「そうするとこうなる」の局面が「どれくらい好ましい局面であるのか」を示す指標である。そして、ボナンザが自動学習をしたのは「局面評価」の「評価基準」である。
一般に何かの評価値を計算するためには評価基準が必要である。フィギュアスケートも（私は詳しくないが）ジャンプに関する点数が細かく決められていたり、スピンに関する点数が細かく決められていたりする。人間ですら数値的な評価をするためには採点基準が必要なのだから、コンピュータが評価をするためには相当かっちりとした評価基準が必要だろうということは想像できると思う。
では、かっちりとした評価基準というのは具体的にどのようなものなのか。まず最も原始的なものとして、「歩１枚につき○○点」
「金１枚につき○○点」といった駒の枚数に対する得点が挙げられる（これを「駒割」と呼ぶ）。そのほかにも「玉の周囲八方に金がいたら○○点」などという評価基準も考えられる。基本的に評価基準は「△△という条件が成立したら○○点」というかたちで機械には与えられる。プログラミングをかじったことのある人なら、
if(条件){score+=点数;}
ということを言っているということが分かると思う。この「条件」と「点数」の組み合わせで「評価基準」はできている。ところで、ここまではまだ「機械学習」の話はしていない。
機械学習というのはこの「点数」の部分を機械に自動的に学習させることをいうことが多い（もちろん例外はあるし、方法論の例外を作ることがどんな研究でも重要である）。ボナンザは「条件」の部分は作者である保木氏本人が手動で与え、「点数」のみを自動学習させている（はずである。間違っていたら誰か訂正をお願いします）。そしてこの「点数」を人間の棋譜から学習させている（どのように学習をしているのかということについては数学的に難しいので書かない）。
「 機械学習」と書くとなにやらものすごいことのようにも聞こえるが、要するに、これまで人間のやっていたパラメータ（点数）調整を機械に任せたに過ぎない（ただし、「機械学習」という概念が生み出されたこと自体はかなり革新的なことである）。何度も書くが、「機械学習」そのものはかなり昔から存在する概念である。
蛇足であるが 、URL の" machine learning " というの は
「機械学習」という意味である。また、ボナンザの「条件」は保木氏によれば１００００以上だそうである（私も試してみたが、適当に作ると簡単に１００００は超える）。
実は、ここまでが本日の日記の予備知識である。ここからが本題である。
コンピュータ将棋協会のブログは、この機械学習に使われたデータの量（棋譜の数）について、次のような見解を示している。
6万局のデータそれ自身の実質的な情報量はせいぜい6メガバイト程度であり、確かに電脳にとって稀少な量ですが、機械学習、もしくはデータマイニングの観点からは、もう充分に飽和に近づいている量である、とも推測できます。
簡単にいえ ば 「
今のデータ量で充分かも」ということである。私もそう思う。乱暴な計算をしてしまえば、６００００局÷１００００パラメータ＝６なので、一つのパラメータにつき６局あることになり、１局は約１００手からなるので一つのパラメータにつき６００局面のデータが存在する（これは本当に乱暴すぎる計算で、データ量の充分さを評価する尺度としてはかなりお粗末なのだが、とりあえずの目安である）。様々な経験から言って、６万局というのは充分だろうなあと思う。このあたりの議論を私が適当に進めているのは、語りたいことがその先にあるからである。
語りたいことがあるなどと書きつつ、ここで唐突に自動音声認識の話を始める。コンピュータ将棋の本格的な機械学習の歴史はおそらく始まったばかりなのだろうと思う。一方、私の専門である自動音声認識は、もう二十年以上も機械学習をおこなっている。機械学習を使っているという点では、コンピュータ将棋よりも自動音声認識の方が先輩である。
自動音声認識の分野でも初めは問題の分析から入った。将棋とはかなり異なるが、まずは「声にはどんな性質があるのか」といったことを調べることから入った。６０年くらい前のことである。その後、声の性質が分かってくると、かなり早い段階から「機械学習」が使われるようになる。
自動音声認識というのはパラメータのかたまりである。詳しい説明は省くが、その声がどのような文字に対応するのかを判別するために、単純なif文などではなく、「混合ガウス分布」「隠れマルコフモデル」といった複雑なモデルを用いており、そこには膨大なパラメータが存在する。そのパラメータを全て手作業で調節しているわけにはいかないので、機械に自動学習させる必要性がかなり早期からあった。
２０年ほど前にすでに現在使われている自動音声認識の技術はかなり出そろっており、そこから１０年ほどかけてひたすら「機械学習」のための「データ集め」に力が注がれた。そして、約１０年ほど前に、ほぼ現状に近い性能の自動音声認識器ができた。
ここに重要な問題がある。 「 では、その後の１０年は何をしていたのか」ということである。私に言わせれば、何もできていない（例外はある。後日改めて書くが、革新的な概念を発表している日本人がいる。ただし、その功績が肯定的に認められているとは言いがたい）。２００７年１０月１９日に情報処理学会主催の音声言語情報処理研究会という学会が開かれたのであるが、そこでは「もはや自動音声認識性能はこれ以上向上しない」という趣旨の発言がなされたほどである。自動音声認識技術の性能は、まだ、人間に遠く及ばないにもかかわらずである。もちろん、技術革新をしようとしている人はいるとは思うのだが、「技術革新をしようとしている人が少ない」「成果が出ていない」という二つの理由により、技術革新の話は一つの例外を除いて聞こえてこない。
実は、ここからが私の主張なのだけれど、自動音声認識技術が発展しなくなった一つの原因は中途半端に成功してしまったことにあると思う。自動音声認識技術は、「データ集め」をした結果、中途半端に成功した。そこからちまちまとそのデータをどのように利用するかという研究はされていたし、ほかにどのようなデータが必要かという議論もされていたが、「根本的なところを振り返る」ということが（雰囲気的に）しづらくなった。何かしらの危機感がこの分野にあれば、「ちょっと根本的なところから考えてみましょう」という雰囲気になるとは思うのだけれど、技術的な危機感がないので「根本的なところから考える奴はうざい」という雰囲気が主流になっている。代わりに、「自動音声認識はなぜ使ってもらえないのか」という議論が２００７年１０月１９日の研究会ではなされていた。ヒューマンインタフェースの観点からすれば、それも根本的で重要な議論であるとは思うのだけれど、その議論をするくらいだったら、自動音声認識技術そのものに関しても根本的なところからの議論に積極的になってほしいところである。
「 機械学習」による 「中途半端な成功」によって自動音声認識の分野では「根本的な議論」がしづらくなってしまっている、というのが私の現状認識である。
そして、コンピュータ将棋の話に戻る。コンピュータ将棋は、今、重要な岐路に立たされているのではないかと感じる。自動音声認識の分野が１０年前に通過した「機械学習による中途半端な成功」がなされたところだからである（渡辺竜王に負けておいて「大成功」とは言えないだろう）。もしこれから先、コンピュータ将棋の分野でも「根本的な議論」がなされなくなったら悲しいことである。
著名なブログに書かれていた以下の文章は、「データを集めればそれでよい」という主張をしている。この主張は現在の自動音声認識の重鎮たちの主張と似ている。
もし、同様の主張がコンピュータ将棋の分野でまかり通るようになってしまったら危険である。そして、その危険な状況に陥るおそれは少なくないと思う。自動音声認識の研究者も初めから「データを集めればいい」と思っていたわけではないだろう。だいたい次のような思考経路を辿っていったはずである。「どのようなデータを集めればよいだろうか 」 →「そのデータからどのような種類のパラメータを抽出すればよいだろうか 」 →「まだ性能は充分でないのは抽出するパラメータの種類が悪いからだ 」 →「どうやっても性能が上がらない 」 →「もう手をつけるべき部分がなくなった 」 →「やっぱり人間には勝てないね」。その誤りは、「大規模データを使わねば研究ができない」という固定観念にある。
コンピュータ将棋もこれから、（専門用語で書くが）「特徴量の検討」「強化学習の導入 」 「学習理論の検討」などを一通りおこなうことになると思う。そのときに（余計なお世話だろうが）根本的な部分にいつでも立ち戻れるような学会の態勢にしておいてほしいと思う。
最後に、googleについて簡単に触れる。今や「大規模データベース」といえばgoogleであるが、グーグルはそもそも会社の理念からして「世界中の知識を収集して使いやすくすること」が目的であるので、上記のような危険性はほとんどない。現在も目的に従って着実に世界中の知識を収集している。「音声認識・将棋」と「グーグル」では、データベースに関する立ち位置がまるで異なるので、データベースに関してはアナロジーを適用することはできない。

Subject : Benny Hinn
I am not sure if I am sending this to the write email address but I definitely think the authors of Benny Hinn Ministries article are out of their mind .
Fisrt of all , I do n't think they ever read the Bible ; to make conclusions like that ?
" Benny Hinn is evidence that there is no God " ??????
Benny
Hinn is probably one of God 's most closest friends , someone God always can count on , someone that is obedient to God just like Jesus was obedient to His Father , and is always available to hear and feel the Holy Spirit .
Before Benny
Hinn goes out to preach in the crusade he secludes himself in the room for 5 - 6 hours praying and conversing with God in order to hear God 's voice during crusades .
God will be your friend only when you pay the price .
Benny
Hinn is paying the price for staying close to God , hearing His voice , and the miracles millions of people are getting on his crusades .
God seeks true worshippers that could worship Him in truth and in Spirit .
Benny Hinn 's books " He touched me " and " Good morning Holy Spirit " are so awesome and inspiring !
Benny Hinn is a wondetrful man of God !
I do n't want to be rude or anything but those persons that wrote the article commenting on Benny Hinn Ministries should seriously consider repenting before God for saying something like that .
They should probably do it before God punishes them .
It is dangerous to talk like that about the works of the Holy Spirit .
The Bible says it will not be forgiven today nor will it be forgiven in the future .

One does not go see a man to find evidence there is a God .
The woman 's email you published in red right below the Benny Hinn article refers to a scripture that God is know to all men through His creation ... the world and everything in it .
( In Psalms )
Furthermore , of men , Jesus said he trusted no man .
We are flawed , not holy , not blameless , not perfect .
Love is different from trust .
He loves us .
Lastly , I am a Christian of 10 years now but will not share my testimony with you .
The carnal mind cannot discern spiritual matters .
You could never understand Benny Hinn or any other evangelist because you are reasoning with your mind .
God does n't enlighten the mind .
He awakens the spirit and lives in one 's heart .
I do n't know if the following message has anything to do with Benny Hinn , but it seems to fit here .

You 're a very brave person to display your ignorance so publically on the internet .
The atheism you glory in is as much a religion as any Christian ( or other ) faith ... and , sadly , when you die , you will discover with regret making the wrong choices about your life .
Read the Bible twice in two different translations , go to Bible college for three years , then , if you are of the same opinion , you can decry the likes of Benny Hinn from a position of knowledge .
But of course you wo n't do this , because in your heart of hearts , you know there is a God , and He will make you accountable for your actions - and you will pay with eternal damnation if you do n't accept the blood sacrifice of Jesus Christ beforehand .
But God , being a just God , leaves the choice to you .
Grow up !
Choose Life !!
Find Jesus before it is too late - he has ALREADY won the victory , and He IS the only way .

Subject : I agree with you about Benny Hinn ...
Hello , I cannot understand , why " God fear christians " think guys like Benny Hinn and Rod Parsely for example , can actually HEAL anyone ?
How is one healed , through stuffing your rent money in an orange bucket in a stadium ?
I agree with the observation you made regarding Benny Hinn , as to me , he is just Satan 's puppet on a string .
I myself , am a Christian , and it pains me and even angers me , that these other ' christians ' , these ... fools , have the stupidity to NOT see through Benny Hinn .
You can NOT go around , your entire life , saying " Praise God ! " and then stuff $ 1,000 in cash into a bucket at an auditorium , and expect to be HEALED .
No sir , God wants us to FIND Him , and it sure as HELL will not be , in an auditorium , with a Muslim ( yes , Hinn IS Muslim , but hides this well ) touching people and saying - " You 're healed , lady ! "
No , she is NOT healed , she or he , needs to be healed , of their stupidity first .
Any idiot , including me even , can stand in front of a gigantic crowd already ' warmed up ' by choirs singing , and fleece morons on stage !
Ever notice how some of Hinn 's idiots he hires ( yes , hires ) to pretend they 've been touched to fall backwards ... well , ever notice they stand there like morons , still smiling ?
Hinn then , touches them again , sort of like saying " Idiot , fall down and make it look good . "
One time I burst into tears , from LAUGHTER , as Hinn touched an old lady , and she touched him back ( she did n't read the script well enough I guess ) , and when Hinn was touched by her ?
HE pretended to stumble backwards , exclaiming " Oh , dont touch ME lady , the power of God is in you , too ! " - I was literally , grabbing my stomach , in laughter ... and IM a Christian !
I will not quote Bible scripture here , to dumbfound the idiot NON - christians who wrote you hate - mail because they butt - kiss to any any on tv thumping a Bible .
Benny Hinn , and people like him , will get their just rewards .
I did n't take well to the " Benny Hinn is proof there is n't a God " you had wrote , so let me correct you please .
It should say , " Benny Hill is proof there IS a devil " instead .
There IS a literal God , and Hinn and the rest , will be fleecing corpses in HELL for pocket change one day .
Not all of us Christians ( and im a deep south Texas one at that ) think scam - artists like Hinn , are real .
I hope you print this letter , so other people will read it and wake up .
Faith , is trust , and trust is in the Lord , not some fraud onstage passing a money bucket around , wearing a white suit from the 1970s , who speaks broken english .
The end .

Subject : Why Benny Hinn ?
Date : Fri , 30 May 2003 19:14:27 - 0500
At the age of 19 , I accepted salvation and began to read the Bible and additional educational books .
I have to say at first every preacher on public television seemed offensive ; to me , a fraud , a money sucker , and taking away from God 's glory through His word .
However , no book , no person , no videotape could get me a deep relationship with God .
It was only because I chose to step out in faith and believe that the " conscience " was only a tiny bit of what God speaks to us .
It 's not about saying a prayer and waiting to see if it gets answered .
It 's about knowing that you petitioned it and He answered the minute you asked .
No longer a monologue but a dialog .
The above emails disturbed me greatly because I did n't attend 3 years of Bible college nor have I been a believer all my life , yet I know I 'm mature in my relationship with God .
And the people who ordered you to repent are the greatest reason many are turned off to Christianity .
It 's not our job to say who 's in sin and who is n't .
It is our job to love everyone as God has loved us .
If people would n't look at Benny Hinn as the healer , rather God Himself , they would n't have to drive hours to be turned away at the door .
Why do n't we just ask for it at home ?
Hinn just asks
God to show up when others are still lacking in that level of faith .
My friend has been to one of His conferences and her skin condition was healed .
She did n't accredit it to Hinn , but to God .
I can understand your reason to question this Christian .
I can't say that he does n't abuse money or the people seeking healing .
But if that is the reason you think he should be thrown into a pile of smoldering , slimy ashes , then just about every politician , teenager , spoiled brat ( old and young ) , and all of corporate America , who is self - serving , should be as well .
We are n't ; however , because our God is forgiving .
( Funny how a nonbeliever knows the final punishment of a nonbeliever . )
Anyway , everyone sins , yes , even we Christians do .
So if you believe Hinn proves there is n't a God , why 'd you pick him as your proof ?
You really do n't have any proof displayed in your essay .
Even the Bible says we all sin and fall short of the glory .
If you truly did n't believe God existed you would n't have sought out proof .
If you just wanted to slander a fellow man , you should have rethought your introductory paragraph and just done so .
Sounds like some of you are searching for something , either God 's truth , or an English professor .
I 'll be praying you find both .

Subject : Benny Hill
I apologize I am not familiar with the Internet .
But ..... stumbled across your site & was very disturbed .
I have been to several Benny Hinn services .
Although I personally did not receive a healing , I saw the face of someone who DID !
It will forever be in my mind .
This person came in a wheel chair & had a crippling disease .
( You may question that . )
But at end of service we were allowed to come forward .
I walked up front while they were working with the healed .
The expression on the face of this young lady as she walked fastly back & forth will always be in my mind !
This was no act , she did not know I was looking at her face , but I saw the amazement & excitement in her face .
No , I did not get my healing but it did not stop me from believing .
I did have a healing at another prayer service .
I do n't claim to understand , I just know what I saw & I know it was real !!!!!!
Also , you said he pushed people down , he does not .
When I approached the stage , he swung his hand & almost everyone he aimed at near me fell on the floor at my feet , but I did n't fall .
It made me wonder what was wrong with me !
I have been to enough Spirit Filled Services to know that everyone does not respond to the Holy Spirit in the same manner , just as everyone does not respond to alcohol in the same manner .
My personal opinion is that Satan is using humans to attack this man of God .
I have not read all you have to say but I do hope you realize that God does heal .
God does want his people to be happy & healthy .
We were all ment to live 120 years & die ( without disease ) .
I am no bible scholar .
I do n't expect you to publish this comment .
Some people out there DO need to be exposed .
Just ask God for guidance .
I do n't know if you are a Christian or not .
James 4:11 says
" Do not speak against one another , brethern .
He who speaks against a brother , or judges his brother , speaks against the law , and judges the law ; but if you judge the law , you are not a doer of the law , but a judge of it . "
Just be careful .

To Whom it May Concern :
Before you print information , or misinformation you would check on it 's validity .
Benny Hinn Ministries does support many outreaches to orphans and supports a hospital in India , that would otherwise not have funds to do some equipment updating .
I do hope that someday you will come to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ , even though you may not be able to agree with some of the ministers you see .

After stumbling upon your anti Benny Hinn web site I was reminded that I too used to scoff at healing and think it was all a fairy tale hoax .
I 'll make a long story short .
I suffered for years with a back problem which medical science could not cure as well as alcoholism brought on by horrible pain from the spinal column
There were six disks in my back which were deformed and my best hope was to survive in a wheelchair .
I finally broke down and in desperation believed in and prayed to God. Boom !
In one second or less , I felt a warm glow come over me and I knew I would never drink alcohol again or even care to .
In a second or two later I noticed that my back stiffness and pain had disappeared .
Two weeks later , my doctors verified the fact that my six deformed disks were in perfect shape and position .
This turned me into a believer but quick after many years of being a fool .
Those healings you see in Benny Hinn crusades are perfect examples of how God uses people who believe in Him .
I have never had a back problem since .
This all happened to me when I was 51 years old .
I am now 74 enjoying back packing among other things .
I thank God daily for the suffering
He allowed me to have because that was His way of teaching me his powers of healing and grace .
Try humbling yourself a bit .
You might just find yourself REALLY happy by asking God for help .
You might just receive something from God which will change your skeptical mind .
And most of all , you will learn that He is a live God and loves you more than you 'll ever imagine .
God bless ya .

I do n't know why in this site you talk so bad about Benny Hinn and God .
I just can tell you that God exist's .
And the Healings are real , because the bible says it " Dummies " So he is not a bad person , is just that God uses his disciples and the bible say 's it .
And Benny Hinn is not the only person in the world that heals people .
Theres alot of people too , that they follow Jesus and they have the provoledge to heal people .
And if you do n't believe in Jesus , you will have your judgement .
And when you find yourself burning in the hell you will see that God exists .
So please stop tellin people God does n't exist and that Benny Hinn is a bad person ok .

So many of you keep saying Benny Hinn heals .
He has never claimed to heal .
The crusades bring on an atmosphere for healing and that is when the healing begins .
I do believe that Pastor Benny is a true man of God .
He has been chosen by him to lead the people to Christ .

Apparently , you are not as against Benny Hinn as you pretend to be .
Why not use your own name to slam this man ?
You are what is called a true coward because you have nothing to do but assassinate some ones character .
It is apparent you have never been truly ill and needed prayer or help from the God you claim is not .
If you truly believed GOD Does n't exist .
I trust that you will meet the God of Benny Hinn .
Would you be brave enough to go to one of his crusades and go on stage and boldly declare what you have said on this web site .
I feel sorry for you .
It is my hope and prayer that you will never need any type of cure for an illness nor your family .
One day you will encounter a situation that will surely change your mind .
IF YOU LIVE ON THIS EARTH AND BREATH GOD'S BREATH , YOU WILL .
REPENT AND HAVE YOUR SINS BLOTTED .
I make no secret of my " own name " , but it is easy to see how someone who could convince themself that I do could be taken in by a smooth - talking conman like Hinn .

Dear Proctologist I just came across your web site .
I have a very dear friend who cannot stand Benny Hinn and sure lets me know it .
Actually it saddens me to see this .
God loves this man as much as He loves you .
God understands where your coming from .
Do you really know deep within your heart the tremendous love that God has for you ?
Do you know that He knitted you in your mothers womb ?
Do you know that He wants to fellowship with you ?
Do you know that God wants to show His love to you in such an intimate way that will satisfy your every need in every way ?
Do you know how precious you are to Him ?
He made you and you are unique .
He has an awesome plan for you !!!
Do you want to miss it ?
All you have to do is to ask Jesus to come into your heart , ask for forgiveness of your sins , to believe
He died on the cross for you and rose again from the dead and ask Him to be your Saviour .
Is this too much to ask ?
We have nothing to give God but He has everything to give you .
Salvation , Healing and Restoration in every area of your life .
And above all Eternity .
For the Word of God says
You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free .
So please ponder on what I have shared with you .
Because God loves you with an everlasting love .
Just ask Him !!!

Subject : I am sorry about what some Christians have written you .
I came upon your article regarding Benny Hinn , and it took me aback .
I was looking for his site , obviously .
But I returned to your site and have glanced at it a little , seeing some of the mail that was written by Christians , and perhaps so - called Christians , about your story on Mr. Hinn .
The ' hate ' mail I have just looked at is a mixture .
Some of it is not hate mail at all , but more like what I feel : a profound regret that there are still many people in this world that do not know the love of Jesus .
Then there are those who do nothing for the cause of Christ , even though their emotions are mightily stirred .
I 'm sure that deep down you 've been hurt with this mail , even as you might laugh at it from an intellectual standpoint .
No one likes to be put down or criticized .
You are expressing your opinion , after all .
From your standpoint , it 's accurate enough .
But there is a question of truth .
I get the feeling , although I do n't know for sure , that you would think that everything is relative , including truth .
If I am wrong , I apologize .
If I am right , then what I could say about truth would fall on deaf ears .
So I will apologize for some people whose zeal does nothing to convince you of a need for Jesus Christ and his atonement .
As a Christian , one who has and does experience the love of my Savior , I want to give you an invitation .
Christ transcends all argument .
I challenge you .
You are a skeptic .
So was a man named Josh MacDowell .
He wrote a book entitled Evidence That Demands A Verdict .
It 's about $ 25 US or thereabouts .
I 'm sure it 's available where you are .
Maybe your library has a copy .
Get it , get a Bible , and look at them as skeptically as you are able .
Rather than look at one man and his flaws ( as you see them ) , look at the subject : Jesus of Nazareth .
Make a decision , but make sure it's an informed decision .
Yours in Christ ,

Subject : Binny Hinn ?
Hi , My name is Brandy .
I do n't know to much about the internet , and I was looking for Binny Hinn 's web , and I got yours .
I was chatting with someone last night , and they told me that they did n't believe in God , because they had done some research on the subject , and the things that they learned caused them not to believe in God .
When this person told me this , I was in total shock .
I could n't believe that this person had found a web that said there was no God .
Well , that was until just a few moments ago .
I just can't believe that you actually said that there is no God .
After reading your letter , I now understand why this person feels that there is no God !!!!
About the part where you said that they are putting their rent money and $ 1000 into buckets for Binny , that is n't the whole truth .
Yea , sure , people do give money to Preacher and Evangelists , but it is n't for either the Preacher or the Evangelist .
It is for God .
Not for them .
In the Bible it says that God wants
His people to give a tenth of a percent of their income back to Him .
Afterall , if it were n't for God , they would n't have it anyway .
If some can give more than that , that is fine .
You give what you are able to give .
You do n't have to give everything that you have , but if you can give more than a tenth , that is fine .
I just do n't understand why you are writing letters , and why you are downgrading the Lord .
How can you say that there is n't a God , if you have never took time out to open your heart and let Him in ?
I do agree with the one lady that apologized for the things that were said to you .
You see , I have only been a Christian for about four months , and if I had n't studied the Bible , I would have believed your letter .
I do n't find that what you are doing is right , because of the simple fact that innocent people that have never had a chance to learn anything about God , that will go on to this site , will read what you wrote , and some of them are going to believe you .
I love you , but I do n't like the things that you are saying .
A true Christian is suppossed to love one another as God loves you , and that is what I do .
No I do n't agree with what you are saying , but everyone is entitled to their own opinion .
I just want to ask that you open your heart and your mind , and let God control you , and help you to understand the truth behind the healing , and the donations of money , and whatever else it is that you do n't believe in .
The healings that happen in Binny Hinn 's services is not from Benny , but it is from the God in heaven .
Healings happen when there is faith in God , and where there is no faith , then there is no healing .
You have to believe in God , and in the healing power of God in order to be healed .
Benny
Hinn does not heal , but rather God heals through the faith of the prayers of the people that put their trust in Him .

You my friend are the anus award winner for the article you wrote about Benny Hinn .
You know nothing about this man , who is for real , not a fake as you may think .
He does not claim to heal anyone , he is just a faithful servant of God .
Your carnal mind cannot comprehend the things of the Holy Spirit , it is foolishness to you .
I suggest for you as a skeptic to start reading the bible , start with John & Acts in the new testaments , sincerely ask God to open your eyes & heart and reveal the truth to you .
Try reading it with an open mind .
The bible is not complicated as even some so called Christians try to make it out to be , by dissecting every word in it with their own reasoning .
Just seek & you shall find , simple .
And to the so called Christian in Texas that wrote and agreed with you about Benny Hinn , where does he get the idea that Benny Hinn is a Muslim ?
I pray God takes the blinders off his eyes .
Please accept Jesus into your life , because time is running short & soon every knee will bow & every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord !
One day you will not laugh at this statement ...
Love in Christ
This person also sent me a quotation from the Bible where God promises to laugh if bad things happen to me and to mock me if I am afraid .
Obviously a just , compassionate and forgiving God.
Strangely , as I read the passage I kept hearing it being preached in the voice of Reverend Lovejoy .

I do n't know if this is who I should write to voice my opinion on the things that were said about Benny Hinn , but here it goes anyway .
I often watch Benny Hinn on the television station called TBN .
At first I did think he was a fraud .
Everyone was being filled with the Holy Spirit , and in all the churches I have been to that never happened .
Yes , a few of the older church goers would fall over or raise their hands or speak in tongues , but this was very seldom .
I was raised in a Baptist church .
When I was married my husband and I started going to a different church .
A nondenominational Christian church .
The first time I was there I was filled with the Holy Spirit .
I did n't fall over or anything , but I could feel it .
In my body I felt peace .
That is when my views on Benny Hinn changed .
I do n't know personally id Hinn is for real or not but it is not my , or your , job to decide .
That is God 's business to judge .
I believe that God does use people like Benny to heal others so why should n't I accept Hinn .
As for me , I will leave the judging to the Lord .

Subject : Binny Hinn
I am just stumbling across your disturbing comments speaking against the man of God , Binny Hinn .
Be careful , God warns us about that in the Bible .
My heart goes out to you , as do my prayers .
I have had the honor of seeing Binny Hinn first hand and have a very good friend who works with his ministry .
This friend is about 6 ' 5 " tall and 250 lbs ( I guess ) , a healthy , solid and in - shape Christian man .
I have known him for about 10 years , before and after he was saved and was in his wedding .
He is a police detective , and when I saw him stumble back from Binny Hinn just waving his hand his way , and when I later talked to him about how he felt the annointing and the power of the annointing , I was blessed .
The funny thing is that you do n't have to believe in Binny Hinn , but you might want to start believing in the power of God .
That is real for sure sweetie , and the works of the Holy Spirit are not to be mocked .
As some have said , Binny Hinn is just a tool who is being used b! y God .
He realizes that means he must endure persecution by non-believers and doubters , why would he not experience that ?
Did n't Jesus experience that ?
And teach us to expect that ?
If Binny Hinn is a fake , which I do n't believe he is , then God will deal with him as He sees fit .
Do n't spend so much time worrying about what others are doing wrong , get your soul in order and seek the Kingdom of God , things that concern you will then fall into place .
However , if Binny Hinn is a true man of God with the annointing to heal , as we can all have , then how sad it will be when you realize that you missed your opportunity to be blessed by this man that God has chosen to use to reach millions of people .
I admire Binny Hinn for having the faith , boldness , and love for God to be in the spotlight like he is in the name of the Kingdom of God .
What are you doing ?
Or did I miss that part ?
At any rate , I love you and will pray for you and others who are afraid of the moving of the Hol !
y Spirit and how it is affecting the church .
I believe that those who have criticism are those who have not experienced the moving of the Holy Spirit in their life , in their heart , soul and spirit man .
Truly experienced Him !
Be blessed !

At you web site I have read the section about Benny Hinn .
I read that you believe that Benny Hinn is Just having these things for the money .
When Benny Hinn has his healing meetings in the US , the meeting are easliy packed out .
Why then if he was only focased on money would he fly to Australia , and other countarys who also have a much weaker currency .
It does n't seem to add up to me .
And on top of that he does n't charge for enterance but only takes a collection .
that doesnt seem to add up as well considering he could fill the areana while charging at the door and also take a collection aswell and get much more money .
And !
you also said that he does no missionary or outreach work , he funds no shelters for the homeless , the indigent , for orphans or abused women .
Well acctualy he does greatly contribute financaly , he has build homes for orphans , and funds an hospital in India , including many other things .
Next time you talk about Benny Hinn rather then talking about how terrible he is because people were given free entrance to his meets and not charged a thing , but those who wanted could offer him money .
And talk about the medicaly proven healings that are taking place .
Ps Your argument about there not being enougth room at the meeting .
Should proberly be directed to the Sydney Entertainment Centre .

I stumbled on to your site by accident .
I started to close it out but something you said caught my eye and so i decided to read what you wrote .
I have been a Christian for many years .
I have lived in the world of sin and God 's world and believe me I would choose God 's world anytime .
People like Benny Hinn bring other people to the Lord .
Benny
Hinn is just an instrument that God uses to preach the gospel to people like you and me .
Benny Hinn DOES NOT HEAL PEOPLE , GOD does .
The power of the Holy Spirit rests upon this man .
The Lord tells us in the word that greater works will we do .
Jesus is the same yesterday , today and forever .
God works through people .
We are all instruments of God .
All we have to do is obey His word .
Be careful what you say against Benny Hinn and any other man that God has chose to preach the gospel .
You never know , one day He could call you into the ministry .
God bless you .

Subject : Repent
I would just like to say one thing about anyone mocking Benny Hinn or any christian minister or ministry , you better repent before you reap what you sow .
God is his or any minister "s judge , not a man or woman .
He will deal with anyone misusing His name or word .
The danger is anyone making fun of or blaspheming the work of the Holy Spirit is in danger of hell .
I never mock a man or woman of God , even if they make a mistake .
Who among us has n't made a mistake , even the best christians ?
When you judge a christian , you are judging God , because
He said in His word , whatever you do to the least of these my brethren , you do unto Me .
Those words are in red in my bible , because Jesus Himself said them .
It is better to say nothing than to speak death .
Proverbs 18:21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue , so I would watch waht I say , because whether you believe it or not , you will reap what you sow , either death or life .
Read Matthew 12:34 -37 and you will see what Jesus said about your words .
It is a very dangerous thing to speak against anyone , especially children of God .
If you do n't like what Benny Hinn or anyone other christian is doing , pray for them or just leave them alone , for your well being .
God will not be mocked , whatever you say will count either against you or for you , it is your choice .
I pray God will open the eyes of everyone who reads this and give them understanding in Jesus ' name !

You seem to know him better than himself .
Sure you can talk about him but have you ever looked in the mirror ?
I do n't think he 's got a problem , at least he 's doing God 's work .
You on the other hand has to stand before God , and YOU WILL CONFESS that Jesus Christ is Lord .
Yes , Benny 's name wo n't even be brought up when it 's your day .
But your deeds will ......
God does forgive if you will recieve what his son Jesus did on the Cross .

Hi !
I have just read your page of comments you have received due to your article on Benny Hinn .
I do not know where you stand with your beliefs as I have not read your artcle on Benny .
Some have referred to you as an athiest .
The page I was on did not reveal much in that aspect .
I am a believer in the Lord Jesus Christ , I have been a believer since 1974 .
I do not use the term " Christian " as the term has a much broader spectrum then the term had in the book of Acts when the church was formed .
I once followed Benny Hinn until he began to make false prophecies .
One of these prophecies was that Jesus would appear on his stage .
Ruth Stapleton ( I believe that was her name ) had prophesied to Benny that Jesus would appear physically on his stage .
Benny himself believed this would happen in Kenya and prophesied so on TBN .
Never happened .
Jesus warns us in Matthew 24:21 - 28 concerning false christs .
He warns if a man tells us that He is here , or there not to beleive it .
He then goes on to say that His appearance will be like lightning as it shines from east to west .
Does not sound to me like
He is limited to a stage in Kenya !
He says not to go forth to where they say He is .
Some have rendered this verse to translate , " this is during " the great tribulation " by inserting the word , " the " before the word , " great tribulation " .
Jesus does not use the word " the " just the words , ' great tribulation " .
This world has " great tribulation " in may diverse geograhical areas right now and this is intensifying around the globe daily .
It is only rendered as a specific future time when we insert the word " the " in front of " great tribulation " .
Benny also prophesied that the time was coming when people would place their sick loved ones in front of the TV when TBN was on and that their loved ones would be healed through the TV .
God says if a man claims to be speaking for Him and his words do not come to pass then God has not spoken to that man and that man has spoken presumptuously .
Deuteronomy 18 : 15 - 22 .
We are warned in I John chapter 4 to try the spirits as to whether they are of God .
The problem with the church today is that she lacks discernment .
Not all who claim the name of Jesus belong to Him .
Jesus tells us this in Matthew 7:13 - 23 .
There is a believer 's judgement in Matthew 25:31 - 46 .
Both the sheep and goats refer to Jesus as " Lord " .
The only difference being being the sheep have a genuine faith evidential with " works " as the book of James describes and the goats have a counterfeit faith that does nothing for others , a faith of " self " promotion and " self " motivation .
Discernment is vital to a believer .
Without it they can fall for a " counterfeit " faith which seems so right yet is so wrong and has eternal consequences .
If truth is altered even slightly it is no longer truth .
If the gospel is altered even slightly it is no longer the gospel , it is a counterfeit gospel .
Satan works within the church , he does not bother those who already belong to him .
He appears as an angel of light , he does not do things that will reveal who he really is .
What he does looks genuine , but is altered ever so slightly .
If only the church would wake up to this !
Lastly , if you are an athiest I will not condemn you for your faith as an athiest , I will only challenge you .
First of all , you are not entirely convinced of your stand or you would not show an interest Benny Hinn or any other false teachers .
In all reality you are defending God when you expose Benny Hinn .
Secondly , being an athiest requires you to have even more faith than I because you have to work to disbelieve all the evidence of a Creator you see around you everyday .
In Romans chapter 1 Paul writes about the power of the gospel and he says the just live by faith because of their belief in God and acknowledgement of God .
Paul goes on to say man is without excuse because of the evidence of God from the creation of the world is clearly seen and understood .
Move your fingers , awesome is n't it ?
Thanks !
Have a great day !

If you will get a hold of this message , it will make you hungry for the presence of God .
If you do not become hungry and completely desperate for an encounter with the Holy Ghost after this message , then you 're going to have to ask God if you really know Him .

Dear Proctologist ;
I do n't know who you are or where your from .
I think that you need to get your heart right with God .
You see God does not promote skepticism .
The bible says that when you judge use righteous judgment and skeptics do not use righteous judgment .
It 's not Benny Hinn 's fault that some people do n't get in to some crusades believe me i've been to two of his crusades .

I hope this is the right email address , Look Jesus loves you and you might not acknowledge that you love him back but obviously you 've thought a little about God Maybe your fighting yourself on something but you have taken your time to actually make a website about him .
maybe you know this or maybe you do n't but God has called you to be something , and maybe Satan has you questioning everything but that 's just a trap .
So fight back cause whether you believe in God or not there is a such thing and there is an after life and if you do n't change for God then you will go to Hell and I know you have received some pretty harsh emails but they are trying to open your eyes before its too late .
You have a chance to be something great in life so Do n't pick on Benny Hinn because he is doing marvelous things with God , cause that could be your calling in life too .
The Bible says this in Job 11 :
" Yet if you devote your heart to him
and stretch out your hands to him .
If you put away the sin that is in your hand
and allow no evil to dwell in your tent ,
Then you will lift up your face without shame ;
You will stand firm and without fear .
You will surely forget your trouble ,
recalling it only as waters gone by .
Life will be brighter than noonday ,
and darkness will become like morning .
you will be secure , because there is hope ;
you will look about you and take your rest in safety .
You will lie down , with no one to make you afraid ,
and many will court your favor .
But the eyes of the wicked will fail ,
and escape will elude them ;
their hope will become a dying gasp . "
So please just pray cause Gods there and He would really love to talk to you .
And if you listen closely
He will talk back .
Your Christian friend ,
Christina

Hey proctologist !
Benny Hinn is not a Fake .
It is real God 's power made evident to a nation that had chosen to declare war to God almighty himself and to break all spiritual and moral patterns inheritted from the pioneers and fatherlands .
Instead of attacking Benny Hinn
Why do n't you attack Heavy metal and rock satanist groups ?
Why do n't you attack indians gurus taking dollars from americans everywhere ?
Why do n't you attack all those New Phacists organizations nationwide ?

Well , have 26 year old , but when I was 24 , I was diagnosed by a terrible disease , and was what I feared most , colon cancer .
I went to doctors , and spent all my money on quimos and all that stuff , and nothing happened , until a day I went to a Benny Hinn conference and I was healed I felt the presence of God in my body touching me , I did't go up stage I felt the presence of God very far away .
What is true is that now instead of giving the money to a sort of doctors , I give it to Benny Hinn ministries that 's better , because God healed me not a doctor that only wanted to operate me to give him $ $ $money , for the operation and does n't matter if it was in terminal stage of the cancer .
Now I 'm healthy and because of the servants of God like Benny that proclaims that Jesus heals and no other does , I 'm thankful because for me was not cure , and that 's why every month I send what I want to give him .

free will .
remember .
in the above article on the home page someone has argued God 's existence because of Benny Hinn , failing to forget that before the fall of man everything WAS good .
We brought upon sin and all categories of sin ourselves .
God is so loving that he does not MAKE us love Him back .
We are given the free will to choose .
If Benny Hinn chooses to continue in his false teachings , albeit I am in complete opposition , that is his own free will .
And for all his followers , it is their free will to believe him .
People are looking anywhere and everywhere but inside themselves for an answer to all of the things evil and insecure in our world .
Benny
Hinn is a powerful tool ... but for who ?
If every time God had to strike down one of his peoples for lying , stealing , or any other sin of the flesh ... there would be no one left on earth .
As it is stated , " We all fall short of the glory of God . "
So to believe that your sin is less than that of Benny Hinn and that this is evidence enough that there is no God leads me to wonder why we as TRUE BELIEVERS , and not just talkers are in unbelievers eyes simple , but somehow have the ' wider eye . '

I ahve been blessed with the oppurtunity to watch many benny hinn tapes .
Owing to the lack of the necessary amonut of faith , I was unconvinced of his ability to heal at will .
However , it is well known that all things are possible with the Almighty Father .
With this being constant on my mind , I found it necessay to question my own faith more than that of Benny or his followers .
Initially I had accepted him to be no more than a clever showman with well rehearsed props .
Having no personal experiences of the man himself , apart from visual images of him on tapes , I began to ask myself , if he was aware that The Almighty was watching and heariong everything he says .
Only a fool will seek to decieve with using the name of the Almighty .
Benny in my opinion is not short of the wisdom that forbids him to become engaged in such acts of deciet .
If he is so sure that The Almighty is healing the people who put their faith in him , then surely he must be aware of the consequences he will face for pretending to be when he is not .
Besides there is always the possibilty of him being exposed , and with it all that he stands for .
He calls on no one else but Jesus and The Father .
I now rate the man as an atom of the genuine article .
Long may he be an influence to us all .
and I pray that Our Father in Heaven be with him always .
Lately I have grown to admire him a little bit more each day

To all those who believe that Benny Hinn is a false prophet , I just want you to know that Jesus Christ loves you .
You are completely wrong about Benny Hinn , but Jesus Christ still loves you .
Oh how I wish you knew about His love and forgiveness .
Did you know that if you were the only person in the whole world , Christ still would have died for you .
He loves you so much .
If there is anyone out there who will go so far to say that they do n't believe in God , it 's OK . . . . .
He believes in you .
And I guarantee that if you receive Him into your heart , YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED .
I promise .
Just give it a try , what do you have to lose , unless you 're scared to do it , because you know that it is real .
Jesus is coming back people . . . . . a lot sooner that you think .
And I just want you all to be ready .
I do n't want to see anybody go to hell .
Hell was n't created for people , it was created for the devil , and only the devil .
But , I have to be honest with you , unless you repent and give you lives to Jesus , you will go there .
I 'm sorry to be so blunt , but , I 'm just stating a fact .
But , the good news is that Jesus is given every one of you time to repent and come to Him .
That is the only reason that He has n't come yet , to give you an opportunity to make heaven you 're home .
If you choose not to do that , then it 's not God 's fault .
So , please all of you , just give God a chance .
And while you 're at it , give Benny Hinn a chance to .
I really do not like what you are saying about him .
He has healed so many people through the Name of Jesus .
People who had Aids , Cancer , blind eyes , deaf ears , they are all healed because of what Benny Hinn is doing in Jesus ' Name .

To whom it may concern
I have seen some of your statements about Benny Hinn and now I can see why you say the things that you say about him .
Firstly , as others have already commented you are trying to prove him false because he is a trickster as far as you are concerned .
You say that he takes the money and does n't use it on the homeless , or on kids or on charities .
Well I think you obviously have n't checked your information very well .
Also you interview some of those on wheel chairs who have been to the Benny Hinn crusades and obviously they have not been healed .
It is quite obvious that you are not a born again , spirit filled christian , because if you were , you might understand that it is not up to Benny Hinn who gets healed .
In fact I have been to many healing crusades not conducted by Benny Hinn but by other believers here in Australia and not all have been healed .
Now we know from the scriptures that even though Jesus did heal all who came to Him , there was an instance where even
He could n't do any miracle because of the unbelief of the people .
Benny Hinn is not God Almighty even though you are trying to make him be one , from your point of view .
You are trying to reason things first and I think that 's where you differ with us born again christians .
You see God is not impressed with our knowledge but he is concerned about our hearts .
The Real Question is , if we have all broken at least some of God 's laws then we all do n't have a perfect record .
If there are only two places to go after we die , HEAVEN or HELL , no third place .
Then we by right should all be destined for HELL .
That 's where JESUS comes in .
You see he 's got a PERFECT RECORD and when He died on the cross
He exchanged our IMPERFECT RECORD for His PERFECT RECORD .
But this event only happens for each one of us when we Turn from evil and Surrender our lives to Jesus .
So when you die , are you going to HEAVEN or HELL ?
that 's a decision only you can make .

Nosso filho que e adolescente , tem buscado ao Senhor e espera nele a vitoria .
Nossa historia e muito grande , ja tivemos varias experiencias com Espirito Santo, e isso nos conforta porque sabemos que ele esta junto a nos .
No seu livro que fala de milagres , eu li sobre as cruzadas , mas e muito longe do Brasil , nao temos como ir , entao resolvi lhe mandar este e-mail e pedir que ore pela cura do meu filho Kassio , por sei que o Senhor Jesus tem agido grandemente atraves de suas oracoes .
Gostaria de receber uma resposta , so nao entendo muito de ingles .
Espero em Cristo Jesus a vitoria , a cura e total restabelecimento de meu filho .
Paz do Senhor Jesus .

It 's too bad that you go to such lengths to get attention .
The Bible says to touch not mine annointed .
You are doing just that .
I would get right with God before it 's too late .
Your site ad is also very deceiving to get people to view it .
God will take care of Rev. Benny Hinn , you wo n't have anything to do with it .
You judging him wo n't hurt Benny , it will just hurt you , and it makes you look very very bad .

I hope you know Jesus as He is the one Benny Hinn serves .
He has a genuine love for Christ .
There is nothing deceiving about Benny Hinn or Jesus .
The bible clearly states " Woe unto you , Touch Not My Annointed And do My Prophets No Harm " .
Do no harm means not bad mouth or bare false witness against him either .
You have put yourself in Danger by your printing of such lies .
If you do not ask God to forgive you and stop what it is you do He ( Jesus ) will deal with you .
He is a God of Love , but also of vengence and wrath .
Please do not provoke
Him in such a manner as this .
God in His Word ( bible ) also mentions , " I ( God ) will not be mocked ! "
He means that you or I or no one is suppose mock the work
He does through human hands or the person
He chooses to use .
Hey , football players get paid alot of money to do what we exspect them to do .
So should a Person who tells others Jesus and His power is REAL .
Besides that , the money is used for a very good purpose instead of self - pleasures .

Ok ... what I have to say is very simple .
As I read some of your writings about Benny Hinn , I could n't help but cry for you .
Not because you have touched one of GOD " S anointed but becuse you are trashing a mans character .
He has done nothing to you to make you lash out at him .
But I am happy to say that he does not have to fight you or anyone like you , because God is for him and God fights his battles !
So say what you will , it will only hurt you in the end .
I have been a christen for 17 and I have seen God do things that would make your head spen .
this is not a " hate mail " but rather to say that I hope and pray that you will listen to the words of warning .
I will pray for you and like so many other have said ... why do n't you go and see for your self .
You may be very surprised at what you 'll find .
In 96 I went to one of his meetings and I too did n't know if the whole things was real but I found that in the hr and 45 min before the meeting to start , People were getting healed and saved and I just sat there in tears , feeling God touch on my heart and life , because of GOD I am forever changed .
NOT because of Benny Hinn .
I wish you could hear the Father heart for you and how much He loves you .
May you find Jesus Christ and know the truth !
I do n't know or why you would do shuch a thing , but regardless Jesus still died on the cross for you and is waiting for your heart to call on Him .
Look to Jesus not to man .
Man is only the vessel .
and Jesus is the only one who can heal and save .
Just know that I will be praying for you and you may find the real truth about Jesus Christ .
Seek the truth for
He will set you free indeed !

Dear Sir : I too was once where you are .
I too did not believe .
And yet , as much as I denied God 's existence , when I really needed help ( when no one else could help ) , in my brokenness and at tne end of my rope , I cried out to God .
This makes no sense to our minds , but God is spirit and not controlled by our minds .
Once you have had an encounter with Almighty God , you too will believe .
Until then , my friend - Many of us join together in prayer for your soul .
God is no respecter of persons .
He loves you no matter what .
It is your sin he hates .
He will open
His loving arms to you -
When you are ready ( and only then ) .
When
He created us , He gave us a free will and He will not go against your will .
You are in need of a Savior ( whether you agree or not ) and ONE DAY - the Bible says , " Every tongue will confess and every knee will bow ... that Jesus Christ is Lord " .
Meanwhle , my friend , we stand in the gap for you .
" Father , forgive him .
He knows not what he does .

l am not hear comment on whether or not Pastor benny is a man of God or not .
but let you know that our lORD GOD heals .
when you fall in his presence that is when you realize there is a lot of power in his presence .
l am not surprised by today coments on man of God for even himself the Lord Jesus christ was subject to such .
let us leave judgement to God or else we run the risk on touching the anoited of God.
so far in all l have seen and had Beny hinn has acknowldged that healing is from the lord .
those who miss it is because they are after a sign as the bible says as oppossed to the Lord , for sure they never get the sign .

Subject : benny hinn is the man of Jesus
When the bible is the ultimate true word of the living god .
the holy trinity and Jesus is the son of the living god and has true witness and his power is executed through faithfull people whom he pours the holy spirit on and when he sent his deciples to preach the word of god he said heal the sick and baptise in the name of the Faher , son and the holy spirit and bring his good news to the world and the lost ones of god .
So to me pastor benny hinn is just one of his appointed faithfull servents ploughing the good seed in good groung of spreading the word of god and we should not make comments but try to absorbe and keep in the truth rather than beeing a companiog of the satan in feeling jelous of gods people and making comments .
I pray that he may bring the word to every one needfull .

Supporters of the Kyoto Protocol were gleeful on Saturday after Australian elections left the United States in the wilderness as the only major economy to boycott the UN ’s climate pact .
The ouster of Prime Minister John Howard stripped President George W. Bush of a key ally barely a week before a conference in Bali , Indonesia , on the world ’s response to climate change beyond 2012 , they said .
“ It ’s great news for the Kyoto Protocol , ” Shane Rattenburg , Greenpeace ’s political director , told AFP .
“ It ’s a very important event in the international climate debate , and for Bali .
It will leave Bush and the United States more isolated . ”
Industrialised countries that have signed and ratified the Protocol are required to meet targeted curbs in their greenhouse - gas emissions by 2012 .

Spaceport America is scheduled to open in 2010 , and this is the final design .
Located in New Mexico , it's to be 100,000 square feet and cost about $ 31 million to build .
Incorporating the latest in green technology , it promises to be environmentally friendly ( minus all the rocket fuel ) .
It will serve as a functional spaceport where Virgin Galactic will transport rich people here or even further into the cosmos .
For poor people it will be a tourist attraction .
It will also serve as the headquarters of the XPrize Cup and the Rocket Racing League and look like a public restroom toilet seat when viewed from above .

Spaceport America to Open in 2010 [ ohgizmo ]
Sept. 25 , 2007  --
A former member of the House Republican congressional leadership -- and the last African - American to serve as a member of the GOP in Congress -- harshly criticized Tuesday the decision of the Republican presidential front - runners to not attend a debate focused on minority issues .
" I think the best that comes out of stupid decisions like this , " said former Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts , is " that African - Americans might say , ' Was it because of my skin color ? '
Now , maybe it was n't , but African - Americans do say , ' It crossed my mind . ' "
All four GOP presidential front - runners -- former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson -- have said they will not attend a PBS debate at a historically black college in Baltimore hosted by Tavis Smiley .
The invitations were extended in March , but the front - runners have claimed scheduling conflicts .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who 's weighing getting into the race , called that excuse " baloney " and called the no-shows " fundamentally wrong . "
On " Good Morning America " today , Gingrich said GOP candidates are making a mistake because " African - Americans have been hurt more by the failures of government " than any other group .
Watts pointed out that some of the candidates with more liberal histories on issues such as guns and abortion have reached out to conservative groups that do n't share their views .
Watts was the former chairman of the House GOP caucus , and served in Congress from 1995 until 2003 .
" You kind of scratch your head thinking why are they making decisions like that ? "
Watts said .
He speculated the candidates do n't have any African - American staffers who " could say to them , ' You 're making a huge mistake strategically by not at least reaching out and talking to this demographic . ' "
On " The Tonight Show " last week , Smiley protested the decision by the front - runners .
" What does it say when you do n't think that black issues and brown issues and issues for red and yellow -- what does it say when you do n't think that all of us are valuable in this process ? " he asked .
African - Americans are the most reliably Democratic voters around , with up to 90 percent voting Democratic in the last five presidential elections , but Watts and other Republicans including former vice presidential nominee Jack Kemp , and former RNC chairman Ken Mehlman , have said that 's exactly why Republicans need to reach out to them .
These no -shows come just days after the Spanish - language channel Univision canceled its debate because only one of the 11 Republican candidates -- McCain -- accepted .
In 2004 President Bush scored better with Hispanics than previous Republicans , garnering 44 percent of the vote , according to exit polls .
But the recent debate over immigration reform may drive those voters back to Democrats in 2008 .
PBS correspondent Ray Suarez , a panelist in Thursday 's debate , said there are imperatives beyond getting votes .
" There are issues in the campaign as it's being run in this conventional way that will never get covered unless you convene debates of this type , " Suarez said .
Candidates could go through a whole campaign without ever talking about issues such as diabetes , hypertension , the high rate of asthma in the inner cities , he said .
" These are issues that play differently outside those minority groups .
And you could run a whole campaign without ever talking about them unless you talk specifically to blacks and Latinos about their problems . "
ABC 's Cindy Smith and Sheila Evans contributed to this report .
On the second day of Pakistan ’s major offensive to uproot the Taliban from tribal areas along the Afghan border , the military claimed to have killed 60 militants , while the Taliban countered that it had fended off the troops ’ initial onslaught .
Wildly differing interpretations of progress being made on both sides are expected to continue as the military proceeds with its most crucial ground operation so far in its war against Islamic militants .
Pakistani army officials said Sunday that 60 militants and five soldiers were killed during the first 24 hours of the offensive , in which thousands of troops have been moved into a large section of South Waziristan considered a stronghold for militants loyal to Taliban leader Hakimullah Mahsud and his predecessor , Baitullah Mahsud , as well as Al Qaeda fighters .
Baitullah Mahsud was killed in a U.S. drone strike Aug. 5 .
The military also said it had destroyed six Taliban antiaircraft gun positions and found locations that Taliban militants fled , leaving behind their firearms and ammunition .
Pakistani fighter jets Sunday pounded suspected Taliban hide - outs in the villages of Ladha and Makeen , military officials said .

The Taliban painted a very different picture of the initial fighting , saying its fighters succeeded in pushing back Pakistani troops and inflicting heavy casualties .
“ We have not been weakened , ” Taliban spokesman Azam Tariq said .
“ Our morale is high and we will fight it out . ”
Neither side ’s claims can be verified because the government is denying access to the region .
The offensive , which began early Saturday , is seen as the key to success in crushing a militancy that for years has used suicide bombings and other acts of violence to destabilize the nuclear - armed nation of 170 million people .

The government believes that more than 80 % of terrorist attacks inflicted on Pakistan were generated from the rugged , underdeveloped Waziristan region .
For months , Washington has pushed the government in Islamabad to forge ahead with the offensive against the Pakistani Taliban , which has provided sanctuary to Al Qaeda leaders and fighters .
Experts estimate that about 10,000 militants are braced for battle in South Waziristan , including 1,200 Al Qaeda - allied Uzbek fighters .
The military is using 30,000 troops in the operation , and relying on fighter jets and helicopter gunships to bomb Taliban hide - outs and bunkers in the ridges and plateaus that dominate the landscape .
Asked about the Waziristan offensive during an interview with CNN on Friday , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said the Pakistani military was “ very much focused on also going into the heartland of where the Pakistan Taliban and Al Qaeda are located , and where these plots and these attacks are planned and directed .

“ So I think that they understand that there is a direct threat to them , which they are addressing , which I think is all to the good , ” Clinton added .
U.S. Army Gen. David H. Petraeus was expected to arrive in Pakistan today for talks with Pakistani military commanders about the Waziristan operation .

Special correspondent Zulfiqar Ali in Peshawar , Pakistan , contributed to this report .
There is a poignant passage in Kurt Vonnegut ’s book Slaughterhouse
Five where he imagines a devastating bombing scene as a movie being run backward on a projector .
The fires on the ground disappear as the bombs are sucked up into the bombers , which fly backward and land on a military base .
There , the bombs are removed from the planes and taken to a factory , where they are dismantled .
Perhaps this wishful fantasy was inspired by Vonnegut ’s own experience watching the fire bombing of Dresden .
If and when our bombs begin falling on Iran , given our current limitations in navigating space and time , we will not be able to run the movie backward .
The dead will still be dead , the destroyed will still be destroyed , and among the casualties will be our own open society .
The damage will be irreversible , and in fact will have reversed 230 years of forward progress towards a just society , and a sane world .
But there is something we can and must “ run backward ” at this time .
We must stand together to face the dark forces that have taken us from freedom to fascism , and reverse the momentum back to sanity and freedom .
There are two common impulses at a crisis time like this .
The first is , “ Do n’t just stand there .
Do something ! ”
The other is , “ Do n’t do something .
Just stand there . ”
So instead of futilely flailing about or hopelessly resigning , it makes sense to take a deep breath and fully assess the situation .
The first piece of good news is , there are at least 50 million of us in accord that the reins of power have gotten out of our hands , and this illegitimate power must be reined in .

Update : Please read the article carefully before commenting .
If you notice , most of the problems being described here is part of Eclipse , which is open source .
So , usability issues are faced by open source programs as well , and not just proprietary programs on Linux .
The reason I wrote that title was because this pain is usually felt by people who are making closed source packages that works on different Linux distributions .
The real issue is about unneeded incompatibilities between different Linux distributions .
After working on the porting project to make Flex Builder run on
Linux ,
I am starting to see why closed source software on Linux is
hard .
There are just a handful of closed source products on Linux ( counting
only the famous ones ) – Opera , Skype , Nero , Acrobat Reader , and Flash
Player .
Hmmm , I can think of just 5 .
Why is that important at all ?
Because software developers who are not
initiated to the FOSS philosophy will be scared off the platform
because of its inherent complexities .
For example , in this project ,
getting the software to run on the various Linux distros was , to put
it lightly , troublesome .
There are a number of issues that we faced , which I ’m certain is the
reason others do n’t want to get into this as well .
Let ’s start with Eclipse .
Eclipse runs fairly well on different
platforms ( let ’s ignore the memory - hogging issue here ) , but on Linux ,
it ’s a different ballgame .
Somehow , the polishing of the UI is
markedly lacking .
Yes , we ’ve filed
bugs , but turns
out it ’s not really Eclipse ’s fault , it ’s simply because different
window managers work differently on Linux , and handling all of this is
a nightmare .
Oh , and this gets better when it comes to distros .
For example , the
latest released Eclipse 3.3 wo n’t run on the latest released Fedora
version .
You have to wait till Fedora
8 ! Because of this ,
we had to drop support for Fedora , and instead concentrated on
other distros
such as Suse , Red Hat and Ubuntu .
That brings up another problem – the number of distros .
The QA effort
required for the Flex Builder ( FB ) on Linux project was huge indeed .
And yes , we found problems that occurred only on Red Hat but not on
Ubuntu , and so on .
For example , clicking on help links in Eclipse on
Red Hat opens a new window every time whereas it properly displays in
the same window on Ubuntu .
Again , it ’s not really Eclipse’s
fault .
Go
figure .
Then , there ’s the issue of running Firefox .
There ’s nothing wrong with
Firefox itself , but what ’s with each distro trying to customize the
Firefox startup script ?!
FB on Linux has to check whether the correct
version of the Flash Player plugin is installed in the browser , and
checking this is a long
procedure
– do we check in ~/. firefox / plugins / directory or
~/.mozilla/ plugins / or $ MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH
or some
Suse - distro - specific directory such as
/usr/lib/browser-plugins/ !
Life is simply too
hard
compared to other operating systems .
Is n’t it a wonder that nobody wants to develop a closed source product
for Linux ?
Even Microsoft is just handing over the audio video codecs
to Novell and
letting them to do the hard work of creating Moonlight on Linux .
Microsoft is smart enough not to try to maintain a Linux version
of Silverlight on its own ( I ’m considering only technical issues ,
let ’s set aside philosophical issues on this one ) .
If we really want to make Linux a good platform , then we need to stop
messing around with the basics – at least please do n’t muck up the
basic shell scripts and paths .
The way to get more people , in large numbers , to understand the open
source and free software philosophies is by making their first steps
easy .
It can not be an all - or - nothing approach .
Closed source software
on Linux is not practical .
And that ’s a bad thing because if we can ’t
convert software developers to use a different platform , how can we
expect mom and pop to switch
to Linux ?
In spite of all this , I think we ’ve done a good job of FB on Linux ,
and happy to see all the great
response
we ’ve seen so far , including reports of success on various distros
that we ’ve never even heard before .
So please keep the
feedback coming !
Standard disclaimer :
The opinions expressed here are my own , not
Adobe’s .
There 's a whole bunch of people who just can't seem to make up their minds about whether or not waterboarding constitutes torture .
In case you have n't been paying attention during the Bush reign , waterboarding is that practice of strapping a person to a board , then tilting said person in such a way that his feet are higher than his head , then forcing water down his throat and up his nostrils , producing a complete sense of powerlessness , panic , and impending doom .
Theoretically , the person being doused half to death is a terrorist , one who can , literally in this case , cough up info that will save lives of the sort of good people who are torturing him , but in reality there is often only the faintest suspicion these people so reluctantly engaging in water sports activities with their interrogators have any affiliation with terrrorism at all , or that they know anything worth knowing .
Nonetheless , the idea is that doing stuff like half drowning people will motivate them to tell you things .
And , in a general sense , it works , with most waterboardees splashing and spluttering out just about anything their superhydrators want to hear , true or not .
After all , if people are blindfolding you , then forcing water into and throughout your respiratory system , would n't you be inclined to get creative , and tell them just about anything your anxious mind could contrive in order to get them to stop with the water , already , before you were dead .
Lots of the people who can't make up their minds about whether waterboarding constitutes torture are in the State Department , others are in the White House , and still others are in the Pentagon and the CIA .
President Bush , the " Decider , " has decided that waterboarding is n't torture , exactly , and besides , we 're probably not doing it , anyway .
Now Bush wants to replace his former Attorney General with yet another person who just can't quite see the harm in waterboarding , replacing the clueless Alberto Gonzales with yet another man who is fuzzy on the concept of just what constitutes torture , and what does n't .
The new guy 's name is Mukasey and , like Gonzales and other Bush appointees , he is old - fashioned in his views about things like the Geneva Convention , finding lots of civilized attitudes " quaint , " and offering up lots of opinion to justify the use of things civilized Americans once rebuked as uncivilized , and unworthy of a nation founded on the protections of our legal system .
Mukasey , the new guy Bush wants to put in Gonzo 's old post , is a judge , though when it comes to judging a simple thing like whether being mean with water constitutes torture , this new Attorney - General nominee just can't work up an opinion .
He finds it too hard to make up his mind on the issue , hard to judge whether waterboarding is torture .
It 's a conundrum he just can't work out , and a decision on the matter eludes him , though making judgments is kinda what most people thought judges did , as a matter of course .
Rushing to his defense , President Bush argued that it was unfair to ask the guy to render an opinion on this matter because , after all , trying to determine in advance how a guy who is going to administer justice in the top legal post in the nation just ain't fair .
That was Bush 's word ~ " unfair . "
For those who thought Bush has been playing rather fast and loose with ideas of fairness during his administration , it 's encouraging to see that he 's concerned about the concept , and that he now finds it unfair that those charged with overseeing who gets appointed to high office in our government are actually asking questions about what kind of attitudes such people would bring to their work .
We can't have that , of course .
It would be like trying to determine in interviews how a potential employee might function in a job he or she was applying for , and , according to the President of These Not -Terribly - United States , doing that sort of thing just ain't fair .
Try telling that to the next " human resources " type you 're facing across a desk in a pre-employment interview , and then cite the nation 's chief executive as your authority .
For most of the people who just can't decide what is torture and what ain't , if it is n't done in a medieval dungeon and does n't involve red - hot pokers and eyeballs , it 's probably just heavy teasing .
If it was n't equal to what they 'd seen in one of the SAW movies , it 's probably not torture , and probably no worse than frat - boy hazing rituals .
Fraternity hazings .
That 's how ol ' Rush Limbaugh defined waterboarding and lots of the other techniques currently being used by our intelligence gatherers , though the not - so - funny part is how we cannot admit we 're using such techniques because that would help the enemy prepare for the tortures we 're not employing against them .
Really , we 're not .
Except when we are .
Anyway , ol ' Rush Limbaugh , the guy who is so pain - averse he got himself addicted to the painkiller Oxycontin , just can't find anything wrong with causing pain and suffering to others if it holds out even illusory promise of keeping us safer .
Given his sensitivity to pain and discomfort , you 'd think Limbaugh would be just a mite more pecky in his attittude about causing pain to others , but one of the identifying characteristics of the remaining Bush supporters these days is that there 's always a double standard .
What applies to them does not necessarily apply to others , things like tax breaks , and sacrifice , and judgmental attitudes toward other people 's lifestyle choices that often turn out to be utterly hypocritical .
Core support for Bush administration torture policy tends to be found in the evangelical movement , those " Christian " fundamentalists who have redefined what Christianity means all over again , whisking it back to those merry days of old when people like Torquemada and other inquisitors had ways of sorting out just who was a heretic and who was n't .
So , by God , if burning people and dunking other people in ponds to determine whether not they were practicing witches was good enough for our Christian forefathers , then using water as an agent of sorting our the terrorists is certainly good enough for the Bush & Cheney - style Christians and other contemporary crusaders .
So , onward Christian soldiers .
Keep up the good work , ye masked interrogators who are , even as I type these words , receiving those prisoners who are being treated to an all - expense - paid vacation to some Third World holding facility for people we want to detain and dunk awhile , all innocently and for good purposes , free of the taint that anything of this kind might be misconstrued as torture because , hell , even judges can't make up their minds about whether drowning simulations are bad or not .
And , to you detainees , just kick back on your little slab of wood provided by the U.S. government , and prepare to gurgle happily , secure in the knowledge that what 's happening to you really ain't so bad , at least as defined by those who can't really decide whether or not it 's bad at all .
And God Bless America .
May the Prince of Peace bless all our efforts to eradicate infidels , and may our critics come to recognize that the water we 're pouring down the gullets of those who might know something we want to know is , in the truest sense of the word , holy water , the kind of water Jesus Himself might have used to bless
His flock in order to defend the faith , and keep the mean ol ' wolves at bay .

As you can see , this video is an excellent mix of very shiny eye - candy and real - world applications that seriously benefit from the use of a multi - touch interface .
It goes way beyond Jeff Han 's TED demo in showing the technology 's usefulness in collaborative applications on large - format displays .
The news that Han is forming a startup company is very encouraging .
One of the things that 's been quite worrisome since the iPhone announcement was that Apple would claim a patent on the concept of " multi- touch " .
Fortunately , the fact that Perceptive Pixel came into existence is a good sign that Apple does n't own every right on this new and revolutionary idea .
As he wandered , he picked up on the latest developments in the art , inventing new cocktails and building a serious following for his particular blend of craftsmanship and showmanship , epitomized in his signature drink , the Blue Blazer , a pyrotechnic showpiece in which an arc of flame passed back and forth between two mixing glasses .
At the Occidental , Thomas was earning $ 100 a week , more than the vice president of the United States .
When he died , in 1885 , newspapers all over the country observed his passing in substantial obituaries .
Thomas ’s most celebrated bar was at Broadway and 22nd Street , occupying the basement and one bay of what is now Restoration Hardware .
“ They really ought to put some sort of plaque there , ” Mr. Wondrich said .
On the walls of Thomas ’s saloon hung caricatures of the political and theatrical figures of the day , many of them executed by Thomas Nast , including one , now lost , depicting Thomas “ in nine tippling postures colossally , ” as a newspaper reporter described it .
Customers could look at themselves in fun - house mirrors that made them look fat or thin .
By this time Thomas was middle - aged , with a wife and two daughters , and at 205 pounds one of the lighter members of the Fat Men ’s Association , but still , undeniably , a sport .
Thomas ’s life spanned the three great ages of the cocktail , the archaic , the baroque and the classic , a helpful chronology proposed by Mr. Wondrich .

In 1830 , the probable year of his birth , the main American mixed drinks were punches , toddies and slings — nothing more than brandy , gin or whiskey sweetened with a little sugar .
Thomas found his professional footing in an age of flamboyant creativity , when bartenders experimented with a bewildering array of ingredients and styles , and by the time of his death in 1885 he had seen the birth of the more streamlined modern cocktail typified by the manhattan and the martini .
It is the baroque cocktail that occupied most of Mr. Wondrich ’s attention .
Thomas , however , could be maddeningly vague in his recipes .
Mr. Wondrich was able to determine that a wineglass , as a unit of measure , equaled two ounces .
He also discovered that most of the gin recipes envisioned the strongly flavored , malty Dutch gin , not the style known as London dry , which did not take off until the 1890s .
Sugar , in Thomas ’s age , came in a dense loaf and was less refined than modern white sugar but not as raw as raw sugar ( Mr. Wondrich compromises by using Demerara or turbinado sugar , pulverized in a food processor . )
A dominant male mouse does not just turn a female on – he makes her brain grow .
Just a whiff of his odour is enough to make her brain sprout new neurons , and this growth drives her to want to mate with him , new research has found .
Samuel Weiss at the University of Calgary in Alberta , Canada , and his colleagues exposed 8 - to 10 - week - old female mice to soiled bedding from males of the same age .
Two weeks later they found that the brains of females exposed to dominant male pheromones had grown significantly more new neurons in two key regions of the brain than those exposed to subordinate pheromones and control odours .
What is more , these females would then pick the dominant male over the subordinate when presented with a choice of mates .
Females that had not grown new brain cells did not .

The researchers think the new neurons encode trace memories of dominant males .
The two brain regions in which the growth took place were the olfactory bulb , which processes smell , and the hippocampus , which is involved in memory .
These have been hailed as main sites for neurogenesis across many species , but the two had not been linked to the same stimulus before , says Weiss .

And when free - market advocacy alone has n’t worked , military force and brutal repression are always at hand to cow the public , all in the interest of promoting the privatization of public resources , the shredding of the social safety net and opening up new markets for foreign investors .
There ’s a measure of truth about the dark side of globalization in all this , but that ’s a lot to lay on poor Milton .
Ms. Klein pins the blame for much of the misery in the world squarely on what she views as Friedman ’s misguided philosophy and the many people in its thrall .
And here she includes not only a litany of expected conservatives like Ronald Reagan , Margaret Thatcher and George W. Bush , but what others might think of as conventional liberals , people like Bill Clinton and Jeffrey D. Sachs , the Columbia University economist who advocated economic “ shock therapy ” in post - socialist countries like Bolivia and Poland and now is one of the leading proponents in the effort to increase sharply aid to the world ’s poor .
“ Since the fall of Communism , free markets and free people have been packaged as a single ideology that claims to be humanity ’s best and only defense against repeating a history filled with mass graves , killing fields and torture chambers , ” Ms. Klein writes .
“ Yet in the Southern Cone , the first place where the contemporary religion of unfettered free markets escaped from the basement workshops of the University of Chicago and was applied in the real world , it did not bring democracy ; it was predicated on the overthrow of democracy in country after country .
And it did not bring peace but required the systematic murder of tens of thousands and the torture of between 100,000 and 150,000 people . ”

Friedman ’s association with Gen. Augusto Pinochet , the Chilean dictator , was indeed the worst stain on his career .
His defense that his economic advice to Pinochet was no different from what a doctor might give a government on how to deal with an outbreak of AIDS is not very persuasive .

FOR a company that looked doomed a decade ago , it has been quite a comeback .
Today Apple is literally an iconic company .
Look at your iPod : the company name appears only in the small print .
Some of the power of its brand comes from the extraordinary story of a computer company rescued from near - collapse by its co-founder , Steve Jobs , who returned to Apple in 1997 after years of exile , reinvented it as a consumer - electronics firm and is now taking it into the billion - unit - a - year mobile - phone industry ( see article ) .
But mostly Apple 's zest comes from its reputation for inventiveness .
In polls of the world 's most innovative firms it consistently ranks first .
From its first computer in 1977 to the mouse - driven Macintosh in 1984 , the iPod music - player in 2001 and now the iPhone , which goes on sale in America this month , Apple has prospered by keeping just ahead of the times .
The company , which is shortly to join the S&P 100 index of leading companies , is not without its critics .
The not - always - lovable Mr Jobs is still stuck in a greedy - looking share - option “ backdating ” scandal .
The firm has come under attack for refusing to make its operating - system and music - protection software available to others ( a price worth paying , Apple responds , for greater reliability and consistency ) .
And there are grumbles about manufacturing defects and customer service .
Apple is hardly alone in the high - tech industry when it comes to duff gadgets and unhelpful call centres , but in other respects it is highly unusual .
In particular , it inspires an almost religious fervour among its customers .
That is no doubt helped by the fact that its corporate biography is so closely bound up with the mercurial Mr Jobs , a rare showman in his industry .
Yet for all its flaws and quirks , Apple has at least four important wider lessons to teach other companies .
Not invented here , and very welcome
The first is that innovation can come from without as well as within .
Apple is widely assumed to be an innovator in the tradition of Thomas Edison or Bell Laboratories , locking its engineers away to cook up new ideas and basing products on their moments of inspiration .
In fact , its real skill lies in stitching together its own ideas with technologies from outside and then wrapping the results in elegant software and stylish design .
The idea for the iPod , for example , was originally dreamt up by a consultant whom Apple hired to run the project .
It was assembled by combining off - the - shelf parts with in - house ingredients such as its distinctive , easily used system of controls .
And it was designed to work closely with Apple 's iTunes jukebox software , which was also bought in and then overhauled and improved .
Apple is , in short , an orchestrator and integrator of technologies , unafraid to bring in ideas from outside but always adding its own twists .
This approach , known as “ network innovation ” , is not limited to electronics .
It has also been embraced by companies such as Procter & Gamble , BT and several drugs giants , all of which have realised the power of admitting that not all good ideas start at home .
Making network innovation work involves cultivating contacts with start - ups and academic researchers , constantly scouting for new ideas and ensuring that engineers do not fall prey to “ not invented here ” syndrome , which always values in - house ideas over those from outside .
Second , Apple illustrates the importance of designing new products around the needs of the user , not the demands of the technology .
Too many technology firms think that clever innards are enough to sell their products , resulting in gizmos designed by engineers for engineers .
Apple has consistently combined clever technology with simplicity and ease of use .
The iPod was not the first digital - music player , but it was the first to make transferring and organising music , and buying it online , easy enough for almost anyone to have a go .
Similarly , the iPhone is not the first mobile phone to incorporate a music - player , web browser or e-mail software .
But most existing “ smartphones ” require you to be pretty smart to use them .
Apple is not alone in its pursuit of simplicity .
Philips , a Dutch electronics giant , is trying a similar approach .
Niklas Zennström and Janus Friis , perhaps the most Jobsian of Europe 's geeks , took an existing but fiddly technology , internet telephony , to a mass audience by making it simple , with Skype ; they hope to do the same for internet television .
But too few technology firms see “ ease of use ” as an end in itself .
Stay hungry , stay foolish
Listening to customers is generally a good idea , but it is not the whole story .
For all the talk of “ user- centric innovation ” and allowing feedback from customers to dictate new product designs , a third lesson from Apple is that smart companies should sometimes ignore what the market says it wants today .
The iPod was ridiculed when it was launched in 2001 , but Mr Jobs stuck by his instinct .
Nintendo has done something similar with its popular motion - controlled video - game console , the Wii .
Rather than designing a machine for existing gamers , it gambled that non-gamers represented an untapped market and devised a machine with far broader appeal .
The fourth lesson from Apple is to “ fail wisely ” .
The Macintosh was born from the wreckage of the Lisa , an earlier product that flopped ; the iPhone is a response to the failure of Apple 's original music phone , produced in conjunction with Motorola .
Both times , Apple learned from its mistakes and tried again .
Its recent computers have been based on technology developed at NeXT , a company Mr Jobs set up in the 1980s that appeared to have failed and was then acquired by Apple .
The wider lesson is not to stigmatise failure but to tolerate it and learn from it : Europe 's inability to create a rival to Silicon Valley owes much to its tougher bankruptcy laws .
None of these things , of course , guarantees success : you can buy in clever ideas , pursue simplicity , ignore focus groups and fail wisely — and still go bust .
Apple very nearly did so itself .
No doubt the bumptious Mr Jobs will overreach himself again : the iPhone 's success is not guaranteed .
But for the moment at least it is hard to think of a large company that better epitomises the art of innovation than Apple .
Just another gem I found out there floating around in CyberSpace .
Unprovoked attacks by Los Angeles police .
From the counter - protest called by ANSWERLA.org to protest a Minutemen march in Hollywood on July 8 , 2006 .
Man in white shirt on left walks towards police , is clubbed .
Others are clubbed , person in wheelchair knocked over .
Screams of " he 's mentally retarded . "
Officer on bike deliberately smashes into two people standing there videoing .
Other cops club them , even after they 're on the ground .
After several seconds of them not moving , cop clubs them again and is pushed back by another cop .
ISTANBUL , Oct. 9 — Turkey took a step toward a military operation in Iraq on Tuesday , as its top political and military leaders issued a statement authorizing troops to cross the Iraq border to eliminate separatist Kurdish rebel camps in the northern region .
Turkey moved toward military action in the face of strong opposition by the United States , which is anxious to maintain peace in the region , one of the rare areas of stability in conflict - torn Iraq .
But more than two dozen Turkish soldiers have been killed in recent days , and the government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan seemed far more determined than before to act decisively .
A government official without authorization to speak publicly on the issue who asked not to be identified by name , said preparations were under way to seek parliamentary approval for a cross - border military operation , a request that would be the first formal step toward an offensive .
The Associated Press reported that the request would be submitted to Parliament as early as Wednesday .
Из -за возможных ошибок в методике тестирования приведенные результаты могут быть не корректными .
Потому бяло принято решение провести тестирование заново с измененными параметрами и набором тестов .
Новые результаты тестировани я
Вы можете получить в серии стате й
“ В Поисках Оптимального Решения ” и в статье , описывающей результаты всей серии тестов .
На этой неделе мы начали проект , использующи й Ruby on Rails как основное средство разработки .
Моей первоочередной задачей являлась настройка окружения на одном из наших development - серверов .
Когда я попытался разобраться , как же другие люди запускают и использую т
RoR , я заметил , что в Internet нет информации о настройке rails - приложений в связке с nginx frontend и нет информации о производительности такого решения .
Перед тем , как вслепую выбирать решение для хостинга нового проекта я решил провести небольшое тестирование популярных решений для запуска Rails - приложений .
Результаты этих тестов и конфигурационные файлы , использованные при тестировании , вы можете увидеть в этой статье .
В первую очередь , опишу программную и аппаратную составляющие тестового сервера :
CPU : 4 x XEON CPUs
Memory : 4 Gb of RAM
OS : Debian GNU / Linux Testing с последним ядро м 2.6
Далее в статье будут приведены конфигурации , использованные в тестах и результаты , полученные при помощи apache benchmarking tool ( ab ) .
В конце статьи я приведу сравнительные итоги тестирования в виде диаргаммы .
Все тесты выполнялись при помощи следующей комманды :
$ ab -c 100 -n 10000 http://127.0.0.1:PORT/
где PORT – это специфичный для каждого теста номер порта , на котором слушает веб -сервер .
Первым среди тестов я опишу решение с использованием простого сервера WEBrick ( веб-сервер , написанный полностью на ruby и включенный в состав rails framework ) .
Для его запуска я использовал следующую команду :
$ ./script/ server -- port 8080 -d
Результаты этого теста оказались впечатляющими для меня .
Я ожидал , что Webrick должен быть очень медленным , но он показал далеко не нулевые результаты ;-) .
Web Server : WEBrick /1.3.1
Время , затраченное на тесты : 51.490
Средняя продолжительность запроса : 514.896
Время , затраченное на запрос ( среднее по всем параллельным запросам ) : 5.149
Количество запросов в секунду ( среднее ) : 194,21
Transfer rate ( Kbytes/ sec ) : 1478,88
Как видите , эти результаты могут быть приемлемыми для маленьких проектов или серверов , предназначенных для разработки , но для больших часто посещаемых сайтов нужно что - то побыстрее . 🙂
Следующий тест был проведен для Mongrel :
Mongrel – это быстрая HTTP - библиотека и веб -сервер для Ruby , предназначенные для хостинга веб -приложений на Ruby используя HTTP вместо FastCGI или SCGI .
На данный момент он поддерживает фреймворк и Ruby On Rails , Og + Nitro и Camping .
Самый простой метод начать использовани е Mongrel – это установить его с помощь ю RubyGems и затем запускать с его помощью приложения Ruby on Rails .
Вы можете сделать это просто :
$ sudo gem install mongrel $ cd your_rails_app $ mongrel_rails start -d
Этот набор команд запустит Mongrel в фоне .
Вы можете остановить его :
$ mongrel_rails stop
Вот и все , что необзодимо .
Есть еще несколько опций , которые могут быть установлены у команды start .
Используйте mongrel_rails start -h для просмотра возможных опций и их описания .
Мой тест Mongrel был произведен на одном процессе , запущенном следующим образом :
$ mongrel_rails start -d -- port 8081
Результаты оказались следующими :
Web Server : Mongrel 0.3.13.3 ( single process )
Время , затраченное на тесты : 17.212
Средняя продолжительность запроса : 172.117
Время , затраченное на запрос ( среднее по всем параллельным запросам ) : 1.721
Количество запросов в секунду ( среднее ) : 581,00
Transfer rate ( Kbytes/ sec ) : 4398,28
Как видите , Mongrel действительно значительно быстрее по сравнению с сервером WEBrick , но давайте посмотрим , что могут показать нам другие сервера .
Третий тест был выполнен при помощи простого tcp-балансировщика ( pen ) и 5 рабочих процессов Mongrel .
Pen был установлен из репозитория debian , потому инсталляция прошла просто ( apt - get install pen ) .
Тест проводился при помощи процесса pen , запущенного следующей командой :
$ pen 8082 127.0.0.1:3000 \\ 127.0.0.1:3001 \\ 127.0.0.1:3002 \\ 127.0.0.1:3003 \\ 127.0.0.1:3004
В процессе тестирования я запускал процессы mongrel при помощи самописного скрипта на shell , но позже я наткнулся на mongrel - cluster – GemPlugin , котороый работает с mongrel и сильно упрощает настройку и установку веб -приложений , используя кластер mongrel - серверов .
Если вы захотите повторить тесты или воспользоваться их результатами – используйте его для упрощения процесса настройки .
Как и ожидалось , результаты оказались лучше , чем в первом тесте , но , что странно , хуже , чем в тесте с одним процессом mongrel :
Web Server : Mongrel 0.3.13.3 ( 5 процессов через балансировщик Pen )
Время , затраченное на тесты : 19.864
Средняя продолжительность запроса : 198.642
Время , затраченное на запрос ( среднее по всем параллельным запросам ) : 1.986
Количество запросов в секунду ( среднее ) : 503,42
Transfer rate ( Kbytes/ sec ) : 3810,98
Следующие два теста проводились с использованием двух популярных reverse - proxy серверов : Nginx и Lighttpd с теми же пятью процессами Mongrel .
Первым протестированным сервером был Lighttpd , собранный следующими командами :
# ./configure -- prefix= / opt / lighttpd # make # make install
Следующий конфигурационный файл был использован для запуска lighttpd :
server.modules = ( " mod_access " , " mod_proxy " , " mod_accesslog " ) server.document-root = " /opt/lighttpd/www / " server.errorlog = " /opt/lighttpd/logs/lighttpd.error.log " index-file.names = ( " index.htm " ) server.tag = " lighttpd " accesslog.filename = " /opt/lighttpd/logs/access.log " static- file.exclude-extensions = ( " .php " , " .pl " , " .fcgi " ) server.port = 8083 server.pid-file = " /var/run/lighttpd.pid " proxy .
balance = " fair " proxy. server = ( " / " => ( ( " host " => " 127.0.0.1 " , " port " => 3000 ) , ( " host " => " 127.0.0.1 " , " port " => 3001 ) , ( " host " => " 127.0.0.1 " , " port " => 3002 ) , ( " host " => " 127.0.0.1 " , " port " => 3003 ) , ( " host " => " 127.0.0.1 " , " port " => 3004 ) ) )
Результаты оказались намного лучше , чем у всех предщественников :
Web Server : Lighttpd 1.4.11 ( прокси для 5 процессов Mongrel )
Время , затраченное на тесты : 14.256
Средняя продолжительность запроса : 142.570
Время , затраченное на запрос ( среднее по всем параллельным запросам ) : 1.426
Количество запросов в секунду ( среднее ) : 701,41
Transfer rate ( Kbytes/ sec ) : 5321,53
Из -за странной проблемы авторы mongrel не советуют использовать lighttpd для проксирования , но должен сказать – у меня он заработал нормально .
И последним тестом оказался тест nginx reverse - proxy сервера .
Я решил провести этот тест после всех остальных так как не нашел никакой информации о его производительности и хотел показать , как производится его настройка и проверить его производительность с
Ruby on Rails когда я уже буду знать все результаты …
Итак , я собрал его со стандартными параметрами :
# ./configure -- prefix= / opt/nginx # make # make install
и проверил со следующим конфигурационным файлом :
worker_processes 2 ; error_log logs / error.log notice ; pid logs / nginx.pid ; events { worker_connections 16384 ; } http { include conf / mime.types ; default_type application / octet - stream ; sendfile on ; tcp_nopush on ; keepalive_timeout 65 ; tcp_nodelay on ; upstream mongrel { server 127.0.0.1:3000 ; server 127.0.0.1:3001 ; server 127.0.0.1:3002 ; server 127.0.0.1:3003 ; server 127.0.0.1:3004 ; } server { listen 8084 ; server_name localhost ; access_log off ; location / { proxy_pass http://mongrel ; } } }
Результаты этого теста оказались поистине впечатляющими и я еще раз хочу сказать спасибо Игорю Сысоеву за отличный продукт !
Web Server : nginx / 0.3.60 ( прокси для 5 процессов Mongrel )
Время , затраченное на тесты : 10.449
Средняя продолжительность запроса : 104.495
Время , затраченное на запрос ( среднее по всем параллельным запросам ) : 1.045
Количество запросов в секунду ( среднее ) : 956.99
Transfer rate ( Kbytes/ sec ) : 7267.27
Сравнительные результаты тестировани я
Вы можете увидеть на следующей дианрамме :
Что же , я сделал свой выбор – я буду использовать nginx для проксирования запросов к кластер у
Mongrel - серверов , так как это рещение является очень гибким и обладает прекрасной производительностью . 🙂
Если у
Вас есть какие - либо предложения по расширению тестирования или замечания к результатам представленных тестов , оставляйте комментарии ниже и я постараюсь ответить на все вопросы .
До встречи !
And yet history still does n't know the half of it .
It has long since ceased to be a matter for debate that the Iraq adventure began in mendacity and ended in calamity .
Sir Richard Dearlove 's public penitence this week merely confirmed what he had already said privately , and not only has every single one of the original official reasons for the invasion been falsified , they have all been stood on their heads .
Now even what many suspected was the ulterior motive - a war for oil - has gone awry
Speaking at the LSE on Wednesday , Dearlove said the government had put " too much emphasis on intelligence " as a justification for the war in order to win parliamentary support .
But even before the notorious specious dossiers were compiled - which is what he meant - he had already said with deadly candour in the July 2002 memo , written in greatest secrecy by Dearlove as head of MI6 for the eyes of Blair and his colleagues , that a decision for war had been taken , and that " the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy " .
He might have added that , while there were no " weapons of mass destruction " in Iraq , there was a great deal of noxious weaponry , which went missing at the time of the invasion and has since been put to dreadful effect .
Nor were there any fundamentalist terrorists in Iraq five years ago - Saddam Hussein was a secular tyrant , and had a very short way with Islamic zealots - but today the country is awash with jihadists .
Many of them come from Saudi Arabia , whose monarch we have just greeted in such obsequious fashion so that we can continue corruptly to sell his country arms .
As to the idea , flourished after the event by the dreaded liberal hawks as well as neoconservatives , that an invasion would bring democracy to Iraq , it 's tempting to say that comment is superfluous .
In fact there is still something to be said - and it was said by Jacques Chirac at a meeting with Tony Blair that has been described by Sir Stephen Wall .
While reiterating his opposition to the war that was about to begin , Chirac made a number of specific points .
He reminded Blair that he and his friend Bush knew nothing of the reality of war but that he did : 50 years ago , the young Chirac served as a conscript in the awful French war in Algeria , which Iraq resembles in all too many ways .
Then he said that the Anglo - Saxons seemed to think that they would be welcomed with open arms , but they should n't count on it .
In a very percipient point , Chirac added that a Shia majority should n't be confused with what we understand as democracy .
He ended by asking whether Blair realised that , by invading Iraq , he might yet precipitate a civil war there .
As the British left , Blair turned to his colleagues and said , doubtless with that boyish grin we happily see less of nowadays , " Poor old Jacques , he just does n't get it . "
Well , who got it ?
Even supposing that it had been possible to spread democracy at gunpoint , it 's curious that anyone thought this would actually serve western interests .
Reporting recently from Dubai under the droll headline " US promotes free elections , only to see allies lose " , Hassan Fattah of the New York Times observed drily that " the paradox of American policy in the Middle East - promoting democracy on the assumption it will bring countries closer to the west - is that almost everywhere there are free elections , the American - backed side tends to lose " .
Well , yes .
Then there 's Blair 's apparently sincere belief that he had an obligation to follow Washington 's lead , because " it would be more damaging to long - term world peace and security if the Americans alone defeated Saddam Hussein than if they had international support to do so " , and that by offering such unconditional support he would " keep the United States in the international system " .
Absurd in any case as theory , this too has been drastically confuted by events .
As the hair - raising BBC programme No Plan No Peace has just confirmed beyond doubt , the British government had no influence whatsoever on American policy or conduct .
Geoff Hoon , the defence secretary at the time of the invasion , has comically and humiliatingly contradicted himself as to whether he did or did n't oppose the crazy decisions to disband the Iraqi army - thereby setting loose large numbers of resentful armed fighters - and to dismiss all Ba'ath party members - thereby denuding the country of administrators .
In any case , what is now quite clear is that his views did n't matter one way or the other .
If London meekly agreed with Washington , the Americans went ahead ; if London shyly expressed reservations , the Americans took no notice and still went right ahead .
Finally there is what has sometimes been dismissed as a conspiracy theory : that it was really a war for oil .
This idea looks a little less cranky now that Alan Greenspan , the former head of the Federal Reserve Board , has acknowledged " what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil " .
But here again , there was no need to await his verdict .
After all , the most powerful man in British politics had told us the same thing even before the war began .
" The greatest thing to come out of this for the world economy , " said Rupert Murdoch , " would be $ 20 a barrel for oil . "
And so , on top of the whole list of false predictions and collapsed justifications , we have this final absurdity .
As both Greenspan and Murdoch have very likely noticed , the price of oil hit a record $ 96 a barrel yesterday , and is still going up .
In April 2003 , our previous prime minister confidently pronounced that " just as we had a strategy for war , so we have a strategy for peace " .
It is not pre-empting the judgment of history to say with even greater confidence that no good whatever has come out of this war , that no single good reason for it can any longer be adduced - and that " we " had never had any plan at all , not to say the faintest idea what " we " were doing .

The Top 7 Most Misleading URLs Nov. 8 by Ben Karl
Before the age of highly refined and comprehensive search engines , people had to play the URL guessing game in order to find their favorite sites .
What would begin as a trivial romp through the web would often turn into a terrifying journey into the depths of misrepresented websites .
Why , when I 'm looking for some sweet scat porn , do I get some boring corporate website ?
We sympathize with the weary internet traveler .
That 's why we 're listing the most misrepresented and poorly named websites on the net .
Get ready for the seven most misleading URLs .
7. Sausagefest.com
A sausage fest is one of the most unfavorable situations for your standard heterosexual male .
For that reason I suspect that not many guys would be trying to visit sausagefest.com .
However , it turns out that sausagefest.com is a great destination for anyone .
The site advocates grillin ' up sausages , ( the edible kind ) and partying with friends in the annual Sausage Fest .
But wait , what if Sausage Fest turns out to be a sausage fest ?!
The overall feeling : Confused elation with a hint of disgust .
6. bbw.com
Ask Eddy Murphy about this one .
BBW is a popular abbreviation of the term Big Beautiful Women .
If you show up to bbw.com with a hunger for Bigguns , be prepared to starve .
All expectations are shot upon the realization that you 've entered the official site for Bath and Body Works .
This realization is maybe not so disappointing since Bath and Body Works is a means to some BBW .
The overall feeling : Mild disappointment .
5. dp.com
Let 's think of a few of the possibilities here , DP could stand for several different things .
Donkey punch ?
Double Penetration ?
The fabulous Dorothy Perkins ?
All of which fit the profile of dp.com much more than what dp.com actually stands for - Design Power .
How lame .
A company that provides " design automation solutions [ that ] reduce engineering time and cost with an order of magnitude . " is no match for a site that provides DP on an order of magnitude .
The overall feeling : Extreme disappointment .
4. omg.com
Oh my GOD !
That 's what visitors of omg.com should say .
Expecting to find a consortment of the coolest crap from around the internet , visitors are dissapointed to find an organization that regulates software technology .
It says any organization is welcome to join , but who would want to have their software regulated ?
That sounds like something that happens at doublepenetration.com
The overall feeling : Whatever software regulation feels like .
3. dutchoven.com
Traditionally , a dutch oven refers to the tendency of a person to build up flatulence , under the blankets , and trap his or her significant other under the covers for a fart smelling session .
This is a complicated technique that may require careful guidance , visual examples and a fully functional discussion forum .
Such resources could only be found at dutchoven.com .
Alas , there 's another kind of dutch oven and it does n't cook your wife 's face in fart .
The real dutchoven.com sells baked goods and yarn products .
Overall feeling : Duh , a dutch oven comes from the heart .
You can't learn how to love someone , you just do .
2. directions.com
Sometimes people just need directions .

' 9/11 Truthers ' flip the bird at Bill Maher Jason Rhyne

After being broadly denounced as " crazy people " by HBO 's sharp - tongued Bill Maher , some members of the so - called 9/11 Truth movement -- a group convinced that US government accounts of the Sept. 11 tragedies do not fully explain the events of that day -- decided to give Maher a taste of his own caustic medicine .
In a new video making its rounds on the internet , one band of miffed Los Angeles - based " Truthers " borrows the graphics , theme music and trademark bite of Maher 's popular " New Rules " segment to push back at the comedian 's charges that conspiracy theorists are lunatics .
" Crazy people are defined by acting crazy , " activist Stewart Howe says in the clip , sitting alongside a Maher - esque video window depicting Fox News host Bill O'Reilly in a straight jacket .
" 9/11 Truthers , " he continues , " are defined by a patriotic quest for the truth . "
" I love Bill Maher , but he 's wrong about 9/11 Truth , " Katy Kurtzman , who also appears in the video , told RAW STORY .
" We wanted to give it back to him the way he gives it out , which is ' I 'm smarter than you and I 'm gonna make fun of you about it . ' "
" We had no idea it was going to go as viral as it has , " she said of the project , which is the subject of more than 35,000 hits to date on YouTube and has received widespread postings on websites skeptical of the official 9/11 story .
" It 's a response to Bill Maher , " said Kurtzman , " but it 's also a cheerleading thing for 9/11 Truth . "
In the Sept. 14 episode of his program , Real Time , Maher had been characteristically barbed : " Crazy people who still think the government brought down the Twin Towers in a controlled explosion , " the comedian jabbed , " have to stop pretending that I 'm the one who 's being naive . "
" How big a lunatic do you have to be to watch two giant airliners packed with jet fuel slam into buildings on live TV , igniting a massive inferno that burned for two hours , and then think ' well , if you believe that was the cause , " he continued , adding that people should " stop asking me to raise this ridiculous topic on the show and start asking your doctor if Paxil is right for you . "
But Bruno Bruhwiler , who edited the green screen video response to those charges , says Maher was n't being fair to the greater 9/11 Truth movement .
" Sure you have to take some of it with a grain of salt , " he said of particularly outlandish conspiracy theories that the majority of the group does n't stand by , " but in general , a picture emerges . "
" It was upsetting because he was dissing the 9/11 Truthers , but he was n't having any on his show , " Bruhwiler continued .
" Which is odd , because it 's a debate show . "
So the Truthers invented their own equal time response opportunity .
" New rule : buildings do not collapse into the path of most resistance at anything close to freefall speed , " Kurtzman counters on video , referring to claims by some that only a controlled demolition would allow for such a fast collapse by the Twin Towers .
" Go back to kindergarten and play with blocks until you figure that out , " she tells Maher , aping the host 's finger - wagging delivery .
Kurtzman also raised questions about the collapse of the World Trade Center 's building seven , which fell despite not being struck by a plane .
" Two airplanes can't slam into two buildings and knock down three , " she says , punctuating the point by flipping Maher off .
Stewart Howe , Kurtzman 's co-star in the clip , says in the video that Sept. 11 was part of an orchestrated plan that fulfilled a host of Bush administration goals .
" They wanted to go to war with Afghanistan and Iraq .
They got it .
They wanted to make billions of dollars for their corporate friends .
They got it , " Howe says , adding that widely accepted explanation of the events of 9/11 helped increase executive power and convinced Maher himself to " parrot the official story . "
" Did n't they manage to accomplish all of this ?
Absolutely they did , " he continues , adding that " it does n't look like incompetence to me Bill , it looks to me like ' mission accomplished . "
" Bill Maher is doing what most of the mainstream media is doing .
All they can really do is attack the messenger , " Howe told RAW STORY .
" If they allow it to become a rational debate , they 'll lose every time .
It 's just not debatable . "
Although the video format did n't allow the group to delve into the swirl of 9/11 facts and figures they say supports their case -- they point to an online documentary called " 9/11 Mysteries " and a number of websites as representative of their views -- it did give them a chance to stick up for themselves .
" We thought , let 's just have fun and slam back , " said Howe .
And if Bill Maher ever decides to change his mind about what happened ?
" In the hopeful event that you rise to the occasion and take the red pill as opposed to more Zoloft , " Kurtzman says , " get back to us because we wo n't hold a grudge . "
" That , " she says , " would be crazy . " "

AT&T plans to introduce a nationwide program today that gives owners of small - and medium - size businesses some of the same tools big security companies offer for monitoring employees , customers and operations from remote locations .
Under AT&T ’s Remote Monitor program , a business owner could install adjustable cameras , door sensors and other gadgets at up to five different company locations across the country .
Using a Java - enabled mobile device or a personal computer connected to the Internet , the owner would be able to view any of the images in real time , control room lighting and track equipment temperatures remotely .
All the images are recorded on digital video , which can be viewed for up to 30 days .
“ It is Big Brother , but in this day and age , you need these type of tools ” for theft protection , weeding out false accident claims and other risks , said Beaux Roby , owner of a chain of five Mama ’s Café restaurants and two banquet halls in Texas .
Mr. Roby has been using the system for nine weeks as part of a pilot program .
“ You have fraudulent claims from customers that trip and fall and things like that , ” he said .
Comedy is the first casualty of the Hollywood writers ' strike .
Late - night satire — a source of news for young audiences — was silenced in Day 1 of the walkout Monday .
Felled , at least temporarily : David Letterman , Jay Leno , Jon Stewart , Stephen Colbert and Conan O'Brien , among others .
MORE : If strike continues , more series will be sidelined Saturday Night Live also goes into repeats this weekend , and sitcoms filmed before studio audiences will follow soon .
Shows such as CBS '
Two and a Half Men shut down Monday , stymied as writers refused to participate in the rewrites made during shooting .
The show will run out of completed episodes by month 's end .
A key sticking point is a demand for royalty payments from the re-use of movies and TV shows online .
" We all know how lucky we are to have the jobs we have .
We 're not asking for much , " said SNL's Seth Meyers , picketing Monday in front of NBC 's studios at Rockefeller Center .
" ( But ) you have to change the rules because people are watching TV in a different way . "
Said Daily
Show writer and correspondent John Oliver : " I can't imagine anyone here would like to be here .
We 'd all rather be at work . "
The shutdown will also limit a big part of the Hollywood publicity machine , as actors will lose a primary outlet to hawk their holiday movies .
The last strike , which lasted 22 weeks in 1988 , kept Johnny Carson off the air for 10 weeks and saw Letterman 's routines rest for four months ; each returned with his own ad - libbed material .
The impact on the rest of television will be felt soon .
Look for more repeats , movies , reality series and newsmagazines to fill vacant big - network time slots amid worries that viewers will defect to the Internet or cable , which is less affected by the walkout .
" A lot of people stopped watching in the last strike , and some did n't come back , " says Simpsons executive producer James L. Brooks .
Dramas and other comedies such as The Office continued to film Monday , though Office star Steve Carell did n't show up for work .
But the pace will slow down quickly as the supply of scripts dwindles .
Among other network shifts , NBC plans to yank Friday Night Lights and Las Vegas to conserve episodes .
" We 've stopped any writing work completely , and the whole thing will be shut down by Friday , " said 30 Rock 's Tina Fey .
But ever the optimist , she hoped for a quick settlement : " I have a fantasy that ( California ) Gov. ( Arnold ) Schwarzenegger will swoop into L.A. to settle something somehow . "
Contributing : Peter Johnson in New York and Bill Keveney in Los Angeles Enlarge Getty Images The Late Show with David Letterman , like other late - night talk shows , will go into repeats until the writers ' strike is settled .

I did my own MLSP review and it took me 4 weeks to decide — do n’t leave money on the table and wasted time waiting to decide — just do it !!
My personal experience using MLSP gave me a minimum of 5 leads per day starting at 3 weeks of using the system .
I started generating leads my first week and seriously was in amazement that it all really worked !
Ask yourself this , what would 5 leads per day look like to your business ?
5 new people that you can talk to every day ?
I would venture to say that the landscape of your business and your bank account are going to look very different , very quickly .
This strategy can potentially get your camp ’s name in front of thousands of people with almost no effort on your part !
But I would recommend that you provide the marketing materials for them to pass along .
Nobody can do a better job of promoting your camp than you .
However , those that are new in networking are prone to fall into the common pitfalls that any beginner should be aware of .
This article outlines five common pitfalls of business networking .
For example , I recently bought a pair of cross -country skis .
Shortly after the purchase , I realized I did n’t know exactly whether I was supposed to wax them .
But the retailer anticipated this question and automatically sent me an email that included , among other gems of information , instructions about waxing cross country skis .
It was like they read my mind !
Let me start with this —
Do you have a marketing funnel ?
Do you even know what a marketing funnel is ?
Do you think you have to be a techie to do it ?
Do you think it ’s too overwhelming to put one together ?
Do you have funded proposals to offer your potential prospects ?
Do you even know what a funded proposal is ?
A funded proposal allows to you give something away of high value to the prospect , before you ever solicit them for your business .
A great marketing funnel allows you to focus on generating traffic , letting the system recruit and build a relationship for you !
So , let ’s step back and start from the beginning .
You must establish what you want your visitors to do and then you can develop an effective marketing strategy to get traffic .
First , what do you what your visitors to do ?
Vi .
Are they clearly brought out on your website ?
Is your website ’s appearance attractive ?
Your website should be professionally designed with well - coordinated colors and clear images to attract visitors from whom you get real customers .
The “ active ” your subscribers are , the more money you can expect to make from your list .
Also , when running a sale , you will want to take advantage of the “ broadcast ” function of your autoresponder .
The broadcast function will allow you to email everybody on your list at once .
There are several types of bad code ; there 's lazy code , frantic code , unaware - of - a - better - way code , and aware - of - a - better - way - but - too - apathetic - to - do - it code , to name a few .
Then there 're amalgamations of different types of bad code .
Môshe encountered such an amalgam when his company was trying out a new delivery service .
Môshe spent some time evaluating the IE - only web interface , and was curious about some JavaScript errors he was getting .
Strangely , he noticed variables named dateSQL , newSQLTag , and modeSQL .
Môshe dug a little deeper , probably thinking that his suspicions could n't possibly be correct , only to find sendLinkVal ( ) in the page 's code :
function sendLinkVal ( the Date , the Status , MainTitle , PageTitle ) { var dateSQL = " AND J.JBDeliveryDate= '' " + the Date + " ' ' " var status = " " var newSQLTag = " " var PageTitle = PageTitle var MainTitle = MainTitle //alert ( dateSQL ) switch ( the Status ) { case " Confirmed " : dateSQL= " " var modeSQL = " " modeSQL = " AND ( J.JBCompanyID=31337 ) " status = " GlobalJobStatusView AS J WHERE J.JBCollectDate= '' " + the Date + " '' AND J.JBConfirmed ='' Yes ' ' AND J.MIStatusCode <> 5 " + modeSQL + " AND ( ISNULL ( J.JBCancelled , 0 ) <> 1 ) ORDER BY Convert ( int , J.MIJobID ) " break ; case " Unconfirmed " : dateSQL= " " var modeSQL = " " modeSQL = " AND ( J.JBCompanyID=31337 ) " status = " GlobalJobStatusView AS J WHERE J.JBCollectDate= '' " + the Date + " '' AND J.JBConfirmed ='' No ' ' " + modeSQL + " ORDER BY Convert ( int , J.MIJobID ) " break ; case " Complete " : dateSQL= " " var modeSQL = " " modeSQL = " AND ( J.JBCompanyID=31337 ) " status = " GlobalJobStatusView AS J WHERE J.JBCollectDate= '' " + the Date + " '' AND J.MIStatusCode=5 " + modeSQL + " ORDER BY Convert ( int , J.MIJobID ) " break ; case " Unconformed " : dateSQL= " " var modeSQL = " " modeSQL = " AND ( J.JBCompanyID=31337 ) " status = " GlobalJobStatusView AS J WHERE J.JBCollectDate= '' " + the Date + " '' AND ( J.MIConformance IS NOT NULL AND J.MIConformance <>'' ' ' ) " + modeSQL + " ORDER BY Convert ( int , J.MIJobID ) " break ; case " NoDelDate " : dateSQL= " " var modeSQL = " " modeSQL = " AND ( J.JBCompanyID=31337 ) " dateSQL = " GlobalJobStatusView AS J WHERE J.JBDeliveryDate IS NULL " + modeSQL + " ORDER BY Convert ( int , J.MIJobID ) " break ; case " Collections " : // the dateSQL is not required so set it to nothing so that it // does n't interfere with the sql being generated at the end of // the function .

Môshe could replace his customer ID with any other and access customer data , and for that matter , to modify or delete whatever he wanted .
He could add or remove columns to tables .
He could possibly even change permissions , add his own database user and deny all other users access .
Shocked , Môshe called the delivery service , who got him in touch with the developer of the system .
This developer was equally shocked to learn that it was even possible to view a web page 's JavaScript code , let alone that his architecture was open to SQL injection attacks from virtually any angle .
He took immediate and decisive action ; all queries were moved to the .NET backend .
Of course , the queries still did n't use parameters and are therefore still open to SQL injection , but now it takes slightly more effort to hack .

Sara Weiss was flying home to Long Island after visiting her son in San Diego for the Fourth of July .
On her way out to California , Transportation Security Administration ( tsa ) inspectors at jfk Airport had questioned Weiss about four old , heavily patched ice packs in her carry - on baggage , so she put them into her checked suitcase for the return trip .
She passed through security without incident , but as she was boarding , a ticket agent asked Weiss to step out of line .
Three police officers escorted her to the basement , where checked baggage is inspected .
San Diego tsa and Harbor Police interrogated Weiss for three hours .
The first question they asked was , “ Do you know Osama bin Laden ? ”
They told her that their scanning equipment “ went crazy ” when her suitcase passed through , that her ice packs contained a “ clay - like substance ” similar to “ what terrorists use to implant explosives , ” and that “ the tape all along the edges of the ice packs suggests to us they were tampered with . ”
Their suspicions were heightened after they searched her carry - on bag and found that Weiss ( who works for the nonprofit Long Island Council of Churches and is herself Jewish ) had a report on Muslim Americans .
After a hazmat team determined the ice packs were , in fact , ice packs , Weiss was released .
But for some reason , the whole episode was included in the tsa ‘s weekly Suspicious Incidents Report and then highlighted as the first item in an internal tsa memo issued to security screeners on July 20 and headlined “ Incidents at U.S. Airports May Suggest Possible Pre-Attack Probing . ”
The memo also detailed three other incidents that might “ indicate terrorists are conducting pre-attack security probes and ‘ dry runs ’ similar to dress rehearsals . ”
These other incidents involved the discovery of “ several items at airports resembling improvised explosive device ( ied ) components ” : a carry - on bag in Milwaukee containing “ a wire coil wrapped around a possible initiator , an electrical switch , batteries , three tubes , and two blocks of cheese ” ; a checked bag in Houston containing “ a plastic bag with a 9 - volt battery , wires , a block of brown clay - like minerals , and pipes ” ; and another checked bag in Baltimore containing “ a plastic bag with a block of processed cheese taped to another plastic bag holding a cellular phone charger . ”
At the bottom of each page of the memo , set in boldface type , was the same admonition : “ No portion of this report should be furnished to the media , either in written or verbal form . ”
But just days later , on July 24 , Brian Williams announced on nbc Nightly News that a document — ” obtained tonight ” — cautioned airport officials to be on alert for “ terrorists [ who ] may be staging a kind of dry run , rehearsing for more attacks on commercial airliners . ” cnn ran a similar story on its website less than two hours later , saying that it had “ obtained the advisory from a government source . ”
The Associated Press picked up the story , which ran the next day in newspapers across the country .
The tsa issued a statement calling for calm , but the 24 - hour commentariat would have none of it .
cnn Headline News ‘ Glenn Beck , for example , denounced the tsa ‘s backpedaling as “ bull crap ” and declared the original report “ a new reason for you to be terrified to fly this summer . ”
Yes , despite explicit instructions not to panic , it was clearly time for us to panic .
And the thought of terrorists conducting dry runs to test our airport security is scary — very scary — but remember that at least one of these incidents involved Sara Weiss , a self - described “ 66 - year - old woman with a bad back . ”
On July 25 , a colleague who knew of Weiss ’ brush with security called her at home .
“ Sara , you were on abc tonight , ” she said .
“ You ’re famous . ”
She explained that Charlie Gibson had described an incident at the San Diego airport involving “ a woman in her 60s with ice packs . ”
As Weiss told Mother Jones , “ after we finished talking , I wondered , ‘ How did they find out about that ?
I must be on a watch list . ’
That made me angry because I ’d been exonerated .
So I called abc , told them I was the woman to whom Charlie Gibson had referred . ”
abc quickly dispatched Lisa Stark and a film crew to interview Weiss .
Ten minutes before her story aired on July 26 , Weiss received a call from Stark informing her that Kip Hawley , the head of the tsa , wanted to apologize and to give “ some background information on why it happened . ”
When they spoke — Weiss says , “ I had to sort of coax an apology from him , but yes , he did apologize ” — Hawley said it had been “ a learning experience . ”
But closer scrutiny revealed the rest of the tsa memo was just as thin .
Of the incident at bwi , Corporal Jonathan Green , a spokesman for the Maryland Transportation Authority Police , told the Washington Post that “ the cheese and the charger were not a threat . ”
Houston Police Department spokesman Victor Senties told the Houston Chronicle of the incident there , “ If there had been any threat at the time , we would not have let the passengers board the plane . ”
Finally , tsa officials conceded that none of the incidents in the memo were quite as ominous as they sounded ; that none of the investigations were , in fact , ongoing , as the original report claimed ; and that none of the airports had closed down any terminals , though the memo claimed that “ some ” had .
Less than three days after the initial nbc report , the entire story had been debunked .
Now , nobody wants to be the guy who lets the next Mohammed Atta sail through security , so maybe each of these tsa episodes can be chalked up to overzealousness or even proper zealousness .
But the real question remains unanswered :
Why was a bogus report — based on false alarms as old as 10 months — delivered by “ a government source ” to nbc and cnn for broadcast on the evening of July 24 ?
In answering that question , it is helpful to remember the administration ’s history of conveniently timing the release of sensational terror threats .
Think back to June 2002 :
As fbi whistleblower Coleen Rowley was set to testify before the Senate on pre-9/11 intelligence failures , John Ashcroft suddenly rigged up a satellite feed from Moscow to announce the arrest of Jose Padilla , which had actually occurred a month earlier .
Ashcroft ’s stunt successfully preempted Rowley ’s testimony on many networks .
Even today , it ’s not uncommon for a terror threat to pop up just as the administration faces a political or pr challenge .
( See “ Wag the dhs , ” below . )
Wag the DHS

Summer ’07 dhs head says he has a bad feeling ; cheese bomb threats leaked two weeks later .
Day that Bush dusts off Iraq - 9/11 “ link ” to boost support for surge .
So it ’s worth noting that the very afternoon that the tsa memo was leaked , President Bush had delivered a speech at the Charleston Air Force Base in South Carolina with the hope of ginning up support for the Iraq War .
Chief among his new arguments was that Al Qaeda in Iraq was little more than a front for bin Laden ’s Al Qaeda and , thus , withdrawal of our troops would threaten American security : “ The facts are that Al Qaeda terrorists killed Americans on 9/11 ; they ’re fighting us in Iraq and across the world , and they are plotting to kill Americans here at home again . ”
The White House characterized the speech as a “ surge of facts , ” though congressional Democrats were quick to point out that , in fact , the president had declined to provide details on the basis for his claims .
Senator John Kerry said that Bush was simply “ trying to scare the American people ” into supporting the war .
Within hours , nbc and cnn had the internal tsa memo in hand and were reporting it — without checking any of its claims .
You would think that after being fooled by tales of mobile weapons labs , yellowcake uranium , and aluminum tubes , the media would treat such tales with a bit more skepticism .
This memo never should have passed the sniff test ; why on earth would tsa release cheese bombers it believed to be Al Qaeda and allow them to continue on their merry way ?

The S.H. Ervin Gallery is housed in the National Trust Centre on Observatory Hill at The Rocks .
It offers a diverse range of exhibitions covering different facets of Australian art from historical to contemporary .
The gallery is also renowned for recognising the valuable contribution women have made to Australian art .
It hosts seven exhibitions each year and is an ideal venue for exploring Australia ’s cultural heritage .
Each Sunday at 3:00 pm the SH Ervin Gallery plays host to an array of guest speakers .
Exhibition floor talks are also held every Tuesday at 12:00 pm .
Talks are included with entry .
History :
In 1815 , Governor Lachlan Macquarie selected the site for use as a military hospital .
It served Fort Phillip , a defence centre protecting the colony against insurrection .
The military left the area for Victoria Barracks in Paddington in 1850 .
The National Trust Centre , which houses the gallery , was built on the site in 1856 to provide extra classroom accommodation for Fort Street School , one of the State ’s leading educational institutions at the time .
In 1911 , the school was split into three separate schools – Fort Street Public School , Fort Street Boys ’ High School and Fort Street Girls ’ High School .
Fort Street Public School remained on Observatory Hill , but in different buildings .
Fort Street Boy ’s High School moved to a new site in Petersham and Fort Street Girl ’s High School remained until 1974 when the two high schools were amalgamated and the female students moved to the Petersham site .
In the following years , the National Trust secured a lease for the building from the NSW Department of Public Works and in 1978 , the S.H. Ervin Gallery was opened to the public by NSW Premier , Neville Wran .
Who Was S.H. Ervin ?
Samuel Henry Ervin was born in Queensland in 1881 .
He moved to Sydney when he was just two years old .
He grew up in Mosman and frequently visited Sirius Cove , a nearby artists ’ camp .
When he left school , he headed to Europe to learn about the wool industry .
Upon returning to Sydney , he became a successful woolbroker .
However , his interest in art was still strong .
He bought and sold artworks , antique furniture and porcelain for most of his life and along the way , acquired many great works himself .
These included paintings from Charles Conder , J. J. Hilder , Norman Lindsay , Sydney Long , H. S. Power , Tom Roberts and ( Sir ) Arthur Streeton .
Ervin was greatly concerned with the protection and presentation of Australia ’s art and heritage .
He became a great patron of the arts in the 1960s when legislation was passed offering tax exemptions to those who made cultural gifts to the nation .
One of Ervin ’s contributions was the donation of a large sum of money to restore two buildings on Observatory Hill with the aim of turning them into an art gallery and museum .
When he passed away in 1977 , much of his estate including many works of art was left to the National Trust .
A portrait of Ervin by Reginald Campbell can be found at the S.H. Ervin Gallery .

P2P apps are popular around the globe , even in regions where Internet access speeds are low .
New research from German deep packet inspection gear maker ipoque shows that in places like Eastern Europe , P2P apps can account for an astonishing 95 percent of all nighttime traffic .
The survey also found that one particular peer - to - peer app , Skype , is also single - handedly responsible for 95 percent of all Internet telephony .
Ipoque gathered its data with the permission of ISPs and universities in Europe , the Middle East , and Australia between August and September of this year ( we covered the preliminary numbers back in September ) .
In all , the three petabytes of information collected show that P2P sucks up anywhere between 49 and 83 percent of all Internet traffic during the day , and can spike much higher at night .
But everyone knows that P2P use is high .
One of the study 's most interesting findings did n't concern the volume of traffic , but the fact the 20 percent of it is now encrypted as the " arms race " between P2P users and ISPs , content owners , and law enforcement heats up .
Increased network filtering — such as that being proposed in the US by AT&T and supported by content owners — would no doubt lead to the deployment of far more potent encryption .
Such a move could leave ISPs with a choice of blocking certain P2P protocols altogether , risking the wrath of those who use them legitimately , or abandoning the attempt at filtering out specific files .
P2P use spikes at night in Europe ( Chart courtesy ipoque ) ( Chart courtesy ipoque )
As far as what 's being traded , ipoque used a variety of techniques ( such as looking at file extensions or parts of filenames like " XXX " ) to identify the sort of content being swapped on P2P networks , and it shows some fascinating regional variations .
In Southern Europe , for instance , game downloads account for 25.5 percent of P2P traffic .
Movies make up 38.8 percent , while pornography is a mere 1.8 percent .
In the Middle East , by contrast , games are downloaded far less ( 6.3 percent ) , but movies much more ( 48 percent ) .
Porn also makes up 5 percent of the traffic .
BitTorrent is , not surprisingly , the number one protocol , but eDonkey continues to hold its own .
And the number one tracker in the world ?
The Pirate Bay , of course .
Is it worth the effort to design software well ?
From time to time I have indirect conversations about whether good software design is a worthwhile activity .
I say these conversations are indirect because I do n't think I 've ever come across someone saying that software design is pointless .
Usually it 's expressed in a form like " we really need to move fast to make our target next year so we are reducing < some design activity > " .
In there is a notion that design is something you can trade off for greater speed .
Indeed I 've come across the impression a couple of times that design effort is tolerated to keep the programmers happy even though it reduces speed .
If it were the case that putting effort into design reduced the effectiveness of programming I would be against it .
In fact I think most software developers would be against design if that were the case .
Developers may disagree on what exactly is good design , but they are in favor of whatever brand of good design they favor because they believe it improves productivity .
( And by " design " here I mean either up - front design or agile 's approach , ie planned or evolutionary design . )
Design activities certainly do take up time and effort , but they payoff because they make it easier to evolve the software into the future .
You can save short - term time by neglecting design , but this accumulates TechnicalDebt which will slow your productivity later .
Putting effort into to the design of your software improves the stamina of your project , allowing you to go faster for longer .
One way of visualizing this is the following pseudo - graph .
The pseudo - graph plots delivered functionality ( cumulative ) versus time for two imaginary stereotypical projects : one with good design and one with no design .
The project that does no design expends no effort on design activities , whether they be up front design or agile techniques .
Because there 's no effort spent on these activities this project produces function faster initially .
The problem with no -design , is that by not putting effort into the design , the code base deteriorates and becomes harder to modify , which lowers the productivity , which is the gradient of the line .
Good design keeps its productivity more constant so at some point ( the design payoff line ) it overtakes the cumulative functionality of the no-design project and will continue to do better .
I call this a hypothesis because it is a conjecture , there is no objective proof that this phenomenon actually occurs .
In scientific terms it 's not a very good hypothesis because it 's hard to test .
We CannotMeasureProductivity nor can we measure design quality .
But despite it being only a hypothesis , it 's also an axiom for many people , including myself .
We may not have objective proof that this effect occurs but many of us feel that this explains what we see we see qualitatively in the field .
It 's an axiom for me as it's the assumption that underpins my entire career as a writer about software design .
If design does n't actually improve productivity in some way , most of my writings are worthless .
I 'm sure it sounds strange to many people to treat a hypothesis as an axiom , but it 's a common thing to do .
I look at it that I use my judgment to assess that the hypothesis is true , but can do so without ignoring the objective weakness of the hypothesis .
I 'd love to find a way to to prove it and almost as much to refute it .
The hypothesis has a corollary , which comes from the the design payoff line .
If the functionality for your initial release is below the design payoff line , then it may be worth trading off design quality for speed ; but if it 's above the line then the trade - off is illusory .
When your delivery is above the design payoff line neglecting design always makes you ship later .
In technical debt terms it 's like taking out a loan but not using the principal for so long that by the time you use it you 've paid out more in interest payments .
This raises the question of where that line is .
Even with people who accept the design stamina hypothesis there is substantial , and important , differences over where the payoff line sits .
I take the view that it 's much lower than most people think : usually weeks not months .
But again this can only be a judgment call .
This leads to a consequence for TechnicalDebt .
Technical Debt is a fantastic analogy and I use it frequently .
But the design payoff line reminds us that taking out a Technical Debt is only worth doing up to a certain point .
Not just do we have to consider whether delivered value is greater than the interest payments , we also have to judge whether the delivery is above the payoff line in the first place .
If The Nazis Could Make It Work , Why Not Us ?
This is an unusual rhetorical gambit from Alan Dershowitz :
Marginal Democratic candidates certainly benefit from moving to the left on national security issues , but serious candidates -- candidates who want to have any realistic chance of prevailing in the general election -- must not allow themselves to be pushed , shoved or even nudged away from a strong commitment to national security .
Consider , for example , the contentious and emotionally laden issue of the use of torture in securing preventive intelligence information about imminent acts of terrorism ...
There are some who claim that torture is a nonissue because it never works -- it only produces false information .
This is simply not true , as evidenced by the many decent members of the French Resistance who , under Nazi torture , disclosed the locations of their closest friends and relatives .
You know , I was on the fence there about torture , until Dershowitz pointed out it really worked well for the Nazis !
Color me convinced !

The Slow Movement : Making a Connection
The Slow Movement aims to address the issue of ' time poverty ' through making connections .
If we think about the following trends .
Buddhism is the fastest growing religion in the world today .
People are turning to organic food in droves .
Schools are in turmoil .
How slow can you go ?
Home schooling is becoming commonplace .
People are downshifting .
The Slow Food movement is gaining popularity with 811 convivia worldwide .
Stress is leading to unprecedented health problems .
“ Stop the world I want to get off ” is a feeling we all have sometimes .
Why is this happening ?
What is wrong ?
What are we searching for ?
The one thing that is common to all these trends is connection .
We are searching for connection .
We want connection to people - ourselves , our family , ourcommunity , our friends , - to food , to place ( where we live ) , and to life .
We want connection to all that it means to live  we want to live a connected life .
This desire for connectedness is not new .
Traditionally , in times past , our lives were connected .
Most traditional cultures still have these connections .
Cultures with connection
These people are connected to their culture , to people , to place and to their lives .
It is not so long ago that the extended family was a real live entity with the extended family often living under the same roof .
Children grew up knowing their cousins , aunts and uncles , grandparents , and other relatives .
These children felt connected .
In these not too long ago times people were connected to their food .
Most people grew their own vegies and some fruit .
Backyard vegie gardens were the norm not the exception .
Many families had a house cow for milk , cheese , butter and cream .
Most families also had poultry or other meat animals .
When visitors came unexpectedly , dad would be sent out back to kill the chook for dinner .
Families used fresh produce and meat to make traditional recipes .
Everyone was involved in cooking and mealtimes were a social event .
When the meal ended most of the family was involved in cleaning up and washing up .
How different is the situation today ?
Our fast paced life has weakened these connections .
Technological advances have meant that the work we do is different from work in the past and it is less connected to living and life than it has been in the past .
Technological advances have resulted in labour saving devices for the home .
Who would complain about vacuum cleaners , electric stoves , hot water systems , flush toilet , or the bread maker , but have these technologies really given us more time to enjoy life as was their claim ?
Or have we used this time to become even more busy .
We are engaged in constant fast - forward motion whereby we are often overscheduled , stressed and rushing towards the next task .
This rushing is not restricted to our work environment .
We rush our food , our family time and even our recreation .
This website supports a growing cultural shift towards slowing down .
On this site we discuss how we have lost connection to most aspects of our life and to the natural world and rhythms around us , and how we can reconnect  how we can live a connected life .
The Slow Movement is a worldwide movement to recapture
Meaningful Connection this state of connectedness .
The movement is gaining momentum , as more and more people recognise their discomfort at the fast pace and disconnected nature of their lives .
Recognising the disconnection and pace of our life as an unwanted state of affairs is an important first step in re-establishing the connections and slowing the pace .
What we all want to know is how do we reconnect ?
How do we live slow , whilst at the same time meeting our most important responsibilities ?
This website tells us how .
It is gives examples of ways to live slow and be part of the slow movement .
It points out the areas of our life that have become disconnected .
We are often unaware of just what it is that is n’t ‘ right ’ , we just know that something is ‘ not right ’ .
Time to rethink priorities
This website tells you where the disconnections lies and , more importantly , it shows you how you can reconnect .
It provides you with tangible , easy - to - do steps to becoming a practicing slow mover , and member of the Slow Movement .
You will find the sanity you so desperately crave .
Some of the things I talk about are easy to do  some are not so easy .
Perhaps the hardest thing to do is to change our attitude and mindset .
We have to rethink our priorities and rethink the way we approach life and all thing in it .
Some of us may take the step of downshifting .
Downshifting is a fast growing movement of people who choose voluntary simplicity in all aspects of their life .
Downshifters go beyond materialism  beyond the fast life .
They downshift to a slow connected life .

In January 1997 , while working as a Systems Administrator for the University of Wales , Aberystwyth , I came up with the idea of doing a spoof of the monologue from the start of the film Trainspotting , with the words changed to have a BOFHish theme .
Knowing this , Bethany , my then grillfiend , bought me a copy of the Trainspotting poster , and so on 28th January 1997 , Adminspotting was born .

In the world of the " A - List " or " Clique " girl , inverting Austen ( and Alcott ) , the rich are right and good simply by virtue of their wealth .
Seventh graders have Palm Pilots , red Coach clutches , Visas and cellphones in Prada messenger bags .
Success and failure are entirely signaled by material possessions -- specifically , by brands .
You know the new girl in the " Clique " novel " Best Friends for Never " is living in social limbo when she shops at J. Crew and wears Keds , and her mother drives a dreaded Taurus rather than a Lexus .
In " Back in Black " the group of " A - List " teenagers spends a weekend at " the Palms Hotel and Casino " ; brands are so prominent you wonder if there are product placement deals : " Vanity Fair always prepared giveaway baskets .
. . .
Last year 's had contained a Dell portable jukebox , a bottle of Angel perfume by Thierry Mugler and a PalmOne Treo 600 Smartphone . "
( The copyright page of the latest " Gossip Girl " book lists credits for the clothing featured on the cover : " gold sequined top -- Iris Singer , peach dress -- Bibelot@Susan Greenstadt , " and so on . )
In these novels , the world of wealthy parents is characteristically seen as corrupt and opportunistic -- but the kids have no problem with that .
In the " A - List " novels , power is all about favors : " Orlando Bloom was next door with Jude Law , and Sam knew him from a dinner party her father had hosted to raise money for the Kerry campaign . "
As Anna challenges a young would - be writer , Scott , " Do you think you only got published in The Times because your mother called in a favor ? "
The mockery the books direct toward their subjects is not the subversion of adult convention traditionally found in young adult novels .
Instead they scorn anyone who is pathetic enough not to fit in .
In the " Clique " novels , the " pretty committee , " dominated by the lead bitch - goddess , Massie , is made up of the cool kids of their elite girls school .
They terrorize the " losers " below them in the social hierarchy : it 's like " Lord of the Flies " set in the local mall , without the moral revulsion .
The girls move through the school in what has become , in movies like " Mean Girls " and " Clueless , " a set piece for nasty cool - girl drama : they are " striking and confident in their matching costumes . . . like a gang of sexy fembots on a mission to take over suburbia . "
In the classic tradition of young adult fiction , Massie would be the villain , and Claire , the newcomer who first appears as an L.B.R. , or " Loser Beyond Repair , " would be the heroine : she is the one girl with spunk , curiosity and age - appropriate preoccupations .
Claire and her family live in the guesthouse of the wealthy Block family ; Claire 's mother is friends with Massie 's mother , but her father seems to be employed by Massie 's father in an uneasily dependent relationship .
In Jane Austen or Charlotte Brontë , that economic dependency on the " great house " would signal that the heroine stands in opposition to the values of that mansion .
Yet Claire 's whole journey , in class terms , is to gravitate into the mansion .
She abandons her world of innocence and integrity -- in which children respect parents , are honest and like candy -- to embrace her eventual success as one of the school 's elite , lying to and manipulating parents , having contempt for teachers and humiliating social rivals .
Over the course of the series , Claire learns to value her own poorer but closer - knit family less than she did before .
Indeed , she pushes her father into greater economic dependence on the rich patrons , absorbing Massie 's shopping tastes and learning to disdain her mother 's clothing .
Veronica and Betty morph into mistresses of the universe , wearing underwear to school with the words " kiss it " on the rear .
Since women have been writing for and about girls , the core of the tradition has been the opposition between the rebel and the popular , often wealthy antiheroine .
Sara Crewe in Frances Hodgson Burnett's " Little Princess " loses her social standing and is tormented by the school 's alpha girls , but by the end of the story we see them brought low .
In " Little Women , " Jo March 's criticism of " ladylike " social norms is challenged by an invitation to a ball ; while Meg , the eldest girl , is taken in by the wealthy daughters of the house and given a makeover -- which is meant to reveal not her victory as a character but her weakness .
This tradition carried on powerfully through the 20th century .
Even modern remakes , like " Clueless , " show the popular , superficial girl undergoing a humbling and an awakening , as she begins to question her allegiance to conformity and status .
As Republican presidential contenders brace for Wednesday 's CNN - YouTube debate , the executive in charge of the event is unapologetic about his decision to put mainstream journalists in charge of deciding which user - contributed YouTube videos the candidates will actually face on the air .
For all the talk about online voter empowerment , the web is still too immature a medium to set an agenda for a national debate , says CNN senior vice president David Bohrman .
" If you would have taken the most - viewed questions last time , the top question would have been whether Arnold Schwarzenegger was a cyborg sent to save the planet Earth , " says Bohrman , the debate 's executive producer .
" The second - most - viewed video question was : Will you a convene a national meeting on UFOs ? "
Thus , instead of using an online voting system to select video questions , CNN 's journalists are plowing through the contributions this week .
CNN will air the final 40 - or - so selected questions Wednesday ( 8 p.m. EST ) when the Republican presidential candidates take the podium in St. Petersburg , Florida – submitting to a debate format Democratic presidential candidates went through in July .
CNN 's YouTube - enabled presidential debate is one of several mainstream media experiments in voter - candidate interaction that have emerged this election cycle – and faced mixed reviews .
The Huffington Post teamed up with Yahoo and online political newsmagazine Slate in September to allow netizens to pick preselected questions for the candidates , which were then posed by PBS talk show host Charlie Rose .
Videos of the recorded interviews were posted on the web .
But the interactive element was little more than an on - demand cable - television - like offering , and not a true two - way conversation between voters and candidates .
In a more successful stab at voter participation , MTV and MySpace teamed up to modernize the traditional town - hall format by enabling the online community to submit questions by instant messenger and to vote in real time on the candidates ' performance .
Though the process has suffered from technical glitches , the effort won praise as an effective way to broaden the scale of interaction between the candidates and the public .
So far , Democrats John Edwards and Barack Obama have participated .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain is next on Dec. 3 .
With its
YouTube collaboration , CNN is one of the first television networks to attempt to meld the televised presidential - debate format with an online social networking tool .
But the news network has received a steady barrage of criticism for keeping a tight grip on the decision to select or reject particular video questions for the event .
An author at The Huffington Post blasted CNN on Monday for its decision to weed out questions for Republican candidates that the producers suspected were submitted by Democrats .
" The notion that the CNN - YouTube debate represents a grass - roots triumph of the internet age is laughable , " wrote Marty Kaplan , a research professor at the University of California 's Annenberg School for Communication .
" The 4,000 + videos are pawns ; the questioners are involuntary shills , deployed by the network producers in no less deliberate , calculating and manipulative a fashion as the words and stories fed by teleprompters into anchors ' mouths . "
But Bohrman , a 53 - year - old technology geek and network TV news veteran , says allowing internet users to vote on which videos to air would reduce , not enhance , the quality of the debate – a lesson he says he learned during a brief stint at the doomed online media company Pseudo.com .
" Guess what , there are troublemakers , " says Bohrman .
" When I was at Pseudo , and we ran live video chats , we had ( people typing ) ' Fuck You ' in 98 - point - type , which appeared on the screen . "
He 's also concerned that the questioning could be manipulated .
" It 's really easy for the campaigns to game the system , " he says .
" You 've seen how effective the Ron Paul campaign ( supporters ) have been on the web – you do n't know if there are 40 or four million of them .
It would be easy for a really organized campaign to stack the deck . "
Community - chosen videos would also rob the debate of spontaneity , because the candidates would know well in advance what question they will be asked .
But in the end , Bohrman just does n't trust people on the internet to pick the interesting questions .
A recently launched project by TechPresident called 10 Questions allows users to vote up or down on video questions that will then be sent to the presidential campaigns , but he 's not impressed with the results .
" You look at 10 Questions , and some of the questions are interesting , " Bohrman says .
" But some of them are completely irrelevant and not interesting , and then it 's just another artificial Kabuki dance . "
Micah Sifry , co-founder of TechPresident , which is running the project , says that Bohrman is oversimplifying .
" There are all kinds of creative ways to invite community input that would still allow for editorial judgment , too , " Sifry says .
" For example , CNN could use the 10 Questions model – we'd be happy to collaborate with them – to involve the community in parsing questions and then promise to use half the questions picked by the community , with the other half picked by his political team . "
For his part , Bohrman sees the journalist 's role in the election process as a facilitator .
The goal at this stage of the process is to help voters on either side of the aisle try to distinguish key differences among their parties ' candidates before they vote in the primaries , he says .
" We want a really Republican debate that underscores the differences among the candidates , " he says .
Excuse No. 2 : It ’s the cheeseburgers .
Americans do n’t have a bad health system , say the apologists , they just have bad habits .
Overeating and teenage sex , not the huge overhead of America ’s private health insurance companies — the United States spends almost six times as much on health care administration as other advanced countries — are the source of our problems .
There ’s a grain of truth to this claim :
Bad habits may partially explain America ’s low life expectancy .
But the big question is n’t why we have lower life expectancy than Britain , Canada or France , it ’s why we spend far more on health care without getting better results .
And lifestyle is n’t the explanation : the most definitive estimates , such as those of the McKinsey Global Institute , say that diseases that are associated with obesity and other lifestyle - related problems play , at most , a minor role in high U.S. health care costs .
Excuse No. 3 : 2007 is better than 1950 .
This is an argument that baffles me , but you hear it all the time .
When you point out that America spends far more on health care than other countries , but gets worse results , the apologists reply : “ Sure , we spend a lot of money on health care , but medical care is a lot better than it was in 1950 , so it ’s money well spent . ”
Huh ?
It ’s as if you went to a store to buy a DVD player , and the salesman told you not to worry about the fact that his prices are twice those of his competitors — after all , the machines on offer at his store are a lot better than they were five years ago .
It is , in other words , an argument that makes no sense at all , yet respectable economists make it with a straight face .
Excuse No. 4 : Socialized medicine !
Socialized medicine !
Rudy Giuliani ’s fake numbers on prostate cancer — which , by the way , he still refuses to admit were wrong — were the latest entry in a long , dishonorable tradition of peddling scare stories about the evils of “ government run ” health care .
The reality is that the best foreign health care systems , especially those of France and Germany , do as well or better than the U.S. system on every dimension , while costing far less money .
But the best way to counter scare talk about socialized medicine , aside from swatting down falsehoods — would journalists please stop saying that Rudy ’s claims , which are just wrong , are “ in dispute ” ? — may be to point out that every American 65 and older is covered by a government health insurance program called Medicare .
And Americans like that program very much , thank you .
So , now you know how to answer the false claims you ’ll hear about health care .
And believe me , you ’re going to hear them again , and again , and again .
Jane Goodall poses for photographers in a file photo .
The primate scientist said on Wednesday the race to grow crops for vehicle fuels is damaging rain forests in Asia , Africa and South America and adding to the emissions blamed for global warming .
REUTERS / Leonhard Foeger
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Primate scientist Jane Goodall said on Wednesday the race to grow crops for vehicle fuels is damaging rain forests in Asia , Africa and South America and adding to the emissions blamed for global warming .
“ We ’re cutting down forests now to grow sugarcane and palm oil for biofuels and our forests are being hacked into by so many interests that it makes them more and more important to save now , ” Goodall said on the sidelines of the Clinton Global Initiative , former U.S. President Bill Clinton ’s annual philanthropic meeting .
As new oil supplies become harder to find , many countries such as Brazil and Indonesia are racing to grow domestic sources of vehicle fuels , such as ethanol from sugarcane and biodiesel from palm nuts .
The United Nations ’ climate program considers the fuels to be low in carbon because growing the crops takes in heat - trapping gas carbon dioxide .
But critics say demand for the fuels has led companies to cut down and burn forests in order to grow the crops , adding to heat - trapping emissions and leading to erosion and stress on ecosystems .
“ Biofuel is n’t the answer to everything ; it depends where it comes from , ” she said .
“ All of this means better education on where fuels are coming from are needed . ”
Goodall said the problem is especially bad in the Indonesian rain forest where large amounts of palm nut oil is being made .
Growers in Uganda -- where her nonprofit group works to conserve Great Apes -- are also looking to buy large parcels of rain forest and cut them down to grow sugar cane , while in Brazil , forest is cleared to grow sugar cane .
The Goodall Institute is working with a recently formed group of eight rain forest nations called the Forest Eight , or F8 , led by Indonesia .
The group wants to create a system where rich countries would pay them not to chop down rain forests and hopes to unveil the plan at climate talks in Bali in December .
Scientists from the forested countries are trying to nail down exactly how much carbon dioxide the ecosystems store , but the amount has been estimated to be about double that which is already in the atmosphere , Goodall said .

After years of looking the other way , Congress seems finally poised to rein in the predatory practices that have become all too common in the credit card business .
Several bills now pending would outlaw unfair billing practices , like the one known as universal default , under which a late payment on an unrelated bill  a utility bill , for example  allows credit card companies to raise their interest rates through the roof .
Other legislation would place limits on the way companies market to college students .
All too often , these companies sometimes deluge students with cards , even when they have no verifiable income , luring them and sometimes their families into debt .
Under pending bills , the companies would be forced to consider a student ’s ability to pay and could extend no more than a single card to a student with no income .
In cases where parents are jointly liable , the spending limit could be raised only with parental approval .
These common sense measures are a good start .
The politically powerful credit card industry wo n’t sit idly by , however , and these reforms are much more likely to succeed if they are wrapped into a comprehensive bill  with more vocal support from the leadership .
Congress also needs to take a close look at the school - themed credit cards that are often offered by privately run college alumni associations .
The associations earn royalties and sometimes share a portion of the money with the colleges , which are then required to promote the cards on campus .
These deals resemble the unsavory arrangements under which student loan companies paid kickbacks to colleges in exchange for being placed on so - called “ preferred lender ” lists .
The most prudent approach for colleges and alumni groups would be to promote these cards only to graduates who have jobs and bank accounts .
If the colleges persist on marketing to students , Congress should bar the practice .
The United States is now well into the fifth year of a war in Iraq that has , at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars , managed to get more Americans killed than 9/11 while alienating global opinion , undermining our strategic posture around the world , arguably speeding nuclear proliferation in North Korea and Iran and detracting from American efforts against Al Qaeda .
The nation ’s elites , ever vigilant , have located the source of the problem : Public outrage over the sorry situation .
Washington
Post foreign affairs columnist David Ignatius , for instance , wrote on Sunday that “ a good start ” in finding an exit from Iraq “ would be for Washington partisans to take deep breaths and lower the volume . ”
That same day , Anne - Marie Slaughter , dean of Princeton ’s prestigious Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs , argued in the Post that , in the foreign policy realm , “ the fiercest battle is no longer between the left and the right but between partisanship and bipartisanship . ”
The former , with its hard - right hawks and strident antiwar types , is bad , of course .
Given that the initial authority to use military force in Iraq was a completely bipartisan affair , with backing from the then - leaders of the House and Senate Democratic caucuses , plus the two men who would eventually make up the party ’s 2004 presidential ticket , and also the woman who ’s currently the front - runner for the 2008 nomination , one might wonder when , exactly , this partisan tussle was so fierce .
To Slaughter , though , criticizing people for collaborating in policy fiascoes is part of the problem , not the solution .
“ In the blogosphere , ” she complained , “ pillorying Hillary Clinton is a full - time sport . ”
What ’s more , " [ Barack ]
Obama has come in for his share of abuse as well . ”
It ’s true .
I , for example , write a blog where I have criticized Clinton frequently and Obama on occasion , just as Slaughter warns .
But what of it ?
There ’s a presidential campaign underway , and they ’re both running .
What better time is there to pillory someone than when they say something you think is wrong ?
The urge to urge calm is hardly limited to the Washington Post .
Monday saw a perfect storm of anti-partisan elites , as Michael O’Hanlon and Kenneth Pollack , both scholars at the liberalish Brookings Institution , complained in the New York Times that “ the political debate in Washington is surreal ” and that “ the administration ’s critics ” -- who , unlike Pollack and O’Hanlon , have not had the privilege of recently taking a guided tour of Iraq organized by the very officials conducting the policy the two scholars are defending -- “ seem unaware of the significant changes taking place ” there .
O’Hanlon and Pollack are both Democrats , so their endorsement of current policy and “ sustaining the effort ” in Iraq indefinitely are examples of the sort of razor - sharp thinking we can expect from Washington if we all just stop and submit ourselves to soothing bipartisanship .
Of course , those of us who read Pollack ’s celebrated 2002 book , “ The Threatening Storm : The Case for Invading Iraq , ” and became convinced as a result that the United States needed to , well , invade Iraq in order to dismantle Saddam Hussein ’s advanced nuclear weapons program ( the one he did n’t actually have ) might feel a little too bitter to once again defer to our betters .
Meanwhile , the very elites we ’re supposed to trust can’t seem to get their stories straight .
Ignatius says everyone ’s looking for the exits in Iraq , and we should just calm down .
O’Hanlon and Pollack want us to stay put .
And as TPM Media ’s Greg Sargent pointed out Monday , the optimism of O’Hanlon and Pollack is at odds with the conclusions of Brookings ’ own Iraq Index project .
It reported July 23 that “ violence nationwide has failed to improve measurably over the past two - plus months , ” and that -- contrary to their enthusiasm about the provision of electricity and other essentials -- “ the average person in Baghdad can count on only one or two hours of electricity per day , ” far less than they had under Hussein .
More ironically still , the person in charge of the Iraq Index is none other than Michael O’Hanlon !
Citizens who have come to fear letting the powers - that - be sort things out from above have some sound basis for their anxiety -- the bipartisan elite turns out to have a fairly awful track record on Iraq .
Indeed , one might begin to suspect that the real agenda here is to try to stifle political debate lest it risk displacing current elites from their cozy positions in favor of some new experts who ’ve shown better judgment .
That , though , would be shrill and partisan .
Better to not complain and just assume it ’ll all turn out for the best .

Introduction
Certain Internet service providers have begun to interfere with their users ' communications by injecting forged or spoofed packets - data that appears to come from the other end but was actually generated by an Internet service provider ( ISP ) in the middle .
This spoofing is one means ( although not the only means ) of blocking , jamming , or degrading users ' ability to use particular applications , services , or protocols .
One important means of holding ISPs accountable for this interference is the ability of some subscribers to detect and document it reliably .
We have to learn what ISPs are doing before we can try to do something about it .
Internet users can often detect interference by comparing data sent at one end with data received at the other end of a connection .
Techniques like these were used by EFF and the Associated Press to produce clear evidence that Comcast was deliberately interfering with file sharing applications ; they have also been used to document censorship by the Great Firewall of China .
1
In each of these cases , an intermediary was caught injecting TCP reset packets that caused a communication to hang up - even though the communicating parties actually wanted to continue talking to one another .
In this document , we describe how to use a network analyzer like Wireshark to run an experiment with a friend and detect behavior like this .
Please note that these instructions are intended for use by technically experienced individuals who are generally familiar with Internet concepts and are comfortable installing software , examining and modifying their computers ' administrative settings , and running programs on a command line .
Requirements
Making use of these techniques requires some general understanding of Internet technology and some technical expertise .
If you do n't understand the process , you may not produce meaningful evidence about what your ISP is doing .
Although we have attempted to explain most of the network concepts and principles involved , it may prove helpful to have read at least one technical book or web site about the TCP / IP protocol suite before beginning .
The test described here must be performed in conjunction with a friend who is using a different Internet connection ( and therefore is probably in a different location ) .
Both you and your friend must have a good understanding of the process described here ; this test relies on comparing observations made at two different locations in order to find differences between them , so it would not be meaningful if performed by one party alone .
Therefore , these instructions are primarily useful for testing peer - to - peer applications or applications for which you can run your own server .
It is therefore difficult to confirm if an ISP is blocking a third - party service like Google unless the operator of that service is interested in participating directly in the tests .
2
The tests described here are most relevant as a means of debugging a specific observed and reproducible problem ( for example , an inability to connect to another party ) rather than as a speculative means of investigating ISP behavior .
This is primarily because of the limitations of tools to automate the process of comparing packet traces from two ends of a connection .
Traditionally , this comparison had to be performed by hand , which can be a quite laborious process if one is n't looking for anything in particular .
EFF has begun to develop tools to automate this process so that large packet traces can be compared automatically and packet injection can be detected even when it is not specifically suspected .
Each party participating in the experiment must have all of the following :
a computer capable of running Wireshark , with appropriate privileges to install and run it ;
the ability to connect this computer directly to the Internet , with a public IP address , outside of any firewalls ( for example , not via a typical home wireless router ) ;
the ability to determine the computer 's public IP address ;
the ability to disable any firewall software running on the computer itself ;
some application to test , and the ability to configure that application to communicate directly with the other party ( by IP address ) .
A note on privacy
Using a packet sniffer can capture all of the traffic passing by your computer ( including all of your communications , and potentially communications of other users on the same network ) ; if your computer is connected to a wireless network , for example , the packet sniffer may record everything you do and everything everyone else on the wireless network does on - line .
Please do not record other people 's communications without their consent .
Doing so is impolite and , under some circumstances , may be prohibited by law .
One way to avoid recording third parties ' communications is to avoid using promiscuous mode for your packet capture , unless you specifically need it .
If you produce a capture file ( packet trace ) with evidence of the results of your experiment , please be aware that the capture file will reveal your IP address , the IP address of the other person involved , and a complete record of everything you did on - line during the course of the experiment .
For example , if you downloaded a file , the packet trace will typically reveal which file ( and even include the full contents of that file ) .
If you browsed the web or checked your e-mail while the packet sniffer was running , the identities and contents of web pages you visited and e-mail messages you downloaded may appear in the packet trace .
In addition , any HTTP cookies sent by your browser ( which might include your username and password for web sites you visited ! ) will be included in the trace .
You should exercise caution when publishing or sharing a packet capture file to ensure that you do n't reveal more information than you intended .
Theory
The traditional Internet architecture is characterized by an end - to - end design in which ISPs passively forward unmodified packets from one user to another .
This means that , in the best case , every packet sent by one user should be received as an identical packet at the other end .
There are several reasons that this ideal might not be attained even in the absence of packet injection by ISPs :
Fragmentation .
The Internet Protocol standard permits ISPs to fragment packets that are too large ( for example , because a particular network technology used by an ISP has a maximum packet size ) .
The packets are then broken up into smaller fragments which arrive separately at the destination ; the destination computer is responsible for reassembling the fragments .
Fragmentation has become somewhat less common in practice for reasons that may include conservative packet size defaults in operating system network code and mechanisms like path MTU discovery ( to automatically select a packet size that is small enough to avoid fragmentation ) .
In test results we 've seen so far , fragmentation generally did not occur , and we will ignore this possibility here , although it should be considered as a possible cause of any observed discrepancies between packets sent and received .
Packet loss .
Under conditions of network congestion , it is normal for some packets to be discarded rather than forwarded , a phenomenon called packet loss .
Packet loss is normally measured as a percentage ; the ping utility measures packet loss with ICMP echo request packets , counting how many ICMP echo replies are received in response to a certain number of probes .
High rates of packet loss could be caused intentionally by an ISP as a means of reducing the performance of a targeted application or protocol , but they can also occur as a result of congestion on the network or other technical problems .
When a packet is lost ( also called a " dropped packet " , " dropped frame " , or " dropped segment " ) , it is not received by the destination at all .
Some higher - level Internet protocols include mechanisms for coping with packet loss , such as TCP 's mechanism for explicitly retransmitting data from packets that are lost .
Reordering .
Sometimes packets are not delivered in the same order in which they were originally transmitted .
If packet B was transmitted after packet A , receiving packet B at the other end does not mean that packet A has been dropped ; it might still be on its way .
TCP can also generally correct for reordering .
Like packet loss , reordering could be used intentionally by an ISP to degrade an application , but also occurs normally in the course of Internet routing .
Spoofing .
Spoofing or packet injection occurs when an entity other than one of the endpoints generates traffic using the source address of an endpoint .
Spoofing is the most straightforwardly detectable means of interference with Internet traffic because it produces concrete evidence in the form of the anomalous spoofed packets , and because it does not occur normally in traditional Internet routing .
Spoofing can be detected by looking for packets that were received by one end but never sent by the other end .
If user B receives a packet apparently from user A that user A has no record of having sent , user B can conclude that someone in between the two has spoofed this packet .
The remainder of this article describes the means of collecting packet traces to allow the packets actually transmitted between two users to be compared in this way .
Spoofing need not involve preventing or blocking communications ; it could also involve changing their content , as with a transparent proxy .
3 Some ISPs have been experimenting with modifying HTML in third - party web pages on the fly in order to inject advertising .
Here is a recent real - world example :
In this image supplied by Chris Palmer , a wireless ISP has modified the source code of Google 's home page to add its own advertising , presumably by spoofing packets with a transparent HTTP proxy .
Although similar behavior often results from adware , in this instance Palmer verified that the ISP was at fault by installing a fresh instance of Windows inside a virtual machine .
4
Setup
Step 1 . Install Wireshark
Download a copy of Wireshark for your platform from the Wireshark home page at http://www.wireshark.org/.
( Wireshark is also prepackaged for most Unix - like operating systems and may be available from your distributor 's package repository .
In older operating system releases , it may still be packaged under its former name , Ethereal . )
Install Wireshark and make sure that you can run the program .
5
Step 2 . Connect directly to the Internet
In order to obtain the most valid and conclusive results , we strongly recommend that your computer be directly connected to the Internet , with a globally - valid public IP address , without any firewalls or network address translation ( NAT ) routers .
Performing these tests from behind NAT could produce valid results but creates some uncertainty about whether unexpected network behavior is due to an ISP or a local NAT router .
A public IP address is one that another party can use directly to communicate with you without the need to configure a tunnel or firewall rule or use a proxy to connect .
6
If you are using an institutional network connection , such as at a school or business , that has a firewall that you are not permitted to disable , you may still be able to perform these tests , but any packet spoofing you detect may be a result of your institution 's firewall rather than its upstream ISP connection .
As we describe below , observing packet spoofing shows that someone is doing it , but does not directly reveal who .
We want to reduce the number of possible responsible parties .
Therefore , before beginning the test , disable any firewalls and NATs located between your computer and the Internet - including both software or " personal " firewalls running on your computer and firewall appliances or firewall functionality in routers .
As an alternative , connect your computer to a point on the network located outside of any firewalls or NAT routers ( for example , by directly connecting it to a cable modem or DSL modem ) .
Some network designs and documentation refer to this location as a DMZ .
Step 3 .
If possible , disable TCP and UDP checksum offloading and TCP segmentation offloading
Checksum offloading ( sometimes called " TCP checksum offloading " , although UDP checksums may also be offloaded ) is a feature of some recent Ethernet cards , particularly Gigabit Ethernet - capable cards , that allows the Ethernet card to construct portions of some network packets in hardware , saving load on the CPU .
However , the use of checksum offloading makes packet captures inaccurate because it prevents the local operating system from seeing what was actually transmitted .
This may cause a discrepancy since one end mistakenly thinks it sent something slightly different from what the other end correctly received ; the resulting mismatch of TCP or UDP checksum values could be misinterpreted as tampering by an ISP , since ISPs are not supposed to alter these checksums .
Checksum offloading should , if possible , be disabled at both ends before beginning the experiment .
If you know that your Ethernet card or network driver does not perform checksum offloading , you do not need to disable it .
It may also be possible to get valid results when checksum offloading is enabled ; workarounds for this purpose are described in a later section .
Here are typical means of disabling checksum offloading on several popular operating systems :
On Linux ( as root ) :
ethtool - K eth0 rx off tx off ( choose correct network interface if not eth0 )
On FreeBSD ( as root ) :
ifconfig em0 - rcxsum - tcxsum ( choose correct network interface if not em0 )
On MacOS ( as root ) :
sysctl -w net.link.ether.inet.apple_hwcksum_tx=0
sysctl -w net.link.ether.inet.apple_hwcksum_rx=0
( Note that this may cause some local applications to work incorrectly ! )
On Windows
Right - click My Computer , then select Device Manager / Network Adapters / ( select device ) / Properties / Advanced ; then disable checksum offloading , if the option is available .
For general information about checksum offloading and why it can cause errors when capturing packets , see http://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChAdvChecksums.html
and http://www.wireshark.org/faq.html#q11.1.
Note that the approach suggested there of disabling TCP checksum verification in Wireshark does not help for our purposes , because we want to compare packets ; having TCP checksums that are different across capture files will still appear as a discrepancy between those capture files even if the checksums ' values are never verified .
If your system performs checksum offloading and you are unable to disable it , other options are available .
The pcapdiff program described below allows you to ignore TCP and UDP checksum values entirely , in case you have reason to believe that checksum offloading is in use .
You can also perform the capture on a separate machine distinct from the computer that is generating the test traffic - as long as it is connected to the same local area network and is able to see the traffic passing by .
In this case , the capture should be performed in promiscuous mode ( see footnote 3 above ) and , on a network used by multiple people , extra care should be taken to avoid capturing other users ' communications without their knowledge .
Another form of offloading that can cause packet capture accuracy problems is TCP segmentation offloading , also known as large segment offload .
In TCP segmentation offloading , an Ethernet card , rather than operating system software , splits a large TCP packet into multiple TCP packets .
This can cause a serious discrepancy in the number of packets a host believes it transmitted as against the number of packets it actually transmitted ; since packets are split up by the network card in a way invisible to the sender 's operating system , every TCP packet large enough to be split may appear to be " forged " , since the sender will have no record of having sent any of the received packets in the form in which they were received .
TCP segmentation offloading should also be disabled if your system uses it .
pcapdiff , for example , is not able to ignore TCP segmentation discrepancies in the same way that it can ignore TCP and UDP checksum mismatches .
See http://www.inliniac.net/blog/2007/04/20/snort_inline-and-tcp-segmentation-offloading.html for a discussion of TCP segmentation offloading 's consequences for packet sniffing , and information about disabling it on Linux .
In general , the validity of the results of packet capture experiments will be improved by disabling all available offloading features .
Step 4 . Determine local IP address
Next , determine the IP address of your computer .
You can obtain this locally from your computer 's network configuration tools , and you can also obtain it from a web site such as http://whatismyipaddress.com/ or http://www.whatismyip.com/, which displays the IP address from which it is being accessed .
Use both methods to ensure that you are really directly connected to the Internet and not using a proxy server or NAT connection .
( If you are not using NAT , your computer 's locally - configured IP address should be identical to the IP address seen by web sites and other Internet users .
If they still disagree , it 's possible that your ISP or institutional network is forcing all users to use NAT or a proxy , rather than providing direct access to the Internet . )
From here on , we will suppose that your IP address is 12.13.14.15 and that the IP address of the person at the other end is 4.8.16.32 .
You should replace these example addresses with the real IP addresses involved .
7
Step 5 . Confirm IP addresses and test connectivity
To ensure that both you and the person at the other end have correctly determined your IP addresses , try to perform some operation that allows you to communicate with one another by specifying each other 's IP addresses .
You could use the ping command or try the application that you eventually plan to test out , such as a P2P file - sharing client or VoIP application .
If you can't establish some kind of end - to - end communication using the IP addresses you 've determined , you 'll need to debug this problem before proceeding any further .
Possible causes could include the presence of a firewall , including a software firewall , that has not yet been disabled at one end .
Step 6 . Synchronize computer clocks
If your operating system supports it , make sure that your computer 's clock is synchronized to an authoritative Network Time Protocol ( NTP ) network time server , so that the dates and times recorded in your packet capture will be accurate and will correspond to those recorded by the other computer .
This will help make results or log entries from multiple computers easier to compare .
Running the test
Start Wireshark ( with administrative privileges , e.g. root privileges , sufficient to perform a raw packet capture 8 ) .
Select " Interfaces " from the " Capture " menu .
Choose the interface corresponding to the network device you will use to capture packets ; the IP addresses bound to all available network interfaces are displayed , which may help you distinguish them if you are unsure which network interface is which .
Click the Options button for the correct interface .
In the Capture Options dialogue , ensure that the IP address you expected your computer to be using is displayed in the " IP address " field .
We recommend setting a capture filter to ensure that only packets directly to or from the other computer will be captured .
If the other computer 's IP address is 4.8.16.32 , a suitable capture filter string is " host 4.8.16.32 " .
We also recommend setting " Update list of packets in real time " and " Automatic scrolling in live capture " , which help you watch the capture process while it 's underway , unless your computer is too slow .
When you 're ready to begin capturing packets , click the Start button .
If you 've set a capture filter to limit capturing to traffic to or from the other computer , you will probably not see any packets appear in the capture until you deliberately generate some traffic between the two computers .
To ensure that the traffic is showing up , you should ensure that Wireshark packet captures are running at both ends , and then have one computer ping the other computer by IP address .
This generates a steady stream of ICMP echo request and echo reply packets .
Current Unix , Windows , and MacOS operating systems all allow you to start the ping process by typing ping 4.8.16.32 at a terminal ( command - line ) prompt .
( On some systems , the ping will stop automatically after a predetermined number of pings ; on others , you can interrupt it by pressing Ctrl+C. )
If both ends of the connection are capturing data , the ICMP packets that represent ping requests and replies should appear in the Wireshark window at each end .
These packets should be identical at the IP layer and - unless the ping utility itself reported packet loss - there should be an identical number of packets seen from both ends .
This test will show if the capture process is set up and working properly .
Here , we see how the capture process appears at both ends following a large number of ping requests from 12.13.14.15 to 4.8.16.32 .
The packets displayed agree one - to - one ( as could be verified by looking more closely at the packets ' contents than we do here ) ; there are no dropped packets and no spoofed packets .
( Note that you can't see this view from both ends in real - time ; this screen shot was created after the fact by copying a saved capture file from one computer onto another .
While the capture is running , each party sees only one of the two windows displayed here ; in order to verify that the packet captures correspond properly while they 're in progress , you 'll need to use some other means of communication to talk to the person at the other end , such as a telephone or instant messaging application .
You 'll use this channel to coordinate your activities and to compare notes . )
Once you 're confident that both computers are talking to each other over the Internet correctly and are saving a valid packet trace , you can begin to gather experimental data about whatever application is of interest to you - or try to reproduce any reported or conjectured errors or problems .
For example , for our tests with Comcast , we configured one of the computers as a BitTorrent tracker and seeder and gave the other computer a BitTorrent file instructing it to attempt to download the file hosted by the first computer .
The details of what you 'll test depend on what you 're interested in and will require you to be familiar with the application you 're testing in some detail .
( In the BitTorrent example , it 's not sufficient simply to have both parties start running BitTorrent at this point ; rather , one computer needs to be configured explicitly to offer a download to the other computer , which , in turn , needs to be configured to request a download from that computer . )
When your experiment is complete , you should stop the capture and save the resulting capture files to disk .
You can then exchange these files with the person at the other end - by e-mail , for instance .
Wireshark can be used to open and display a saved capture file generated on another computer .
There are many other network analyzers or packet sniffers that could be used instead of Wireshark .
We have chosen to describe Wireshark because it is powerful , user friendly , open source , and available for several platforms .
As long as the network analyzer you use can save its packet traces in pcap format , they can be read by a wide variety of software , including Wireshark ; thus , meaningful and comparable results could be obtained using other software .
If you 're capturing packets on a device that can't run Wireshark - such as a remotely - accessible server in a colocation facility with no graphical user interface - you should consider the tcpdump program , which is a standard part of many Unix - like operating systems and is available at http://www.tcpdump.org/.
It is important to be aware that some network analyzers default to capturing only a portion of each packet .
Wireshark 's option to " Limit each packet to 68 bytes " in the screen capture above is ( correctly ) disabled by default , but the corresponding option in some other programs could be ( wrongly ) enabled by default .
To meaningfully compare the resulting packet traces , the packet size limit should be set to the largest possible value ( usually 65535 bytes ) or disabled entirely .
For example , using the tcpdump utility , an appropriate command line would be
tcpdump -v -s 0 -w packet - trace.pcap
Setting -s 0 sets the packet size limit to " unlimited " instead of tcpdump 's default of 68 bytes .
( When running tcpdump on a computer with multiple network interfaces , it may also be necessary to specify a network interface with the - i option . )
Interpreting the results
As we described above , packet trace files generated on separate machines that were communicating directly with one another can be compared to see how packets sent by each computer correspond to packets received by the other computer .
Since a simple file transfer or VoIP conversation could generate thousands of packets , the lack of automated tools to perform this comparison can make the process tedious .
We intend to collaborate with other interested parties to produce such comparison tools in the near future , enabling much larger data sets to be analyzed quickly for spoofed packets , even where specific sorts of spoofing are not suspected .
Here are a few tips for comparing packet traces by hand :
Spoofed packets may correspond to protocol errors or extreme delays reported or observed in application software ; for example , if a client program gives an error like " Connection reset by peer " , " Connection closed by foreign host " , " Lost connection " , etc. , or data rates suddenly drop , packet spoofing may have occurred .
Noting the timing of suspicious errors may provide guidance for where to look for spoofed packets in a packet trace file .
Spoofed packets used to disrupt connections are often TCP segments with the FIN or RST flags set ( also known as " FIN packets " and " RST packets " ) ; each of these flags indicates that a computer does not want to continue a TCP conversation .
Wireshark can be configured to color these packets differently so that they stand out in a packet display .
Keep in mind that there are legitimate uses for FIN and RST packets within the TCP standards and that the presence of forged FIN or RST packets , not the presence of such packets generally , is suspicious .
( A client software or firewall bug , for example , could cause one end of a connection to disconnect prematurely - but that is n't the ISP 's fault ! )
If a problem you 're investigating is widespread , someone may already have published claims about precisely when or under what circumstances spoofed packets may appear ; you can consult the details of other people 's allegations to see whether you can reproduce these claims for yourself .
Setting aside the possibility of fragmentation , we have explained that packets are spoofed when they are received by one computer but were not transmitted by the other computer .
Below , we give examples of summary views showing a BitTorrent transfer disrupted by TCP RST spoofing :
Before the RST packets begin ( packet no .
2338 in the local capture and packet no .
2549 in the remote capture 9 ) , the packets transmitted and received correspond directly to one another ( although they appear in rather different orders ) .
10 Once the RST packets begin , a large number of packets are received at each end that do not correspond to packets transmitted at the other end .
We can verify this by looking at the detailed contents of these packets ( for example , their sequence numbers , which are displayed by Wireshark as Seq=nnnnn ) , although simply counting them tells the tale in this case .
The local machine , with IP address 12.13.14.15 , reported transmitting a total of five RST packets to the remote machine at 4.8.16.32 ( packet nos .
2340 , 2342 , 2346 , 2350 , and 2354 ) , while it reported receiving 13 such packets from 4.8.16.32 ( packet nos .
2338 , 2339 , 2343 , 2344 , 2347 , 2348 , 2351 , 2352 , 2355 , 2356 , 2357 , 2358 , and 2359 ) .
The remote machine , with IP address 4.8.16.32 , reported transmitting only a single RST packet ( packet no . 2560 ) while it believes it received 17 RST packets from 12.13.14.15 ( 2549 , 2550 , 2551 , 2552 , 2553 , 2554 , 2555 , 2556 , 2557 , 2558 , 2561 , 2562 , 2563 , 2564 , 2565 , 2566 , 2567 ) .
Evidently , many of the RST packets received by each machine did not actually originate from the other .
11 The result of these RST packets in this case was that the BitTorrent session stopped and did not resume for around four and a half minutes .
( A new TCP session is established with the characteristic SYN and SYN / ACK packets at local capture packet nos .
2446 and 2447 , which correspond to the remote capture 's packet nos .
2578 and 2579 . )
Wireshark provides the ability to view not only a packet summary list like the lists displayed above but also the sequence of bytes that comprise each individual packet , as well as a dissector view which shows what the packet 's contents actually mean from the point of view of various Internet protocol layers .
A careful examination of this evidence could involve a byte - for - byte , packet - for - packet comparison to determine exactly which packets were spoofed .
If one is performing such a comparison , it is important to appreciate that Wireshark captures more than just the IP packets that get transmitted over the Internet ; each IP packet is typically captured wrapped inside a link - layer header ( often referred to as an Ethernet frame header or Ethernet packet header on an Ethernet - style network , including a wired Ethernet or wifi network ) .
Link - layer headers are used to communicate between computers on the same local Ethernet network and are discarded and regenerated whenever a packet is forwarded through any router .
Thus , there is no reason to expect link - layer headers to correspond between two packet traces unless those packet traces were captured on the same physical local - area network .
When manually performing a detailed packet comparison , packets should be considered " the same " if the Internet Protocol headers and payload match up ; the link - layer headers can simply be ignored because they were never forwarded over the Internet .
Even some discrepancies between IP headers are to be expected ; for example , the Time - To - Live ( TTL ) field is supposed to be decremented by each router that forwards a packet , so the TTL value when a packet is received should always be smaller than the original TTL value when it was transmitted .
Similarly , the IP checksum field that indicates whether a packet 's IP headers were transmitted without error has to be recalculated each time the packet is forwarded , because the TTL value has changed .
There are also other circumstances in which an ISP 's routers may , consistent with Internet protocol standards , legitimately alter other fields in the IP headers .
12
On the modern Internet , there are usually several ISPs involved in forwarding packets from their source to their destination .
As a technical matter , any of these ISPs has the ability to spoof ( or drop ) packets .
Detecting the presence of spoofed packets , then , does not directly reveal or conclusively establish which ISP was responsible for injecting them .
To find out which ISPs were involved in the process of forwarding packets from one computer to another , one can use the traceroute tool or any of its descendants or variants .
( On Unix and MacOS , the command - line version of this tool is generally called traceroute ; on Windows , it is known as tracert . )
This tool is run with a host name or IP address as its argument and experimentally determines the path probably followed by probe packets , displaying a list of the routers in between the local computer and target computer .
In order to establish which ISP is responsible for packet spoofing , one could try experiments with a wide variety of ISPs in order to determine if users of one ISP routinely or disproportionately experience that sort of spoofing ; one could also try to enable a virtual private network ( VPN ) to hide traffic from a local ISP , although the details of this process are beyond the scope of this document .
Using pcap files
As we 've described above , packet capture files produced by Wireshark and many other network analyzer programs are normally in the pcap format ( also known as libpcap format or tcpdump format ) .
This format is an open standard that is widely understood by network analysis software .
If you 're certain that a pcap file or set of pcap files you 've made does not contain sensitive personal information - recalling our earlier warning that it may , by default , contain a record of all Internet activity your computer performed while the capture was active - you can c onsider sharing pcap files with an ISP as part of a problem report or support request , or publishing them on a blog or web site when documenting a problem you 've experienced .
These files are concrete , useful evidence that can help technically knowledgeable people diagnose network problems and confirm that a problem such as packet spoofing by an ISP is really occurring .
EFF is developing a tool called pcapdiff to help automate the process of comparing large pcap trace files that were made simultaneously at each end of a connection .
This automation makes it easier to find packet spoofing or tampering when one does n't know what to look for ahead of time and could make the comparison process less tedious ( considering that many communications involve thousands of packets or more , and not all tampering will have results as obvious as TCP RST injection ) .
The pcapdiff program is a command - line utility written in Python which requires exactly two pcap packet traces ; it automatically compares them to find discrepancies indicating dropped and spoofed packets .
You can download pcapdiff from < http://www.eff.org/testyourisp/pcapdiff>.
Your computer must already have the Python interpreter installed ; if not , you can obtain it from http://www.python.org/.
Currently , pcapdiff also requires the pcapy module from http://oss.coresecurity.com/projects/pcapy.html in order to read pcap files ; binary versions of this module are available for Windows and Linux , but it must be compiled from source code for MacOS .
Future versions of pcapdiff may be able to run without pcapy .
pcapdiff is run from the command line ; you must specify two pcap trace files and the local IP address of the computer where each was captured .
In addition to producing statistics about overall rates of packet dropping and spoofing , pcapdiff will produce a list of the IP identification field values of each such packet .
This can help you locate packets of interest in a program like Wireshark much more quickly .
For example , if pcapdiff says that a packet with IP identification value 4321 was spoofed in the outbound direction , you can enter the display filter ip .id eq 4321 into Wireshark 's display filter field and see only the packet ( or packets ) with this particular IP identification value .
Typically , IP identification values uniquely identify IP packets transmitted by a particular computer , although these values will be repeated at least every 65536 ( 216 ) packets .
Observing a very large number of forged packets may suggest that something is systematically wrong - for example , you may have started or ended the captures at different times ( so that one machine has no record of having sent many of the packets that it did , in fact , send ) , you may have limited the number of bytes captured per packet at one end but not at the other end , you may have some kind of protocol offloading active on one end ( so that one computer 's operating system is wrong about the contents of the packets that the network card actually sent over the wire ) , you might still have NAT or a firewall enabled at one end of the connection , or your ISP might be forging or altering packets routinely , perhaps with a technique like transparent HTTP proxying that is invisible to most application software .
It is important to think critically about the significance of evidence and whether results are reproducible or attributable to confounding factors .
pcapdiff and the techniques described here are meant to help users find anomalous discrepancies between packets sent and packets received , not to definitively assign blame for the source of those anomalies .
Learning more about TCP / IP and interpreting network packet traces
For a deeper understanding of network protocols and packet traces like those described here , you can consult the Internet standards documents that specify the TCP / IP protocol suite .
Most of these documents have been published in the RFC document series available at http://www.rfc-editor.org/ and http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/.
For example , the Internet Protocol ( IP ) is described in RFC 791 , the Transmission Control Protocol ( TCP ) in RFC 793 , and the User Datagram Protocol ( UDP ) in RFC 768 .
An excellent guide to the TCP / IP protocol suite in book form is W. Richard Stevens , TCP / IP Illustrated : Volume 1 , The Protocols ( Reading , MA : Addison - Wesley , 1994 ) , ISBN 0201633469 .
Stevens uses the tcpdump tool to produce packet traces on 1990s - era Internet - connected networks , and carefully explains the theory and practice of Internet networking with reference to these packet traces .
Doing the same thing with Wireshark might be clearer today because Wireshark has a friendlier interface and more extensive protocol dissection than tcpdump , but Stevens 's explanations are clear , thorough , and generally valid for the Internet of today .

2 If your ISP were blocking Google , you might suspect this when you encountered difficulty connecting to Google 's services - and you might see apparently anomalous packets in a packet trace from your end .
However , only the addition of a recording of the same interaction from Google 's end would definitively establish whether the problem lay with Google or with an ISP in between .
Otherwise , it is difficult to tell whether the problem is a result of ordinary packet loss , a misbehaving computer at Google 's end , or even misbehaving software on your own computer .
We urge readers to interpret the results of their tests cautiously and avoid jumping to conclusions or making spurious accusations .
For example , RST packets are a legitimate part of the TCP protocol , and receiving RST packets does not normally mean that they were spoofed by an intermediary .
RST packet spoofing can only be proven definitively by making simultaneous measurements at the endpoints of a connection .
( Some forms of packet spoofing could produce suggestive evidence at one end because the spoofed packets have anomalous properties that make it very unlikely that they were really transmitted by the other end .
But observing these anomalies will probably not be truly conclusive unless evidence is also gathered at the other end . )
It would clearly be useful to have a reliable automated means of testing non-P2P services to detect interference or degradation by ISPs .
In some cases this would just be a matter of writing software , while in other cases it would require co-ordination among multiple parties ( such as Google in the example just given ) .
For example , it would be helpful to know whether ISPs give users lower - latency connections to some web sites than to others .
Because the web site operators ' co-operation is required for this test , it is beyond the scope of this article .
One test that could be performed readily by two end - users is seeing whether exchanging the same volume of data with different protocols ( for example , sending a single 1 - megabyte file with HTTP , FTP , BitTorrent , Gnutella , and disguised as a SIP VoIP telephone call data stream ) takes appreciably different amounts of time , and whether the round - trip latency for each of these protocols is the same or not .
This article does not discuss tools that would help automate such a test .
We do discuss our pcapdiff tool below and also mention the University of Washington research project using JavaScript to detect some modification of web page contents by ISPs .
3 One Internet user configured his open wireless gateway to modify images seen by users as they browsed the web , either by mirror - reversing them or blurring them .
See http://www.ex-parrot.com/~pete/upside-down-ternet.html.
It can be easy to forget that Internet intermediaries are able to make arbitrary changes to their users ' view of the Internet .

5 If you 're running Wireshark on the same machine that 's generating or receiving the test traffic , as we recommend here , you do n't need to follow the additional directions at http://www.wireshark.org/faq.html#promiscsniff because you wo n't need to capture traffic in promiscuous mode .
Running Wireshark in promiscuous mode on a different machine on the same local area network segment ( note : not on an Ethernet switch ) could , however , help mitigate problems with excessive CPU load , with the unavailability of Wireshark or a suitable packet capture driver for a particular operating system or device , with TCP or UDP checksum offloading or large segment offloading ( described below ) , or when logging into a remote server by means such as SSH in order to run tests on that server 's communications with your client machine .
In this scenario , the machine capturing packets is not the same machine that generates them ; however , the resulting packet trace can generally be used in the same way as a packet trace that was captured directly on the machine generating the packets , as long as the LAN to which the machines are connected broadcasts all packets to the packet - capturing machine .
There are also techniques for sniffing traffic on some non-broadcast switched LANs , which are beyond the scope of this document .
Running Wireshark on MacOS
X requires X11 ; there are other pcap - compatible native packet sniffers for MacOS X .
6 NAT devices and firewalls create uncertainty because they routinely rewrite , drop , or block traffic ; if they are not disabled , it will be difficult to prove that communications that blocked or altered packets were blocked or altered by an ISP rather than by a firewall device .
NATs and proxies also prevent direct packet - by - packet comparison of packet traces because the end points do not have a consistent view of the source and destination addresses in use , and there may not even be a one - to - one relationship between packets entering and exiting a NAT or proxy .
Evidence of third - party packet tampering gathered in the presence of any of these devices is better than no evidence , but must be interpreted with extreme caution .
7 Note that if your IP address appears to be in a private address range defined by RFC 1918 ( 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 , 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 , or 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 ) , you have not properly followed the instructions to disable any firewalls and NAT devices ( or your ISP is forcing everyone to use its own ISP - operated NAT service ) .
8 Windows users may also be able to use the NPF driver to perform a packet capture as an unprivileged user .
9 In this context , " packet number " refers to the ordinal number of the packet within a particular capture file , which is displayed by Wireshark in the left - hand column ; the first packet sent or received is number 1 , the next number 2 , and so on .
There are also other forms of serial numbering contained within the packets themselves , such as the IP identification field and TCP sequence number .
pcapdiff uses the IP identification field ( which Wireshark refers to as ip.id for display filter purposes ) to refer to packets , but this paragraph is merely discussing Wireshark packet ordinal numbers .
" Packet no. 2340 " in this sense need not have IP identification value 2340 .
10 This reordering is not necessarily only due to ISP packet reordering , but also to the existence of network latency ; if both computers transmit a packet at noon over a network with a 1 - second latency , each computer will receive the other computer 's transmissions at 12:00:01 and consider its own transmission to have taken place " first " .
11 To compound the suspiciousness of this situation , each machine believed that it was not the first to send a RST packet in this transaction - the local and remote machines each believed that the other party had initiated the process of disconnecting the communication .
It can be legitimate in the TCP protocol to send a RST in response to a RST , and this trace suggests that each machine believed that that is what it was doing - disconnecting only after the other end had already disconnected .
12 We might compare this , albeit imprecisely , to the behavior of the post office in delivering a letter : the post office may apply a postmark or print a bar code on the outside of the envelope , stamp delivery - related notations on it , or even correct an erroneous postal code .
However , the post office is not supposed to alter the contents of letters .
( CNN ) --
The husband of Carol Anne Gotbaum , the woman who died in police custody at the Phoenix , Arizona , airport , says a little kindness might have saved her life .
Video shows Carol Ann Gotbaum being arrested at a Phoenix airport shortly before she died while in custody .
" If the airline or the police authorities had treated Carol with some modicum of sensitivity and grace , or one single person at that airport had put an arm around her shoulder , sat her down and given her some protection , she might still be with us today , " Noah Gotbaum said at her funeral Sunday in New York .
CNN obtained a recording of Noah Gotbaum 's eulogy with the family 's permission .
Carol Gotbaum died September 28 in a holding cell at Phoenix 's Sky Harbor Airport .
She apparently became angry after not being allowed to board a flight to Tucson , Arizona , and was arrested .
Surveillance video showed her resisting police who handcuffed her and dragged her away .
Watch officers wrestle Gotbaum to the ground »
Authorities believe she strangled herself as she tried to maneuver out of handcuffs secured behind her back and attached to a bench in the holding cell .
The medical examiner who performed the autopsy went into the same holding cell where Gotbaum died and had officers handcuff and shackle her in the same position as Gotbaum , a source close to the investigation told CNN .
The medical examiner 's height and weight are similar to Gotbaum 's , making the re-enactment worth doing , the source said .
Authorities said , following Gotbaum 's death , that she might have been drinking , and an attorney retained by her family has said she was traveling to Tucson to check into an alcohol treatment center .
However , the source told CNN that Gotbaum was sober when she arrived in Phoenix , as she sent a series of e-mails and made some phone calls , sounding lucid .
But 46 minutes before the Tucson flight was scheduled to leave , Gotbaum went to an airport sports bar to get something to eat , and may have had some drinks there , the source said .
She arrived at the gate one minute after boarding was closed , and was not allowed to board .
Although that upset her , the source said , she did not become irate -- as seen on an airport surveillance tape -- until she was not allowed to get on the next flight to Tucson .
The police report said a man offered to give up his seat on that flight for her , but officials told her he could not do that because it would be considered a security breach .
That may explain why witnesses and authorities said Gotbaum was screaming " I 'm not a terrorist " at the time of her arrest .

Satirist ’s faux campaign hits its first roadblock as early primary state decides he does n’t meet criteria .
S.C. Dems reject Colbert candidacy
Stephen Colbert ’s satirical run for the presidency has run into its first roadblock — his bid to be on the ballot in the South Carolina Democratic presidential primary was rejected on Thursday .
The party ’s executive council voted 13 - 3 to refuse Colbert ’s application for a spot on the ballot .
Advertisement
“ The general sense of the council was that he was n’t a serious candidate and that was why he was n’t selected to be on the ballot , ” said Joe Werner , the party ’s director .
“ There was discussion — I would n’t call it a heated debate — but there was discussion about it . ”
There is no appeal process , Werner said , adding that the party will certify its ballot as final later Thursday with the South Carolina State Election Commission .
The Democrats had to decide whether they considered Colbert to be a bona fide Democrat who is nationally viable and has spent time campaigning in the state .
A South Carolina - based lawyer who was working to get Colbert ’s name on the Democratic ballot could not immediately be reached for comment , nor could members of the executive council that made the decision .
Colbert could still run as an independent in the general election , though he ’d have to collect 10,000 signatures to get on the ballot , said Chris Whitmire , a spokesman for the State Election Commission .
Colbert ’s candidacy posed a tricky question for the Democratic Party executive council , which has to approve all candidates for the party ’s ballot .
If it allowed Colbert to appear as a presidential candidate on their ballot , it would generate attention that might swell the party ’s ranks and coffers by attracting previously unaffiliated voters .
But it likely would also attract allegations it was helping Colbert , the host of the popular faux - news program “ The Colbert Report ” on Comedy Central , make a mockery of the election system .
On the flip side , by rejecting Colbert , the council might satisfy purists but be scorned as killjoys by others .
Members of the executive council expressed a range of similar sentiments before the vote , according to a CNN story .
It quoted council member Waring Howe Jr. saying Colbert would appear on the party ’s ballot “ over my dead body . ”
Many members of the executive council likely voted against giving Colbert a spot on the ballot because they have allegiances to specific candidates , said former South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges , a Democrat who knows many council members .
“ There are various candidates who do n’t get the joke in the Democratic Party and who , for whatever reasons , want to keep him off the ballot , ” said Hodges , who signed a petition supporting Colbert ’s candidacy .
“ I personally think he does n’t hurt any of them .
He brings a sense of levity to politics that ’s needed , and the people in South Carolina would enjoy it .
We probably would have some people participate who otherwise would not do so . ”
Hodges , who served from 1999 until 2003 , met Colbert at a recent party and said , “ I even offered myself up as a vice president .
I told him that he could think of me as Dick Cheney but as a better shot , ” presumably making a crack about Cheney ’s infamous hunting incident .
Less than one hour before a noon deadline , Colbert filed to get on the ballot .
He submitted a $ 2,500 filing fee — paid with a personal check from Colbert — and a letter explaining to the committee why he wanted to run , said Werner .
“ It is a very , very nice letter .
If you ’re from South Carolina , this is going to play a role in the decision , I ’m sure , ” Werner said before the meeting .
Another issue the council may have considered :
The state Democratic Party has to pay the state a $ 20,000 fee for each name it places on the ballot .
The council did grant a spot on the party ’s ballot to former Alaska Sen .
Mike Gravel , whose presidential campaign barely registers in most polls and who the Democratic National Committee has barred from participating in official debates .
Also getting approval at Thursday ’s meeting : Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York , Barack Obama of Illinois , Chris Dodd of Connecticut and Joe Biden of Delaware and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina , Rep. Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico .
Colbert brought his “ campaign ” to South Carolina last week , speaking at events Saturday and Sunday , attracting a college crowd of about 1,000 people at the latter .
On his show last month , Colbert announced he would run on both the Democratic and Republican primary ballots in his native state of South Carolina .
But the fee to apply to get on the Republican ballot was $ 35,000 , while Democrats asked for only a $ 2,500 fee or the signatures of 3,000 registered South Carolina voters on a petition .
Colbert had posted a downloadable copy of the Democratic Party ’s petition on a bare - bones campaign website , www.colbert08.org.
Though Colbert submitted petitions , Werner said they were unnecessary because he paid the filing fee .
He added that he did not think Colbert had collected 3,000 valid signatures .
“ There are some names on the petition that are interesting names , ” Werner said , including Hodges ' .
Ironically , even though he likely wo n’t be on the Democratic ballot , his effort brought him at least halfway to being considered a real candidate under federal election laws .
The laws impose strict rules on anyone who raises or spends more than $ 5,000 to promote a candidacy .
If Colbert hits that threshold , whether his campaign was intended as a joke or not , he ’d have 15 days to form a campaign committee and file a statement of candidacy with the FEC .

Tony Blair suffered a humiliating put - down from U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as he started his job as Middle East envoy .
Dr Rice made it clear she was in charge of brokering peace between the Israelis and Palestinians , not the former prime minister .
She said Mr Blair should instead stick to his narrow remit of mending the Palestinian economy and political system , a role merely complementary to her job as leading peacemaker to the region .
Her comments will embarrass Mr Blair , who has been angling for a more prominent role from the Quartet , the peacemaking body of the U.S. , UN , EU and Russia .
Scroll down for more ...
When he was appointed Middle East envoy on the day he left office on June 27 , Mr Blair had pledged to broker a Northern Ireland - style peace process between Israel and the Palestinians .
This contrasted with his predecessor , former World Bank president James Wolfensohn , who dealt solely with Palestinian economic reform .
But on Mr Blair 's first day in the job , Dr Rice insisted the U.S. would keep leading Middle East peace efforts , with Mr Blair playing a ' completely complementary ' role .
' There is also a political track that for a variety of reasons the U.S. is committed to lead in coordination with the Quartet , ' she said before a meeting of the peacemaking body in Lisbon .
She later told Sky News that Mr Blair would bring ' an energy ' to improving the lives of Palestinians , describing him as an ' experienced , capable , historic figure ' .
Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev said , however , that while he had no doubt Mr Blair would make a difference , no one believed he could ' show up and be the Messiah and suddenly everything will fall into place ' .
Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman Michael Moore said the fact that Dr Rice was playing down Mr Blair 's role ' indicates that the Quartet is in a mess and the Palestinians and others are right to be highly sceptical about it ' .
Mr Blair will make his first visit to the Middle East in his new role next week .
The job is unpaid - although it comes with office expenses of around £ 100,000 - meaning Mr Blair has been forced to look elsewhere for a way of funding his post - Downing Street career .
He plans to bolster his earnings on the lecture circuit and last week he was the star guest at a media and technology conference in Idaho .
CAR owners the world over fret about parking , but in China the competition for spaces can be especially fierce .
Within just a few years urban China has undergone a transformation .
Streets that teemed once with bicycles are clogged now with cars .
New housing complexes have sprung up in the suburbs for the fast - growing middle classes .
Rows frequently erupt over control of parking spaces within them .
These and other local confrontations signify a huge change in the balance of power in Chinese cities .
Until the 1990s the state owned almost all urban housing .
Most residents lived close to their state - assigned workplaces .
They had no bargaining power .
Neighbourhood committees were controlled by Communist Party appointees .
If residents had complaints , they usually kept quiet about them .
In recent years , along with the sweeping privatisation of almost all urban housing , a new force has emerged : landlord committees , many of them formed spontaneously by home - owners to protect their new assets .
These committees , often democratically elected with little party interference , have become increasingly powerful in asserting the rights of home - owners against encroachment by the state , and by state - owned and private developers .
The fight for control of parking spaces is one of the many modest causes that have brought a change in the urban mentality — beyond a consciousness of limited legal rights , to a growing awareness of the need for a more active “ civil society ” as a balance against arbitrary officialdom .
To accommodate the new middle classes , whose support is considered vital by Chinese leaders to the maintenance of Communist Party rule , the party has refashioned its ideology .
Five years ago it allowed private business owners to join the party .
Later this year it plans to revise its charter to fix a new objective , of creating a “ harmonious society ” — a goal that would appeal to society 's underdogs , but would also reassure the middle classes that the “ dictatorship of the proletariat ” , to which China still lays claim , does not mean attacking property owners .

China 's space race
In March this year , despite vocal opposition by party conservatives , the leadership ensured passage of a new property law in parliament .
This was widely hailed as a further salve for landlords .
Although much of it merely consolidated existing legislation , it contained important new provisions concerning the rights of property owners in new housing estates , including principles governing the ownership of parking spaces .
The provisions were intended to address the root cause of the parking - space battles , namely , the lack of any clear ownership rights .
A developer would usually proceed on the basis that , save for the apartments themselves , any other land and buildings on an estate could be exploited as he saw fit .
Home - owners found they had little say in the price of a parking space , and no way to prevent spaces being sold or rented to non-residents .
Some estates became jammed with cars parked randomly by residents trying to save money ; reserved spaces are often sold at prices equivalent to that of a new car .
Private passenger car ownership reached nearly 11.5 m last year , more than one - third higher than 2005 's level , not counting millions of company and government cars used for private purposes .
Many estates were built without factoring in such a surge .
The new law makes clear that parking spaces occupying what the law considers to be land owned collectively by the home - owners , such as roads within estates , are also collectively owned .
It obliges developers to give priority to the parking needs of estate residents .
It is vaguer on the subject of how home - owners and developers are supposed to cooperate .
Some developers , fearing that home - owners will gain a greater say over prices , have rushed to sell off as many spaces as that they can before the law takes effect on October 1st .
Disputes continue to simmer .
Party leaders say that a top priority in the development of a “ harmonious society ” is strengthening democracy and the rule of law .
They reject any idea of a multi-party system , but they have begun to talk more about a need for greater “ public participation ” in policymaking ; unusually , an early draft of the property law was made public , and comments on it by private citizens were collected .
But developers remain an obstacle .
Faren magazine , a legal journal , said this month that out of 3,000 residential estates in Beijing , only 500 had set up landlord committees .
It quoted legal experts as saying this was because developers and property management companies often refused to cooperate with them .
When it comes to developing democracy , China 's new capitalists can be as obstructive as old - style communists .
The disinhibiting and pain - numbing effects of drugs make them perfect for turning people into killing machines .
In fact , criminals on PCP have been reported to withstand multiple shocks with Taser guns , pepper spray , and Mace , and even direct gunshot wounds to the chest , without slowing down .
It 's no wonder that so many generals have relied on drugs to bring out the so - called best in unwitting soldiers .
1. Nazi Shock Troops
During World War II , Nazi Germany definitely led the pack in its use of amphetamines , cocaine , and other " performance - enhancing "  drugs .
In fact , amphetamine pills were included in every German soldier 's first - aid kit , and Nazi researchers developed chewing gum that delivered a dose of cocaine with each piece .
But that was n't all !
According to a book by German author and criminologist Wolf Kemper on the subject , Nazis on Speed , one of the substances tested by the Nazis in 1944 , D - IX , was actually a cocaine - based compound that included both amphetamine and a morphine - related chemical to dull pain .
The experimental drug was tested on prisoners of war , and
Nazi doctors found the test subjects could march 55 miles without a rest
before they collapsed .
The Nazis hoped that the drug could put some fighting spirit into their armies , which were by that time being defeated on all fronts , but luckily the war ended before production could begin .
2. Thai and Burmese Bandit Armies
" The Golden Triangle " — an area straddling Thailand , Laos , and Myanmar , where poppy plants grow particularly well — has long been a center of the international drug trade , and for centuries national armies , revolutionaries , and criminal gangs have waged war for control of the income it generates .
Recently , however , bandits and rebels from all three countries have begun recruiting children , feeding them opium , hashish , amphetamines , and tranquilizers to give them courage , then sending them out on " human wave "  attacks .
The disturbing phenomenon leaves a huge proportion of the children dead .
One adult soldier from Burma who had to fight these poor child soldiers recalled , " There were a lot of boys rushing into the field , screaming like banshees .
It seemed like they were immortal , or impervious , or something , because we shot at them but they just kept coming . " 
3. U.S. Army " Go Pills " 
Though amphetamines are essentially off - limits for the civilian population of the United States , American armed forces have long made use of them to enhance the fighting abilities of pilots , soldiers , and sailors , and to keep them awake for long periods of time .
Interest peaked in World War II , when all the major combatants on both sides conducted extensive research and distributed large amounts of stimulants to their soldiers .
Surprisingly enough , America 's armed forces continue the practice to this very day .
The amphetamine most often dispensed to American servicemen and women is Dexedrine , short for dextroamphetamine sulfate , also referred to as " go pills . " 
In one April 2002 incident in Afghanistan , pilots from the Illinois Air National Guard accidentally dropped bombs on a Canadian unit , killing four and wounding eight .
In the inquiry that followed , the pilots claimed that they were disoriented because they had been forced to take Dexedrine " go pills "  by their superiors and would have been declared unfit for combat if they had not .
4. West African Child Soldiers
In the brutal civil wars that have bedeviled West Africa over the last two decades , much of the fighting is done by children who are teenagers or younger .
Armed with automatic weapons , the children are rewarded with sex , candy , tobacco , or alcohol — anything that encourages them to fight .
However , sometimes the temptation is n't great enough , so their adult commanders often find it helps to ply them with more powerful drugs that inhibit their judgment .
In Sierra Leone , Western observers met children between the ages of 9 and 16 who had been given amphetamines , while children of similar age in the militias of Liberian president Charles Taylor were routinely given cocaine , opium , marijuana , and palm wine to encourage their killer instincts .
Often dressed in outlandish costumes out of a belief that strange clothing would protect them in combat — a wedding dress with fright wig was a favorite — these children were described by the journalists who met them as borderline psychotic .

MENLO PARK , Calif . —
By almost any definition — except his own and perhaps those of his neighbors here in Silicon Valley — Hal Steger has made it .
Mr. Steger , 51 , a self - described geek , has banked more than $ 2 million .
The $ 1.3 million house he and his wife own on a bluff overlooking the Pacific Ocean is paid off .
The couple ’s net worth of roughly $ 3.5 million places them in the top 2 percent of families in the United States .
Yet each day Mr. Steger continues to toil in what a colleague calls “ the Silicon Valley salt mines , ” working as a marketing executive for a technology start - up company , still striving for his big strike .
Most mornings , he can be found at his desk by 7 .
He typically works 12 hours a day and logs an extra 10 hours over the weekend .
“ I know people looking in from the outside will ask why someone like me keeps working so hard , ” Mr. Steger says .
“ But a few million does n’t go as far as it used to .
Maybe in the ’70s , a few million bucks meant ‘ Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous , ’ or Richie Rich living in a big house with a butler .
But not anymore . ”
Overheard outside the Dance building :
Girl 1 : What other explanation , you know , could there be ?
Because my numbers are 3 and 7 , and so last year was great for me , but now that I ’m a senior everything ’s downhill .
Girl 2 : That ’s why we put the “ ology ” in “ Numerology . ”
Science works .
This is why I do n’t make many friends in the Dance Department .
Newton Fractals
As soon as I ’m done teaching today , I ’m heading on the road to scenic Tyler , TX for the Conference on Representation Theory , Quantum Field Theory , Category Theory , Mathematical Physics and Quantum Information Theory .
And so something light , that I actually presented to my students last week .
Many of you may be familiar with this from calculus , but at least it ’s more interesting than L’Hôpital ’s rule .
For those who have n’t seen it , this post is outside the main line .
Accordingly , I ’m willing to leave some of the calculus unmotivated and unexplained .
Newton ’s Method is an attempt to find a point where for some function .
The basic idea is that we pick a point near where we think there ’s a zero of the function and assume that the graph of the function is sort of sloping towards the zero .
Functions on their own are sort of hard to work with , but we know how to deal with linear functions pretty well .
We ’ll try to pretend the function is just linear and work from there .
So if we start at the point we have the point on the graph above it .
Then we draw a straight line that just touches the graph at that point .
Calculus tells us that this line has the equation .
Now we want to find the where this line crosses the - axis .
That is : .
Some algebra tells us that .
Now I ’m not saying that is our desired zero , but hopefully it ’s closer .
Then we just run this again .
If we define we can write .
And then we continue by writing , where the exponent means we evaluate the function twice .
This goes on , defining an infinite sequence of points , and the hope is that this will zoom in on a zero of the function .
Well , zeroes of the function are fixed points of this map .
Indeed , if then .
We have other tools that tell us a fixed point of a function will attract nearby points if .
And here , .
Since , we see that , so near these fixed points the map does indeed pull points closer .
But there ’s a problem .
What happens when ?
Then the function is undefined , and the method breaks down .
Almost as bad , near those points the tangent line is almost flat , and so the next point in the sequence ends up very far away , possibly nearer a different zero than the one we were trying to find .
Here ’s a picture to show how complicated this can get .
In this picture , we ’re moving from calculus over the real numbers to calculus over the complex numbers , but the mechanics of Newton ’s Method work the same .
We consider the function , so we ’re trying to find the three points on the complex plane that have cube .
We know that one is itself , and the other two are situated a third of a rotation around the unit circle in either direction .
We get the picture by picking a complex number to start with , and running the method until we ’re within some very small distance of one of our zeroes , so we know we ’re going to get to that one in the limit .
If we end up at , we color the point blue .
The points which go to the other two zeroes we color green and red , respectively .
We color a point darker if it takes longer to get near one of the zeroes .
We ’d hope that starting at a given point would land us at the closest of the three zeroes , but borders here are tricky .
We can never have a boundary between two of these basins of attraction without having the third one there too .
So along the line separating the blue basin from the red one we have a chain of green islands .
Similarly , we have red islands between blue and green , and blue islands between red and green .
And then along the boundary a green island shares with the big blue basin we have a chain of smaller red islands , and so on .
The upshot is that every boundary point looks like the point at where all three basins touch each other , leading to the famous self - similarity that is characteristic of fractal geometries .

ALGEMEEN
De maan zo rood als bloed Van zaterdag op zondag 3/ 4 maart 2007 vond een totale maansverduistering plaats .
Het bijzondere was dat de verduistering in Nederland en België van begin tot einde was te zien .
De verduistering duurde van 22.30 tot 02.11 uur .
De intrede van de Maan in de donkere kernschaduw van de aarde begon om 23.44 uur .
Om 00.21 uur was de maan het diepst in de kernschaduw gedompeld .
Om 00.58 viel weer zonlicht op de linkerrand van de maan en was de totaliteit ten einde .
Steeds groter werd het maansikkeltje totdat om 02.11 uur de maan weer gewoon ' vol ' was .
Tijdens de totaliteit ( midden ) straalt de maan met een oranje - rode gloed .

Bij een maansverduistering trekt de maan door de schaduw van de aarde .
Er ontbreekt een ‘ hap ’ uit de volle maan en die wordt steeds groter totdat de maan volledig door de donkere aardschaduw is ‘ opgeslokt ’ .
De maan is dan niet helemaal onzichtbaar , maar straalt nog met een donkere , oranje - rode gloed .
Vanaf de maan gezien is namelijk een oranje - rode ring om aarde te zien : het licht van alle zonsondergangen en zonsopkomsten op onze planeet .
Vanaf de maan gezien wordt de zon door de aarde verduisterd .
Het verloop van de maansverduistering is in de figuur afgebeeld .
Daarbij waren de volgende momenten van belang .
Tussen 21.18 en 22.30 uur , alsook tussen 02.11 en 03.23 uur , bevond de maan zich in de bijschaduw van de aarde .
Aan de nachtzijde van de aarde onderscheidt men een donkere kernschaduw ( umbra ) , met daaromheen een bijschaduw ( penumbra ) .
Hetzelfde effect doet zich voor als we een voorwerp tussen een lamp en een stuk papier houden .
Ook dan ontstaan een donkere slagschaduw met daaromheen een lichtgrijze bijschaduw .
Dat lichtgrijze gedeelte is het gebied waar nog wel een deel van het lamplicht doordringt .
In de natuur is de schaduw van de aarde een lange , spitse kegel .
Ter hoogte van het gebied waar de maan doorheen trekt , is de middellijn van die kegel twee ënhalf tot driemaal groter dan de maanmiddellijn zelf .
De omringende bijschaduwkegel beslaat gewoonlijk één maanmiddellijn rond de slagschaduw .
De totale maansverduistering van 3/4 maart 2007 .
De donkere cirkel is een doorsnee , op maanafstand , van de slagschaduw van de aarde .
De buitenste grijze cirkelomtrek stelt de bijschaduw voor .
De pijl bij Noord wijst naar de noordelijke hemelpool ; de pijl bij Zenit 1 duidt de richting van het zenit ( hoogste punt aan de hemel ) aan ten tijde van het begin van de verduistering .
De pijl bij Zenit 2 is de richting van het zenit ten tijde van het einde van de verduistering .
De streepjeslijn stelt de ecliptica voor : het aan de hemel geprojecteerde vlak van de aardbaan .
1 ) Maan komt de kernschaduw binnen : 22.30 uur .
2 ) Begin van de totale verduistering : 23.44 uur .
3 ) Maximum van de totaliteit : 00.21 uur .
4 ) Einde van de totaliteit : 00.58 uur .
5 ) Maan verlaat de kernschaduw : 02.11 uur .

Van een bijschaduwverduistering is doorgaans niet veel te zien .
Op de maan vindt dan een gedeeltelijke zonsverduistering plaats en daradoor valt er nog gewoon zonlicht op de bodem .
Alleen waar het zonnesikkeltje al heel klein is geworden , kan een verzwakking worden opgemerkt van het teruggekaatste maanlicht .
Rond 22.00 uur was al te zien hoe het onderste deel van de volle maan minder fel verlicht was dan het bovenste gedeelte .
En na 02.11 uur was datzelfde verschil te zien tussen de nog wat donkerder rechterkant en de veel fellere linkerkant van de maan .
Het beste waren deze verschillen te zien als het maanbeeld met een verrekijker of een telescoop op een stuk wit papier werd geprojecteerd of als wolkenflarden voor de maan langs trokken .

De maansverduistering kon met het blote oog worden gevolgd .
Maar het verschijnsel was nog indrukwekkender door een verrekijker .
Wie de maansverduistering door een echte telescoop wilde bekijken kon dat doen bij een van de publiekssterrenwachten .
Daarvan waren van zaterdag op zondag een zeventigtal in Nederland en een veertigtal in Vlaanderen geopend .
Op 28 augustus dit jaar vindt weer een totale maansverduistering plaats .
Deze is echter niet vanuit Nederland en België te zien .
De eerstvolgende totale maansverduistering die wel bij ons te zien is , vindt plaats op 21 februari 2008 .
Daarna is het wachten tot 28 september 2015 , 27 juli 2018 , 21 januari 2019 , 7 november 2025 en 31 december 2028 .
Al deze maansverduistering staan echter een stuk lager boven de horizon en zijn dus niet zo mooi als die van 3/4 maart 2007 .
Pas op 20 december 2029 is er weer een totale maansverduistering die bij ons zeer hoog aan de hemel staat .
Kleur en helderheid van totale maansverduisteringen
Volgens de Franse astronoom Danjon ( 1890 - 1967 ) zou de helderheid van de totale verduistering afhangen van de 11 - jaarlijkse zonnevlekkencyclus .
Kort na een minimum aan zonnevlekken zouden de verduisteringen zeer donker zijn , om dan in de loop van de volgende jaren geleidelijk in helderheid toe te nemen .
Dit zou zo doorgaan tot vlak voor het volgende zonnevlekkenminimum , waarna de verduisteringen weer heel donker zouden beginnen .
Nu is de dichtheid van de aardatmosfeer boven een hoogte van circa 200 km afhankelijk van de zonnevlekkencyclus .
In jaren met veel zonnevlekken ( 1957 , 1968 , 1979 , 1989 en 2000 en straks 2010 / 11 ) is die groter dan in jaren met weinig zonnevlekken ( 1964 , 1976 , 1986 , 1995 en 2006/07 ) .
Dat werd al kort na de lancering van de eerste kunstmanen vastgesteld aan de hand van de wrijving die deze objecten ondergingen tijdens hun omloop om de aarde .
Toch is het moeilijk voorstelbaar dat de hoge aardatmosfeer zóveel extra zonlicht zou afbuigen .
Bovendien : hoe ontstaat dan de abrupte overgang van zeer heldere naar zeer donkere verduisteringen ten tijde van het zonnevlekkenminimum ?
Veel waarschijnlijker zijn de helderheidsverschillen van ' aardse ' oorsprong , zoals veel stof in onze atmosfeer door vulkaanuitbarstingen .
Maanden na de uitbarstingen van de vulkanen Krakatau ( 1883 ) , Mont Pelée ( 1902 ) , Gunung Agung ( 1963 ) , El Chichón ( 1982 ) en Pinatubo ( 1991 ) volgden totale maansverduisteringen die zeer donker , of voor het blote oog zelfs volkomen onzichtbaar waren .
Daarom kan iedere maansverduistering voor een verrassing zorgen !
Schaal van Danjon
L=0 .
Zeer donkere verduistering .
Vooral bij het centrale deel van de aardse slagschaduw is de maan nauwelijks zichtbaar .
L=1 . Donkere verduistering .
De maan is donkerbruin of grijsachtig getint en er zijn nauwelijks oppervlaktedetails te zien .
L=2 . Donkere , dieprode maan .
Het centrum van de slagschaduw is veel donkerder dan de oranje - achtige rand .
L=3 .
Heldere verduistering met een steenrode kleur .
De rand is nu geelachtig getint .
L=4 .
Zeer heldere verduistering .
De maan is koper - rood of oranje - rood van kleur en heeft een heldere , blauwe rand .
Natuurlijk heeft zo 'n Danjon - schatting alleen waarde als ook rekening wordt gehouden met de hoogte van de maan boven de horizon en de doorzichtigheid van de lucht .
De verduistering van 3 - 4 maart 2007 kon worden geschat als tussen L=3 en L=4 .
De maan bleef tijdens het maximum van de totaliteit iets helderder dan de planeet Saturnus .

Voorgaande live webcasts :
One of the big visual changes just happened in KDE 4 , the
transition of kdelibs to the Oxygen Icon set .
This transition is
still in progress , and it includes a massive icon naming scheme
change that affects thousands of files .
But , the Oxygen artwork
project much is more than just an icon set , it 's a unified way to do
artwork for KDE 4 . SVG an essential part of Oxygen , so many
applications that are now capable of SVG display are also using
Oxygen styled artwork .
Read on for more ...
Please keep in mind that the artwork I am showing today is a
work in progress , but shows things that have already made
their way into KDE 's SVN as the new default .
Oxygen will be the
default art scheme throughout KDE 4 , but many of the elements can
still use some tweaking .
If you have constructive feedback on any
of the artwork demonstrated today , the Oxygen team would be happy to
hear about it in the comments . :)
Back on the first of January , I wrote an article showing some SVG
widgets making their way into KDE , thanks in part to Qt 's new SVG
capabilities .
Some of the artwork shown in that article was
placeholders that were produced by the Oxygen team .
Since then ,
there have been improvements to much of those graphics , but the
really big visual change that just happened is the inclusion of the
new Oxygen Iconset into the KDE libraries as the new defaults .
Oxygen is a far reaching project , and extends well beyond icons .
They have a sort of unofficial tagline : " a breath of fresh air for
your desktop " , which encompasses the look and feel of the whole KDE
environment .
They are a team of developers and artists that are
dedicated to making things look beautiful .
And not just shiny
effects either , they are ensuring that KDE has a unified , easy to
recognize interface .
For example , icons that end up in toolbars all
have the same shadows below them to give them a consistent look .
Colour palettes have been created for the artwork to ensure that
icons do n't clash with one another , and yet are still easily
recognizable .
All of the icon sources are SVG files create using
Inkscape ( and other SVG capable programs ) , and having the sources
available makes it easier to make simple tweaks to the SVG files .
We also now have an official icon naming scheme for KDE 4 .
Previous versions of KDE grew the naming scheme organically as KDE
evolved , so it was somewhat random in many places .
The Oxygen team
was responsible for developing parts of this naming scheme , but they
did so as part of freedesktop.org so that there is less confusion
about icon schemes between Gnome and KDE ( and other environments ) in
the future .
So , rather than just talk about Oxygen , I have some screenshots
to show the icons in action .
Below is a screenshot of Dolphin showing Oxygen icons , and a shot
of Konqueror ( from KDE 3.5.6 ) showing the same folder .
Many of
these mimetypes also have previews available for them , when previews
are enabled .
You 'll notice in the Dolphin shot that there are still a few old
icons sticking around , even though the Oxygen iconset includes
replacements to those icons .
One of the biggest changes that
happens are part of the Oxygen transition is that many icons got
renamed .
Old code may be referring to the old icon names , rather
than the newly corrected Oxygen names -- when the crystal SVG icons
are removed from kdelibs , it will become more apparent which names
are affected .
For those who like the old icons better , they will
also get renamed , and be offered as an icon - theme within the KDE
artwork package .
As the Oxygen Icons have now been made the default , you will be
seeing them in all future articles in the Road to KDE 4 series , and
should get a better appreciation of how complete this artwork is .
Of course some icons still have room for tweaking , which is easy
thanks to using SVG sources .
I 'm not providing the screenshots of
the whole iconset in this article as you can find them in websvn or by
building KDE 4 yourself .
The next snapshots of KDE 4 will of course include the new icons as they are now considered the default .
But , like I said , Oxygen is n't just about the icons .
There are a
lot of other places within KDE where the Oxygen artwork is popping
up .
Here is a shot of KDE 4's new logout dialog .
One of the biggest advantages to using Oxygen artwork in various
locations throughout KDE is that it is ( mostly ) resolution
independent .
Which means , certain applications can be made to scale
to any size you want , and it will still look good .
So , for
instance , if you are playing KBounce ( from KDE Games ) , and you want
it to be big or small , it just adjusts the size for you .
So while KDE 4 is not a true , resolution independent desktop , and
this is n't necessarily a goal for KDE at this time , some KDE
components do now operate on a resolution independent basis .
There is another two elements of Oxygen currently in development ,
that are not yet complete .
These are the Oxygen Widget Style , and
the Oxygen KWin Decoration .
These have not yet been made the
defaults for KDE 4 as they are not yet far enough along .
But owing
to the fact that it has not yet become the default for KDE , I'll
decline to show it off just yet .
Just bear in mind that the Oxygen
Icons and related artwork are just a few elements of the Oxygen
project .
The Oxygen team is making a lot of progress on the Style
and Windeco , but this whole project is an enormous amount of
work .
There are also other visual elements of KDE 4 underway that do
not directly involve the Oxygen team , but will work together with
them when required .
These are things like KWin 's composite branch ,
or the Plasma Workspace theming capabilities .
For those that are interested in helping KDE out through
artwork , you should visit # kde- artists on irc.kde.org and get in
contact with some of the artists there .
They are quite friendly ,
and take constructive feedback from artists and non-artists
alike .
Individual KDE projects are also looking for artists :
Recently ,
Carsten Niehaus of Kalzium put out a request
for some help producing some kid-friendly icons to represent the
elements of the periodic table in an optional kid-friendly layout .
Anyone up to the task should visit the #kalzium irc channel .
Also , the Amarok project has recently informed me that they are
in need of some artwork for their upcoming 1.4.6 release ( for KDE
3.5.x ) which does n't need to be Oxygen styled , as Oxygen is intended
for KDE 4 .
Join the #amarok irc channel if you 're interested , and
talk to ' markey ' .
Editorial aside : I 'm glad that so many people are showing
interest in KDE 4's development , but please try to provide
constructive feedback to help improve KDE 4 .
Many of the developers
read the comments on the dot and implement things that users request
if they are well - reasoned .
For example , Peter Penz implemented the
Tree View in Dolphin , and Rafael Fernández López made changes to the
Job Progress Manager based on your constructive feedback .
Your
feedback is very welcome , but as last week 's article has shown , when
the comments get out of hand , it becomes harder to sift through them
for the constructive ones .
On the flip side , that article
absolutely demolished the previous dot. kde.org comment records .
Hopefully we can break those records again one day as the interest
in KDE 4 grows .
Until next week ...
