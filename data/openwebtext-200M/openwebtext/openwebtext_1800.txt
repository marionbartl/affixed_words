In July , scientists at the University of Maryland announced the development of bioengineering techniques that could be used to mass - produce a new food for public consumption : meat that is grown in incubators .
The process works by taking stem cells from a biopsy of a live animal ( or a piece of flesh from a slaughtered animal ) and putting them in a three - dimensional growth medium -- a sort of scaffolding made of proteins .
Bathed in a nutritional mix of glucose , amino acids and minerals , the stem cells multiply and differentiate into muscle cells , which eventually form muscle fibers .
Those fibers are then harvested for a minced - meat product .
Scientists at NASA and at several Dutch universities have been developing the technology since 2001 , and in a few years ' time there may be a lab - grown meat ready to market as sausages or patties .
In 20 years , the scientists predict , they may be able to grow a whole beef or pork loin .
A tissue engineer at the Medical University of South Carolina has even proposed a countertop device similar to a bread maker that would produce meat overnight in your kitchen .
There are still several major hurdles to clear , like figuring out a way to get stem cells to proliferate cheaply enough that meat could be mass - produced .
But if in vitro meat becomes viable , the environmental and ethical consequences could be profound .
The thought of beef grown in the lab may turn your stomach , but in vitro meat would avoid many of the downsides of factory farming , most notably pollution : in the United States , livestock produce 1.4 billion tons of waste each year .
What 's more , once a meat - cell culture exists , it could function the way a yeast or yogurt culture does , so that meat growers would n't need to use a new animal for each set of starter cells -- and the meat industry would no longer be dependent on slaughtering animals .

One of things that came out of the Google Analyst briefing presentation was a project Google is working on called Lighthouse .
This is what we were able to glean :
With infinite storage , we can house all user files , including : emails , web history , pictures , bookmarks , etc and make it accessible from anywhere ( any device , any platform , etc ) .
We already have efforts in this direction in terms of GDrive , GDS , Lighthouse , but all of them face bandwidth and storage constraints today .
And :
Another important implication of this theme is that storing 100 % of a user ’s data makes each piece of data more valuable because it can be access across applications .
For example : a user ’s Orkut profile has more value when it ’s accessible from Gmail ( as addressbook ) , Lighthouse ( as access list ) , etc .
Richard McManus speculated that it might be a ” a next - generation file search solution that ‘ shines a light ’ inside documents on your desktop ” .
Shii asked : “ Could Lighthouse be a privacy - enabled bookmarks system , like Yahoo My Web 2 ? ”
Having thought about this for a couple of days , I think it ’s highly likely that Lighthouse is Google ’s Online File Management system .
Every file system needs a file management system to organise and set up a file retrieval system and GDrive will be no different .
In fact , the challenges that Google faces in building a file management system for an online drive are enormous .
It ’s also critical .
I ’ve mentioned before that I have been favouring Writely over Zoho Writer simply because I felt it had a superior file management system ( Zoho has improved their system lately but I still prefer Writely ) .
We ’re talking about a couple of dozen word processing files here , imagine how much complex and challenging it gets when you ’re talking about storing ALL of your files on an online drive and what ’s more making that your “ Golden Copy ” .
Problems have already been noted with Google Desktop Search ( GDS ) which breaks when you move files around on your local drive .
Google has an enormous amount of work to do in trying to replicate files with a user ’s local machine and that ’s even without tackling the issue of file sharing .
A key advantage of an online file system is the ease of being able to share documents for collaboration and what not , but that opens up a can full of worms in terms of replication issues , copyright issues , privacy issues .
( This is likely what Google is talking about in terms of Orkut profiles being used as access control lists in Lighthouse ) .
While the challenges are enormous , the rewards for making this all work are enormous .
If you control the online file management system , surely you also control what online application is used to manipulate a file when online .
If you click on an a Word file in your GDrive , ‘ Lighthouse ’ if this is what it is , will surely launch Writely , if you click on an email GMail will open it up , launch an image and the online version of Picasa kicks into action , etc , etc. Kent Newsome asked why Google would bother with Writely .
If you consider Writely in conjunction with my Lighthouse theory then you start to see how Google might successfully lock you into their ecosystem and therefore it ’s important that they can provide the whole picture .
This is looking even more monopolistic than Microsoft has ever been !
Google Lighthouse ( again , assuming I ’m right about it ) just might be the most important Google application of all .
( If you have n’t read my Google / Writely Online / Offline post , it might be worth reading as background as to where Google ’s general strategy could be heading )
Nick FitzGerald forwards me another animated GIF spam that takes the animation plus transparency trick I outlined in the blog post A spam image that slowly builds to reveal its message to a new level .
And it shows why spammers will work around OCR as fast as they can .
Here 's what you see in the spam image : Looks simple enough until you take a look at the GIF file that actually generated what you see .
It 's animated and it has three frames :
The first image is the GIF 's background and is displayed for 10ms then the second image is layered on top with a transparent background so that the two images merge together and the image the spammer wants you to see appears .
That image remains on screen for 100,000 ms ( or 1 minute 40 seconds ) .
After that the image is completely blanked out by the third frame .
My favourite touch is that it's not the entire image that 's transparent , not even the white background , but just those pixels necessary to make the black pixels underneath show through .
If you look carefully above you can see that some of pixels appear yellow ( which is the background color of this site ) indicating where the transparency is .
That is darn clever .

About the VB
About Jurgen Verstrepen
If Verstrepen does n’t stop with that fucking garbage in his columns , I will make sure no official will be his studio guest ever again .
We 've noticed that international and Belgian press described our project VB6015 as an extreme - right political propaganda broadcast .
This is absolutely not the case ; this information is false .
The talk radio show Zwartof Wit ( Black or White ) can be described as " more stimulating talk radio " and best of all compared with the US talk shows like Rush Limbaugh and others .
[…]
The name of the network was inspired by the nickname Jurgen Verstrepen had been using for years in the Flemish media : " Vlaams Bakkes " which means " Flemish Bigmouth " .
About the decision
Art. 34 . § 2 . Private radio broadcasts have to offer a variety of programs . [...]
Either as to content as in broadcasting schedule , there should be no discrimination whatsoever .
[ They mean you should n’t be Islamophobic ; you can tackle the Church , but not Islam ; your can tackle locals but not immigrants . ]
§ 3 . It is strictly forbidden for private radio stations to broadcast programs that jeopardize the public order , public decency , state security or that are insulting to people ’s beliefs or to a foreign state .
[ They mean you should n’t be Islamophobic ; you can tackle the Church , but not Islam ; your can tackle locals but not immigrants ; how can you show porn on radio ?
Does it involve moaning ? ] .
A private radio station cannot broadcast electoral propaganda .
[ Why not ?
Elections are essential to democracy .
And why is it their business ? ]
Art. 35 .
Private radio stations must be independent from any political party .
[ Why ?
Parties are essential to democracy .
And why is it their business ? ]
Art. 36 .
Content broadcasted has to obey current rules of journalism deontology and the impartiality and journalists ’ independency has to be guaranteed .
[ Why are all the state - controlled media then manned by lefties ? ]
Art. 37 .
Broadcasting equipment of private radios should be located in Flanders or Brussels .
[ How can they ever enforce that ?
It ’s clearly incompatible with the freedom to establish a business anywhere in the EU ] .

Mr. Verstrepen became quite popular with a Howard Stern - like weekly Sunday morning Talk Show ( in Dutch , ) simultaneously both on Radio and on TV .
In the show , he covered a wide range of controversial subject with uncensored audience telephone input .
What bothered leading officials and government parties most is that he did n’t back off raising sensitive issues like Muslim immigration , and inviting leaders of the right - wing Flemish independence and anti-immigration party ) as studio guests .
All other Belgian political parties consider the VB to be " racist " and have put a ) around it .
They refuse any cooperation or coalition with the VB , blocking it from the state - controlled media ( like the government - owned Radio and TV - channels VRT ) , and heavily and successfully pressuring private media to do so too .
As the situation became embarrassing because the VB kept winning every election and even ended up as the largest party in the last 2004 general elections , both on the Belgian and the Flemish level , - they had to resort to other measures . [.]
Near the end of 2004 , the VB was convicted in court for being a " racist " party , a trial that has raised some eyebrows here and there , as it was perceived by many as atrial and technically flawed .
Whatever , since the VB was now a , it quickly dissolved itself , and as a Phoenix it formed a " new " party with a different name ( Vlaams Belang ) , and with some minor changes in its political program , but with still the same leaders and the same elected parliamentarians .
The vaudeville goes on , by the way , since the new VB faces a trial once more , simply because one its leaders said in an interview with an American - Jewish magazine to be " " .
The Belgian crown prince Philippe also added to the turmoil earlier this year , by declaring that he would fight the VB because they " " , - thereby violating the neutral political position of the king as required by the Belgian constitution .
Mr. Verstrepen apparently did n’t want to give in to pressures from the government ( and especially from the Socialist parties in the coalition ) to observe some auto - censorship in his Zwartof Wit show .
But his commercial hostsanddiscontinued the show for " " , while no other channel wanted to host the show either .
It was the second time that Verstrepen had to cancel his show .
The first time it was hosted onandbut Belgian ’s prime minister , was .
Verstrepen had to stop it in 2001 .
In an interview with the Dutch newspaperon November 16 , 2002 , Verstrepen told that he was under intense pressure from circles around Verhofstadt who should have said ( in Dutch , ) : ( with thanks to lvb. net for the quote ) .
In the mean time , the popular and flamboyant media figure and rebel Verstrepen was elected as Flemish parliamentarian in the June 2004 general elections as an " independent " candidate for the VB , on the theme of .
He subsequently tried to revive his Radio Show ason the short waves either analog or in DRM ( ) , and broadcasting from outside the Belgian territory .
But his providers in the UK and in Germany were allegedly pressured not to do so .
In his weblog , Verstrepen stated on May 31 , 2005 : Apart from political pressures , the initiative also faced some technical difficulties , as it went from 6.015 MHz over 13.680 MHz to 15.660 MHz .
Moreover , not everybody can listen to DRM yet .
The program was also broadcasted on the , as a podcast , both streaming and as a MP3 file .
Currently , this is the most popular way to listen to the program , as the ether broadcast seems to be discontinued .
But it ’s unclear , on the VB - site " ether " is still mentioned , but their MP3 archive does n’t work either .
Flanders ’s media regulation stipulates that ( political ) broadcasts are subject to a license when transmitted through the ether .
If through the Internet , the VCM must be notified by registered mail .
Some excerpts ( translated into English ) : Verstrepen apparently did n’t either ask for a license nor register his podcasts with the VCM .
Let ’s not focus on the ether - broadcasts , since it is perfectly reasonable that the limited ether bandwidth should be regulated and assigned by the authorities .
Let ’s focus on the Internet podcast instead .
In a preliminary inquiry by the VCM about his station VB6015 , Verstrepen objected that the servers he is " transmitting " from are located abroad , and that the content of his program is targeted to Flemish .
The VCM discarded these arguments in its decision , claiming that the content of the VB6015 program apparently is targeted mostly to Flemish in Flanders itself , and that the programs were actually recorded on Flemish territory by a Media Company called " BCC&V " with its seat on Flanders ' territory .
They considered the actual location of the transmitting servers as a mere technicality .
Furthermore , Radio Stations owned by political parties are outlawed by the Flemish Media regulation .
Verstrepen claims that his station offers a broad coverage of subjects like political gossip , politics , media events , music and trivia about all flavors in society , - is indeed slightly .
Most of the politicians interviewed belong to the VB or at least appear to be very sympathetic towards it .
Political issues selected mostly represent VB issues .
VB1602 is mirrored on the VB - site and apparently the VB supports it .
On the other hand , Verstrepen claims his Station is independent and personal .
He has a point , is likely to be in tune with Christian - Democrat parties too .
And anyways , the friendly link between VB6502 and the VB is really irrelevant as the state - owned and state - sponsored media like the VRT are mostly populated by left - wing journalists and have an official policy of ignoring the VB .
VB1602 just fills a gap in the political media spectrum .
Strictly spoken , the VCM might have a point , but one can wonder if the ban on political Radio Stations is fundamentally not against , and if so , one can easily claim a station is voicing concerns of a , not of aas such .
That ’s how all the other parties do it by the way , quite hypocritically .
Verstrepen has been negligent and reckless not registering his Station .
If the VCM had denied his request , he would have had a much more validcase .
He also could have registered his Media Company BCC&V abroad .
That ’s what the Isle of Man postboxes are for .
Concerning the Internet podcasts , his reasoning could have been that a mandatory preliminary registration is unconstitutional , since the Belgian constitution guarantees Free Press and forbids preemptive censorship or state control of the Press .
It ’s quite clear that the Establishment and the Flemish media Commissars are playing games with technicalities and use a very wide definition of the concept " broadcast " .
What they actually want to do , of course , is to stifle Verstrepen ’s " free radio " and the voice of the " Vlaams Belang " , just because its content is against the convictions of theruling Socialists and Social ( ist ) - " Liberals " .
[ in the Flemish sense are equivalent within the American sense ; in fact the Flemish Liberals gradually evolved into a weak species of Collectivists over the years . ]
For , the decision ( which is not a ruling yet ) , has alarming consequences to be worried about .
If a podcast on the Internet is considered to be a , what about a weblog then ?
Especially when the weblog carries some sound too ?
Since blogged podcasts are sprouting all over , they might be considered to be just a sound - version of a weblog .
None of these podcasts / weblogs has been under scrutiny by the VCM yet .
Verstrepen was singled out , just because of his popularity and because of his connection with anparty .
But where is the guarantee thatorweblogs wo n’t take the heath soon too , if the Internet is not a form of Press but a form of Broadcast ?
Do the Flemish commissars realize they can only succeed then by imposing away of controlling the Internet ?
Luckily , is hosted on an American server , its content is posted from Asia , and the audience targeted arethe inhabitants of the outer moons of Uranus .
Verstrepen announced 2 days ago on his weblog that he will object the VCM decision , that he will file a complaint against Prime Minister ’s Verhofstadt ’s personal podcast on his site , the Flemish and Belgian Federal Parliament ’s podcasts , - and that he willpay the fine and willpodcasting .
As every citizen can report a podcast to the VCM , of which heit might not have been registered , - Verstrepen urges on his weblog today to file complaints againstpodcasts of politicians and government institutions tothe VCM .

Some of the same problems plagued this flight , panellists say
Their views are included in a report by the Return to Flight task group , overseeing how Nasa responds to recommendations following Columbia .
They said leadership shortfalls made the shuttle effort costlier , longer and more complex than it needed to be .
Space shuttle Discovery launched successfully from Florida on 26 July .
The task group 's final report was released on Wednesday .
The views of the more critical seven panellists are individual observations only .
Nasa 's administrator Michael Griffin requested that all individual comments , including the 20 - page critique from the seven panel members , be included in the official task force report .
It was the first flight since shuttle Columbia broke up over the US in 2003 , killing seven astronauts .
Failed recommendations
" We expected that Nasa leadership would set high standards for post - Columbia work ... we were , overall , disappointed , " the panellists wrote in the report .
" It is difficult to be objective based on hindsight , but it appears to us that lessons that should have been learned have not been . "
The seven critics included a former shuttle astronaut , former undersecretary of the Navy , a former congressional budget office director , former moon rocket engineer , a retired nuclear engineer and two university professors .
They were part of the 26 - member Return to Flight task group appointed to evaluate how the US space agency meets the recommendations by the Columbia Accident Investigation Board ( Caib ) .
The task group concluded in an advance summary in late June - just a month before Discovery 's launch - that Nasa had failed to satisfy three of the 15 return to flight recommendations .
Those three failed recommendations were : an inability to prevent dangerous pieces of foam and ice from breaking off the fuel tank during launch ; no capability to fix damage to the shuttle in orbit ; and a failure to make the shuttle less vulnerable to debris strikes .
But during launch on 26 July , a 1lb ( 450g ) chunk of foam debris peeled away from the external fuel tank , though , fortunately , the foam did not hit Discovery .
Nevertheless , Nasa has since grounded the entire shuttle fleet until the problem has been fixed .
A new direction
The Nintendo Wii represents a bold new direction for the company , one that came as somewhat of a surprise .
The integration of a motion - sensitive controller combined with the decision to go with a more modest technological improvement in processing power and graphics were both risky decisions , and the jury is still out on how successful these gambles will play out .
Recently , Nintendo released an interview from with some key executives and engineers at Nintendo .
The topic of discussion was the reasoning behind the company 's design decisions with the Wii , and what benefits they expected to receive from these decisions that would give them an advantage over their competitors .
The interview featured Iwata Satoru , Nintendo's president and CEO ; Takeda Genyo , the head of development ; and engineers Takamoto Jouji , Ashida Kenichiro , and Shiota Kou from the company 's various design departments .
All of them seemed excited and cautiously optimistic about the Wii's chances in the market , and were more than happy to discuss how they came to the decisions about the console .
Lessons from the GameCube
Nintendo dominated the market with their original NES console , but every generation since then has seen them not only grabbing a lower percentage of overall sales , but selling fewer consoles than they had in the previous generation .
While some competitors , such as Sega , have exited the hardware business , the arrival of Sony and Microsoft has turned what was traditionally a two - way race to a much more difficult three - way competition .
On the flip side , Nintendo has been doing extremely well in the portable console market , with its GameBoy series dominating the landscape .
Even the arrival of Sony's PSP has n't dented Nintendo 's dominance in this arena : while the PSP and DS battle it out for first place , the lower - powered GameBoy Advance continues to rake in the cash .
Data source : Nintendo
During this time , Nintendo has been observing something that many industry analysts have been warning about : the runaway costs of video game development .
As each new console generation has been released , the amount of time and money required to generate more detailed content for new games has been rising exponentially .
Takeda explained the predicament that developers were finding themselves in :
" It was around a year after we started the development of the Wii , " he recalled .
" When talking with our development partners , I noticed that there is no end to the wants a person can have when they keep thinking of making things better .
It is n't like a person who gained one then reaches for two , and then for three .
Its more like five , ten , 30 , then 100 and onwards .
These wishes exponentially increase .
If we simply follow these , we 'd end up with a disaster . "
Data sources : Business Week ; www.eurogamer.net; www.buzzcut.com; www.erasmatazz.com
It was this potential disaster that Takeda wanted to avoid .
Engineer Shiota realized that simply going with " cutting - edge technology in a normal way " would lead to " higher performance and more glitz . "
This race for performance can be tracked by the increasing power of the central processing unit .
Chips such as the triple - core Xenon in the Xbox 360 and the Cell in the PlayStation 3 use much more power than their predecessors in order to deliver next - gen performance .
" More glitz " is always welcome in any new generation , but at some point one runs into laws of diminishing returns .
Shiota wondered if advances in technology could be used in a different way .
The Wii was designed to take processor technology improvements and use them to make the unit run with less heat , by making the chips smaller .
This enabled features that other consoles could n't duplicate , such as the ability to leave the console powered on all the time ( we 'll return to this later ) .
Shiota admitted that this was a risky decision .
" Diverging from the road map takes a fair amount of courage , " he said , " especially when we did n't have a clear image of what we were going to do with this hardware . "
However , once he saw the power level reduction ( from one - third to as little as one - fourth that of current hardware ) he was very excited .
Instead of competing on " how many more times the CPU is going to be faster , how much more memory is going to be on the machine , and how many more polygons can be rendered " he saw Nintendo as being able to do something different and unique .
Of course , performance was still an issue .
Takeda pointed out that increasing the CPU performance was still a goal , and the team was aiming at " high performance , low power " rather than looking for economy on both sides .
The Wii's CPU , while retaining compatibility with the GameCube 's G3 - inspired Gekko chip , will have additional features and performance that developers will be able to take advantage of .
In addition , of course , there is the motion - sensitive controller technology , which adds a new dimension to game play .

It is a conventional wisdom and as far I know , unlike some others not a malicious one that the native civilizations of the Americas had an oral tradition rather then a written one .
It looks as though the Inca with the help of Gary Urton and Carrie J. Brezine of Harvard University may prove that history mistaken .
Unraveling an Incan mystery
WASHINGTON – The Incas ’ curious knotted strings called khipu were probably used by bosses and accountants to keep track of taxes and tributes and carried both words and numerical information , two experts said yesterday .
Many of these strings have turned out to be a type of accounting system , but interpreting them has been complex .
The Inca have long been described as an advanced civilization excepting that they frustrated anthropologists who thought of writing as the benchmark for complexity .
The Inca did have everything else – a monetary system , political institutions , mathematics , art and architecture .
Urton and his team of researchers have taken their theories about khipu a step further ( see the January 2007 print edition of Wired ) .
They think the knots ( photo at link ) are clearly more then simple bookkeeping and contain a complex language that is akin to a three - dimensional binary code .
As Wired points out this could be the most important discovery in language and writing since the deciphering of ancient hieroglyphics .
The right - wing bloggers obsession about denying the level of civil strife in Iraq reminds me of Holocaust deniers .

The denial of inconvenient truths are and have always been a full time occupation of the unAmerican Right , Tracing “ Jamil Hussein ’s ” footsteps and ignoring anti-blog hatred .
By Michelle Malkin · December 20 , 2006 03:17 PM
This is not just one story .
It is at least 61 .
And all of these .
And this big one .
It is not about conservative bloggers ignoring the bona fide , grim realities on the ground .
It is about the credibility , veracity , trustworthiness , and accountability of the world ’s “ essential global news network ” –more important than ever in a time of war .
Some notes on Malkin ’s post and the genuflecting echo across the blogs of wing - nuttia : Malkin is still calling Jamail Hussein Jamil Hussein .
You ca n’t confirm sources if you ca n’t spell the name correctly .
I do n’t read Makin ’s blog very often , but it is amazing how often she uses titles to her posts that portray her as some poor beleaguered victim while at the same time using wild speculation and bizarre suppositions to drag her opponents of the moment through the mud .
The names game can get confusing , but let ’s introduce or rather reintroduce a name into the proceedings – Imad al - Hasimi – New Savage Twist to Violence in Baghdad
Imad al - Hasimi , a Sunni elder in Hurriyah , confirmed Hussein ’s account .
He told Al - Arabiya television he saw people who were soaked in kerosene , then set afire , burning before his eyes .
While I have read this name once at Hotair it generally goes unmentioned or the importance of it has not taken root in the brains of the Iraq Civil War - Kerosene Deniers .
No one on the right has questioned his existence or his account of events .
I do n’t have time to read every wing - nut blog , but you would think that the major rightie blogs , when not regurgitating Malkin ’s rhetoric would at least bother to discredit him too , not to mention three other witnesses .
Then there is the Right ’s twisted logic : if the Kerosene story is not 100 % pure without even a few mitigating details here or there then every report ( 61 ? ) filed by AP in Iraq is false .
Can we hold Michelle Malkin , Power Line , Wizbang , Confederate Yankee , Flopping Aces , Newsbusters and an assortment of the usual conservative suspects to that same standard ?
If we find one falsehood on their blogs or their books in Malkin ’s case , then we have licence to assume that everything they have written is spurious .
The Associated Press lost Iraq ? by Eric Boehlert
Warbloggers are obsessed with all things AP , or the “ Associated ( with terrorists ) Press , ” as Malkin subtly calls it .
Which brings us back to news of Lutfallah ’s death and the odd silence that emanated from the warblogs — and by odd , I mean , wildly hypocritical , because the silence sprang from the fact that the circumstances of Lutfallah ’s murder did n’t fit the warbloggers ’ ideological script .
Namely , that Lutfallah was executed by insurgents , which completely undermined the warbloggers ’ theory that the AP enjoys close ties to terrorists .
According to warblogger logic , the insurgents should have made sure Lutfallah got the best film of the gun fight with police ; in fact , insurgents might have even tipped him off that a battle was going to take place .
That ’s how the drill is supposed to work .
Yet insurgents in Mosul , after seeing the AP cameraman filming and then identifying him , approached the father of two and emptied five bullets into his body , took his equipment , cell phone , and press ID .
They shot him like a dog in the street .
( emphasis mine )
Eric Boehlert goes on to highlight 6 deaths of the 129 journalists and associates that have been killed by insurgents in a country that is not in a civil war .
Unfortunately , given her widely read blog and her platform as a Fox News analyst , Malkin has influenced a new generation of right - wing press critics , who sloppily draw all sorts of dark and dishonest conclusions about the press .
The phenomenon has been rampant during the Hussein controversy .
Here ’s one small example .
Warblogger Curt at Flopping
Aces raised doubts about a December 12 AP dispatch , which reported that 66 Iraqis had been killed by an insurgency car bomb in downtown Baghdad .
The number of dead was probably inflated , according to Curt at Flopping Aces , given the “ prior reporting history by the AP . ”
Specifically , the warblogger questioned the report because it was written by the two AP journalists who had previously quoted Jamil Hussein , the “ fake policeman , ” which meant “ anything printed by these two ” was possible fiction .
[ Emphasis added . ]
Slight problem : Central Command quickly confirmed that a car bomb on December 12 did kill 66 people in Baghdad , which matched what AP had reported .
So much for that round of media gotcha .
So playing by right - wing rules , rules that Curt and Malkin have issued , everything that Flopping Aces has written is suspect and is not to be taken as an honest attempt at citizen journalism , but pure Pravda - like propaganda .
When the Republican bloggers get finished with AP they can start on UPI , Eye on Iraq : The other Iraq report
The new report , entitled ‘ Iraq`s Sectarian and Ethnic Violence and Evolving Insurgency : Developments through mid-December 2006 ’ is by Anthony H. Cordesman , who holds the Arleigh A. Burke chair in strategy at the center for Strategic and International Studies , a Washington think tank .
The 92 - page report was released to none of the media hoopla and obsession that greeted the Iraq Study Group report chaired by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and former Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton .
But it is even more frank and harsh in its assessments of the current chaos in Iraq than the ISG document .
The CSIS report acknowledged what we predicted and then saw confirmed in the fall : that the ill - fated U.S. - led Operation Together Forward II in Baghdad had only made ‘ slow progress in clearing the volatile neighborhoods , and the initiative lacked sufficient forces to maintain peace in cleared areas ’
‘ Baghdad was the center of the sectarian conflict , but violence spread to surrounding towns — particularly Baquba , Balad , and Amara — as the civil war threatened to engulf the entire country , ’ the report said .
Cordesman noted that the United Nations had concluded that by mid-December , sectarian violence was killing 120 Iraqis a day .
Back in the spring , we warned that the escalating violence by that point was on schedule to kill more than 30,000 people a year in Iraq . , even if things did not get any worse .
Cordesman has now confirmed things have gotten worse than that .
The U.N. figures he cites mean that even if the current levels of violence in Iraq do not deteriorate further ( in fact they show every sign of doing so ) 43,800 people will die next year there at the current rates of carnage .
( emphasis mine )
“ It was then that I began to look into the seams of your doctrine .
I wanted only to pick at a single knot ; but when I had got that undone , the whole thing raveled out .
And then I understood that it was all machine - sewn . ” – Henrik Ibsen
Etched nanostructured rings around an LED can make it more than seven times brighter .
The novel technique developed at NIST may have applications in areas such as in biomedical imaging where LED brightness is crucial .
Credit : NIST
Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology have made semiconductor light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) more than seven times brighter by etching nanoscale grooves in a surrounding cavity to guide scattered light in one direction .
The novel nanostructure , which may have applications in areas such as in biomedical imaging where LED brightness is crucial , is described in the July 17 issue of Applied Physics Letters .
Semiconductor LEDs are used increasingly in displays and many other applications , in part because they can efficiently produce light across a broad spectrum , from near - infrared to the ultraviolet .
However , they typically emit only about two percent of the light in the desired direction : perpendicular to the diode surface .
Far more light skims uselessly below the surface of the LED , because of the extreme mismatch in refraction between air and the semiconductor .
The NIST nanostructured cavity boosts useful LED emission to about 41 percent and may be cheaper and more effective for some applications than conventional post - processing LED shaping and packaging methods that attempt to redirect light .
The NIST team fabricated their own infrared LEDs consisting of gallium arsenide packed with " quantum dots " of assorted sizes made of indium gallium arsenide .
Quantum dots are nanoscale semiconductor particles that efficiently emit light at a color determined by the exact size of the particle .
The LEDs were backed with an alumina mirror to reflect the light emitted backwards .
The periphery of each LED was turned into a cavity etched with circular grooves , in which the light reflects and interferes with itself in an optimal geometry .
The researchers experimented with different numbers and dimensions of grooves .
The brightest output was attained with 10 grooves , each about 240 nanometers ( nm ) wide and 150 nm deep , and spaced 40 nm apart .
The team spent several years developing the design principles and perfecting the manufacturing technique .
The principles of the method are transferable to other LED materials and emission wavelengths , as well as other processing techniques , such as commercial photolithography , according to lead author Mark Su .

What to Watch ( 6/18 to 6/24 )

Do you an idea for a column or just something to say ?

The existence of the American Teen Drama series is something that most teenagers today take for granted .
Afterall , on any given night , a kid can turn on the TV and find some show set in a high school or college that involves teenagers and young - adults battling a myriad of dramatic issues .
This was not always the case though .
Only in the last twenty years or so have networks begun to recognize the huge teen demographic in this country that are craving TV shows they can relate to .
Aaron Spelling ’s ‘ Beverly Hills , 90210 ’ was one of the first truly successful teen drama series .
After ‘ 90210 ’ aired , an onslaught of teen drama shows followed in its wake , hoping for the same success .
It would be an understatement to say that while ' 90210 ' may have paved the way for future high - schooly type shows , it was by no means , the best of it 's genre .
Do n't get me wrong , I 'm a huge fan of ' 90210 '
( One of my guiltiest pleasures is the collection of ' 90210 ' reruns on my Tivo ) but show 's like ' Buffy The Vampire Slayer ' and ' Veronica Mars ' outstrip ' 90210 ' by miles .
And while shows like ' The OC ' carry the torch for one - dimensional teen drama shows like ' 90210 ' , writers such as Joss Whedon ( ' Buffy ' ) and Rob Thomas ( ' Veronica Mars ' ) are catering to the teens and young adults who do n't mind thinking and feeling while watching TV .
So here 's my breakdown of some of the more popular teen dramas .
( 1990 - 2000 ) - In its 10 - year run , ' 90210 ' captured an audience ranging from about 13 to 25 .
It started out centering on a family from Minnesota who moved to Beverly Hills and attempted to adjust to the ritzy LA lifestyle .
In their high school years , twins Brenda and Brandon Walsh and their gang of over - privileged pals battled the usual issues ( sex , mild drug abuse , cheating on exams , etc ) but by the end of the series the group 's issues had expanded greatly .
In fact , if you added up all of the crazy things that have happened to the ' 90210 ' friends , you 'd realize just how ridiculous it all was .
Sure there has to be an element of suspension of disbelief but the writers of ' 90210 ' took the show to the level of soap - opera - fakeness .
If the ' 90210 ' gang could make a list of all of their misfortunes , it would include : rape , murder , unplanned pregnancy , alcohol abuse , dozens of infidelities ( many of which included members of their tight group of friends ) , drug abuse , gambling addiction , theft , wrongful accusations and abusive boyfriends among other things .
In essence , the show relied on dramatic circumstances to keep viewers interested .
While that 's all fine and good because afterall , this is a teen - drama series , other shows that came later proved it was n't necessary to over - dramatize the lives of regular people in order to produce a watchable show .
' Party of Five ' was not one of these exceptions .
( 1994 - 2000 ) - Like ' 90210 ' , ' Party of Five ' was supposed to center around an " average " American family , however , the Salingers were by no means , average .
After losing their parents in a car accident , the Salingers have to raise themselves .
Charlie ( the oldest of the siblings ) as the reluctant father - figure , Bailey , Julia , Claudia and Owen ( the baby ) attempt to make it on their own so they wont get split up .
The premise of the show was good and lasted about half a season before the real drama set in .
Writers apparently ran out of normal , realistic circumstances to put the Salingers through and decided to throw the not - so - typical problems into the mix .
Alcoholism , abuse and date rape , among other things became part of the daily Salinger life .
Once I realized nothing good ever happened to the Salingers , I stopped watching .
I do n't mind a bit of drama but who wants to watch a show where the characters are always miserable ?
' Dawson ’s Creek ' fans , maybe . ( 1994 - 1995 ) - ' My So Called Life ' was a short - lived drama series that managed to capture the truth of a generation .
If I wanted to show my kids what it was like to be a teenager in " my day " , I would hand them the DVD set of ' My So Called Life ' .
Angela Chase ( played by Claire Danes ) was just your average American teenager .
Going through the usual teen identity crisis , she abandons her childhood friends in favor of the outcast - crowd .
The show essentially centers on Angela , her old friends , her new friends and her family , all of which are intertwined .
In the eyes of many teens that watched the show , she was a real girl .
The show 's demise was said to be a combination of poor ratings and Claire Danes ' desire to pursue a film career .
It ended prematurely , leaving viewers to wonder if Angela would end up with dreamy but somewhat mentally vacant Jordan Catalano ( Mmmm Jared Leto ) or nerdy but sweet Brian Krakow ?
Chances are if the show continued , she would n't have ended up with either of them .
In the end , the show stayed as true to real - life as it got and how often does high school romance last , anyway ?
Either way , viewers were devastated when the show was cancelled .
MTV reran the episodes on and off for a year or two afterwards and die - hard fans managed to get the show distributed on DVD for a brief time .
I like to think ' My So Called Life ' was a bit to ahead of its time in terms of writing .
( 1997-2003 ) - I just heard all the Whedon - haters sigh .
Hear me out , though !
I myself was anti-Buffy until very recently !' Buffy ' was a phenomenal show that I regret having missed the boat on .
In fact , I did n’t watch the series until two years after the final season aired .
It was one of those shows that annoyed me even though I 'd never caught more than a few minutes of it .
It was n't until after I watched the series that I realized it was / is the fandom surrounding the show and not the series itself , which tends to irritate non -' Buffy ' fans .
Joss
Whedon put the ' Buffy ' series together a year or two after the film version of ' Buffy the Vampire Slayer ' came out .
The show was nothing like the movie and perhaps that was what drew some viewers in and drove other viewers away .
Set in the fictional town of Sunnydale , California , ' Buffy ' is the " chosen one " .
There 's one Slayer in every generation and Buffy 's it .
She and her mother move to Sunnydale , which Buffy quickly learns is set on the mouth of hell .
Sunnydale being all hell - mouthy means its basically a magnet for demons .
As fate would have it , Buffy shows up in time to repeatedly ward off the forces of evil while maintaining a decent GPA .
Demons aside , ' Buffy ' was one of the best teen drama series in television history .
Definitely in the top three .
Joss Whedon managed to capture the minds and hearts of viewers with characters who are not only good looking ( a necessary factor in any successful teen - drama show ) but also smart , funny and emotionally realistic .
It could be said that ' Buffy ' was one of the first teen drama shows that recognized the ability of teen and young - adult viewers ' to think and watch tv at the same time .
The formula for the show defied the usual " OMG !
Bailey 's an alcoholic !
Dylan cheated on Brenda ! " junk that other teen shows force - fed their viewers .
Instead of the melodramatic ' 90210 ' route , Whedon addressed the hardships of adolescence indirectly through the supernatural stuff .
In that way he was able to make a quality teen / young - adult drama series that did n’t recycle storylines from other shows .
Each season had the overall " Big Bad " that Buffy and her " scoobies " had to battle but there were also many stand - alone episodes .
It 's in these episodes ( usually when there 's a new demon in town who wont make it to the end of the episode ) that the characters in the show are developed .
Whedon 's characters are multi-dimensional .
Not only do they have realistic attributes ( including flaws ! ) but they also have memories .
When I say memories , I mean they actually remember things that happened in previous seasons and reference them from time to time .
Unlike shows like ' 90210 ' where its ok to date your friend because chances are , one year later it will be as though the relationship never existed , ' Buffy ' characters are actually affected by their interactions for more than just a few episodes .
It 's almost as though Whedon made a list of all the teen - drama clichés and said " How can I make a show that does n't have any of this and maybe even on occasion , pokes fun at these clichés " .
' Buffy ' raised the bar when it comes to drama in a TV series and not just among teens and young adults .
As a 28 - year - old , I can honestly say that few shows ( adult and young adult alike ) measure up to the quality of writing in the ' Buffy ' series .
( 1999 - 2000 ) - Another teen series that was squashed well before its time was ' Freaks and Geeks ' .
Set in the early 80s , this show would technically be defined as a " dramedy " because though it was quite a dramatic series , there was definitely an element of humor mixed in .
‘ Freaks and Geeks ’ centered on Lindsey Weir and her younger brother .
While Lindsey attempts to abandon her group of mathlete - band - geek friends in favor of the grungier crowd ( you know , the ones who barely go to class and can often be found smoking under the bleachers ) , her younger brother Sam struggles with the realization that he is in fact , a geek .
Like any significantly dorky kid in the 80s , Sam and his friends spend their time playing D&D , returning to the theaters repeatedly to watchfor the billionth time and of course , getting their butts kicked at Dodgeball .
While Sam is busy getting pantsed , Lindsey wants desperately to shed her goody - goody reputation and manages to gain the friendship of some of the " freaks " in the school .
Once in with them , she finds that the grass really is always greener on the other side of the cafeteria .
The show got cancelled right around the time when it seemed Lindsey was finding a balance between who she was and who she thought she wanted to be .
Like ' My So Called Life ' , viewers felt they could relate to the Weirs and the other characters in the show ( both the freaks and the geeks ) .
The show did n't last to the end of its first season but was re-aired on Fox Family after its cancellation .
The humor of the show centered mainly on the 80's - ness .
Common references to 80's pop-culture were made throughout the series , which made the show all the more enjoyable .
I blame the failure of the show on NBC for moving it around too much .
The show 's inability to anchor itself to a timeslot no doubt affected its ratings .
Afterall , it was aired in the pre-Tivo years .
How can we watch a show when we do n’t know when its going to be on ?
What a waste .
Buy the DVD set .
You wont be disappointed .( 2004 - present ) - Like ' Buffy ' , I was late in the game with ' Veronica Mars ' .
Its on UPN and as I barely watch that channel , it never occurred to me to give this show a chance .
Season 2 finished up this year and after hearing that the writing was comparable to ' Buffy ' , I decided to give it a chance .
I netflixed the first disc of Season 1 and after four episodes , I bought the season on DVD .
I 'd seen enough in the first four episodes of the show to know that this was one of those rare quality teen - drama shows that comes around once every five years or so .
I was not about to miss the boat this time around .
Veronica
Mars is a high school student whose father is a private detective .
As the apple to her father 's tree , Veronica takes after her old man by moonlighting as a private detective .
In season one , we 're introduced to the cute and perky Veronica , a high school student who , after the death of her best friend Lily , has been cast out of the " cool crowd " ( The ' 09ers ) .
Along with doing side - job detective work for her fellow classmates , she does her best to find out who really killed her best friend .
What makes ' Veronica Mars ' one of the best series on TV today ?
Good writing , plain and simple .
While the show 's reality definitely leans towards the make - believe existence in which many teen - drama shows reside ( by season 2 , four of the main characters were living on their own without parental supervision despite the fact that they 're all still in high school ) , the characters in ' VM ' are well developed and more human than most of the plastic characters you see in teen dramas .
Their behavior has a reason as well as a purpose .
Throughout the first two seasons , getting to understand what motivates the characters has been part of what draws viewers back .
The hook of ' VM ' is the detective work .
A common theme between the first two seasons is the big mystery .
In season one it was " Who Killed Lily ? " and in season two it was " Who caused the bus to crash ? " .
But it ’s the little mysteries that keep ' VM ' fresh .
Whether she 's finding a lost dog or proving a friend 's innocence , Veronica is almost always willing and able to take on a new mystery .
She 's loyal and well intentioned ( unless you get on her bad side , in which case , watch out ! ) .
Veronica 's personal relationships with her father , her friends and boyfriends ( especially the on - again / off - again relationship with Logan ) have definitely played a part in the growing number of viewers ( mostly teens and young adults ) who are addicted to the show .
Again , I attribute this to a combination of good writing and good chemistry among the actors .
Never once in the 10 years that ' 90210 ' was I ever so caught up in the relationships of the characters the way I am with the ones in ' Veronica Mars ' .
Granted these teenagers barely act like real teenagers but the intensity of their relationships and the way they 're portrayed on screen have put the show very high up on my list of best tv shows ever ( I 'll write it in pencil though , as the show is only in onto its third season ) .
The show can deliver a simple moment like two characters having their first kiss , in such a way that viewers will find themselves holding their breaths through the scene and then clawing for their DVR remote to roll it back and see it again ( ok maybe I 'm just speaking for myself here but there you are ) .
The right lighting , the right music , well written lines ( thank you Rob Thomas ! ) and phenomenal acting all contribute to the success of these moments and its these moments that make the show as good as it is .
In this way , ' Veronica Mars ' makes shows like ' 90210 ' look like cheesy teen soap operas with corny story lines and absolutely no suspense or plot - momentum .
Then again , that is pretty much what ' 90210 ' was .
Much like ' Buffy ' , ' Veronica Mars ' seems to have developed a pretty intense fan base .
When UPN and WB were deliberating over which shows to keep and which shows to dump once the networks officially merged into the CW Network , fans launched internet campaigns to make sure season 3 of Veronica Mars would happen .
Some fans even went so far as to have a banner flown over CW headquarters just to make sure execs knew the show was wanted .
Their voices were heard and the show is set to air on the CW Network this fall .
So there you have it .
I know there are a number of other teen - drama shows out there that went unmentioned ( ' Popular ' , ' Felicity ' , ' Degrassi High ' etc ) but it was my intention to touch on the ones that I think had the biggest impact on the genre ( for better or for worse ) or served as the best example of its kind .
Many people look down their noses at this type of show but I consider my tastes in television programs to be pretty eclectic .
Teen Dramas seem to be evolving from what they once were ( soapy fluff ) and finally giving teenagers and young adults a genre they can latch onto and realistic characters that they can idolize or demonize to their liking .
While there will always be ‘ OC ’ type shows out there catering to the future soap - opera addicts of America , its comforting to know that shows like ‘ Buffy ’ and ‘ Veronica Mars ’ are raising the standard for teen drama series ’.- ( rerun ) - ‘ The Family Guy ’ is mostly guy - humor but each episode is usually jam - packed with random pop-culture references which means laughter for the whole family .
Though its animated , like the ‘ Simpsons ’ and ‘ South Park ’ , ‘ Family Guy ’ does tend to have adult and young - adult oriented storylines . - ( rerun ) – I ’ll be honest , I have n’t actually seen this show yet but the commercials in which they do a spoof of the opening of ‘ Friends ’
( The couch and the splashing around in the fountain ) makes me laugh .
New episodes of this sitcom will air on FX later in the month , but in the meantime , why not try out a rerun ?
The show takes place in Philly ( duh ) and centers on 4 friends who run a bar .
Hmmm … sounds like the perfect setup for a sitcom .
Cheers , everyone !- ( New ! ) –
If you have HBO and you are n’t watching ‘ Entourage ’ , you ’re seriously missing one of the best 30 minutes the channel has to offer each week .
The third season started last week so it ’s not too late to get caught up !
In this week ’s episode , Vince ’s agent , Ari and manager , Eric worry that the rolling blackouts in LA will affect the opening weekend box - office sales of Vince ’s new movie– ( rerun ) – And they said the sitcom was dead ?!
‘ HIMYM ’ ( as I like to call it ) is one of the best sitcoms on TV right now .
Granted , that ’s not saying much but if you ’re in desperate need of a break from trashy reality shows or crime investigation dramas , ‘ HIMYM ’ is the way to go !
The basic premise is that a bunch of 20 - somethings try to figure out how to be grown ups .
Watch it if only for the hilarious Neil Patrick Harris ( best known for playing the title character in ‘ Doogie Howser , MD ’ ) . is the episode when Ted and Marshall use their decorative swords to battle it out to decide who will get the apartment after Lily and Marshall get married .
Of course , someone ended up making friends with the pointy end of one of the swords but I wont say who !- ( rerun ) -
One of the great things about the CSI shows is that you do n’t have to tune in every week in order to be able to watch an episode now and then .
In this episode , detectives are trying to find a man who shot up a bunch of people at a day spa then began breaking into the victim ’s homes .
And to think , getting a facial and a mani - pedi is supposed to be relaxing .- ( rerun ) – I never get tired of ‘ House ’ .
In this episode , a college senior binge - drinks himself into a shocking overdose and when I say shocking , I mean that literally .
He ends up as Dr. House ’s patient because he has seizures that literally cause electric shocks to course through his body .
As usual , House and his band of good - looking brainiac doctors have to figure out what ’s wrong with this kid before he fries to death .- ( rerun ) –
Oh how I adore this show ( see the above essay ) !
In this episode , Veronica tries to track down Abel Koontz ’s daughter because he ’s on his deathbed and wants to see her one last time .
In the mean time , Logan is reunited with his dad when he ’s arrested for the murder of Felix .
The show ’s about a quarter of the way into the season so if you ’ve never seen it , you might have trouble getting into it . - ( New ! ) –
In this episode of ‘ Rescue Me ’ the guys attempt to save a bus full of children in Harlem .
On the more dramatic side , Sean tells Tommy about his relationship with Maggie , Franco figures out what the deal is with sexy - older - woman Alicia ( Susan Sarandon ) , Probie and his roomie discuss their sexuality and Janet wants Tommy to discuss their divorce settlement sans lawyers .
I expect this episode to be 1 part funny and 2 parts dramatic .- ‘ Big Brother ’ has become one of my guiltiest TV - watching pleasures .
This season as most BB fans know , they ’re doing an All - Star season .
In this week ’s episode , we will get to see which 20 previous houseguests are up for another chance at the game .
After the episode , America will get to decide which houseguests will return to the house for another summer of laughs , lies and PB&J .
My hopefuls – Kaysar ( 6 ) , Howie ( 6 ) , Dr. Will ( 2 ) , Janelle ( 6 ) , Drew ( 5 ) , Roddy ( 3 ) and James ( 6 ) .-
Simon Cowell ’s new series in which he scours the country looking for talented American ’s who will compete to win $ 1,000,000 .
The contestants will range from the typical singers and dancers to less popular talents like magicians and “ bizarre novelty acts ” .
Sounds like another chance for Simon to use words like “ dreadful ” and “ I ’m - not - being - rude - but ” .- ( rerun ) - If you have n’t been watching ‘ My Name Is Earl ’ , now ’s your chance to see what all the fuss is about .
I jumped into the series about halfway through the season so I can confirm that this is definitely the kind of show where its ok to have missed episodes .
It ’s both funny and sweet in a simple kind of way .
In this episode , Earl attempts to repay the government after not paying taxes for years .
There ’s another episode of ‘ Earl ’ on at 9 pm . - ( rerun ) – This show never fails to make me laugh .
In this episode , Michael and Dwight are out of the office today so Pam and Jim get everyone in the office together to play some made - up games for the unofficial “ Office Olympics ” .
There ’s another episode of ‘ The Office ’ at 9:30 pm . - ( rerun ) –
So this show ’s been cancelled and will fall off the radar the second WB and UPN merge but that does n’t mean you ca n’t enjoy this girly sitcom while it ’s still around !
The episode looks like it ’s a good one because OMG , Brandon and Kelly are finally reunited !
Ok not really but kind of .
The show stars ‘ 90210 ’s ’ own Jennie Garth and this episode does happen to feature a guest appearance than Jason Priestly .
Yes , you can probably bet on at least one well - placed but cheesy ‘ 90210 ’ reference so really if you ’ve been writing in your diary begging the universe to put these two back on screen together , your wish has been granted .
I have n’t seen this episode but I have seen this show on more than a few occasions .
Its charming in a squeaky - clean kind of way .- ( rerun ) – Another casualty of the big WB / UPN merge , ‘ Twins ’ is taking its final breaths in the rerun season which is kind of a shame because it was actually a pretty decent show .
Starring Larry from ‘ Perfect Strangers ’ ( Mark Linn - Baker ) , Melanie Griffith , Molly Stanton and Sara Gilbert ( Darlene from ‘ Roseanne ’ ) , ‘ Twins ’ is a show about two fraternal twins who are polar opposites in terms of personality .
They take over their dad ’s business and the chuckles ensue as Farrah ( the girly blonde twin ) acts all girly and blonde while Mitchee counters her twin ’s girliness with lots of non -blonde / non - girly behaviorisms .
It ’s a recipe for good clean Friday night family time .
Unfortunately there just were n’t enough good clean families watching TV on Friday nights because CW is replacing the timeslot with a big chunk of wrestling .
“ Daniel LaRusso ’s gonna fight ?!
Daniel LaRusso’s gonna fight ! ” – that ’s right ladies and gentleman , call your friends and tell them you cant go out with them Friday night .
There ’s waxing to be done ( of the on and off variety ) .
Turner Classic
Movies will be playing one of the greatest 80 ’s movies of all time .
When I sawwas on TCM I had to do a reality check .
Realizing that this movie , which premiered in 1984 is in fact , 22 years old , made me feel ridiculously old but I wont let that stop me from enjoying it in all it ’s awesomeness .
Who could forget Mr. Miyagi beating up a bunch of high schoolers as they were dressed in their oh - so - cool skeleton unitards or the part when you think Daniel ’s out because Tommy took Kreese ’s orders and swept his leg .
Or that beautiful moment at the end when Johnny , bleeding profusely from his recently crane - kicked nose , passed Daniel the giant trophy .
We did it Mr. Miyagi !!!
Profiles of young TV and movie stars in all their adorableness then does a sort of “ where are they now ” piece .
Expect lots of dimples and celebrity appearances from people like Candace Cameron ( Bure ) .
Since its on Saturday night I suggest you turn this into some kind of drinking game .
Drink every time an Olsen twin shows up on screen .
Drink for every dimple shown .
Drink for every celeb that at one point in time , turned to drugs and / or alcohol .
Drink whenever a catchphrase is used ( “ how rude ! ” , “ oh , brother ” , “ whatcha talkin ’ bout willis ” , etc ) .
A friend of mine has a problem - his team worked for months on a big system with great success , marvellous technical achievements and a very elegant architecture .
However , the users do n’t share his enthusiasm .
They do n’t appreciate the architecture , flexibility and openness to change .
Somehow , they seem ‘ blinded by the user interface ’ .
Although the statement is completely correct , it ’s hardly something that developers should be moaning about - on the end , ‘ user interface ’ is called like that because it is exactly what users see .
Instead of complaining how users only see ‘ the stupid UI ’ , we can embrace that fact and improve their feelings about our software .
Developers tend to over - emphasise functional aspects , underlying structure and technical achievements .
But users are blind to that - they only see what the software does , not how .
Most users are only concerned about how the software will help them get their regular job done , and how pleasant it will be to work with .
For them , the underlying structure , service layers and database optimisations exist somewhere over the rainbow …
Restaurant chefs have learned this lesson a long time ago – a great meal tastes excellent , but it opens your appetite with the first look , not the first bite .
Although the real value of the meal is in it ’s taste , the visual impression is also very important .
A tasty meal looking like a mess might even disgust me , and if it was not in a restaurant I know and respect , I might just get up and leave .
On the other hand , I will surely take a few bites of a nice looking meal , but if the taste is not there , I ’ll eat something else .
A great meal has to have both components .
It ’s the same with winning software solutions – they must have both the functions and the looks .
It is incredible how much a few polishing touches can improve the customer ’s perception of software and the team .
The image that sold the system
My first encounter with this phenomenon was six years ago , while I worked on an energy - trading software system .
Electrical energy trading is somewhat strange , as the current goes where physical laws govern , but traders set their own abstractions for ‘ transiting ’ and ‘ trade ’ .
There is no warehousing , and if you are a middle - man , what you buy must match what you sell at any given time , and buy / sell contracts are coordinated and matched by various network operators on 15 or 60 minute levels .
One of the key selling points of our software was automation of the transit planning – which would save our clients a lot of effort and money , because they were doing it manually at the time .
It took us a few months just to come up with mathematical models for an optimisation algorithm , merging few existing network - flow optimisations and adding some ideas of our own .
Then , we spent a month or two developing software which would read the trading plans and network limits , find the optimal transit plan and present it in a 15 minute breakdown table .
Traders would then verify the plan and the software would send it to appropriate network operators .
As a quick check tool , we developed a graphical display of suggested transit routes , and used it to see visually whether the optimised routes made sense .
Just for the fun , we polished that code and added it to the GUI client , putting a map of Europe under the plotted lines .
My boss , at the time , was complaining about how we were wasting time on silly eye - candy when we should be working on the real stuff .
When we presented the system to the clients , their top - management attended the meeting along with leading traders .
Very proud of our new algorithm , both in terms of the mathematical model and light - speed implementation , we talked a lot about all the boring details ( I ’m pretty sure we could have given them a sedative and achieved the same effect , as they all were all sleeping ) .
On the end , when I pushed the Optimise button , and Europe with red , blue and yellow lines came up on the screen , they all suddenly woke up with faces reminding me of a child getting a new toy .
One of the leading traders shouted something like ‘ This is great , it ’s going to make my work so much easier !’.
Like a fool , I thought that they were thrilled by how the process finished in a few seconds , and continued talking about the resulting table and the algorithm .
But the trader interrupted me – ‘ I ’m not talking about the table – this map is fabulous …
I ’ve never been able to see my plans that way . ’
Everything before and after that moment did not matter , they ‘ loved it ’ .
That single feature , developed in less that 8 hours , sold the software on the end , and we could have given them a faulty model with the same success .
Of course , the real value of the system was in the way it correctly and swiftly managed tons of data to produce an optimal transit map .
But all they were talking about was the silly map .
Imagine my anger - we could have spent those months playing games and I guarantee that the silly map would still sell the software ( not that it would do much good later ) .
Improving the view
If the clients are not very technical , they will only see the GUI - so let ’s give them something nice to see .
If the GUI is not polished , from my experience it ’s best to delay the project for a few days to clean it up , even if the clients are screaming to get it ASAP .
It may sound against common sense , but in practice it works great .
Sprinting to add raw , unpolished functionality almost never pays off , and it can blow up in your face .
Putting a bit of eye - candy into the project can really help with first impressions , and it ’s incredible how much a few days of polishing can improve the customer perception .
I ’ve worked with clients that have a very good understanding of what goes on under the hub , but these are an exception rather than a rule .
Most cannot see trough the visual interface , so the functionality is really not that important to them as long as it does the job .
And , even those with technical background will also appreciate a nice GUI , so polishing the user interface is time well spent in any case .
Even if you do not have the budget to pay professional designers , the software does not have to be grey and ugly .

hype /hīp /
Noun : Extravagant or intensive publicity or promotion .
A hypodermic needle or injection .
Verb : Promote or publicize ( a product or idea ) intensively , often exaggerating its importance or benefits .
Stimulate or excite ( someone ) : " I was hyped up because I wanted to do well " .
One of my crusades recently in online beer communities has been against the word " hype " .
I 'll discuss my rationale below , but if you 're the impatient , TL ; DR type , I 'll summarize here : 1 ) It 's being used incorrectly ( this is actually fairly minor ) .
2 ) Using it that way corrodes discussion and inhibits clear thinking ( major ) .
I 'll explain .
First , let 's start with a dictionary definition .
I loathe doing this because I think that , in general , any literate adult should be able to tell you roughly what a word means , but we may as well go to the " authorities " .
My favorite method is to use the google search " define : foo " which leads to these results
Now , it 's clear that the meanings we 're dealing with are both of the # 1's ( although you could sort of make a case for verb # 2 , I do n't think it really makes sense in pretty much any context , and really needs to be followed by " up " ) .
And both of those explicitly mention " publicity " or " promotion " , as well as " extravagant " , " intensive " , or " exaggerating " .
It is completely clear that " dudes talking about a beer on a beer website " are n't meeting this definition .
Saying your opinion of something , even in hyperbolic terms ( " that was the best beer ever ! " ) is n't promoting / publicizing something intensively , let alone extravagantly .
Maybe you 're exaggerating ( although if it 's your honest opinion then you 're obviously not , by definition everyone has had a " best beer ever " so stating yours is just stating an opinion ) , but unless you 're doing this repeatedly ( to meet " intensive " ) then it 's not hype .
So whatmeet this definition ?
Well , typically any publicity push by a company will at least get close .
Bud Lite or Dos Equis are obviously hyped .
Even in the craft beer world it does happen .
One could accuse Shelton Brothers of hyping Westvleteren 12 in advance of their shipment of it to the US later this year ( I think that 's debatable , but regardless , it 's a reasonable case ) .
ONCEMADE was absolutely hyped .
At the time of the launch I said that it was a fantastic example of hype in the craft beer world .
It was a product that was n't really all that different from dozens of other products that had a big marketing push ( publicity / promotion ) using over - the - top ( exaggerated ) language , and it showed up all over the place in a short time span ( intensive ) .
I hope that illustrates why calling something like , say , Pliny the Elder / Younger or Heady Topper ( or most other craft beers ) " hyped " is using the word incorrectly .
There 's no intense publicity , no exaggeration , no extravagance .
There are just beer fans enjoying a beer and talking about it .
You might disagree , and you 're free to ( taste is subjective , after all ) , but their expressed enjoyment of something is not hype , it is praise .
( This is a tangent , but I wanted to include it .
While it's not in the definitions I think a very important part of thinking about hype is asking , " Who benefits ? "
If I go on Beer Advocate and make a post about how Pliny is the best beer ever , there 's no way in which I benefit .
First , pretty much everyone on BA already knows about Pliny , I 'm not actually spreading the word to anyone new .
Second , even if I were , what do I gain ?
It 's an off - the - shelf beer , already very well known , it wo n't trade any better .
I also wo n't gain financially .
If anything increased awareness will just make it harder for me to buy !
The same is true of most beers that people consider " hyped " .
Really , when you 're talking about BA or /r / beer the posts that could be hyping are the ones talking about a great new local place with hard - to - get stuff ( think Funky Buddha ) , but even then it 's probably just genuine praise , not an attempt to inflate trade values ( although it could also be homerism , that 's beyond my scope right now ) .
I think that 's something valuable to keep in mind , " Who benefits ? " ) This is my real problem with the overuse of the word " hype " .
What do I mean by it ?
I do n't mean that people are using a word incorrectly and the English language is suffering ( if she has survived the sling and arrows of the recent past , she 'll continue doing just fine ) .
What I mean is that calling something " hyped " is an accusation .
The word has clear negative connotations .
When people use it they are implying that something is not as good as its reputation , that its reputation is fluffed up by the hype .
It 's also accusing the people who have praised it of either being taken in by the hype ( and thus being unsavvy saps ) or of actively fueling the hype , and thus being pawns ( or worse , hypers ) .
Lest you think I 'm being paranoid or overly sensitive here , I 'm not .
I do n't actually give two shits if someone accuses me of hyping something .
If they do , I 'll explain why I 'm not , but I 'm not particularly insulted by it .
This is n't a personal quest because I 'm just a Sally - sensitive .
Those effects are real and they are poisonous to sensible discourse .
It means that people are forced to defend not only their opinion of the thing , but also their motives for holding that opinion .
It removes the benefit of the doubt ..
Maintaining the benefit of the doubt and assuming good intentions are critical to having a reasonable , respectful discourse , especially over text , where tone and visual cues are missing .
That 's my biggest problem with the over -use of the word hype .
It creates a situation where accusations are flying , people are put on the defensive , motives are constantly questioned , and communication degrades .
So , what would I like to replace the word " hype " with ?
Most of the time you can sub in " praise " without any issues .
One use of " hype " where that does n't work is the " hype train " effect , where beer forums ( especially trading forums ) are inundated with discussion ( usually ISO / FT posts or discussion thereof ) of the new beer .
This is corrosive in the same way , implying that the beer ( and those trading it ) are not worth the attention .
Honestly , I think that this should just vanish from our discourse .
Human beings like trends , everyone knows this , beer is no exception .
That the forums are populated by posts about a flavor of the month for a few days every few weeks is n't surprising in the least , nor is it bad in any meaningful way .
Even though I earlier used the word " inundated " these posts are rarely the majority of posts on a board .
It might be a bit hard to ignore , but it 's not like there 's nothing else going on .
I 'd like to see people accept this , move on , and bury the phrase " hype train " .
One thing that I 'd still like to discuss is why this use of " hype " is so prevalent .
My belief is that it comes from sports discussions .
The difference there is that because of themedia presence , things really are frequently hyped .
Tim Tebow is hyped .
RG3 is hyped .
As much as the Stanford fan in me hates to say this , as of now Andrew Luck is hyped .
It 's true that these guys generate discussion on forums in the same way beer does ( although on a much bigger scale for sports ) , but the presence of media actively fueling the fire is what sets sports discussion apart .
Hype sells for them in a way it just does n't for craft beer .
Hype gets eyes on ESPN , readers on the various news websites , listeners on the radio .
Those things bring advertising dollars .
The hype machine directly benefits the people doing the hyping .
Since there 's a pretty large overlap between people who are into sports and people who are into beer , the language translates .
The problem is that when you have a lot of people talking about a beer , you 're not in the same situation as when you have a lot of people talking about an athlete .
In the latter case the media is driving the discussion , and they 're doing it to get your attention and therefore money .
In the former case it 's just a bunch of dudes who are passionate about something .
But the fact that they 're so superficially similar ( ie " Everyone 's talking about Tim Tebow " and " Everyone 's talking about Heady Topper " ) makes the comparison easy .
But it 's also lazy , and it 's wrong .
That 's the end of my rant about hype .
Most of us have heard of the American fashion for asking : " What would Jesus do ? "
You may be more surprised to learn that a book was recently published entitled What Would Bill Hicks Say ? , featuring contributions from , among others , Rob Newman , AL Kennedy and Radiohead 's Thom Yorke .
Are we to infer that the late US stand - up , who died in 1994 aged 32 , is comedy 's Christ ?
He has certainly risen again at this year 's Edinburgh .
The hit Fringe show Bill Hicks : Slight Return , in which Hicks is brought back to life in 2006 by writer and actor Chas Early , is back at the Pleasance .
At the Dome , Hicks 's childhood friend and one - time comedy partner Dwight Slade is staging three seminars , entitled Bill & Dwight , in which he reminisces about their relationship .
And the runaway favourite for this year 's if .comeddies award , the brilliant American stand - up Doug Stanhope , is forever being compared to Hicks .
Which tees him off , for several reasons .
" That guy would be so against us idolising him , " he says .
" Stop turning him into a cult , man .
He was a good comic , that 's all . "
This posthumous popularity would amuse Hicks , who struggled for years .
Before his death , his stock was fast rising in the UK , where his gigs at the 2,000 - seat Dominion Theatre were broadcast by Channel 4 .
His US reputation lagged far behind , but a breakthrough was within his grasp : the critic John Lahr had penned a rhapsodic profile for the New Yorker after Hicks became the first act to be censored on the David Letterman show .
( The offending jokes attacked the anti-abortion lobby .
" Pro-life ! "
Hicks sneered .
" Boy , they look it , do n't they ?
They just exude joie de vivre ... " )
There was no time left for Hicks to salvage his TV career - six months later he died of pancreatic cancer .
But in the years since , he has become more popular than ever .
It helps that the subjects of his most excoriating comedy - a Bush in the White House , a war in Iraq - remain bizarrely apposite .
Books , DVDs and CDs of his work are released on a regular basis ; the latest , Sane Man ( " the first full - length Bill Hicks performance ever filmed ! " ) , hit stores last year .
His name has become a byword for free - thinking , outspoken , savagely funny and socially conscious comedy , and his legacy casts a long shadow .
For personal reasons alone , Slade finds the phenomenon strange .
" I do n't listen to his CDs .
I did n't read the books .
Because I do n't want to relate to Bill as the icon and forget what he was as my friend . "
But he understands the blossoming reputation .
" What happens when you die young , " says Slade , " is that you freeze - frame this really energetic , wonderful life - this idealistic , uncompromising voice . "
Hicks has become an icon , says Slade , " for a generation that does n't really have anybody .
The 1960s and 1970s had the Beatles and Joplin , Hendrix and Andy Kaufman .
But the 1980s and 90s were these empty areas of American idealism , until Bill took that role . "
" It 's become easy to turn him into a saint , " says Early , despite there being " elements of his comedy that were difficult and in many cases unappealing " .
Some audiences inevitably felt hectored by Hicks 's vehemence , and the fainthearted struggled with the more lurid sexual content .
But his merits outshone his flaws .
Above all , he was technically supremely gifted .
The energy was unflagging , the jokes brilliantly honed and the stage presence mesmerising .
He was also a brilliant physical comedian .
Slade 's Bill & Dwight show features grainy home videos of the two adolescents rehearsing slapstick routines in a California baseball park , proving that Hicks knew Chaplin 's oeuvre inside out .
But the key to Hicks 's longevity is his idealism ; the fact that his comedy was underpinned by a passion for saving the world .
Loud - mouthed controversialists are 10 - a - penny in stand - up , but with Hicks , the drugs and porn shtick formed part of a libertarian , humanist , spiritual ( although not religious ) worldview .
The tension in his work , says Slade , was that " he had a great love of people , and a great disdain for people " .
But he was journeying ever closer towards the former .
His final testament , quoted in the 2004 collection , Love All the People , reads : " I left in love , in laughter and in truth , and wherever truth , love and laughter reside , I am there in spirit . "
Hicks detested hypocrisy and intellectual laziness , and believed they could be conquered through comedy .
" There is a real underlying wish in his work , " says Early , " for humanity to improve and see its flaws .
There is a witch - doctor element : ' Come on , people , together we can change the world . ' "
In this , there are echoes of Hicks 's southern Baptist upbringing in Texas .
" His mum once said to him , ' You 're just two steps away from being a preacher , ' " says Early .
" And he said , ' That 's exactly what I 'm doing .
I 'm trying to get people to believe . ' "
Of course , it 's easy to be principled when you die young .
" I 've compromised myself to fucking oblivion , " says Slade , now aged 45 .
Maybe Hicks , too , would have lowered his standards .
( In a set brimming with filth and horror , Stanhope 's most shocking joke imagines Bill surviving to star in a hit TV show called Everyone Loves Hicks . )
But Hicks 's routines on the subject remain perhaps the most satisfying expression ever of the wound inflicted on society when good people ( Jay Leno , in Hicks 's example ) sell out .
" Here 's the deal , folks , " he ranted .
" You do a commercial , you 're off the artistic roll - call forever .
End of story .
You 're another corporate shill , you 're another whore at the capitalist gang - bang .
And if you do a commercial , there 's a price on your head , everything you say is suspect and every word that comes out of your mouth is like a turd falling into my drink . "
Given this provocateur persona , would n't Hicks have been dismayed by the cult that now surrounds him ?
Early 's play asks that very question .
" And I think he 'd say , ' What is it with dead comedians ?
Have n't you got enough live ones to go around ?
Why is n't anyone moving the story on ? '
I think he would be annoyed . "
Slade disagrees .
" Bill was a guy who was in tune with his own voice , and who was able to amplify it into something very funny and inspirational and meaty .
But there are comics all over the place who do that now .
Bill raised the bar and comedy has followed .
And I think Bill would be thrilled that comics are really digging deep and coming up with very interesting stuff . "
To honour Hicks 's legacy , says Slade , is n't to get onstage in black leather , angry and wreathed in smoke .
It 's to tell one 's own truth , as honestly and fearlessly as possible .
" Give me something that is different and unique and yourself .
There 's nothing more refreshing than that . "
For any Hicks fan , Slade 's intimate photographs and films of the young Bill - goofing around in their apartment , hijacking Dwight 's wedding dressed as a mafia enforcer - will be as poignant as they are fascinating .
But we must n't be too sad , says Slade .
" When we were kids , Bill and I would spend every weekend putting on Aerosmith and Kiss and pretending we were rock stars .
Bill loved that , because he wanted to be a rock star .
And he would be thrilled by the fact that he has become one . "
100 Years of Turbulence
A century ago today , the Wright brothers took turns steering one of the first powered heavier - than - air aircraft on a series of controlled flights , the longest of which lasted fifty - seven seconds .
I say " one of the first " because there is a bit of controversy about who was first to fly , depending on how Clintonian you want to get about the meaning of " flight " .
If simply getting airborne is the criterion , honors have to go to the New Zealand eccentric Richard Pearse , who in 1902 built a giant flying table that enabled him to reach an altitude of several dozen feet and crash into gorse hedges .
If powered flight without a pilot on board qualifies , then credit is due to Charles Parson 's powered glider ( 1883 ) and Alexander Mozhaiski 's steam - powered [!] monoplane ( 1884 ) .
If reaching an altitude of eight inches counts as flying , then put your hands together for Clement Ader , who made the first manned flight in 1890 - also using steam power - and then improved his aircraft so much that it could not get off the ground at all .
If you believe that a qualifying flight has to be sustained and controlled , but you have lenient standards of proof , then you should consider the claims of Gustave Whitehead , who built a plane that modern science shows to be stable and controllable , but neglected to bring a camera or logbook along on his maiden voyage .
If you are very demanding and insist that the plane not only stay in the air under its own power , but land at the same point it took off , to demonstrate full control , then you 'll be wanting to congratulate the Wright brothers .
In 1904 , they rolled up their sleeves , built an improved version of their flyer , and on October 20 made a circular flight a little less than a mile long .
Not even a year later , Orville was able to fly for more than 24 miles , staying airborne for 39 minutes .
That 's true flight by anybody 's criteria except the Brazilians , who insist on the tortured prerequisite of takeoff from a dead stop in still air , just so they can cheer the Brazilian scion and one - man freak show Alberto Santos - Dumont .
Dumont made waves in Paris by flying a giant powered box kite for several hundred yards in October 1906 , gradually perfecting his technology until it could ' easily cover 200 meters of ground ' .
From there , it was a direct line to the Embraer jet .
The bickering about who was first in the air obscures the real accomplishment of the Wright brothers , which was the careful and scientific approach they took to the problem of aircraft design .
The Wrights were the first to do wind - tunnel tests , correcting longstanding errors in aeronautical theory , and they systematically applied their experimental results in designing each subsequent version of their gliders and aircraft .
Unlike most of the other pioneers of aviation , they actually understood what they were doing .
And they were superb craftsmen , who could turn abstract design principles into a handsomely assembled machine .
Unfortunately , like countless engineers before and after them , the Wright brothers were also dour , stubborn , and completely lacking in basic social skills .
They wanted nothing more than to sell out and be free to pursue their aeronautical research , but alienated all potential buyers by refusing to demo the flyer until a contract had been signed .
This stubbornness grew partly out of their obsession with having the invention stolen .
After proving to themselves and the world that powered flight was possible , they basically locked the airplane away and said to each other ' let 's litigate !'.
Having just invented the airplane , the Wrights stopped flying for two and a half years .
Of course , just because you 're paranoid does n't mean they 're not out to get you .
Almost as soon as the news of the first flight got out , the brothers received a threatening letter from the nefarious glider pilot and charlatan Augustus Herring , who had rushed to patent parts of the Wright brothers ' own design after a visit to Kitty Hawk , and wanted in on the action ( the patent would be denied ; Herring went on to a storied career as an aviation con artist ) .
The Wright brothers ' first priority was to patent their airplane , and they duly received their patent in 1904 .
It did n't just cover their specific design , but the whole concept of three - axis control - being able to independently steer the aircraft in pitch , roll , and yaw - that was critical to powered flight .
This patent became a mighty weapon that the Wright brothers used for the next thirteen years to sue the bejesus out of anyone else who tried to fly an airplane .
It may not have been a problem if the Wrights themselves had kept working on aircraft design , or if the original flyer had been good enough to license .
But neither was the case - the Wrights became so consumed with their lawsuits that they had no time or energy left for further work , essentially becoming the SCO of the early aviation age .
And their airplane design , while innovative , was mostly innovative in the wrong ways .
One major problem the flyer had was instability .
If you take almost any modern airplane and deflect its nose or tip its wings in flight , it will gradually return to its equilibrium position - one reason why planes stay aloft even in severe turbulence .
The plane is said to exhibit positive dynamic stability .
The Wright flyer had negative stability - if you perturbed it , it would get further out of whack until the pilot corrected the motion , or until the plane returned to the ground " without further attention on the part of the aeronaut " .
A second problem was the idiosyncratic technique the Wrights used to turn the plane .
On modern planes , a pilot banks the wings by moving small control surfaces on the trailing edge of the wing called ailerons .
The Wrights rejected ailerons in favor of wing warping , where the actual wing shape would be changed by the judicious pulling of wires .
This technique was as elegant as it was ultimately ineffective .
Steering in general was a problem - there was n't a lot keeping the flyer pointed in a steady direction .
The forward ' rudder ' ( what we now call a canard wing ) made things worse , because the plane naturally wanted to weather - vane around .
The plane layout we 're all used to ( long fuselage with a tail and horizontal stabilizer behind the wing ) actually predated the Wright 's design by almost a century , but the Wrights had rejected it in favor of a canard wing , so that they could get the maximum amount of lift possible from their awful engine .
This engine was terribly underpowered , even by the standards of the day .
The Wright brothers knew how to build airframes , not engines , and the only reason they were able to get their flyer airborne in the first place was because their brilliant propeller design and high - lift wing made up for the great crappiness of the power plant .
A fellow aviator , Glenn Curtiss , knew how to build quite wonderful lightweight engines , and in one of the great ' what - ifs ' of aviation history offered to go into partnership with the Wrights in 1906 .
But the brothers turned him down , and subsequently worked hard to sue Curtiss out of the airplane business .
In the years to come , the Curtiss - Wright rivalry would become the most bitter of the many legal disputes surrounding the brothers .
Curtiss , backed by Alexander Graham Bell , scurried to build new airplanes faster than the Wrights could win court cases against him , going to great lengths to try to establish prior art or at least narrow the scope of the patent ruling .
Despite the many innovations in the Curtiss design ( ailerons , empennage , a new engine ) the court took the broadest possible view of the Wright patent .
Curtiss was n't a thief - his designs were themselves revolutionary improvements , and he was motivated by a passion for aviation at least as great as the Wright brothers ' - but the rivalry was so bitter that the brothers would not license to him .
For the Wright brothers , the patent struggle was a series of Pyrrhic victories .
They wanted justice and credit , and ideally the freedom to pursue their research further .
Instead they found themselves consumed by litigation , and forced to watch others catch up with and overtake their technical lead , particularly in Europe , where areonautical research had strong state support .
The endless legal battle over the airplane patent may even have contributed to Wilbur Wright 's early death - he came down with typhoid at an especially rough patch in the legal proceedings , and died at age 45 .
His brother Orville lived long enough to see the Wright company taken over by Curtiss in 1929 , in the most bitter of ironies .
Neither brother made any substantive contribution to aviation after 1908 .
The United States government finally put an end to the patent strife in 1917 .
Mindful of the impending war , it insisted that the rival parties form a patent pool - in effect , removing patent barriers to creating new airplane designs .
Together with the war , the patent pool inspired a golden age of American aviation .
The pool stayed in effect until 1975 ; companies who wanted to preserve a competitive advantage did so using trade secrets ( such as Boeing 's secret recipe for hanging jet engines under an airliner wing ) .
I believe that the Wright patent story drives home the intellectual bankruptcy of our patent system .
The whole point of patents is supposed to be to encourage innovation , reward entrepreneurship , and make sure useful inventions get widely disseminated .
But in this case ( and in countless others , in other fields ) , the practical effect of patents turned out to be to hinder innovation - a patent war erupts , and ends up hamstringing truly innovative technologies , all without doing much for the inventors , who were n't motivated by money in the first place .
It 's illuminating to point out that all three transformative technologies of the twentieth century - aviation , the automobile , and the digital computer - started off in patent battles and required a voluntary suspension of hostilities ( a collective decision to ignore patents ) before the technology could truly take hold .
The Wright brothers won every patent case they fought , and it did them absolutely no good .
The prospect of a fortune was n't what motivated them to build an airplane , but ironically enough they could have made a fortune had they just passed on the litigation .
In 1905 , the Wrights were five years ahead of any potential competitor , and posessed a priceless body of practical knowledge .
Their trade secrets and accumulated experience alone would have made them the leaders in the field , especially if they had teamed up with Curtiss .
Instead , they got to watch heavily government - subsidized programs in Europe take the technical lead in airplane design as American aviation stagnated .
If you are someone who believes that the Internet and computer software are a transformative technology on a par with aviation , you may find it interesting to note that there is now a patent cease - fire in effect in the world of software , the occasional high - profile infringement case notwithstanding .
The reason for the cease - fire is simple : if companies like IBM , Xerox , and Sun were to begin fully enforcing their patent portfolios , it would mean an apocalypse of litigation for all software developers .
Everyone understands that the health and growth of the Internet are contingent on ignoring the patent system as much as possible .
At the same time , more patents are being granted than ever before , for broader claims , and with an almost complete disregard for prior art .
Entire companies - and not just legal firms - are basing business models on extracting money from the patent system without actually creating any products .
And the boundaries of patent law are expanding .
For the first time in history , it 's possible to patent pure mathematical ideas ( in the form of software patents ) , or even biological entities .
The SARS virus was patented shortly after being isolated for the first time .
But if the patent system does n't even work for the archetypal example - two inventors , working alone , who singlehandedly invent a major new technology - why do we keep it at all ?
Who really benefits , and who pays ?
If this topic interests you , read Bruce Perens ' wonderful essay on software patents , which states the case more articulately and cogently than I ever could .
And please join me in drinking a toast to those prickly Wright brothers , who for all their foibles did something amazing on this day , and deserve all the credit and respect they so clearly craved .
Iraqis  especially the majority Shi’ites  are increasingly angry and frustrated about their situation and impatient for U.S. troops to leave , but most do not believe their country will fall apart , according to a major new poll [ . pdf ] released here Wednesday by the University of Maryland ’s Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) .
Seventy - one percent of the 1,150 randomly selected respondents interviewed for the survey in early September said they wanted all U.S. and coalition forces to leave Iraq within the next year , with more than half of them calling for the withdrawal to be completed within six months .
Moreover , nearly four in five respondents said they believed that the U.S. military in Iraq is " provoking more conflict than it is preventing , " while nearly 61 percent said they approved of attacks on U.S. - led forces , an increase of 14 percent compared to the last PIPA survey of Iraqi public opinion eight months ago .
Among the three main communal groups 
Shia , Sunnis , and Kurds  the biggest jump in negative opinion toward U.S. forces came from the Shi’ites , who comprise roughly 60 percent of the Iraq ’s population .
Nearly two of every three Shi’ites said they approved of attacks on U.S. - led forces , compared to 41 percent last January , just after a coalition of Shi’ite parties swept to victory in parliamentary elections .
At that time , only 22 percent of Shia respondents favored a U.S. withdrawal within six months .
The percentage has now risen to 36 percent , according to the PIPA poll .
The new survey , which to some extent mirrors the reported findings of a State Department - commissioned poll leaked to the Washington Post Wednesday , comes amid intensifying debate between most Democrats who favor setting a timeline for withdrawing forces and President George W. Bush and Republican loyalists who say that such a strategy would invite disaster .
That debate has been fueled in recent days by the disclosure of a classified National Intelligence Estimate ( NIE )  the consensus position of Washington ’s 16 national intelligence agencies .
Among other conclusions , it found that the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq have become a " cause celebre " for jihadists worldwide and fueled the growth and spread of terrorism and Islamic radicalism .
The administration , which was forced to declassify parts of the NIE under pressure from Democrats Tuesday , has also acknowledged that another NIE on Iraq  a draft version of which was described as " grim " by one source  is under preparation .
But the White House said it is not scheduled for completion until January , a timetable that has provoked protests from Democrats who believe that its conclusions are almost certain to stoke public anger here with the Iraq war and , if released before the elections , help them win control of at least one house of Congress .
The State Department poll , which was conducted from late June to early July , reportedly found that majorities of respondents in all regions of Iraq , except Kurdistan , said that the withdrawal of U.S. - led forces would " make them feel safer and decrease violence " and that nearly two out of three respondents favored an immediate departure .
The 71 percent majority who told PIPA they want a withdrawal within one year underlined a " growing sense of urgency " on the part of Iraqis , according to PIPA director Steven Kull , who noted that last January , 70 percent of respondents said they favored withdrawal within two years .
The only group that shows less eagerness for the military to leave are Sunnis , who comprise about 20 percent of the total population and have been most resistant to the U.S. occupation and unhappy with the Shia - dominated government .
The percentage of Sunnis who favor withdrawal within six months has dropped from 83 percent to 57 percent , although nine in 10 Sunnis still say they want U.S. troops out within a year .
Four out of five Iraqis  including 96 percent of Sunnis and 87 percent of Shi’ites  say that the U.S. is having a negative influence on the situation in Iraq , according to the poll , which found that Kurds still believe Washington ’s influence is positive by a 48 - 34 percent margin .
If , as most Democrats have urged , the U.S. made a commitment to withdraw from Iraq according to a specific timeline , 53 percent of respondents said they believed that would strengthen the Iraqi government , as opposed to only 23 percent who said they though it have the opposite effect .
" Basically , because U.S. forces are there , the Iraqi government does n’t really have the legitimacy it might have , " suggested Kull , who noted growing confidence , particularly on the part of Shi’ites , that Iraqi security forces will have become strong enough within the next six months to handle security challenges on their own .
Growing impatience with the U.S. military presence was also reflected in the strong approval among both Sunnis and Shi’ites for attacks on U.S. - led forces , which Kull called " the most disturbing finding " of the new survey .
If , however , the U.S. made a commitment to withdraw its troops according to a timetable , support for attacks would diminish , the poll found .
Nearly half of Sunnis and Shi’ites who said they support attacks said they would feel less supportive if such a commitment were made .
A major problem , however , is nearly four in five Iraqis believe that Washington wo n’t withdraw its troops because it plans to have permanent military bases in Iraq .
The same percentage also believes that even if the Iraqi government demanded that U.S. forces withdraw , Washington would not comply .
( Coincidentally and largely at the initiative of Democratic lawmakers , Congress is expected to approve a ban this week on the expenditure of any money appropriated for next year ’s defense budget for the purpose of building permanent bases in Iraq . )
Kull suggested that Iraqi skepticism about U.S. intentions may be behind the overwhelming approval among both Sunnis and Shi’ites for attacks on U.S. forces .
The poll uncovered no evidence , he said , for an ideological or related motive .
Indeed , the survey found that views of al - Qaeda and Osama bin Laden were remarkably negative .
While nearly 100 percent of Shi’ite and Kurdish respondents expressed unfavorable views of both , three out of four Sunnis agreed with them .
Nonetheless , disillusionment and anger with the situation in Iraq has clearly grown , according to the survey .
Fifty - two percent of all respondents now believe that the country is going in the " wrong direction "  up from 35 percent as recently as last June .
Among Shi’ites , a majority of 59 percent still believe it is going in the " right direction , " but that is down from 84 percent in January .
While the decline in optimism among Kurds has not been quite as sharp , Sunnis remain as deeply pessimistic as in January when 93 percent said the country was headed in the " wrong direction . "
" The trend is a very poor one , " said Kenneth Pollack , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution .
" There is no question that Iraqis are ever more frustrated and angry with the United States . "

Picasa for Linux available !
Google has indeed been working on Picasa , and it 's finally available for download at http://labs.google.com/
For the curious , here are a few tidbits about how it came to be .
When Google wanted to port Picasa to Linux , they faced a problem : the Picasa team was busy working on new projects , and having them also do a native port would have taken a while .
As an experiment , Google decided to give Wine a try .
A quick look showed that much of Picasa already worked , but key features were missing : the IWebBrowser API , SSL , scanner / camera support , removable media notification ( so you can insert a flash drive and have Windows notice it right away ) , and change notification ( so Windows can notify apps when new files are created ) , among others .
Fortunately , Wine was already halfway to having an implementation of IWebBrowser thanks to Jacek Caban 's Summer of Code 2005 project .
And all that other stuff could n't be * that * hard , right ? :-)
So Google engaged Codeweavers to add those features and fix any other bugs .
This resulted in tons of improvements to Wine ( see the list at code.google.com/wine.html ) , all of which are now in the public tree at winehq.org .
Many people assume that when porting a Windows app to Linux using Wine , the best thing to do is link Winelib into the application to create a native Linux application .
Not so !
It 's just as effective , and a heck of a lot easier , to run the same binary on both Windows and Wine .
So that 's what the Picasa team did .
Picasa for Linux uses slightly different text messages , but the .exe file is identical for both Windows and Linux .
Toward the very end , everything was looking great except that the initial assumption that most cameras emulate storage devices turned out to be wrong .
Fortunately , Marcus Meissner just happened to decide to implement libgphoto support ; his patch appeared at the perfect moment , and now Picasa supports both common flavors of cameras .
Two features left out of the Linux version were CD - ROM burning ( the driver Picasa uses is hard to support under Wine ) and movie playback ( Wine does n't have the necessary codecs ) .
Both are potentially fixable in a future version , but were beyond the scope of this first port .
One interesting challenge when shipping commercial apps for Linux is packaging -- do you choose RPM or Debian packages , or do you use a WIndows - style installer ?
The Picasa for Linux team chose all three , in hopes of pleasing everybody .
( Let 's see how well * that * works :-)
The Windows - style installer was implemented using the open - source Loki installer , and a few patches were contributed back for that , too .
The Picasa for Linux team had a blast .
It 's not often you get to pour resources into a vital open source project to help ship a commercial application !
We hope we get to do it again sometime soon , and we hope the results are good enough to encourage other companies to give Wine a try .
Thanks to the Wine community for a very capable platform ! -
Dan
WE KNOW this : Barack Obama is a rising star .
He ’s a powerful speaker and a gifted writer .
He is the only African American serving in the U.S. Senate .
But is he black ?
That ’s what New York Daily News columnist Stanley Crouch asked last month , and his answer was decidedly “ no . ”
No , Crouch was n’t just employing the old “ blacker than thou ” canard .
Nor was he concerned with the fact that Obama was raised by his white mother .
Rather , he was treating blackness not just as a racial ( shared biology ) identity but as an ethnic ( shared historical experience ) one .
And is n’t that what the switch of terms from “ black ” to “ African American ” was all about ?
Think back to the late 1980s , when the Rev. Jesse Jackson became the most prominent black to call for the adoption of the term African American .
“ Just as we were called colored , but were not that , ” he said , “ and then Negro , but not that , to be called black is just as baseless .
Every ethnic group in this country has a reference to some land base , some historical cultural base .
African Americans have hit that level of maturity . ”
The problem , of course , is that most black Americans are descendants of slaves who had their African cultural heritage brutally stripped from them .
What Crouch is arguing is that what the majority of black Americans share is their ancestors ’ experience as human chattel , brought to these shores in the grips of chains .
Slavery and segregation not only forged a rigid racial line between black and white but created a shared ethnic experience .
For Crouch , the fact that Obama ’s father — whom Obama met only once — was a black Kenyan who came to the U.S. to study at Harvard and the University of Hawaii removes him from the traditional black American narrative .
Advertisement
Author and essayist Debra Dickerson agrees .
She believes that much of Obama ’s popularity among whites stems from the fact that his family was n’t part of the slave experience and therefore elicits no feelings of historical guilt .
“ The swooning from white people is a paroxysm of self - congratulation , ” she said .
But Dickerson also thinks that Obama ’s thoughtful embrace of his African lineage has the potential to broaden the definition of what it means to be black in the United States .
Indeed , the possibility of an Obama campaign for the presidency has already sparked an unusual — and potentially illuminating — debate about race .
It ’s true that in our country , blackness is not a choice but rather something thrust on people who have any hint of African lineage .
Traditionally , anyone with “ one drop of African blood ” has been considered black .
But in recent decades , more children of black - white unions are choosing to buck the “ one - drop rule ” and call themselves biracial .
But in this respect , Obama is a traditionalist .
He clearly chooses a black identity , but he does so even as he embraces his Midwestern Anglo roots .
In other words , rather than straddling two identities or creating a new mixed one , he prefers to place himself within a single category and then expand it .
In his lyrical yet interminable 1995 memoir , “ Dreams From My Father , ” Obama tells of his journey toward accepting his absent father ’s legacy and coming to terms with his feelings of alienation from both sides of his family tree .
Ultimately rejecting old - fashioned racial nationalism and narrow notions of authenticity , Obama encourages Americans to accept their messy racial inheritance .
And though he admits that his personal story bears little resemblance to that of most African American families , he chose to graft his own personal story onto theirs .
The one - drop rule was developed to protect slavery and to maintain segregation .
By defining all mixed children as black and compelling them to live in black communities , the rule enabled whites to believe in the fantasy of their own racial purity .
By extension , blacks also came to embrace rigid notions of their relative purity from whiteness .
Advertisement
BUT LOOK closely at the historical record and you ’ll find that plenty of prominent black political figures were at least half white , including Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington .
In addition to his African ancestry , W.E.B. Du Bois could trace his roots back to France and the Netherlands .
During Reconstruction , all but three of the 23 blacks in the House and Senate were some mixture of black and white .
The list goes on .
The difference between now and then , of course , is the element of choice .
Barack Obama does not remind Americans of the racial divide or of the chains that first created it .
Instead , he points to an alternative history that Americans have never been able to achieve .
“ Symbolically , Obama ’s parentage is the founding couple that America never accepted , ” said Werner Sollors , who teaches African American literature at Harvard .
Crouch is right : Obama does not remind us of this nation ’s original sin .
But he does remind us of an opportunity that we as a nation are continually missing .
OTTAWA , Dec. 19 - The technology patents at the heart of an infringement lawsuit by NTP against Research In Motion , the maker of the BlackBerry wireless e-mail device , are likely to be struck down by the United States patent office , both companies said on Monday , a move that would be a setback for NTP .
The United States Patent and Trademark Office took the unusual step of notifying the companies that it expected to reject the five patents held by NTP in its final rulings .
The office has issued preliminary rejections of all five wireless e-mail patents in the past .
The final rulings may come by mid-February , earlier than expected .
" The patent owner 's arguments are deemed nonpersuasive , " said the patent office document , which was received last week but dated Nov. 30 .
" The next office action is expected to be a final rejection of all current claims . "

Coulter is an opportunist who will do or say anything for a buck .
For the last several years she 's been on the reicht - wing payroll and that works for her .... her mental illness ( and yes I think she 's nutz ) fits right in with the rest of the whack jobs ( hannity , limbaugh , O'loofah , wiener / savage , bowtie boy - who also fall into the category of opportunist --- their individual levels of sanity vary from day to day and with whatever dose of crap , drugs , koolaid , or money they 've imbibed ) ...
If she 's been flipping lately between rw conservative and liberal I 'd say it 's because inspite of the crap she spews she can feel the wind shifting and does n't want to miss the next gravy train heading left .

Hawk , when " liberal groups " do it , the talking heads just spin it as more " hate and consiracy " .. does n't do any good .. anyone with eyes can see how nuts
Ann and the rest are ..
They do a huge disservice to the Conservative movement ..
Why would Liberals try to save them if they do n't want to save themselves ?
If Conservatives do n't want to be lumped in with the whack - jobs , then Conservatives have to distance themselves .. no one can do it for them ..
And I tell ya what ..
When the psychos who claim to be Conservative are out of the party , I could try to repsect Republicans again .. but not while they prop up people like Ann , Hannity , O'Reilly , Limbaugh , etc etc .

I may not like their points , but I can respect a conservative 's point of view .
It is not inherently anti-human .
That , of course , is unlike Ann Coulter 's point of view .
Hers is vicious and inhumane .
I 'd much prefer to have a discussion and debate on values with a true conservate than a debate littered with ridiculous accusations .
At least with a conservative , we can both agree that we 're people and have a toast to it .

Dear Brad , I come from a long line of " true " conservatives .
While I am still a Christian , because of people like Ann Coulter , Jerry Falwell , Rush Limbaugh , Bill O'Reilly and yes , our current hypocritic supposedly " saved " President ( since when does being " Christian " give one the right to lie and decieve ) I cannot in good faith call myself a " conservative " Christian .
Even though my values are indeed Christian .
Is n't it time that we stopped refering to ourselves with labels like " evangelical " and " conservative " and began to just " be " Christian ?
Anyway , it is refreshing to see someone from within the flock finally stand up to Coulter and her ilk .

The chick was a dude ...
Ann Coulter is actually a former drag queen from Key West named Pudenda Shenanigans .
Ms. Shenanigans was famous for her renditions of � Dude Looks Like a Lady � � I will Survive� and � You Shook Me All Night Long� as well as an extensive Barbra Streisand repertoire .
We who used to work with her are concerned for her as well as upset by the vile hatred she has spewed towards her former friends in the gay community .
We feel that by bringing the truth to light perhaps
Ann will come to grips with her past and change her wicked ways .

She is not a man , but she is not a woman either .
It is a well documented medical fact that a woman with a low body fat ratio as low as hers will not be able to have a period , or a baby .
Also , since the brain is made mostly of fat , her starving bird brain is not functioning properly , but you knew that .

I think it is pretty obvious why she has n't been exposed like this by the Democratic party :
Ann , whether by design or incompetence , is doing damage to the image of conservatives .
She 's making all conservatives look like loonies in a " guilt by association " way .
Even if you are an agnostic conservative who is against the War in Iraq , you tell someone you are a conservative and they will think , " Oh , right wing Ann Coultier loony conservative , eh ? "
Ann is doing the Democrats a great service , that 's why you wo n't see her exposed for the hypocritical fraud she is .
It 's the same reason Pat Buchanon was on Crossfire , Clinton had those highly visible meetings with Newt Gingrich , etc .
All you have to do in politics is encourage the nutballs on the opposite side of the aisle to be more visible , and more polarizing , and you will harm them greatly .

As a life - long liberal Democrat , I cannot even begin to express how relieved I am - not glad , not gloating - relieved to see real Christians , real conservatives taking back the Republican party from those like Ann Coulter and the neoCon extremists , who , by pretending to speak for all Republicans , have done more to polarize and damage this country than any Democrat ever could .
The ' values '
Coulter had made a small fortune promulgating - hate , fear , killing , suppression of any dissenting opinion - have tarnished conservatives badly .
I hope that other Democrats , like me , are less interested in gloating and more interested in finding common ground with real conservatives to bridge the chasm between us , and repair the incredible damage our country is suffering , and will suffer for years to come .

they lash out and flame and smear .

And it will never change .

What 's interesting is that traditional conservatives are finally getting some traction .

But Fox News , Bill O'reilly , and Ann Coulter are to conservativism what Hot Topic is to gothic .... just mainstream corporate spinoffs of spectacular and eccentric fringr cultures .

Would you devote a website to a insane homeless man raving about being Napoleon ?
That 's all that horse - faced GOP broad is .
The only power she gets is from people like you and websites like this .
She is a child .
Your response to her should either be to ignore her or to laugh at her .
Treating her idiotic statments as worthy of rebuttal is a waste of time and a worthless tactic .
When someone asks you about the horse - faced bitch , just say " Never heard of her " or " Yeah - I think she 's hilarious !
She 's like a female Andrew Dice Clay ! "

It would be like screwing cardboard --- no I wo n't get into that .
They gotta have * depth * ...
( We are only taking like this because she deserves it .
There are some hot progressives out there - I have n't said a word , have I ? )
On another level ...
Here are the six " canons " of conservative thought , according to one of the respected big shots of conservatism , Russell Kirk - from his book , The Conservative Mind 1 .
Belief in a transcendent order , or body of natural law , which rules society as well as conscience .
2. Affection for the proliferating variety and mystery of human existence .
3. Conviction that civilized society requires orders and classes , as against the notion of a classless society .
4. Persuasion that freedom and property are closely linked .
5. Faith in prescription and distrust of " sophisters , calculators , and economists " who would reconstruct society upon abstract designs .
6. Recognition that change may not be salutary reform .
Conservatives believe in a " concept of society as joined in perpetuity by a moral bond among the dead , the living , and those yet to be born - the community of souls . "
This just goes to show what I 've been saying ---
We need to rethink the terms we use .
Progressives do n't have an " affection for the proliferating variety and mystery of human existence " ?
Of course they do .
They are trying to save it from imposed blank sameness , being promoted by fake " conservatism " .
Belief in a transcendent order ?
Is this really a defining political issue ?
I think you can see the flaw in conservatism I mentioned on another thread .
Greed is not mentioned and is ignored in the focus on property and classes .
Fatal flaw , IMO .
The " community of souls " - a beautiful concept - of course , is Christian in the conservative world view .
Unfortunately for this view , Christ was a " leveller " because he understood the concept of greed as a moral and practical iniquity .
He was very clear on this , it seems to me .
Another flaw in the " canon . "
I think most of you will agree with me that there are some great concepts here , though vitiated , possibly destroyed , by confusion and blindness to key facts .
But , " progressives " have a lot to talk about with true conservatives and it's about time everyone recognized the fact .
About greed , about corporatization , about homogenizing and degrading the beauty and variety of life , about nourishing the " community of souls " .
Am I wrong ?
Ann Coulter is a weed , and has nothing to do with conservatism , of course .

Arry , here 's an article I think you will find interesting : Corrupt , Incompetent and ' Off Center '
by Eric Alterman [ snip ]
Here is the liberals ' problem in a nutshell :
More than 30 percent of Americans happily answer to the appellation " conservative , " while 18 percent call themselves " liberal . "
And yet when questioned by pollsters , a super - majority of more than 60 percent take positions liberal in everything but name .
Indeed , on many if not most issues , Americans hold views well to the left of those espoused by almost any national Democratic politician .
In a May survey published by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press , 65 percent of respondents said they favor providing health insurance to all Americans , even if it means raising taxes , and 86 percent said they favor raising the minimum wage .
Seventy - seven percent said they believe the country " should do whatever it takes to protect the environment . ''
A September Gallup
Poll finds that 59 percent consider the Iraq
War a mistake and 63 percent agree that US forces should be partially or completely withdrawn .
Nevertheless , extremist right - wingers , including a few apparent criminals , enjoy a stranglehold on our political system and media discourse .
And so the majority views of the American people are treated with contempt by pundits and politicians alike .

She was fidgeting , yanking on her own hair constantly , crossing and uncrossing her legs continually --- and I realised , she 's just extremely metally ill , and needs professional help .
Now , as hateful as she is , I just feel sorry for her .
I know you check out the websites , Ann , to see what 's being said about you --- that explains why you 're now wearing turtle - necked sweaters instead of your usual low - cut outfits .
Sorry , but it is SO NOT WORKING .

The other task is to talk and to sort out what citizens really believe because the whole labeling thing is doing little but confusing the issue .

Coulter offers nothing to the political discourse .
She 's just a rabble - rouser for the right .
Perhaps the clearest reason the Bushistas appear to be Fascists at time is their complete separation from the conservative public .
They play to the Religious Right , but it 's pretty clear from all they do that they 're not religious themselves .
Instead , it seems to me they are a secret political party , dedicated to the Rich and Corporate America .
Call them Skull & Bones or the party of the Rich if you wish .
Their use of the Religious Right , the Libertarians and others in the Republican Party can only last a short time .
Then , like a supernova they 'll implode and just fade and disappear .
They 'll scurry for the dark spaces like so many cockroaches .
Why is it these people seem to gain control of a political party , rather than the true believers ?
It 's because they are more Machiavellian and take power more effectively .
Like most sociopaths they manage the political lying and machinations easier than normal healthy people .
Nixon was that way too .
I 'd love to see that movie The Corporation which compares the modern American corporation to a sociopath .
I think a national airing of that might explain a lot to the American people .
That everyone says America is to the right , much further than Europeans , and yet the polls which show the public to the left of the politicians .
It 's quite amazing and shows there 's something seriously wrong , call it an illness , with our system .
I 'd guess it 's the skewing influence of money which Jerry Brown talked about during his 1992 presidential campaign .

While the ability to have a baby does not a woman make , the thing is , and I think the most important thing that we all keep losing sight of , is the fact that Ann Coulter has no real power of her own .
She has none .
She has no influence over other people that is not superficial and faked .
She has , for one reason or another been given one thing : a pass to get on television .
So how does she manage that ?
This is the thing that should be focused on : who is letting the mentally ill imbecile spew all over the airwaves ?
Who is supporting her ?
Who is orchestrating it ?
This goes to what Mooser said .
Is n't her hateful crap indeed the same thing that most Conservatives * have * been saying , for decades ?
In other words , if you consider yourself a " true " Conservative from back in the day , how can you in good conscience align yourself with these whackjobs ?
Where indeed is YOUR voice ?
Oakland Soul : you make a good point , since there is no dearth of male morons also being paid to speak on TV - but hey we are used to those .
Not too many women as idiotic as Coulter , so perhaps it 's a bit of a novelty

The mere fact that Coulter even gets attention is absolutely bizarre .
Under the most basic analysis she is a pathological narcist , who happens to be skilled with words and appears selfconfident .
She is a poor individual who has some deep rooted problems with self hatred .
She needs to raise evidence for herself that she is a worthless person only deserving to be disliked and not loved .
She shows a distinct and extreme example of narcistic disorder .
She mentions christianity and morals to preach to what she calls liberals , which are far beyond the true meaning and definition of liberal democrats .
She lives in extreme terms , and wants to kill , wipe out , punish someone .
All that is exhibiting , again is merely all that libido ( as repressed and stagnating sexual energy ) that can't find a positive expression in art , loving repaltionship , community , tolerance and acceptance .
She is trapped in her own hatred .
Possibly uncapable of meaningful relationship , ( denying bulimia ? ) very likely unaccepting of her own homosexuality , and in consant conflict with the notion of self as an opportunistic " self made celebrity " clashing with the inner perception of an empty , scared and cold blooded soul starved for true love .
There is no other replacement for true love and acceptance .
In order to blur that and distract her own mind consantly , she goes for what she knows best ... getting some surrogate love in form of fake admiration and fame , at any price .
The really bizarre fact is that so many republican americans even buy into her let me call it for what it is here ... bullshit .

Well , no ..
While the people who run corps " could " keep the corp from acting like a sociopath , it 's the way the law is set up that defines what a corperation 's mission is that makes the comany a sociopath .
The people driving it , in " doing their job " , ensure the company acts that way .
Some of the definitions in the movie explain that " not having remorse " and the like applies to the company " de facto " .. as in , while the board members might " feel bad " that the toxins they dumped in the river killed 350 people , the " corperation " does n't have feelings to feel bad with ..
Some of it ( painting a corp as a sociopath ) is a slippery slope , to be sure .

From the article written by Eric Alterman ( linked in my # 51 ) only 18 % of the American population calls itself " Liberal . "
I do n't even know what Liberal means in our current political spectrum .

Kira at # 70 Seems the Sarbanes - Oxley Act of 2002 is all about " disclosures " and " accounting " in the aftermath of Enron and Worldcom ..
Basically , it seems to be an attempt to make sure companies do n't create tons of " fake child / partner corps " to burry money in , and do n't atrificially inflate their profits ..
This is all about " protecting investors " .. which , if you ask me , is pretty silly given that at MOST , that would be 40 % of our Society .. and really only protect the money of the people with the most tied up in the market ..
Rich folks and mega corps .. and protects the investment firms ( less scare in the market , the more in comissions they get ) .
Kind of like doing away with the capital gains tax ..
Speaking of .. anyone see the financals on this guy ?
$ 120,000 to just over $ 1 mil in " capital gains " .. and soon to be untaxed .. nice .. and I had to drop my 401k contrabutions to pay child support .. not that I have upwards of $ 5 mil in stocks to get dividends on anyway ..

Do n't think I am dignifying Coulter when I speak of the " canons " of conservatism , etc .

I think Coulter * is* crashing , and it might be a good sign for further downfalls .
But propaganda of the vicious kind is one of the primary tools of fascist - like authoritarianism , and when people are losing their grounding the demagogues come in like hyenas to the kill , providing the necessary scapegoats and villains , thereby diverting attention from the true and important issues and the things that need to be done to act upon them .
Of course , they do n't just come in on their own .
They live in a symbiotic relationship with those who would be gather the power and wealth to themselves and prefer not to be caught in the act .
Goebbels and his machine were n't negligible in the least in the Nazi consolidation of power .
In fact , they were crucial .
And , yes , I think " sick " people tend to be the ones who gravitate toward demogogy , and , if they are effective , they infect the society .

Trust me I 've seen this before .
I should know because I am TS .
1 - She has obviously had plastic surgery with one famous facial feminization surgeon in San Fran known for his ' cookie cutter ' faces .
Unfortunately ( for Ann ) while it can fool most of the world , it does n't fool most of us who know the real deal .
2 - She to my knowledge does not have much of a researchable past ...hmmmmmmm
3 - She has the hostility of a what we call a ' late transitioner ' someone who spent most of their life accumulating wealth as a male then decides one day to have sex reassignment .
She does n't know when to put her sword down and relax and enjoy her new femininity .
4 - She attacks everyone in hopes that it takes the focus off of her .
5 - She is very critica of gays and ' other deginerates ' as she says .
Again it is a hallmark of conservative late transitioning white TS women who have led white male priviledge all their lives only to find out oooops ....
I almost feel sorry for her ... but nah , the bitch gets everything she deserves !

I guess if they could , they would rewrite the 10 commandments to say " Love only thy conservative christian neighbor and kill the others " .
Ann Coulter is just an extreme example of the problem Bush 's has created in the last 5 years .

If Ann wants to do something constructive for a change , she might announce that she 's donating the profits from her next book to the Anorexia Foundation .
This might help prevent other young girls with anorexic and bulemic personalities from visiting their angst on people they do n't know through reckless and mean - spirited attacks .

As a part - time centrist , part - time liberal , I read with pleasure about Borcher 's attempt to reawaken the conscience of the Conservative movement .
I had , frankly , despaired of finding such people on the Right ; and without people of conscience on both " sides " , there can be no meaningful dialogue between the two .
( People of conscience on the Left have gotten harder to identify , too , since at least the Monicagate . )
Brad , thank you for bringing Borcher to our attention , especially in this context .

I think people exposing Ann Coulter are correct .
She had made many contradictions and is a Bush follower for the most part .
She does n't discuss much about the civil liberty problems with George W. Bush and other real issues in this nation .
She is right on a few issues , but her many outrageous comments ruining the rest of the limited credibility that she possessed .
As for religion , many folks have always distorted religion to achieve an end .
I do n't even consider many extremists a spokesman for any sincere religious individual .
Many folks do n't want to mention the Atheistic Communists genocide of millions of people in Russia and China .
Ann Coulter is caught up in the Left / Right paradigm .
She does n't look at Bush being part of the Bohemian Grove and Skulls and Bones , the evidence pointing to the inside job of 9/11 ( proven by folks like WINGTV , Alex Jones , etc. ) , the CIA leak scandal , the depopulation agenda , Big Brother , how the government trained many " terrorists " before , and the evil Neo - Con agenda threatening the world .
The Project for a New American Century outline that rather clearly .
The corporate media including tools and puppets like Bill O'Reilly , Sean Hannity , Rush Limbaugh , etc. may feed some people spin , but honorable people can learn the real truth and counterract this savage agenda .

Speaking of vitrol and hate - mongering and the like ..
It 's been said on this blog ( in a different , likely dead - ish thread ) that there 's good reason for invading Iraq ..
The quote used was " he gassed 300,000 of his own people .. he 's a mass murderer !" .. coupled with the reports of " shredders " and rape - rooms and other forms of killing , one would be led to believe he killed .. well .. near millions ?
or near a million ?
or 700,000 ? or what ?
The " implication " of " gassed 300,000 " when we know he killed other people in other ways causes confusion ( and right - wing distraction ) .
This article shows that the right - wing is " abusing the numbers " .. he " gassed 5,000 " .. in the decades ( what , 20 years ? ) he 's been around , he 's killed 300,000 total .. that 's what , 15,000 a year ?
1250 a month , on average ?
Given a dictator who 's fighting millions to keep his power , that hardly seems " overly different " than - any other evil dictatorship out there -.. does it ?
Does that mean I think what he did is ok ?
not at all ..
I think it 's unacceptable when a government kills it 's own people for greed and gain ..
Um .. oops ?
isnt ' letting thousands of people a year die from starvation , poor housing conditions , lack of medical care , etc .. is n't that bad ?
How many people are dying from cancer from tabacco ?
and we still sell cigarettes ?
still SUBSIDISE tabacco crops ?
Ca n't the government say " that product is killing large numbers of the population .
Make the product safe in 2 years or quit selling your poison " ..
I mean , is n't the FDA responsible for that ?
What about the EPA LYING to us about the air after Sept. 11 , 2001 so it would n't impact the economy ?
Sent people back into a TOXIC environment ..
What about during the First Gulf War when the U.S. sent troops into areas with dangerous gasses and never told them , and never had them put on their protective gear ?
My point is , when our government lies to us to pull at our " heart strings " so they can manipulate us to give them what they want , they are n't much better than Saddam ..
In fact , I 'd say they are worse ..
Saddam at least made sure everyone knew he did n't mind going out and killing them ..
not like our government that kills us for profit and lies about it so it can keep doing it over and over .
This post is kind of an explination of why I dislike people like Ann , Limbaugh , Hannity , Savage , O'Reilly , etc. etc. .
They are the people that spin and lie and refuse to have honest debates about things based in fact .
Almost - every - time you bring up a valid point worth debating , they jump the track to a different subject .. why ?
So they can feed the right - wing .. the ignorant , spineless , discompassionate , hate - mongering , greedy , elitists who believe they are entitled to more than " those guys " .. and do their damdest to take it .
Now they run the country full - on .. and look what a mess they 're making .
Defunding social programs at record rates , rolling back environmental protections at record rates , and giving money to their corperate buddies at record rates ..
Funny , the SAME thing Republicans have been doing for decades , just to the extreme now that they have a full majority .

Several of us on this blog , and others on other blogs , have been pointing out for years that the neoCon phenomenon is nothing more than a symbotic relationship .
They attached to the GOP because they were more suseptible , had just come into power , and power is what the neoCons are wild - eyed about .
There is nothing wrong with a political party wanting to win ... it is natural .
And the neoCons used that natural want to corrupt the right side into wrong , criminal pursuits .
" Something is wrong and we must fix it " is the time - worn path to goodness and badness .
In this case the neoCons got firmly entrenched into the GOP , so that now when the sane republicans have seen the light , extracating the neoCon from their midst is going to hurt .
It may hurt very bad .
Nevertheless we see signs that the republican moderates are going to do just that .
Even the conservatives ( " true conservatives " ) are in on this movement to cleanse the neoCons from the GOP .
Good luck to the moderate republicans and conservative republicans ... ridding themselves of the criminals would be good for america .
And American comes first ... before dems , repubs , indys , and greens .

The secret of Ann Coulter�s success ?
Ann Coulter is just the latest in a long line of �shock� performers �and make no mistake , Coulter is a performer first and foremost .
She comes from the same lineage as Morton Downey Jr. , Andrew Dice Clay , and Howard Stern .
Her �shtick� is to be as provocative and outrageous as she can get away with .
She�s a female shock jock masquerading as a political pundit .
Coulter astutely saw an opening on the political right for her act .
The left was already overcrowded with Hollywood �s beautiful people .
Attractive actresses and celebrities invariably take up liberal causes .
If she had gone left , Coulter would have been lost in the sauce .
So Coulter looked to the right �at the balding , overweight , bespectacled commentators �and saw her market .
A relatively attractive woman like Coulter clearly stood out in the crowd of Pat Buchanan , George Will and John McLaughlin .
She played her self - conscious sex appeal against those stodgy old boys and found an audience .
In her leather boots and mini-skirts , Coulter created the persona of the longhaired provocative �babe on the right � who could always be counted on to get the controversy going .
She made for good theater .
People like Bill Maher were as responsible as anyone for creating Coulter .
On his � Politically Incorrect � show , Maher frequently rolled out Coulter to counteract the inevitable liberal Hollywood celebrities .
Without Coulter , Maher would have been stuck with gorgeous Hollywood airheads debating fat old men .
Why should anyone be surprised that legitimate conservatives are distancing themselves from Coulter ?
Coulter knows her primary role is to liven things up and keep the circus going .
That is what keeps getting her booked on television .
She has never been taken seriously as a political commentator .
But as a self - promotion genius , she ranks up there with Madonna .

Amen to what # 36 Nonny Mouse writes .
Welcome , Mr. Borchers , to a cooperative albeit spirited opportunity for REAL discussion .
As a lifelong bleeding heart , I have always felt that those of us from different political persuasions have more in common than our politicians portray .
Divisiveness is a political game .
We should stop playing it .
As a country , we , conservatives , liberals and everything inbetween ( which describes most of us : bits of everything ) all share the same issues .
While we may differ on how we address those issues , there is no doubt in my mind that we can find good ( not lowest common demoninator ) paths by working together .
Mr. Borchers , you do n't know how long folks like me have been waiting to have a civil dialogue with folks like you .
Thank you for coming forward .
And , by the way , nothing that takes place in this country makes me gloat .
I am too filled with the shame of Abu Ghraib , Gitmo , Katrina and the overall corruption of the current administration .
Even if the entire administration were frogmarched to prison --- which I think should happen --- I will weep for my country .
As for those interested in , er , shall we say , " intimate encounters " with Ms. Coulter , I suggest that one consider that she , on multiple occasions , loudly proclaimed how hard it was to get " a decent lay . "
She may be as hateful in the boudoir as she is on TV .
And what would one do for foreplay ?
Waterboard non-Christian babies ?
Watch reruns of NOLA ?
Surely , one can do better than [ image intentional ] joust at windmills .

I am fascinated by medical oddities , particularly those pertaining to sex .
I would love believe that the Adam 's apple means something , but is n't it possible that this protuberance is so noticeable because of her weight problem ?
Al Franken , in his " Lies " book , devoted several chapters to Coulter and ascertained that she had two driver 's licenses with a different age on each .
Of course , she now claims the younger one is correct .
( She is well over 40 . )
She grew up in Connecticut .
Surely there is a high school yearbook , a debate team , a prom picture ?
If she is a genetic male , I would suspect Androgen Intolerance Syndrome , a genetic condition in which the body is incapable of using male hormones .
The affected individual will never devlop male characteristics in the womb .
Female primary sex traits are also absent , but the secondary ones blossum nicely at puberty : ample bosom , small waist , etc .
Also the person will never have acne or thinning hair , as these are caused by male homones in both sexes .
An historical example of a suspected case is Wallis Simpson , the Duchess of Windsor .
Anyway , only genetic males are subject to AIS , and though they can never be physical men , even with surgery ( because no amount of hormones will work ) , they still have the Y chromosome and a certain je ne sais quois about them .
Maybe someone should examine the area around her seat the next time she appears in public to see if they can find a hair sample for a DNA test .

This is why the country is doomed and has been doomed for about a century .
Because people endlessly debate over which political party should be in charge of the mass enslavement .
Conservative no longer has any real political meaning , nor do the terms liberal and progressive .
These are all nonsense words that infantile slaves banter about .
There is only freedom and tyranny , modern day political terms only serve to keep people confused and perpetually debating over how much better their enslavement would be if their dear leaders the ____s were in charge .
Rather than being individuals that think for themselves most people are content to join a team -- politics has become like sports .
The modern day scourge of collectivism has all the fat , stupid , beer swilling TV addled morons acting like the sedated lab rats in a cage that the global elite view them to be .
The human race loves hellish totalitarianism , it always has .
The aeons pass , the heavens swirl , poles shift , the empires rise and fall but the core belief of the masses remains the same : the human race is like an ant hill , we work , we consume , we die , and we exist only to serve the Queen .
A key example of this is the poll of people mentioned above where so many contemptible fools want government healthcare .
There 's the collectivistic programming of the mass media and government brainwashing system known as public education asserting its dominion over the feeble minds of the hoi polloi .
The State is not god and has no right to STEAL from me .
But nothing has changed as I said , the constellations may move into new positions but human nature never changes .
Humans demand enslavement and call it freedom .
The horror of such a death - care system boggle the sane mind -- euthanasia , forced abortions , waiting lists a light year long to get some worthless " doctor " who knows absolutely nothing about how to keep the patient well .
So count this Hyperindividualist out of this false paradigm of perpetual enslavement , the living death of collectivism .
Anyone who still thinks there is such a thing as right vs. left is a fool marching into oblivion -- the heroin junkie tripping out in his own world makes more sense than those lunatics .
So yes , Ann Coulter is wrong , this required no power point presentation0 -- so is Al Franken ; so are the progressives ... but the majority of humanity , much like the USA itself , is utterly doomed to the Brave New World Order Big Brother control grid nightmare .

I think a national airing of that might explain a lot to the American people . "
Exactly ..
And , that 's why I suggested in the other thread that we " prosecute all the ' people ' who drive Corperations " when they do things wrong .
You can't leave those people in charge , they say " the company did it , not me ..
I 'm just doing my job " .. bullshit ..
We need to fix this mess .. and soon ..
It ' not always the big guys .
I 've been taken by more plumbers , mechanics , roofers , car salesmen , etc ..... and it 's up close !
It 's not corporate culture ... it's ALL the culture .

Another reason Western Civilization is doomed -- adults act and think like children in a sex obsessed way that 's just pitiful .
Let 's face it , this civilization has a government of the scum by the scum and for the scum .

Who is Borchers kidding ?
Conservativism is all about deregulation and privatization --- Every Man for Himself .
Liberalism is about government 's role in safeguarding the public interest --- We 're All in the Same Boat .
All things considered , Ann Coulter is the perfect spokesmodel for conservatism .

Brenda ..
Your " resolution " may be the problem .. the " monitor size " does n't determine how a page fits ( or does n't ) ..
Granted , some of it can be fixed in HTML , but most is from a " too low resolution " standpoint ..
Brad can't fix that .
I 'd suggest a 1024×756 for 19 " , at the smallest .. some like 1200 ×1024 , or , if you have good eyes , 1600 × 1200 .
800×600 is way too low of a resolution for thtat big of a screen ..
640×480 is insane .. just a thought .. I run 1024×756 on my 19 " , no problems at all .. oh , and I run netscape .. not sure if that matters ..

Where were these people back in 1980 when the " new " right took over their party ?
Now we will have the new and improved " Oh , but that was n't me that wrecked the nation and took the world to hell " conservatives .
Bullshit .
The folks doing this vid may have been standing up for a long time and good for them but they are not the norm .
The " conservative " movement has cheered Coulter on with very few exceptions .
Coulter does n't do anything that is n't much different from what Rush does .
Savage ?
Hannity ?
O'Reilly ?
the list is endless .
Coulter is the norm .
All of them say these same things .
They may hide them a smidgen better but they say these same things and believe them .
Ann Coulter IS conservatism .
That is who they are .
Yes , this is a good sign but liberals better damn well not let conservatives morph into looking like something they 're not and never will be in our lifetime .
If you so much as call yourself conservative today , YOU are the cause of our nation 's and the world 's problems .
That is n't " blaming America first " , that is where the leaders you have chosen have taken us .
Conservative leaders , all of them not just the president , conservtaive leaders who LOVE Rush and Savage and Coulter talk , have turned our great nation into " thugland . "

Jeepers Conrad , a little dispondant ?
Sure , lots of peopel suck .. they 're lazy and ignorant .. but , you 're suggesting returning to " a state of nature " .. in that condition , nothing happens .
We all run around killing animals for meat , picking berries for food , sticking our winkies in any woman we can to breed , and kill each other all willy - nilly for stomping grounds and mating rights ..
Like all the rest of the animals ( and even THEY have societies in some sense .. only , their government is run by whom ever can beat their chest the best , or kill anyone who tries to take their women ) .
Our job as " intelligent beings " is to find a way to live - despite - our animal nature .
Consumerism is the problem .. the idea that " buying is all that 's important " .
It causes people to satisfy their hedons for no apparent reason other than they are " supposed to " ..
Corperations specialize in building things in a context of perpetual upgrading , or replacing from breakage or outdatedness ( typewritters are all but obsolete with the advent of the computer , for example ) .
Living in the State of Nature would never allow for technilogical advances either .
No blogging , no advanced medical treatments , no abundant food supplies .. no trips to the moon .. we 'd still be thinking " why is the man in the moon spying on us ? " ..

Savanster , just one thing --- in the animal kingdom you will not find murder ... except in the ape family .
I agree with you that consumerism is one of our serious downfalls .
Aother is the attitude that it's ok to cheat if nobody catches you - this attitude is rampant in our country today .
Corporations are run by PEOPLE who have made a choice as to which path they will follow --- that of ethical or that of unethical decisions .
We should n't allow Corporations to be thought of as detached from that simple truth .

" Savanster , just one thing --- in the animal kingdom you will not find murder ... except in the ape family .
" Actually , murder is kind of common ..
Lions killing young for breeding purposes .. for example .
There are more and more species found to " murder " , it 's still an " uncommon ( to rare ?
lots of species out there ) practice " in the animal world though ..
It used to be thought that the Apes were the only animal family that actually " waged war " though ..
But , some new studies , I thought , showed that there are a limited number of species that wage war as well .. though , " group combat " for territory is n't exactly the same as " waging war " , but it 's pretty close ..
I 've not done any research on this for a long time ..
This might be a good time to get back into it It 's funny though .. some of the premises we used to hold as ( sometimes bad ) examples of what makes us " stand out " are n't really there ..
We really are just more animals roaming around the big blue ball ..
I think music / art / literature are the only things that we have that other animals do n't .. the things that require both higher reasoning and opposable thumbs ..
I do n't think we - know - if we 're the only critters with higher reasoning .. we - think - we are , but I 'd say the jury is still out on that ..

True , but corporate structure makes it so easy to be unethical .
In fact , we have been subject to corporate culture for so long that ethical principles are not real or are quaint or are made hypocritical to those immersed in it .
We have seen empirical evidence of this .
( As if we could n't have seen it in the age of the robber barons ! )
I think Ambrose Bierce had it right a long time ago .
He said a corporation is " " an ingenious device for obtaining individual profit without individual responsibility . "
That 's the horror of what is happening to the world in a nutshell .
Individual responsibility fades away .
( And the " conservatives " say they advocate individual responsibility .
I think they had better think this over . )
Here 's a good speech about " commons " and corporations - which , IMO , radiate out into democracy and oppression , self - worth and commodification .

Gotta weigh in as another tranny who thinks Ann Coulter is one .

Or someone who thought she was one .
Physical cues aside , you can tell from her style of wit , her fixation on violence , and the fact that she 's literally trying to * destroy * anything that connects her with the source of her pain .
She 's trying to identify with the oppressors using her wealthy privilege , only it 's not enough , so she continues to try and get the approval of the people she feared and has become .

No Savanster I 'm not despondent , merely a realist .
Nor do I advocate a return to savagery , just a way out of it .
The things you mentioned : " We all run around killing animals for meat , picking berries for food , sticking our winkies in any woman we can to breed , and kill each other all willy - nilly for stomping grounds and mating rights ... only , their government is run by whom ever can beat their chest the best , or kill anyone who tries to take their women . " are exactly the things the human race currently engages in -- particularly the government !
I advocate a return to freedom , a sort of neo-tribalism where everything is decentralized ( like the blogosphere ) and governments are very small and easily stomped under freedom 's foot if need be .
As it is now , we are all totally enslaved .
There is no real freedom in the world today .
If the human race is indeed just a pack of advanced animals descended from primordial slime , then there 's absolutely no reason to change .
We all might as well rape , pillage and have a grand old time until we croak .
As a mass of unintelligent beings the smart among us have the job of trying to survive and crush everything that 's wrong with the world , and if that means an end to welfare , public education , big government , federal taxation , and all corporations then I 'm all for it .
Corporations are not compatible with a free market .
If only that scumbag puppet FDR had n't wrecked the free enterprise system ... Clinton is scum , Bush is scum and there is a massive conspiracy to murder and enslave all of humanity .
The sooner the moronic right vs. left cult members understand the reality of the conspiracy , the sooner some people can get their freedom back .
Freedom is taken by force .
The elite have taken their freedom at the expense of the dumbed down masses .
There is only force in the universe .
There is the force of subatomic matter , there is the force of the elite who will impose slavery on an easily duped rabble , and there 's the force of some people who are sick of being slaves .
Force is energy in motion , for every action an equal and opposite reaction .
I want critical mass and would embrace it any day over the docility of complacent popular culture , which is artificially engineered using Frankurt School methods .
The Neocons are merely a continuation of the same cabal that McCarthy so bravely went after .
There are other 21 year olds like me who know that the world is run by scumbags and that that 's the historical norm -- it 's part of the pathology of power -- and we 're sick of it .
There 's a continuum of corruption that is totally ignored by democrat , republican , and progressive cult members .
Government has usually been another word for crime syndicate throughout history -- of the scum by the scum and for the scum .

While I agree Ann is most likely Trans I do not agree with your assertation that any man who would be with a post op transwoman is gay .
Here is why : Gay are men attracted to men .
Period .
Trans is not the ' slippery slope ' to being gay .
It 's not a ' gateway sexuality or lifestyle ' .
It is the outward manifestation of one 's gender identity .
While ann has masculine characteristics ( as do many non-trans women ) and is likely trans , many young post op trans women including myself are not as masculine .
http://www.the-backups.com/ingenuej.jpg
My boyfriends were not attracted to me because I looked or sounded like a man , but rather the opposite .
There heterosexuality remains intact and my current boyfriend and I are due to marry in January .
The difference is non-trans masculine looking women tend to shy away from thigh high boots and mini skirts as they are a little more self conscious of things like a bony boyish build , masculine face .
and adams apple .
That said quite a few trans women I have come across exhibit the physical and mental characteristics as Ann .
Many of these women were led lives of priviledge before they changed sex and remained Republican , Conservative and often they will talk against ethnic minorities and gays to take the heat and attention off of themselves .
The reason this rumor persists than Ann is Trans is because I am not the only to notice this .
To Blitz : I have seen MANY transsexuals , I know a transwoman when I see one , even many most non trans people would never be able to tell .
Until you have been to Thailand and can spot every TS ( as I have done ) you can not tell me that Ann is not transsexual .
She tips off EVERYONE who is not from middle america who have actually met transsexuals , trannie radar .
Ann has the voice , build and face of a late transitioning TS woman and a chip on her shoulder reflecting an inability to leave behind her white male priviledge .
Look I would n't pick on her if she was n't such an arrogant bitch but too often people like me : Black , Poor and Trans are the ones who are at the receiving end of her and people like her 's hate ( see : http://www.rememberingourdead.org for examples ) .
I do n't mind her being trans other than she is an embarrassment to transwomen .
I DO mind her advocating murder , torture and disasterous policies which are ruining my country ( yes it is MY country too ) .
If she left us alone we 'd leave her alone .
Until then I believe a DNA test is a good idea .
If nothing else it would resolve the question once and for all .

All very true , Jasmine .
Of course , it 's possible she 's just a self - hating abused anorexic rich girl with * other * body image issues and thus is fixated on pleasing the bad guys ....
That profile could fit , too .
What I 'm afraid of is that , after she 's done all this dirty work , her worshippers will turn around and turn her into a big * anti- trans backlash * while never reevaluating what they cheered her on for saying as part of what happens to people they 're still determined to hurt .
Kinda like Rush and the drugs thing .
I mean , it seems she really has enough money that she * could * be one of those mythical people who really thought changing sex was a good way to avoid the stigma of being gay .
Of course , this only adds up in the world of those very , very few with enough money to really bypass all the things that make this a ridiculous proposition indeed .
I just think maybe it 's Occam 's Razor time .
She 's * that * type of rich tranny who gets all the cosmetics and legal work done , then becomes a horrible transphobe and general reactionary without ever dealing with her issues .
That , after all , is what her brand of right wing is all about :
Make villains , impose violence , impose religion , Big Lie , ... and never deal with the issues ... even if you 're cruising toward a really big and embarrassing collapse .

... Savantster said on 10/21/2005 @ 6:20 pm PT ...
Ah .. Conrad .. now I get better insight into your thoughts ..
I too was once 21 .. and full of spit and fire .. when I was talking about " killing beasts for meat " , I did n't mean " corperate farming " , I mean running around the woods / jungle / plains trying to kill a deer with your hands .. knife , spear , bow , what have you .. picking berries as in fill you pocket for dinner .. then have to do it tomorrow .. not massive corperate farms that produce enough food in 1 year to support 10,000 people ..
That ties back into the lack of technology .
Free Markets only work when there 's a pooling of resources .. when someone can specialize .. in a tribal world , that can't happen ..
Here 's something you 'll see as the years drag on ..
Society serves a function .
While it may be true that you would " feel freer " in certain circumstances , in the long run , you 'd be at great risk .
Your tribal society ( which , let 's say for the sake of argument is happy and hunkydory ) would encounter those who decided not to be tribal .. who joined forces to ward off some threat and liked the results ..
They went out to other tribes and absorbed them in too .. had more land , more people , more resources ..
Now that " multi- grouped " tribe comes to your shore ... on big boats with technology you do n't have because you 're tribal .. only being " free " and living on the land ..
Know what ?
that 's happened already ... here .. in the U.S ...
The people from Europe came and killed all the Native Americans so they could use the land as they saw fit ..
Governments and Societies are a natural progression to our evolution .
Individuals want protection , so they offer up something to someone bigger than them for that protection ..
That 's where we are ..
We want protection .. from Russia ... from China .. from the weather .. from cold .. from hunger .. from our neighbors , in a lot of cases ..
Government is a concept ..
and in " concept " , a " good " thing ( well , the vision is for it to act for good .. it 's actually neutral ..
a non-entity like a company , or a rock .. it 's there .. a tool to be used ) .
You talk about Free Market like it 's some how a magical thing that is self regulating and " good " .. but it too , is just a tool .. and used by bad people , will do bad things ..
Just like Corperations today .. the " people " make it bad ..
A company can be a - great - thing .. it can do wonderful things , if used for good .
When it 's used by some super - rich guy to make his pockets fuller , when that 's his - only - goal , it 's a bad thing ..
But , here 's the shitty part .
Government is - supposed - to be protecting us from that .
The job of the Government is clearly defined , especially in the U.S .
The problem , as you point out , is that bad people use it for bad things .
Without Government , most of what we have to day would n't exist .. now or ever ..
In small splintered groups , we do n't have the collective manpower and knowhow to " advance " ..
What we need now is .. we need to wake our fellow Americans the fuck up ..
They are asleep at the wheel , intoxicated by toys and goodies and fear .
They consume to fill some void ..
" OH !
If I just get that NEW CAR !
Life will be great !
I 'll get laid ..
I 'll get friends ..
I 'll party all the time ..
I 'll get a raise .. the T.V. implied it !"..
Then there 's the side " If he has that and I know I 'm better than him , I better buy something bigger ! " .
Then , today ( more now than ever before in history .. ever .. ) , we have " debt " .. lots of it .. more and more and more .. and that brings fear .. " oh shit .. if I say anything about politics at work that my boss does n't like it , he can fire me ( woot !
gotta love " no fault states " ) .. then I can't pay for that car I got that I did n't need but wanted to have to get laid .. that 'll suck !" ..
Or worse " Man , if I get fired I 'll lose the house and car .. and can't pay the credit card bills which have last month 's food on them , and the new computer is still on it .
. and why did I buy that 60 " Plasma TV ?.. where will the wife and kids sleep ?
How are all 4 of us gonna fit in the Honda with the dog ? " ..
See , these are real fears as you start to " accumulate wealth " .
Governments are meant to help protect that .. but have been used by bad people to limit the protections for " us " and maximize protections ( and profits and all that ) for themselves .
The only solution is for us to get people to get out of their sleepy haze .
They need to start learning how to think again .. need to start understanding that their apathy - is - hurting them , - is - making them slaves , as you point out .
Most people do n't see it .. well , they do n't admit it to themselves ...
Most people , in my expierence , are too simple - minded to handle the truth .
It 's easier to just close their eyes and keep consuming , hoping the next thing they buy will be what it takes to " make them happy " ..
I do n't know ..
With all the " not too bright " people I 've met , I do n't hold much hope that we 'll be able to " peacfully " hold back the tide .. part of the problem is , the rich and right - wing are trying to do exactly what you suggest .. cut off welfare , medicare , support networks for the poor ..
Problem is , the poor are mostly poor because the rich are " clinical " and insanely greedy ..
What the hell does Bill Gates need with $ 51 billion in personal assets ?
I 'm guessing there 's an obsessive - compulsive disorder there , and the fixation is money ..
Most rich folks are like that .
What most people refuse to see is ( even your " free market " would die here .. ) , there are only so many resources to go around .
When 90 % of all that there is to " have " is tied up with 10 % of the population , that does n't leave much for the rest of us .
Which is exactly what Government " of the people , by the people , for the people " is supposed to mitigate .
But , you 're right .. that 's not what we have .
What we have NOW is , Government of the " greedy corperate boards " by the " semi- rich obsessed with power " for the " greedy corperate boards and the top 10 % - 40 % who want free money on the backs of others " ..
Fix that to be what it 's supposed to be , and that freedom you think is " missing " will be back .
Sure , we 'll be slaves to the machine in a limited sense .. but it 's either that with nice toys and technology , or slaves to our stomachs need of shelter ..
You pick ..

I see nothing wrong with picking berries and hunting deer .
That 's self sufficiency , that 's they individuals are supposed to live .
I 'm not saying there 's anything wrong with certain modes of farming .
The two methods of getting food are not mutually exclusive , that 's the nature of true freedom -- it is n't a single form imposed upon all system .
I used the term " neo " - tribalism to differentiate it from the primitive variety .
The word " society " is another nonsense word .
There is no such thing as society , it 's a collective abstraction that can mean almost anything depending on whomever is using it .
Usually the term society is just another way to say conform .
Thoreau was correct when he said that society everywhere was a conspiracy against the individual .
As to resources , you 're wrong .
It is not a zero sum situation .
We have limitless resources , and as beneficial technology progresses there are limitless ways to go about utilizing them .
There is no " right wing " .
There is no " left wing " .
There are just power mad freaks , the dullards they control , and those who resist .
Now not all of those that resist are 100 percent , most of that category is totally wro
But across the political spectrum there is concern that the hoarding of information could backfire .
Thomas H. Kean , chairman of the Sept. 11 commission and a former Republican governor of New Jersey , said the failure to prevent the 2001 attacks was rooted not in leaks of sensitive information but in the barriers to sharing information between agencies and with the public .
" You 'd just be amazed at the kind of information that 's classified -- everyday information , things we all know from the newspaper , " Mr. Kean said .
" We 're better off with openness .
The best ally we have in protecting ourselves against terrorism is an informed public . "
Mr. Kean said he could not legally disclose examples he discovered of unnecessary classification .
But others cite cases of what they call secrecy running amok : the Central Intelligence Agency 's court fight this year to withhold its budgets from the 1950's and 60's ; the Defense Intelligence Agency 's deletion of the fact that the Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was interested in " fencing , boxing and horseback riding " ; and the Justice Department 's insistence on blacking out a four - line quotation of a published Supreme Court decision .
Secrecy has long been denounced by liberal watchdog groups like the American Civil Liberties Union .
But more conservatives are emerging as skeptics , including Senator John Cornyn , Republican of Texas , whose bill to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act passed the Senate last week .
The bill , cosponsored by Senator Patrick J. Leahy , Democrat of Vermont , requires that any legislation creating new exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act explicitly disclose them .
It is only part of overhaul efforts proposed by the two .
Mr. Cornyn , a former state attorney general , said he had been trying to persuade his colleagues that freedom of information was not just a concern of the news media .
" The people should get the information they need to see if government is doing what they want , " he said .

質問と回答 ：
いえ。ハッカーというのは、メディアの報道に反して、コンピュータに侵入する人間のことではありません。そうした手合はクラッカーです。ハッカーはコンピュータと戯れる人達です。あなたが雇っているハッカーは時折安全対策を出し抜いたりしますが、これに悪意はないのです。セキュリティがそれなりのものである場合に特にそうしたがるわけで、これはすなわち好奇心ゆえなのです。
仕事に依ります。ハッカーはある仕事においては非ハッカーよりも劇的に有能たりえるし、そうでなければ劇的に劣ってしまいます。ハッカーが特に得意とする仕事は、
システム管 理
プログラミン グ
デザイン
ハッカーが特に不得手とする仕事は、
データ入 力
大体において、迅速さや予期せぬ変化、傑出した技能を必要とし、余り繰り返しのない仕事というのが、ハッカーが秀でるところです。繰り返しが多い単調な仕事は優れたハッカーを無駄にし、あなたが雇っているハッカーを退屈させ欲求不満にさせるでしょう。退屈で欲求不満ではよく働いてはくれませんよね。
ありがたいことに、ハッカーを彼が特に好むところに置いてやれば、しばしば「平均的な」労働者のおよそ５倍から１０倍もの成績を上げるのを目の当たりにするでしょう。これは首尾一貫しておらず、毎度それを期待すべきではないのですが、往々にして起きることです。これは特に困難な仕事を与えたときに最も目にします。
猫を飼うのと同じ要領です。いくらか困惑するでしょう。彼らは他の大部分の労働者と毛色が異なるわけですから。でも心配無用！
あなたのところのハッカーは、もし求められたら、問題への解を進んで提案してくれるでしょう。多くのハッカーはほとんど自己管理がなってます。
本当 に「１０倍」と申しました。そうです、私は真剣です。好調時のハッカーなら、二三ヶ月で、小規模な開発グループ（７、８人の）が団結しながらも一年以上苦労しているものを作りうるのです。人によりますから、あなたのところのハッカーがそこまですごいかどうかはわかりませんが。
IBM はかつて、特定のプログラマーが他の労働者の１００倍、もしくはそれ以上の生産性を示したことを報告しました。この種のことが起こるのです。
今のとこまだです。当面は、 「 New Hacker 's Dictionary 」（下記参照 、 「ジャーゴン・ファイル」として知られている）を、特にアペンディクスをチェックしてください。全体にハッカーの思考法の説明と細目でいっぱいです。
よくあることです。あなたの雇ったハッカーは、ハッカーと仲良くやれる人間を見つけてないのかもしれません。あなたとしては在宅勤務やフレックス勤務（夜型への移行）を提案することを考えてみてはどうでしょう。そうしてみれば生産性が向上するかもしれません。さもなくば他のハッカーを雇うことですね。
あなたのところのハッカーは団体における風采の重要性をとてもよく理解してますよ。つまりそれが仕事の助けにはならないということをです。IBM、フォード、そしてマイクロソフトもみんな、従業員が望む服装をさせるのが仕事にもよいことを認識してますよ。あなたのところのハッカーはその人にとって気持ちのよい服装をしているのです。特別な機会にはいくらかドレスアップするよう礼儀正しく要求するのはもっともなことで、殆どのハッカーは丁重に求められれば、快活に（意図せざる）穴のあいてない服を着てくれます。
ハッカーは肩書きに敬意を払いません。ハッカーというのは、マネージメントがエンジニアリングの「上位」にくるなんて思わないのです。つまり、彼らにとってマネージメントというのはある役目を果たすことであって、エンジニアリングもまたしかりです。彼らはあたかもマネージメントが彼らの下位にあるかのような口振りをすることも多分頻繁にあるかもしれませんが、これは実際公平だといえます。つまり、あなたの問いによると、あなたはエンジニアリングがあなたの下位にあるかのようにほのめかしてるからです。ハッカーを対等な存在として扱うことです。そうしたら、彼女も恐らくはあなたを対等な存在として扱うでしょう。全く光栄なことではないですか！
あなたの雇っているハッカーをわきに連れて行き、現在の仕事のおかしいところを詳しいところまで助言を求めるのです。何か問題があるのかもしれません。大抵の場合うまくいっているという事実に騙されてはいけません。あなたのとこのハッカーは、その問題が全てを破綻させてしまうという事実が気になっているのかもしれません。彼はパフォーマンス、信頼性、そして他の主要点について劇的に向上させる改良点を指摘できるかもしれません。これは調べてみる価値があります。
あなたはあなたのとこのハッカーに説得してもう少し礼儀正しくするようにさせることができるかもしれませんが、もし彼と他の従業員との間で大きな見解の相違があるようならば、あなたが現在抱えるスタッフの一人、もしくはそれ以上が無能である、ということも大いにありうることです。勿論のこと、ハッカーは他の多くの人達とは能力の基準が違うことに注意してください（「基準が違う」を「基準がより高い」と読みかえてもよいです）。
ハッカー、作家、そして画家は皆「浸透」のために費やす時間がいくらか必要で、彼らの潜在意識の働きを問題に向けるために何か他のことをしているのです。あなたのとこのハッカーは多分何か困難に突き当たっているのでしょう。心配には及びません。
あなたのとこのハッカーは、多分一人で、ビッグ・プロジェクトに従事していて、それは始まったばかり、でよろしいですか？
彼女は多分その全容をあらかじめ理解しようとしているのです。彼女に進捗を尋ねてみてください。もし彼女が次々とセンテンスを話しだすが、「いや、待って・・・」とか「ちぇっ、上手くいかないぞ」といった言葉で中断するようなら、順調です。
いいえ、あなたのとこのハッカーは色々なやり方で気晴らしをし、物事を考える必要があるのです。気晴らしをしないより、した方がより生産的であるでしょう。あなたのとこのハッカーは仕事を楽しんでます。合理的にかつ迅速に仕事がなされるかについて心配することはありません。
その職責を果たす必要があるのですか？ 自分は問題を解けるが他の誰もそれを解けない場合、問題を解くことに抵抗できるハッカーはほとんどいません。この場合、あなたのとこのハッカーは仕事をうまくやってますか？
もしそうなら、そうした行動を（あなたへの）無償のサービス、チップと考えてみて下さい。それは協定にはないかもしれないが、いくばかりか助力にはなるでしょう。
幸せそうですね。多分以下の三つのいずれかなのでしょう：
基本的な職責が周期的なもの（電話サポート、文書調査など）で、次に来る仕事までの小康状態である。心配御無用です！
あなたのとこのハッカーは困難な問題に突き当たっている。
あなたのとこのハッカーはひどく退屈していて、娯楽を見つけようとしている。できましたら、あなたはよりやりがいのある仕事を見つけてやるべきではないでしょうか？
以上の要素のいずれかがあてはまるのかもしれません。全部があてはまるのかもしれません。一般に、もし仕事にやりがいがあり、うまくいっているなら、そのプロセスについて心配することはありません。ハッカーが書いた本にクレジットが与えられるようかけあってみては如何でしょう。
あなたは本当に、既に何かをやってしまった労働者より、現在うまくやっている労働者を求めているのですか？
エゴなんて職場で重視するものではないでしょう。もし連中がうまくできてないのなら、連中ができる仕事を割り当てることです。
素晴らしい！ 多くのハッカーが自分の仕事と引き換えに受けたいと思うものの幾つかを以下に挙げます。
尊敬 称賛 賛辞 理解 高価なおもちゃの割引 お金
必ずしも順番通りではありません。４番目の項目（理解）が最も難しいでしょう。次回あなたのとこのハッカーが
x-trek をやって遊んでいるのを見かけたときに、ハッカーが成し遂げたいい仕事のことを思い出そうとしてください。仕事にぐちをこぼすよりは、うまくいった仕事へのボーナスとして（非公式に）与えられる「臨時収入」とみなすことです。心配御無用！
ハッカーというものは仕事をやらなければすぐに退屈してしまうものですから。
それはいけません。３０年に渡る心理学の調査によると、処罰では長期的には望ましい効果がでません。あなたのとこのハッカーは実験用ネズミではないのです（あまつさえ彼が実験用ネズミであるとしても、処罰ではうまくいかないでしょう。少なくとも、心理調査が有効な実験用ネズミの類だったとしたら）。もしあなたがそのハッカーのすることが気に食わないなら、あなたの考えを伝えることです。振る舞いについて、あなたを悩ませていることを説明するのです。
議論のための準備をすることです。あなたのとこのハッカーは道理をわきまえた存在であって、理由があったのでしょうね。彼を余りにも性急にこっぴどくしからないことです。ちゃんとした理由があったことが分かるかもしれません。
もしあなたの方が間違っていたら、素直に謝りましょう。もしあなたのとこのハッカーが非を認めても、謝罪を要求しないように。ハッカーにおいては、非を認めることは、大抵において謝罪なのです。
昇進により、他人の仕事の説明を聞くために費やす時間が増え、コンピュータと戯れる時間が減るということが往々にして起こります。あなたのとこのハッカーは現在の仕事を楽しんでいるのです。つまり、もしあなたが報酬を申し出るなら、肩書きにおける昇進、可能な給料の引き上げ、そしてちょっとした賛辞を考慮することです。あなたが彼女の業績に満足していることを確かに知らしめること、それこそが彼女が求めるものなのです。
貴社の規定はおかしいですよ。フリーランスのコンサルティングをやって、時給
200 ドル（時にはそれ以上）も稼げるハッカーもいます。あなたのとこのハッカーに、手当て付きの終身のコンサルティングの地位を申し出てもよいでしょうし、それができないのなら抜け道を探すことです。さもなければ、何か役得を見つけてやることですね。多くのハッカーは、彼らのお気に入りのメーカー製のハードウェアの割引を、印象的な昇給として喜んで受け入れるでしょう。
その部署の他のスタッフに、そのハッカーがやっている仕事や、それについての感想を尋ねなさい。恐らく、あなたのとこのハッカーは週に二三時間、他だったら高額な外部のコンサルタントが必要な、難解な質問に答えるのに費やしているのでしょう。あなたのとこのハッカーは、時間を切りつめて、オフィスまわりでもう一人分の仕事に値する職責を果たしているのかもしれません。給料分の価値のないハッカーなどごく少数です。彼らは困難な仕事を成し遂げることを楽しみ、労働者の効率を改善しているのです。
あなたのとこのハッカーは techie（技術オタク）なんです 。TNHD （
The New Hacker 's Dictionary ）のコピーをピックアップすれば間違いないでしょう。http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon（最後に私がチェックしたときには）か、品揃えのよい本屋で見つかります。そうした参考文献を理解するのが困難なら、あなたのとこのハッカーに、コピーを持ってないかとか、もし良ければ用語を説明してくれないかなと尋ねてみましょう。殆どのハッカーは専門用語を説明するのをいとわないです。恩着せがましい態度をとられるかもしれません。でもそれは彼女があなたを侮辱しようと思っているわけではないのです。あなたがその単語を知らなければ、彼女はまずそれを説明するためにレベルを落として話さなければならないのですから。
当然ながらそれは難しい単語の集まりです。なにしろ沢山ありますし、それらの単語の用法はぱっと聞いた印象よりずっとより厳密です。ハッカーは言語ゲームが好きなんです。
[ 英語があなたのとこのハッカーのネイティブな言語でないこともまたありえますし、あなた自身がそうでないかもしれません。その場合は上記の説明の
English を適当な言語に置き換えて読んで下さい。 ]
あなたのとこのハッカーは、まだその問題の困難さの程度を解析しきれていません。大部分の労働者と違い、ハッカーは問題を確かに理解したと納得できるまで、見積もりを出すことに大きな抵抗を示すでしょう。時には、理解しようとしている間に問題を解いてしまうことさえありえます。
優秀な技術者は、決して95%以上の確信を持ちません。そして大抵のハッカーは優秀な技術者です。もしあなたが、無理に見積もり通りにやらせたりはしないと言えば（しかも本気で！）、大抵の場合は、おおまかな見積もりを出してくれるんじゃないでしょうか。この見積もりはえらく高く思えたり、あるいはえらく低く思えるかもしれません。実際、その通りなのかもしれません。結局それは見積もりでしかないんですから。でもそれがあなたの欲しかったものでしょ。
もしあなたが勇敢なら、説明を求めてみては。そうしたものの殆どは説明可能です。しばらくかかるかもしれないが、おもしろさが分かるかもしれません。
コンピュータがそうするからです。あなたならそれを避けることもできますが、コンピュータは０から数え始めます。大部分のハッカーもまた、くせになっているのです。

This close - up drawing of the LET shows the ultrathin silicon junction acting as a quantum well .
After recombination , the electric carriers are confined into a standing wave , greatly increasing the electroluminescence efficiency .
Credit : Shin-ichi Saito , et al .
In one of the early discoveries of the current " silicon electrophotonics era , " scientists from Hitachi , Ltd. in Tokyo have built a light - emitting transistor ( LET ) that transfers , detects and controls an electrical signal all on a single nanometer - sized chip .
Using a silicon - on - insulator ( SOI ) substrate , the group could optically connect the LET to a detector , resulting in a tiny chip that may integrate a wide range of microelectronics and photonics nano devices .
“ With LETs , we could develop an optical interconnection beyond the present copper interconnection , ” Shin-Ichi Saito , co-author of the study in Applied Physics Letters , told PhysOrg.com .
“ If LETs are really integrated on silicon chips , we might reduce power dissipation ( since light does not have electrical resistance ) , as well as RC [ Resistive Capacitive ] delay : in electrical circuits , the interlayer coupling capacitance reduces the speed of electrical signals , while such a delay might be reduced in optical interconnections . ”
Similar to a standard field - effect transistor , Saito et al . 's LET takes advantage of some interesting properties of 2D electron and electron hole systems , called “ quantum confinement effects . ”
By reducing the thickness of the crystal silicon down to the nanometer scale , the scientists fabricated an ultra - thin single crystal silicon film , directly connected to the thick silicon electrodes .
In such a design , n- type ( electrons ) and p-type ( holes ) semiconductors lie next to each other separated by a narrow junction .
As the electrons and holes efficiently eliminate each other in a process called " recombination , " photons are emitted ; thus electrical signals can be converted to optical signals .
At left , the drawing of the LET describes the scientists ’ observation , shown in the electroluminescence intensity map at right .
The infrared light emitted from the LET reaches the detector , meaning that an electrical signal can be transferred to the detector by light .

“ With the lateral carrier injections that we used , we can efficiently inject both electrons and holes directly in the quantum confined silicon , ” said Saito .
“ Usually , nano - scale silicon structures are passivated by SiO 2 , which has huge potential barriers for carriers .
Such a limitation does not exist in our device . ”
In this set - up , the p-n junction consists of a light - emitting diode ( LED ) made of ultrathin silicon .
At a 9nm thickness , the silicon acts as a quantum well , confining the electric carriers to two dimensions , which forms a standing wave consisting of an electron .
This confinement serves an especially useful purpose for integrating optical components into silicon circuits , as it enhances the electroluminescence efficiency of the junction .
While other LETs -- from carbon nanotubes and organic models to semiconductor and nanocrystal devices -- have been demonstrated , Saito et al . 's is the first in which recombination occurs along the silicon junction and takes advantage of quantum confinement 's electroluminescence .
“ The key idea is that the 2D conduction band electrons behave just like electrons in direct band - gap semiconductors , ” said Saito .
“ In bulk Si , the conduction band electrons move very fast with a large momentum .
However , in the ultra - thin Si , the electrons cannot move perpendicular to the substrate with such a large momentum , simply because that direction is restricted .
Many people also consider that this quantum mechanical confinement plays some role for the enhanced luminescence in nano - scale silicon . ”
To optically interconnect this electrical signal from the LET to a detector -- which were electrically isolated but on the same silicon chip -- the group applied a forward voltage bias to the LET .
The scientists observed the light from the LET to reach the photodetector , and measured the " photocurrent " in the detector to increase with a voltage increase , and decrease when the voltage was turned off ( detector limitations caused some current to continue flowing ) .
Although the Hitachi group points out limitations to the present experimental set - up that need to be fixed before applying the principle to marketable technology , they suggest solutions for these problems : for example , reducing the response time of the detector and using waveguides to contain the light on the chip .
However , the achievement shows how , using curious phenomena of quantum mechanics , photons , just like electrons , can be manipulated on a silicon chip .
Quite possibly , future integrated circuits may use lights instead of currents to enhance performance while reducing power dissipation .
“ We have just confirmed the basic operation principle for this LET , ” said Saito .
“ The hope is that this is just the beginning of more research ; we have lots to do . ”

Because think about it , we have the HIGHEST infection rate IN THE WORLD .
And what 's bad is that cases still keep spiking ' til this day .
This country is doing the worst job handling this pandemic , which is pretty shameful .
And who is the leader of this country ?

The site is thought to have been the stronghold of Ajax
In Homer 's classic tale The Iliad the Achaean hero Ajax the Great fought duels with Hector in the Trojan War .
The Mycenaean - era complex found on the small island of Salamis near Athens covers about 750 sq m ( 8,070 sq ft ) .
The chief archaeologist said it was a rare case where a palace could be attributed to a famous Homeric hero .
Yiannis Lolos said travellers and archaeologists had been looking for the site " from the early 19th Century " .
The ancient complex on Salamis was built on four levels and had at least 33 rooms .
A bronze armour fragment found there was stamped with the royal mark of Pharaoh Ramses II of Egypt , who ruled in the 13th Century BC .
Salamis was also the site of a 480 BC Greek naval victory over the Persians which spelled the end of their invasion of Greece .
In Homer 's Iliad , Ajax was a great asset to King Agamemnon 's army , with a reputation for strength and courage .
At one point Ajax fought off the Trojan warriors almost single - handed , in stark contrast to his cousin Achilles , who could not be induced to fight .
The Cubic Surfaces DVD by David A. Madore
The DVD Downloading it To save server bandwidth , the DVD ISO image for burning is made available as a bit torrent : you will need a program such as BitTorrent or Azureus to download it .
Once you have BitTorrent ( or some other similar program ) installed , please give it the following link to download the image : download link for the DVD ( bit torrent file )
If you absolutely cannot use BitTorrent ( e.g. , if you are behind a fascist firewall that blocks the bit torrent protocol because it is a form of peer - to - peer ) , try downloading the previous link without the final . torrent extension in the address : this will fetch the image directly from the server .
The ISO image is 610 MB in size .
Burning it Once you have the ISO image downloaded ( it should be called cubic - dvd.iso ) , you should use some DVD burning software to rip it .
Make sure you burn the image as a raw ISO - 9660 image , do not copy this as a file on a DVD ( it is already a DVD image , not a file to be included on a DVD image ! ) .
Under Linux ( or some other Unixen ) , for example , one might use a command line such as : nice -- 18 growisofs - dvd-compat - speed=4 - Z /dev/dvd=cubic - dvd.iso .
Under Windows , these instructions might be of some help ( though they pertain to burning CD 's , I imagine that burning DVD 's has much in common ) .
Under Mac OS X , select Image then Burn Image in the Disk Copy application .
For maximal compatibility with certain standalone DVD players , it might be preferable to use a DVD −R ( as opposed to DVD +R or DVD ± RW ) medium .
This is not universally true , however ( in fact , I have observed the opposite ) ; and , of course , the medium must be appropriate for the recording drive .
Since the image is small enough to fit on a CD , you can try using that medium instead of a DVD ( but again , make sure to burn an ISO image , not a CD containing a single file ) : this might work on certain players , but it generally will not .
Your mileage may vary .
Buying it ✱
If you do n't feel like downloading and burning the DVD yourself , you can also buy it online for 4 € , thanks to Ikarios ( with whom I am not affiliated , nor do I get any profit from the sales ! ) .
Make sure to get the most recent version , though ( currently , 2006 - 10 - 22 ) .
This is mostly convenient in France , although they will also ship to other countries .
Notes on the disc 's content
The videos on the DVD are in the PAL format ( 720×576 , 25 frames per second ) which is common in Europe .
Hopefully this should not make it difficult to view the DVD elsewhere in the World .
Naturally , the image is not region - encoded , copy - protected or content - scrambled in any way .
Once you select a video from the DVD menu , it will loop forever : use the buttons on your remote control to return to the menu .
To play each video for one minute , in order , highlight the title in the DVD menu ( this is only valid starting from version 2006 - 10 - 22 of the disc ) : then you can use your remote control to switch chapters .
The version described on this page is that of 2006 - 10 - 22 .
A previous version was released on 2006 - 10 - 16 .
Version 2006 - 10 - 22 has the same videos , but differs in the following aspects : a bug was fixed which caused the highlight in the menus not to be visible on certain standalone DVD players , a title ( and indication of author 's name ) was added in the intro sequence , and the possibility was added of viewing all videos sequentially .
I plan to make a new version of the DVD , with optional subtitles describing each animation , possibly some time in the future .
For the moment , there are no comments whatsoever : please refer to the list below for a very short description of each animation .
Al Gore , former U.S. Vice President , highlighted use of space to help problem - solve Earth environmental challenges at Wirefly X Prize Cup Executive Summit 2006 .
LAS CRUCES , New Mexico - Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore has called for better use of the " space resource " to battle Earth 's climate crisis , enlisting entrepreneurial muscle to help solve global issues that threaten the planet 's habitability .
Gore said he has long been a fan of faster , cheaper , better approaches that allow the private sector to exploit the space resource " in a responsible and creative , and cost - efficient way . "
As an example , Gore spotlighted the competitive and dynamic forces unleashed by the entrepreneurial growth of the Internet .
" We ought to learn that lesson and apply it to space , " Gore said .
" Because of the environmental climate crisis , we need to speed up the introduction of private companies into the creative exploitation of the space resource . "
Gore spoke as part of a Wirefly X Prize Cup Executive Summit 2006 [ image ] , held here Oct. 19 , attended by a range of executives , visionaries and space and high - tech leaders .
Serious mistake
Labeling himself as a " recovering politician " , the former U.S. Vice President under the Clinton Administration rebuked the recently released space policy by U.S. President George W. Bush .
Gore called the newly issued Bush space policy " a move in the wrong direction " and " a very serious mistake , " and urged Summit listeners to analyze the policy " very carefully . "
" It has the potential , down the road , to create the kind of fuzzy thinking and chaos in our efforts to exploit the space resource as the fuzzy thinking and chaos that the Iraq policy has created for us in Iraq , " Gore explained .
" We need to avoid putting in place a set of policies that end up creating chaos and new obstacles for the creative exploitation of the space resource , " he added .
Gore said that the new space policy , in his view , ignores international law and consensus .
" If one nation takes it upon itself to assert its own unilateral definition of what world law should be -- without respect to what the rest of the world thinks about it - that 's usually a mistake , " Gore told Summit attendees .
" Policy matters .
Law matters .
International law matters . "
Humankind 's actions
Earth 's climate pattern is now being put at risk by humankind 's actions , Gore said .
" We face what I think should be described as a full - scale planetary emergency . "
Image 1 of 1
The Controversy
The Effects
The Possibilities
Strange Solutions
While aware such a phrase sounds shrill to many ears , Gore added that " unfortunately , I believe it is exactly dead - on accurate . "
Gore cited increases in carbon dioxide , the thickening of the atmospheric blanket enveloping Earth , rising sea levels and the increased acidification of the world 's oceans that could completely disrupt the marine food chain .
" We have a climate crisis , " Gore said .
Humans first became aware of this fact while in space , he said , pointing to the 1968 flight of Apollo 8 , when astronaut snapped a photograph showing a distant Earth , in all its beauty and fragility , rising beyond the Moon 's barren horizon .
The image , one of the most famous in history , caused a dramatic change in the consciousness of humankind , Gore said .
It was also the scientific study of near - Earth planetary neighbors - including Mars and Venus - that spurred the start of the earth sciences , Gore said .
" It 's still shocking to me that we have more detailed information in some fields about Mars and Venus than we have about Earth . "
" Getting a perspective that can give us the ability to really understand and then effectively deal with the climate crisis is from the perspective of space , " he said .
" And government is not doing it , unfortunately .
The private sector can . "
Earth : like a business in liquidation
Gore said he expects there to be a " complete reexamination and re-imagining of what space policy should be " after the 2008 election .
Earlier this year , NASA removed the mention of Earth from its mission statement to better match up with the current administration 's goal of pursuing human spaceflight to the Moon and Mars .
" [ Earth ] used to be right up there as one of our most important priorities , " Gore said .
" I think that if there were a change in administrations and party control ... maybe even a new Republican President would reexamine that point and others connected to it . "
Gore referenced the view of Herman Daly , an expert on ecological economics , who once said that the planet is being operated like a business in liquidation .
Centuries - old technologies , like the internal combustion engine , are " ridiculously inefficient " , Gore pointed out .
Global energy use , architecture and design , and transportation systems need rethinking .
Use of giant sunshades in space to help counteract global climate change - among several space projects dubbed as " geoengineering " - are not favored by Gore .
" In a word , I think it is nuts , " Gore told SPACE.com .
" If we do n't know enough to stop putting 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere every day , how in god 's name can we know enough to precisely counteract that . "
Evacuation route
Pressed on the colonization of space , Gore said that in some future century - maybe sooner - that could be a practical possibility .
But he questions the ability of the human race to evacuate the planet , even with ample notice .
" We did n't do a really good job of evacuating the city of New Orleans [ due to the onslaught of Hurricane Katrina ] , " he said .
There 's only one Earth , Gore said .
" We do n't have a spare ... we do n't have an operating manual . "
Our planet has a rising fever , Gore said .
" If the crib catches fire you do n't say : ' Hmmm , how fast is that crib going to burn ?
Has it ever burned before ?
Is my baby flame retardant ? ' "
The former U.S. Vice President said his personal cause is to change the public 's mind about " this planet crisis " to make it a top priority .
The term " crisis " in Chinese is represented by two symbols together , he advised .
" The first means danger ... the second means opportunity , " Gore said .
Oblaka politika zveze ne zanima in napadov na Rudija Zavrla in njegove sodelavce ne komentira , sam pa tudi ne priznava kritik , ki jih je dobil po porazu z Bolgari .
" Pri nas bi imel težave tudi Luis Van Gaal .
Če ni rezultatov , javnost zahteva zamenjave , tako pač je .
Sam proti Bolgarom ne bi ničesar menjal , mogoče le Lavriča za Novakoviča .
Nasprotnika bi lahko presenetil le s tekom in tako sem tudi postavil enajsterico .
Res je , da nismo igrali dobro , 50 minut smo bili le dobro postavljeni .
A v napadu bi morali pokazati več , posebno slabi smo bili na levi strani .
Še sam pa ne vem , zakaj smo tako padli v drugem polčasu .
Odločila je individualna kakovost , tu so Bolgari boljši .
Nisem še videl igralca , kot je Martin Petrov , ki tako teče in še kreira igro , " po prespanih nočeh razmišlja selektor , ki je z izjavami pred tekmo , da bomo igrali s tremi napadalci , hotel preslepiti Stojčkova , z napovedmi o igri na zmago pa je očitno le skrival nervozo in nizko samozavest svojega moštva .
So igralci pili alkohol
Na nekatere očitke , da so igralci po tekmi pili alkohol , se selektor ne ozira .
" Igralci po tekmi lahko spijejo tudi kakšno pivo .
V mojih časih smo imeli v slačilnici Bayerna polno piva , ta v telo prinaša B vitamin , " reprezentante brani Oblak , sekretar Jošt pa zagotavlja , da bo zveza primer vendarle preiskala .

Navdušil me je , ko sem bil trener pri Olimpiji .
Jani je odličen razdiralec nasprotnikove igre , hvalil ga je tudi Prosinečki .

“ WE WILL not stop until every San Franciscan has access to free wireless - internet service . ”
It was a typically bold statement from Gavin Newsom , the charismatic young mayor of San Francisco , as he announced plans in October 2004 for a Wi -Fi network that would blanket the city with wireless - internet coverage .
Mr Newsom thus joined a nationwide movement of cities across America that are planning to provide wireless - broadband access for government workers , residents and businesses .
These municipalities , ranging in scale from communities of a few thousand residents to huge cities including Philadelphia and San Francisco , are concerned that the lack of availability of broadband access , compared with other parts of the developed world , is holding back economic growth and perpetuating a “ digital divide ” between internet haves and have - nots .
A further motivation is that by setting up their own wireless networks , municipalities hope to be able to cut communications costs , improve the efficiency of their staff , and make possible new services such as allowing parking meters to accept debit and credit cards .
Small municipal wireless networks , typically built for local - government use , have been up and running in some parts of America for some time .
The far bolder idea of building citywide networks available to all took flight in August 2004 , when plans for such a network were announced by John Street , the mayor of Philadelphia .
Stringing transmitters across the entire city would create the world 's largest Wi -Fi hotspot , providing access both indoors and out .
This would extend low - cost broadband access to existing users frustrated by the slow speed and high cost of dial - up internet connections .
A survey conducted by the city found that 72 % of internet - connected households used dial - up connections , compared with 47 % nationally .
“ We wanted broadband at dial - up rates , ” says Dianah Neff , the city 's chief information officer .
In addition , the city would provide subsidised or free access to tens of thousands of unconnected residents , sometimes even supplying computers .
Only 45 % of Philadelphia residents had internet access at home , the city found , which compared poorly with the national figure of 73 % .
Last October the body established by the city to oversee the project , Wireless Philadelphia , picked EarthLink , a national internet service provider , to build and operate the network , which is expected to cost around $ 10 m .
Philadelphia 's ambitious scheme prompted many other cities , including San Francisco , Portland and Minneapolis , to follow .
So far , nearly 200 municipalities have announced plans for citywide wireless networks , issued bid requests , or built networks , according to Esme Vos , the founder of Muniwireless.com , a website that tracks the subject .
Over the next three years nearly $ 700 m will be spent building such networks in America , she estimates .
Some networks will be supported by advertising ; many will charge fees of $ 15 - 25 per month .
Most will offer some form of free access at certain times of day or to poorer users .
Free ( or at least cheap ) broadband for every citizen — who could argue with that ?
Plenty of people , it turns out .
Critics worry that cities are underestimating the cost and complexity of building and running their own networks .
Incumbent telecoms and cable operators are predictably opposed to subsidised schemes that will compete with their own broadband offerings .
Then there are the technical objections : no Wi-Fi network as large , dense and complex as Philadelphia 's proposed system has ever been built ; citywide Wi-Fi networks could interfere with existing Wi -Fi systems ; and the networks will be built using proprietary technologies , so that municipalities will become dependent on their equipment - makers .
“ Using Wi-Fi at high power levels for citywide coverage could drown out existing networks . ”
These criticisms have some merit .
Last October Mr Newsom back - pedalled on his “ free Wi-Fi for all ” pledge , in favour of providing “ affordable ” wireless access throughout San Francisco .
And when putting networks out to tender , the preferred model is now for the construction and operating costs of the network to be carried by the winning bidder , to ensure that cities ' own liabilities are limited .
But much uncertainty still remains over whether large - scale municipal Wi -Fi networks can be made to work at all .
Even if they can , nobody knows how much they will cost .
And it is hardly reassuring that rival manufacturers , each promoting different and incompatible technologies , claim not just that their equipment is the best , but that their rivals ' will not work at all .
When challenged , vendors point to the many smaller networks that are already running .
So who is right ?
The view from Tempe
To see municipal wireless networking in action , a good place to start is the city of Tempe , Arizona , a suburb on the outskirts of Phoenix with 160,000 residents spread over 40 square miles .
The flat , desert terrain is an ideal environment in which to use wireless networking to boost the availability of broadband .
Several years ago the city installed wireless - broadband equipment on two buttes at the opposite ends of town .
Rather than paying to lease high - speed digital lines from Qwest , each of which would cost hundreds of dollars per month , police stations and other municipal buildings are linked via the city 's own wireless network .
Telecoms costs have fallen from $ 1.7 m a year a decade ago to $ 0.5 m today .
“ We 're probably not Qwest 's favourite customer , ” says Dave Heck , Tempe 's deputy manager of information technology .
As a result , when the city began considering ways to extend broadband access to more residents — including nearly 60,000 students , staff and faculty members at the main Arizona State University campus in the centre of town — wireless made a lot of sense , says Mr Heck .
“ We do n't have a lot of competition for broadband in Tempe , ” he says .
“ There 's just not a lot there . ”
A local provider , NeoReach , won the contract to build a Wi - Fi “ mesh ” network to provide broadband throughout Tempe , using equipment made by Strix Systems .
NeoReach is paying for the network 's construction , and will collect access fees from subscribers ; the city 's administration , police , fire and emergency services will also pay to use the network , which will cost $ 2.3 m to build .
Mesh networking allows large areas to be blanketed with wireless coverage quickly and inexpensively .
As its name suggests , a mesh network consists of an array of wireless access points , only a few of which are actually connected back to the internet via high - speed links ( known as “ backhaul ” connections ) .
The trick is that all of the access points double as relays , passing packets of data to and from their neighbours .
This connects up the mesh , so that users can access the internet at high speed at any of the access points .
If the nearest access point does not have a backhaul connection , the packets of data that users send and receive simply make one or more “ hops ” across the mesh .
As well as being cheap and fast to set up — partly because many of the access points can be attached to utility poles — mesh networks have several other merits .
They can provide coverage in areas , such as sprawling suburbs , where fast copper or fibre - optic connections are hard to come by .
“ When you get out in the residential areas , there 's no fibre , ” says Chuck Haas of MetroFi , whose company has installed mesh Wi -Fi networks in three of the San Francisco Bay Area 's largest suburbs .
Mesh networks are reliable , since the failure of one or more access points does not bring down the whole network , and they can also route data around obstacles , such as large buildings , which might otherwise block coverage .
By January NeoReach had installed over 400 access points in Tempe , providing Wi-Fi to subscribers in much of the city , and in outdoor areas in downtown Tempe and on the university campus .
With the network 's completion this month , NeoReach claims to have built the first example of a citywide Wi -Fi network in America .
Proof , surely , that Wi -Fi mesh networks are an excellent way to extend broadband coverage across entire cities ?
In fact , it is too soon to say .
Wi - Fi was designed for use in small hotspots , not in citywide mesh networks .
Using mesh networks to connect up a flat , sprawling , relatively sparsely populated suburb is one thing .
But many unknowns remain , given the scale and nature of the networks about to be installed in Philadelphia , San Francisco and several other large American cities — all of which will push Wi -Fi technology to its limits .
“ We 're taking this technology and , through some enhancements , we 're trying to apply it for an application it was n't really designed for , ” says Peter Rysavy , an independent wireless consultant .
“ Consequently , we just do not know how well it 's going to work — but we 're going to find out . ”
Not so fast
Some mesh network devices , notably those made by Tropos Networks , the market leader , use the same Wi-Fi frequencies both for communication between neighbouring access points , and to connect users to the mesh .
Wireless experts fear that the use of Wi-Fi at the very high power levels required for municipal - scale networks , particularly in cluttered cities , could drown out existing outdoor Wi -Fi networks , public and private , and slow or disable indoor networks .
An estimated 10 m American homes contain Wi-Fi networks ; many more are installed in offices , schools , coffee shops and parks .
“ It is absolutely guaranteed that you 're going to end up interfering with anybody else that is using any channels within your coverage area , ” says Mr Rysavy .
To make matters worse , Wi-Fi operates in “ unlicensed ” frequency bands , which are supposed to be available for anyone to use .
By interfering with existing Wi -Fi networks , a municipal network is , in effect , appropriating a shared public asset .
“ There are going to be 3,000 or 10,000 or whatever access points in the city of San Francisco , ” says Tim Pozar , a wireless consultant .
“ Even though this is unlicensed frequency , guess who owns the spectrum ?
The vendor . ”
Ron Sege , the boss of Tropos , insists that his firm 's technology does not cause undue interference .
After all , he notes , there are millions of access points in use already , with more being added all the time .
Tropos nodes installed in a city are no different , he says , from a home user buying an access point and plugging it in .
The problem , however , is that off - the - shelf access points operate at just 3 - 20 % of the power output of the mesh nodes made by Tropos and its rivals .
Reducing the signal strength of the mesh nodes would reduce interference with existing networks , but the density of nodes would then have to go up , increasing costs .
Interference is not the only potential difficulty with municipal Wi -Fi networks .
Another problem , notes Mr Rysavy , is that there is no common standard for Wi -Fi meshing , and thus no compatibility between the five leading vendors ' equipment .
So if a city builds a network and the vendor goes bust — as recently happened to Vivato , a pioneer of long - range Wi-Fi gear — keeping the network running could be difficult .
Although a standard for Wi -Fi meshing , called 802.11s , is under development , it is not very far along — and cities want to start building now .
“ Until there 's some standardisation in the mesh protocols , any deployment today is pretty risky , ” says Mr Rysavy .
That raises another criticism : that wireless technology is developing very quickly , yet most municipal networks will be based on a Wi -Fi standard that is already three years old .
Why not wait for the next - generation standard , 802.11n , which is much faster , or for Wi -Fi 's long - range big brother , a much - hyped technology called WiMax ?
Waiting a year or two might make it possible to build faster networks over greater areas at lower cost .
In fact , 802.11n is designed to perform best indoors , while WiMax has already been factored into most municipal wireless plans — where it will be used to provide backhaul connections to the mesh .
EarthLink , for example , will use Canopy , Motorola 's WiMax - like technology , for this purpose in Philadelphia and in four other cities .
And dedicated Canopy links will also , says Ms Neff , be used to connect several hundred large buildings , which will not therefore rely on the Wi-Fi mesh .
“ Metro Wi-Fi is going to create the base and the excuse for WiMax , ” says Tom Hulsebosch of Motorola 's Canopy division .
Municipal Wi-Fi must also contend with political interference .
A number of reports financed directly or indirectly by incumbent telecoms firms such as Verizon , AT&T and Comcast , have criticised municipal networks as risky wastes of taxpayers ' money that will provide unfair competition to private companies .
Similarly , there have been complaints that if city governments cannot even fill potholes in roads , how will they be able to manage the far more complex task of running a network ?
Proponents of municipal networks respond that broadband access is just another utility , and that utilities have been state - run in the past .
That is true , but public ownership of electrical utilities was , in fact , as controversial a century ago as municipal Wi-Fi is today .
“ If city governments cannot even fill potholes , how will they be able to manage running a network ? ”
Philadelphia 's plans were almost derailed when , after much lobbying , legislation was proposed in Pennsylvania that would have given Verizon , the local incumbent , right of first refusal in any municipal telecoms scheme .
A bitter argument ensued , and the bill was signed into law only after Verizon agreed to issue a waiver exempting the city of Philadelphia from the provision .
Similar bills preventing municipalities from going into competition with telecoms incumbents have been passed in over a dozen states .
One exception is Texas , where a grass - roots movement succeeded in scuttling a vote on such a bill , which had been sponsored by the local incumbent , SBC ( since renamed AT&T ) .
Michael Dell , the founder of the world 's biggest PC - maker , based in Round Rock , Texas , helped to undermine the bill when he pointed out to state legislators that more broadband might sell more computers , and thus bring more jobs and tax revenues to the state .
To avoid such political wrangling , many cities are now taking the approach of awarding contracts to firms that build the networks at their own expense , pay taxes or franchise fees , and operate autonomously , in return for special rights to city - owned facilities such as utility poles , towers , building tops and electricity .
All of this means that Philadelphia , San Francisco , Minneapolis , Portland , Chicago and many other cities are participants in a great experiment .
Building a large Wi -Fi network is harder than it looks , says Mr Haas , who has first - hand experience , not least because , once deployed in the field , mesh Wi -Fi equipment does not always perform as promised .
“ The radios we put up in 2002 and 2003 and the first half of 2004 — hundreds of them — are either back at the vendors or sitting in the warehouse , ” he says .
Only in the past 18 months has his firm hit upon the right combination of equipment and network design .
One step at a time
Reassuringly , Philadelphia and other big cities are taking a staged approach to the deployment , which will allow the conflicting claims made by equipment manufacturers to be resolved , one way or another .
In Philadelphia , EarthLink will start by building a 15 - square - mile test network covering different terrain , demographics and building densities .
Building such a test network “ is very expensive to do , but it 's never been done , ” says Greg Richardson of Civitium , a consultancy that was involved in the bidding in Philadelphia and San Francisco .
If EarthLink cannot meet the specifications set by the city and assessed by independent auditors , the network will not be built .
“ It gives us a chance to see if what we ask for is realistic , or if we need to change some of the parameters , ” says Ms Neff .
And if existing Wi -Fi networks are disrupted , citizens in the test area will know whom to blame .
Mayor Newsom 's utopian vision of free wireless for all quickly ran up against the snag that all such giveaways require : there 's a price to pay at the end of the day .
Even with the decision to charge some users for access , not all cities will find that their plans for citywide Wi -Fi networks turn out as expected .
The real measure of municipal wireless networks will not be in places such as Tempe , where they are expected to work , but in bigger cities , where success is far from certain .
Whether service providers will be able to meet the required technical standards and still make a profit will soon become clear .
For some time now , I ’ve wanted to increase my understanding of microformats .
If you ’re unfamilar with the term or want to understand the basic purpose of this technology better , I suggest reading Phil Windley ’s Microformats : Paving the Cowpaths .
I read it some time ago and was intrigued but had very little time to do further research .
I have had a chance to dive in a bit more over the past few weeks and am excited at what I ’ve found .
I ’ve trawled the mailing list archives , spent some time on the wiki , and read what people are saying on the blogs .
I have yet to spend a lot of time in the guts of the individual specifications ( e.g. , hCard , XOXO , hCalendar , etc. ) because , frankly , the nitty - gritty is a very small potion of what ’s really grabbing my interest here .
There seems to be a bit of confussion around what “ microformats ” actually are and I think I know why .
From what I ’m seeing , the term “ microformats ” has two separate meanings - one is obvious and one comes after interacting with the community a bit .
“ Microformats ” are a set of specifications describing interoperable machine formats that work on the web .
“ Microformats ” is a process for arriving at interoperable machine formats that work on the web .
In general , when someone says “ microformats ” , they are most likely talking about the specifications .
What I ’ve found after lurking on the mailing list and watching the community is that when someone very close to the project says “ microformats ” , they are more often talking about the process that is evolving there .
This is much harder to explain but it ’s definitely worth trying because the core values , the Zen , these guys are carving out have very strong parallels to those of the less code movement , I think .
Luckily , I do n’t think I ’ll have to do much explaining myself because there are some gems from the microformats - discuss mailing list that I think go a long way in describing what ’s going on there :
Mark Pilgrim in RE : Educating Others :
The regulars on this list grok this intuitively , or at least have accepted it for so long that they ’ve forgotten how to articulate it .
We simply do n’t care about the general case .
Some people ( Scott , Lisa , others ) look at this and say “ what about this edge case ? ” or “ how do you combine them ? ” or “ I need something with rigid structure ” or “ how do you validate them ” or whatever .
And these are all obvious questions that form interesting permathreads on mailing lists around the world .
And we just do n’t care .
Not because we ’re lazy or sloppy or naive — in fact , just the opposite .
Our apathy towards the edge case is born out of bitter experience .
We all bear the scars of drawn - out battles over edge cases that satisfied someone ’s sense of “ completeness ” or “ aesthetics ” or “ perfection ” , but ultimately made the common cases harder and solved no real problem .
Ryan said microformats are all about 80 /20 .
He ’s right , but unless you ’ve share [ sic ] our common experience , he may as well be speaking in Zen koans .
Most standards go like this : Solve 80 % of the problem in a matter of weeks .
Spend two years arguing about the last 20 % . ( cough Atom cough ) Implement the 80 % in a matter of weeks .
Wonder why everything is so hard .
Spend months implementing the last 20 % .
Realize why the first 80 % was so hard .
Curse a lot .
Discover that the last 20 % was n’t really worth all the time spent arguing about it or implementing it .
Microformats , on the other hand , go like this :
Solve the 80 % in a matter of weeks .
Promise ( wink wink ) to tackle the 20 % “ later ” .
Implement the 80 % in a matter of days .
Watch people use it for a few months .
Maybe tweak a little here and there .
Discover that the last 20 % was n’t really necessary after all .
Breathe a sigh of relief that you never bothered .
Move on to the next problem .
The regulars on this list have all been through the full standards cycle many times .
We know about edge cases , we know about validators , we know about standards .
We know .
We ’ve been there .
We ’ve all decided that this way is better .
Not because it ’s easier or faster or sloppier , but because it leads to a better result .
Really .
The fact that it happens to be easier and faster is just a karmic coincidence .
Mark ’s description of the mainstream standardization process vs. that of microformats could easily be used to describe the difference in technique employed by the mainstream software industry vs. that of the less code crowd .
Ryan King in RE : Educating Others :
… we ’ve proven that microformats ( at least , the ones developed so far ) work in practice , we just need to show that they work in theory .
The arguments in this thread are theoretical –in theory there ’s no difference between theory and practice , but in practice there is .
Luke Arno in Evolution vs. Intelligent Design :
It ’s evolution not “ intelligent design . ”
Tantek Çelik in Microformats and the Semantic Web :
Microformats essentially ask : Can we do more ( practical use and applications ) with less ( logical formalism , formats , namespaces , etc. ) ?
Tantek Çelik in Microformats and the Semantic Web , and this one ’s a gem :
I hardly ever look at PDF docs .
Without even looking at the actual technical specifications , I think these quotes say a lot about microformats ’ potential .
To me , what ’s exciting about microformats is the same thing that ’s exciting about dynamic languages , REST , F / OSS , and other seemingly unconnected technologies and concepts : they are all evolving under the fundamental principle that you cannot adequately plan / design large systems upfront and expect them to be successful .
That we do n’t know anything until we ’ve observed it .
Respect for this simple truth leads to dramatic changes in how one builds and evaluates technology and you can see this happening to great effect ( and with equally great results ) in each of these communities .
More …
If you ’ve experimented with “ social bookmark ” sites such as digg.com or del.icio.us as a way of filtering the web ( something I wrote about here ) , you may have come across reddit.com .
When I mentioned it in a recent column for the Globe and Mail about Yahoo ’s acquisition of del.icio.us , I got an email from one of Reddit ’s co-founders , Alexis Ohanian , and we started a kind of ad hoc interview about the deal and about Reddit ’s business model .
Alexis said that he felt Yahoo ’s purchase had “ validated the ‘ business model without a business model ’ approach of del.icio.us , ” ( something that not everyone thinks is a good idea ) , but that he was “ curious to know how whether or not it ’s an anomaly , ” adding that “ one look at reddit and you can guess what we ’re hoping for . ”
I asked whether reddit.com was modelled on del.icio.us , and he said it was — but that Reddit wants to do something different as well .
“ We were actually inspired by del.icio.us / popular , ” Alexis said .
“ We found ourselves most interested in this page because it was a sort of zeitgeist for what people were busy bookmarking — but we wanted to take it further . ”
The Reddit co-founder , who was part of a “ summer camp for startups ” along with his college roommate Steve Huffman — and was in a movie called Aardvark ’d — said that while there are “ aesthetic similarities in the minimalist designs of our sites , ” reddit.com is “ trying to build a very different site . ”
As a Guardian article on the site pointed out , Reddit users can vote an article up or down in popularity ( in much the same way Slashdot modifies comments ) and they get “ karma points ” if something they linked to is voted onto the front page ( Solution Watch has a nice overview ) .
As for a business model , Alexis did n’t give me much to go on , but he said that the two friends “ started on reddit with the hope of being acquired one day , but as the project evolved we started exploring a model that could ( hopefully ) be sustainable . ”
He said there have been “ overtures , ” but that he and his partner are “ loving this ride and we want to see how far it will take us . ”
As for venture capital , the company has met with a few but has n’t taken any money .
“ We secured angel funding in August , ” Alexis said , “ that should , given our bare bones lifestyle ( 2 guys in a Cambridge apartment ) , last us until the thaw of summer . ”
Thanks for taking the time to answer my questions , Alexis .
I think reddit.com has some interesting twists on the del.icio.us model that make it potentially more useful , but whether that translates into financial success is the multimillion - dollar question .
Best of luck to you and Steve .
Wallstroem : Firms must remember their responsibilities
In a blog entry , EC vice president Margot Wallstroem said Microsoft , Yahoo and Google were matching their morals to suit new markets .
In particular she said the firms seemed to have deleted words such as " ethics " and " corporate social responsibility " from their codes of conduct .
She urged the companies to re-discover their responsibilities .
Ethical stance
Ms Wallstroem wrote her comments after learning about the lengths Microsoft , Yahoo and Google have gone to in order to accommodate the wishes of the Chinese government .
Google is reportedly amending its index to exclude information to which the Chinese government objects .
Microsoft and Yahoo have also submitted to the demands of Chinese authorities .
In her blog , Ms Wallstroem wrote that the firms " have flexible ethical standards depending on where they operate " .
She went on to say that the companies needed to realise that active support of democracy and corporate responsibility was necessary for growth .
She urged the companies to read the UN Global Compact which stresses the need for uniting business goals and human rights .
Comments left by readers on her blog said the EC too should examine its record on relations with China .
In September Yahoo was accused by Reporters Without Borders of providing information that helped Chinese authorities link journalist Shi Tao with e-mails that allegedly divulged " state secrets " .
Mr Tao was subsequently jailed for 10 years for sending the messages .
At the time Yahoo said it had to operate within the laws of each country in which it traded .
In June 2005 it emerged that Chinese users of Microsoft 's net services writing blogs are having censored some journal entries mentioning " freedom " , " democracy " and " demonstration " .
Pop - up warnings asked writers to use another expression for these terms which were banned .
Microsoft too said it had to respect local laws .
The Chinese economy is exploding and it is increasingly becoming an attractive new place for both on and offline firms to do business .
For media and net based companies setting up a business in China , this also means adhering to local rules , including tight state controls of the press and restrictions governing what websites can say .

Shia and Sunni , A Ludicrously Short Primer
Even now , many people who hear these terms daily on the news are confused about what the real differences are between Sunni and Shia Muslims , so I , having been brought up in a very devout Shia household in Pakistan , thought I would explain these things , at least in rough terms .
Here goes :
It all started hours after Mohammad 's death : while his son - in - law ( and first cousin )
Ali was attending to Mohammad 's burial , others were holding a little election to see who should succeed Mohammad as the chief of what was by now an Islamic state .
( Remember that by the end of his life , Mohammad was not only a religious leader , but the head - of - state of a significant polity . )
The person soon elected to the position of caliph , or head - of - state , was an old companion of the prophet 's named Abu Bakr .
This was a controversial choice , as many felt that Mohammad had clearly indicated Ali as his successor , and after Abu Bakr took power , these people had no choice but to say that while he may have become the temporal leader of the young Islamic state , they did not recognize him as their divinely guided religious leader .
Instead ,
Ali remained their spiritual leader , and these were the ones who would eventually come to be known as the Shia .
The ones who elected Abu Bakr would come to be known as Sunni .
This is the Shia / Sunni split which endures to this day , based on this early disagreement .
Below I will say a little more about the Shia .
So early on in Islam , there was a split between political power and religious leadership , and to make a long story admittedly far too short , this soon came to a head within a generation when the grandson of one of the greatest of Mohammad 's enemies ( Abu Sufian ) from his early days in Mecca , Yazid , took power in the still nascent Islamic government .
Yazid was really something like a cross between Nero and Hitler and Stalin ; just bad , bad in every way : a decadent , repressive dictator ( and one who flouted all Islamic injunctions ) , for whom it became very important to obtain the public allegiance of Husain , the pious and respected son of Ali ( and so , grandson of Mohammad ) .
And this Husain refused , on principle .
Yazid said he would kill Husain .
Husain said that was okay .
Yazid said he would kill all of Husain 's family .
Husain said he could not compromise his principles , no matter what the price .
Yazid 's army of tens of thousands then surrounded Husain and a small band of his family , friends and followers at a place called Kerbala ( in present day Iraq ) , and cut off their water on the 7th of the Islamic month of Moharram .
For three days , Husain and his family had no water .
At dawn on the third day , the 10th of Moharram , Husain told all in his party that they were sure to be killed and whoever wanted to leave was free to do so .
No one left .
In fact , several heroic souls left Yazid 's camp to come and join the group that was certain to be slaughtered .
On the 10th of Moharram , a day now known throughout the Islamic world as Ashura , the members of Husain 's parched party came out one by one to do battle , as was the custom at the time .
They were valiant , but hopelessly outnumbered , and therefore each was killed in turn .
All of Husain 's family was massacred in front of his eyes , even his six - month old son , Ali Asghar , who was pierced through the throat by an arrow from the renowned archer of Yazid 's army , Hurmula .
After Husain 's teenage son Ali Akbar was killed , he is said to have proclaimed , " Now my back is broken . "
But the last to die before him , was his beloved brother , Abbas , while trying desperately to break through Yazid 's ranks and bring water back from the Euphrates for Husain 's young daughter , Sakeena .
And then Husain himself was killed .
The followers of Ali ( the Shia ) said to themselves that they would never allow this horrific event to be forgotten , and that they would mourn Husain and his family 's murder forever , and for the last thirteen hundred years , they have lived up to this promise every year .
This mourning has given rise to ritualistic displays of grief , which include flagellating oneself with one 's hands , with chains , with knives , etc .
It can all seem quite strange , out of context , but remembrance of that terrible day at Kerbala has also given rise to some of the most sublime poetry ever written ( a whole genre in Urdu , called Marsia , is devoted to evoking the events of Ashura ) , and some of us , religious or not , still draw inspiration from the principled bravery and sacrifice of Husain on that black day .
Earlier today , I took the following unlikely pictures on the ritziest road in New York City , Park Avenue :
This is the procession commemorating Ashura , or the 10th of Moharram .
In front , you can see a painstakingly recreated model of the tomb of Husain .
The mourners are dressed mostly in black .
It is a testament to the tolerance of American society that despite the best attempts of some of its cleverest citizens to proclaim a " clash of civilizations , " it allows ( and observes with curiosity ) such displays of foreign sentiment .
The procession is made up of Shias of various nationalities , with the largest contingents being from Pakistan and Iran .
A young Shia holds up a banner , perhaps forgetting for a second that he is supposed to be mourning .
You can see one of the coffins with roses on it , which are ritualistically carried in the procession .
The self - flagellation is in full swing at this point .
( The arms are raised before coming down to beat the chest . )
This is " Zuljana " or Husain 's horse , caparisoned with silks and flowers .
The self - flagellation , or matam , reaches a climactic frenzy before ending for Asr prayers .
Later in the evening , there are gatherings ( or majaalis ) to remember the women and children of Husain 's family who survived to be held as prisoners of Yazid .

The Tornado Cup comes down to a game between the Fugees and the Concorde Fire , perhaps Atlanta ’s most elite — and expensive — soccer academy .
The Fugees need to win to advance to the finals .
Standing on the sideline in a sweatshirt with “ Soccer Mom ” on the back , Nancy Daffner , team mother for the Fire , describes her son ’s teammates as “ overachievers . ”
One is a cellist who has played with the Atlanta Symphony .
Her son wakes up an hour early every day to do a morning radio broadcast at his school .
The Fire are mostly from the well - to - do Atlanta suburb of Alpharetta .
They have played together under the same coach for five years .
They practice twice a week under lights , and have sessions for speed and agility training .
Over the years , the parents have grown close .
During practice , Ms. Daffner says , she and the other mothers often meet for margaritas while the fathers watch their sons play .
The team has pool parties and players spend weekends at one another ’s lake houses .
In the summer , most of the players attend soccer camp at Clemson University .
Ms. Daffner estimates that the cost of playing for the Fire exceeds $ 5,000 a year per player , which includes fees , travel to tournaments and , of course , gear .
Each player has an Adidas soccer bag embroidered with his jersey number .
There is one other expenditure .
The parents of the Fire collectively finance the play of Jorge Pinzon , a Colombian immigrant and the son of a single working mother .
He is n’t from Alpharetta , but from East Gwinnett County , a largely Latino area outside Atlanta .
Fire parents go to great lengths to get Jorge to games , arranging to meet him at gas stations around his home , landmarks they can find in his out - of - the - way neighborhood .
Jorge is the best player on the team .
Ms. Mufleh gathers the Fugees before warm -ups .
“ Play to the whistle , ” she tells them .
“ If the ref makes a bad call , you keep playing .
O.K.?
You focus on the game and how you ’re going to win it .
Because if you do n’t , we ’re going to lose your last game of the season , and you ’re going home early . ”
Just before the opening whistle , some of the Fugees see a strange sight on the sideline .
A teacher from the school of Josiah Saydee , a Liberian forward , has come to see him play .
Some older refugee children from the complexes in Clarkston have managed rides to the game , an hour from home .
Several volunteers from resettlement agencies show up .
For the first time all year , the Fugees have fans .
Still Pictures
IN 10,000 years , the earth 's population has doubled ten times , from less than 10 m to more than six billion now and ten billion soon .
Most of the calories that made that increase possible have come from three plants : maize , rice and wheat .
The oldest , most widespread and until recently biggest of the three crops is wheat ( see chart ) .
To a first approximation wheat is the staple food of mankind , and its history is that of humanity .
Yet today , wheat is losing its crown .
The tonnage ( though not the acreage ) of maize harvested in the world began consistently to exceed that of wheat for the first time in 1998 ; rice followed suit in 1999 .
Genetic modification , which has transformed maize , rice and soyabeans , has largely passed wheat by — to such an extent that it is in danger of becoming an “ orphan crop ” .
The Atkins diet and a fashion for gluten allergies have made wheat seem less wholesome .
And with population growth rates falling sharply while yields continue to rise , even the acreage devoted to wheat may now begin to decline for the first time since the stone age .
It is time to pay tribute to this strange little grass that has done so much for the human race .
Strange is the word , for wheat is a genetic monster .
A typical wheat variety is hexaploid — it has six copies of each gene , where most creatures have two .
Its 21 chromosomes contain a massive 16 billion base pairs of DNA , 40 times as much as rice , six times as much as maize and five times as much as people .
It is derived from three wild ancestral species in two separate mergers .
The first took place in the Levant 10,000 years ago , the second near the Caspian Sea 2,000 years later .
The result was a plant with extra -large seeds incapable of dispersal in the wild , dependent entirely on people to sow them .
The story actually starts much earlier , around 12,000 years ago .
At the time , after several warm millennia , a melting ice sheet in North America collapsed and a gigantic lake drained into the North Atlantic through the St Lawrence seaway .
The torrent of cool , fresh water altered the climate so drastically that the ice age , which had been in full retreat , resumed for a further 11 centuries .
The Scandinavian ice sheet surged south .
Western Asia became not only cooler , but much drier .
The Black Sea all but dried out .
People in what is now Syria had been subsisting happily on a diet of acorns , gazelles and grass seeds .
The centuries of drought drove them to depend increasingly on wild grass seeds .
Abruptly , soon after 11,000 years ago , they began to cultivate rye and chickpeas , then einkorn and emmer , two ancestors of wheat , and later barley .
Soon cultivated grain was their staple food .
It happened first in the Karacadag Mountains in south - eastern Turkey — it is only here that wild einkorn grass contains the identical genetic fingerprint of modern domesticated wheat .
Who first replanted the seeds and why ?
For a start , he was probably a she : women have primary responsibilities for plant gathering in hunter - gatherer societies .
The time was certainly ripe for agriculture : the ability to make tools and control fire ( cooking makes many plants more digestible ) was already well established .
But was it an act of inspiration or desperation ?
Did it perhaps happen by accident , as discarded grains germinated around human settlements ?
The wheat plant evolved three new traits to suit its new servants : the seeds grew larger ; the “ rachis ” which binds the seeds together became less brittle so whole ears of grass , rather than individual seeds , could be gathered ; and the leaf - like glumes that covered each seed loosened , thus making the grains “ free - threshing ” .
In the past two years , the very mutations that allowed these changes have been located within the wheat plant 's genome .
Wheat 's servants now became its slaves .
Agriculture brought drudgery , subjugation and malnutrition , because unlike hunter - gatherers , farmers could eke out a living when times were bad .
But at least that meant that they could survive .
Population growth was now inevitable .
Within a few generations , wheat farmers were on the march , displacing and overwhelming hunter - gatherers as they went , and bringing with them their distinct Indo - European language , of which Sanskrit and Irish are both descendants .
By 5,000 years ago wheat had reached Ireland , Spain , Ethiopia and India .
A millennium later it reached China : paddy rice was still thousands of years in the future .
Wherever they went , the farmers brought their habits : not just sowing , reaping and threshing , but baking , fermenting , owning , hoarding .
By 9,000 years ago they had domesticated cattle , to which they could feed wheat to get meat and milk .
They could also get precious manure to fertilise the fields .
Not until 6,000 years ago did somebody invent the first plough to turn the earth , burying weeds and breaking up the seedbed .
Innovations came slowly in wheat farming .
The horse collar arrived in the third century BC , in China .
By not pressing on the animal 's windpipe , it enabled the animal to drag greater weight — and faster than an ox .
In 1701 AD the Berkshire farmer Jethro Tull devised a simple seed drill based on organ pipes , which resulted in eight times as many grains harvested for every grain sown .
Like most agricultural innovators since , he was vilified .
A century later the threshing machine was greeted by riots .
In 1815 a gigantic volcanic eruption at Tambora in Indonesia led to the famous “ year without a summer ” .
New England had frosts in July .
France had bitter cold in August .
Wheat prices reached a level that would never be seen again in real terms , nearly $ 3 a bushel .
Thomas Robert Malthus was then at the height of his fame and the harvest failure seemed to bear out his pessimism .
In 1798 he had forecast a population crash , based on the calculation that it was impossible to improve wheat yields as fast as people made babies ( each new baby can make more babies ; each new field of grain leaves less new land to cultivate ) .
The Malthusian crash was staved off in the 19th century by bringing more land under the plough — in North America , Argentina and Australia especially .
But wheat yields per acre grew worse if anything as soil nutrients were depleted .
So in 1898 , in a speech to the British Association , a chemist , Sir William Crookes , argued again that worldwide starvation was inevitable within a generation .
Population was rising fast .
There was little new land to plough .
Famines became worse each season , especially in Asia .
This time it was the tractor that averted Malthusian disaster .
The first tractors had few advantages over the best horses , but they did not eat hay or oats .
The replacement of draft animals by machines released about 25 % more land for growing food for human consumption .
The Malthusian limit would surely be reached one day , though .
The only way to increase yield was to find a way of supplying extra nitrogen , phosphorus and potassium to the soil .
Neither a break crop of legumes , nor manure was the answer , since both demanded precious acres to produce .
The search for fertiliser took unexpected turns .
British entrepreneurs scoured the old battlefields of Europe searching for phosphorus - rich bones .
In about 1830 a magic ingredient was found : guano .
On the dry seabird islands off the South American and South African coasts , immense deposits of bird droppings , rich in nitrogen and phosphorus , had accumulated over centuries .
Guano mining became a profitable business , and a grim one .
Off South - West Africa , the discovery in 1843 of the tiny island of Ichaboe , covered in 25 feet of penguin and gannet excrement , led to a guano rush followed by a mutiny and battles .
By 1850 , Ichaboe , minus 800,000 tonnes of guano , was deserted again .
Between 1840 and 1880 , guano nitrogen made a vast difference to European agriculture .
But soon the best deposits were exhausted .
In the dry uplands of Chile , rich mineral nitrate deposits were then found , and gradually took the place of guano in the late 19th century .
The nitrate mines fuelled Chile 's economy and fertilised Europe 's farms .
On July 2nd 1909 , with the help of an engineer named Carl Bosch from the BASF company , Fritz Haber succeeded in combining nitrogen ( from the air ) with hydrogen ( from coal ) to make ammonia .
In a few short years , BASF had scaled up the process to factory size and the sky could be mined for nitrogen .
Today nearly half the nitrogen atoms in the proteins of an average human being 's body came at some time or another through an ammonia factory .
In the short term , though , Haber merely saved the German war effort as it was on the brink of running out of nitrogen explosives in 1914 , cut off from Chilean nitrates .
He went on to make lethal gas for chemical warfare and genocide .
On farms , Haber nitrogen ran into much the same revulsion as had greeted the seed drill .
For many farmers , the goodness of manure could not be reduced to a white powder .
Fertiliser must in some sense be alive .
Haber nitrogen was not used as fertiliser in large quantities until the middle of the 20th century , and for a good reason .
If you put extra nitrogen on wheat , the crop grew taller and thicker than usual , fell over in the wind and rotted .
On General Douglas MacArthur 's team in Japan at the end of the second world war a wheat expert named Cecil Salmon collected 16 varieties of wheat including one called “ Norin 10 ” , which grew just two feet tall , instead of the usual four .
Salmon sent it back to a scientist named Orville Vogel in Oregon in 1949 .
Vogel began crossing Norin 10 with other wheats to make new short - strawed varieties .
In 1952 news of Vogel 's wheat filtered down to a remote research station in Mexico , where a man named Norman Borlaug was breeding fungus - resistant wheat for a project funded by the Rockefeller Foundation .
Borlaug took some Norin , and Norin - Brevor hybrid , seeds to Mexico and began to grow new crosses .
Within a few short years he had produced wheat that yielded three times as much as before .
By 1963 95 % of Mexico's wheat was Borlaug 's variety , and the country 's wheat harvest was six times what it had been when Borlaug set foot in the country .
In 1961 Borlaug was invited to visit India by M. S. Swaminathan , adviser to the Indian minister of agriculture .
India was on the brink of mass famine .
Huge shipments of food aid from America were all that stood between its swelling population and a terrible fate .
One or two people were starting to say the unsayable .
After an epiphany in a taxi in a crowded Delhi street , the environmentalist Paul Ehrlich wrote a best - seller arguing that the world had “ too many people ” .
Not only could America not save India ; it should not save India .
Mass starvation was inevitable , and not just for India , but for the world .
No need to starve
Borlaug refused to be so pessimistic .
He arrived in India in March 1963 and began testing three new varieties of Mexican wheat .
The yields were four or five times better than Indian varieties .
In 1965 , after overcoming much bureaucratic opposition , Swaminathan persuaded his government to order 18,000 tonnes of Borlaug 's seed .
Borlaug loaded 35 trucks in Mexico and sent them north to Los Angeles .
The convoy was held up by the Mexican police , stopped at the border by United States officials and then held up by the National Guard when the Watts riots prevented them reaching the port .
Then , as the shipment eventually sailed , war broke out between India and Pakistan .
Natural - born mutants
As it happened , the war proved a godsend , because the state grain monopolies lost their power to block the spread of Borlaug 's wheat .
Eager farmers took it up with astonishing results .
By 1974 , India 's wheat production had tripled and India was self - sufficient in food ; it has never faced a famine since .
In 1970 Norman Borlaug was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for firing the first shot in what came to be called the “ green revolution ” .
Borlaug had used natural mutants ; soon his successors were bringing on mutations artificially .
In 1956 , a sample of a barley variety called Maythorpe was irradiated at Britain 's Atomic Energy Research Establishment .
The result was a strain with stiffer , shorter straw but the same early harvest and malting qualities , which would eventually reach the market as “ Golden Promise ” .
Still Pictures
Today scientists use thermal neutrons , X - rays , or ethyl methane sulphonate , a harsh carcinogenic chemical — anything that will damage DNA — to generate mutant cereals .
Virtually every variety of wheat and barley you see growing in the field was produced by this kind of “ mutation breeding ” .
No safety tests are done ; nobody protests .
The irony is that genetic modification ( GM ) was invented in 1983 as a gentler , safer , more rational and more predictable alternative to mutation breeding — an organic technology , in fact .
Instead of random mutations , scientists could now add the traits they wanted .
In 2004 200 m acres of GM crops were grown worldwide with good effects on yield ( up ) , pesticide use ( down ) , biodiversity ( up ) and cost ( down ) .
There has not been a single human health problem .
Yet , far from being welcomed as a greener green revolution , genetic modification soon ran into fierce opposition from the environmental movement .
Around 1998 , a century after Crookes and two centuries after Malthus , green pressure groups began picking up public disquiet about GM and rushed the issue to the top of their agendas , where it quickly brought them the attention and funds they crave .
Wheat , because of its unwieldy hexaploid genome , has largely missed out on the GM revolution , as maize and rice accelerate into world leadership .
The first GM wheats have only recently been approved for use , their principal advantage to the farmer being so - called “ no till ” cultivation — the planting of seed directly into untilled soil saves fuel and topsoil .
Soon after Norman Borlaug went to India in 1963 , a remarkable thing began to happen .
The world population growth rate , in percentage terms , had been climbing steadily since the second world war ( bar a two - year drop in 1959 - 60 caused by Mao Xedong ) .
But in the mid 1960s it stopped rising .
And by 1974 it was falling significantly .
The number of people added each year kept on rising for a while , but even that peaked in 1989 , and then began falling steadily .
Population was still growing , but it was adding a smaller and smaller number each year .
Demographers , who had been watching the exponential rise with alarm , now forecast that the population will peak below ten billion — ten gigapeople — not long after 2050 .
Such a low forecast would have been unthinkable just two decades ago .
Already , in developing countries , the number of children born per woman has fallen from six to three in 50 years .
It will have reached replacement - level fertility ( where deaths equal births ) by 2035 .
This is an extraordinary development , unexpected , undeserved — and apparently unnatural .
Human beings may be the only creatures that have fewer babies when they are better fed .
The fastest - growing populations in the world over the next 50 years will be those of Burkina Faso , Mali , Niger , Somalia , Uganda and Yemen .
All except in Yemen are in Africa .
All are hungry .
All remain untouched by Borlaug 's green Revolution : all depend on primarily organic agriculture .
In 10,000 years the population has doubled at least ten times .
Yet suddenly the doubling has ceased .
It will never double again .
The end of humanity 's population boom will happen in the lifetimes of people alive today .
It is the moment when Malthus was wrong for the last time .
Of course feeding ten billion will not be trivial .
It will require at least 35 % more calories than the world 's farmers grow today , probably much more if a growing proportion of those ten billion are to have meat more than once a month .
( It takes ten calories of wheat to produce one calorie of meat . )
That will mean either better yields or less rainforest — which is why fertilisers , pesticides and transgenes are the best possible protectors of the planet .
The story of wheat is not finished yet .

After reading Simon Willison ‘s excellent article on the topic I spent a couple of hours last night looking at the current OpenID specification , and after a fair bit of thought found the ideas behind OpenID clever , but not what ’s needed for the ID of the future .
What ’s Right
OpenID has some really good ideas behind it .
Here are a few that really stand out in my eyes .
If you have a LiveJournal account for example , it just works , no extra sign - up , no additional work .
The ID is easy to remember , a persons blog / home page URL is among the easiest things for a user to remember .
Decentralized architecture that minimizes the potential for downtime .
Anyone can operate an Identity Provider .
Open , well documented protocol , as well as open - source libraries .
ID may be portable from one Identity Provider to another without changes to the ID .
What ’s Wrong
There are a number of issues I see with this system , while there are certain advantages ; some of these disadvantages are quite disturbing .
Here are the issues that strike me as most concerning ( in no real order ) .
SSL ( HTTPS ) is not required for any communications .
This is a potential security issues , though not as large as could be due to the nature of the system .
Requires editing HTML for users that do not use a hosting service that automatically adds the OpenID HTML code to the proper page (s ) .
Not all hosting services allow the user to edit HTML directly .
Does not offer a way to communicate enough information , such as would be used to expedite an e-commerce transaction .
( This may be changed in future versions , or with extensions . )
No trust relationships , only verifies a person controls a URL .
No certification or audits for Identity Providers to ensure end - user security .
Excessive bandwidth usage .
Each login requires parsing at least one full HTML page to identify the Identity Provider server .
If a user has openid . delegate included in their page , there will be another full - page download / parse for each .
included in their page , there will be another full - page download / parse for each .
HTML pages must be parsed to identify the Identity Provider server , parsing HTML can raise issues when it contains errors ( as is quite common ) .
Seeing as there is no standard library to perform the parsing , HTML with errors may work with some implementations but not with others .
Anyone that gains access to edit the HTML of the identity URL can steal one ’s identity just by changing / adding an openid .
delegate .
This is a real risk in some shared hosting environments .
What We Need
The idea behind OpenID , to create a distributed identity system that is easy to use and can be used universally is a great idea , and one that should be pursued .
If this goal could be achieved , it would be a project that would truly help to make the world a better place ( at least it in that it would save everybody time ) .
I have great respect for the work of all that have contributed to the OpenID project ; it is a great idea and certainly has uses .
To be truly useful though , an ID system needs to be easy to use for people of all skill levels , with and without web sites .
It should provide an option to control how much information is shared with a web site ( such as OpenID does ) , and should have the option to provide information such as shipping or billing information to minimize entering the same data in so many web sites .
All the data should be transferred via SSL to ensure the highest level of security .
Features of The Future ID
The protocol should be completely open and well documented .
The protocol should be XML based so as to be lightweight and easily implemented in any language .
The ID should be easily used with not only websites , but via desktop applications and other forms of software that require authentication .
The organization backing the identity system should arrange for an optional certification program for Identity Providers to ensure that certain basic security policies are implemented .
The requirements should be defined by the backing organization and the audit carried out by a third - party auditing firm .
The IDs should be in an easy to remember format that is easy to type and makes translation back to the provider simple .
Identity Provides should offer a way to verify that a user is who they claim , not just that they control an ID .
This would be an option for users that would be quite useful in applications such as e-commerce use .
( This would rely on the provider having a trusted signing certificate and following certain identity verification guidelines . )
While some of these features cover far more ground than something like OpenID , this increased scope is needed to ensure that the ID service can be used in all the needed applications .
While it is far more complex to add these extra features , the ability to use the resulting ID for almost any purpose makes it well worth it .
I ’m not proposing an alternative to OpenID , simply seeking feedback while passing my feedback on OpenID along for those interested .
Streik im Öffentlichen Dienst Schlechte Werbung mit vollen Mülltonnen

I. Introduction
In the midst of working on this paper , I learned that a friend of ours , an extraordinarily beautiful woman in all senses of the word , found that her equally beautiful nine - month old boy has a virulent strain of muscular dystrophy .
For that bright - eyed and laughing little boy with a genetic time bomb , the future points to progressive wasting , immobility , and death before adulthood .
It is easy to see in this little boy the transformations already affecting his body and to feel the sharp sting of how things will unroll in time .
There is a clear sense of inevitability , of time being " a river which sweeps him along . "
Although just as true for ourselves , we easily see in him that time is a devouring tiger and a consuming fire .
Ill show that understanding something about time in Buddhism and modern physics deepens our sense of how " Time is the substance I am made of . "
Such understanding also helps us appreciate how we are the devouring tiger and the consuming fire .
Beyond its inevitability and destruction , time has other crucial features .
We can reflect on past events and learn from them , but we can not influence them .
The past has a fixity that contrasts sharply with the more malleable future , where we make choices and influence events .
Therefore , we experience a directionality to time , expressed by a metaphorical arrow pointing from the past , through the present , and into the indefinite future .
In contrast , the fundamental equations of physics are all time symmetric , meaning that they have no directionality in time .
All the fundamental interactions can proceed in the reverse direction without violating any laws of physics .
For a simple example , bounce a ball off the floor and take a movie of it .
If you run the movie backwards , nothing looks strange because the time - reversed motion violates no laws of physics .
Or , take a movie of our solar system from a distant star and play it backwards .
All the rotations and revolutions of the sun and planets will be reversed , but no laws of physics are violated and nothing looks strange .
The same is true for quantum mechanical examples .
Let an excited atom decay and emit a photon .
Run the process backwards and you have an atom absorbing light and ending in an excited state .
Yet , many complex processes do display clear temporal directionality .
The ruptured balloon , dangling from the tearful childs hand never spontaneously reassembles itself back into its inflated condition .
Such irreversible processes like the rotting of food and the decay of teeth are in sharp contrast to the time reversible laws of physics .
Our little sick friends inevitable ride down the river of time , along with our own , is full of irreversible transformations , leading to death , the one we most fear .
Therefore , despite the symmetry of the fundamental interactions , nature clearly has many asymmetric and irreversible processes .
As we will see below , the physicists explanation for this asymmetry , within symmetric underlying laws , can help us understand some of the deepest lessons from Middle Way Buddhism .
The two decades that this little boy can look forward to seem criminally short from here , yet time may seem to crawl unendurably in his final days .
However , in this digital age most believe that , despite such subjective experiences , time is absolute .
Two decades is a well - defined interval that all observers can agree on , despite their subjective biases .
Again , appreciating how physics destroys this apparent absoluteness can also deepen our understanding of Middle Way Buddhism .
I hope to show that understanding a little about time in modern physics helps us more deeply appreciate some of the most profound ideas in Buddhism .
Furthermore , I will also suggest that some appreciation of Middle Way Buddhist ideas could aid in the development of physics .
Thus a nontrivial synergy between these two very different disciplines is possible , one that results in deeper understanding and more compassionate action .
While time may be a devouring tiger , appreciating these ideas might help us attain equanimity and encourage us to act more compassionately toward each other and the planet .
II .
Carrots and Emptiness in the Middle Way Ill review the principle of emptiness within the Middle Way Consequence School ( Prasangika Madhyamika , which I abbreviate by Middle Way ) through a little story .
Nearly thirty years ago a very holy man gave me some fresh carrot juice to drink .
What a tasty elixir !
I returned home determined to grow some fresh carrots of my own on our little farm .
( Actually , I was determined to get my wife to grow them . )
However , the soil in my part of the world is heavy and stony , and the carrots that first year were stubby and misshapen .
I thought , " If only I had a garden tiller , I could whip that heavy soil into the most beautiful carrot bed . "
I could not afford one of those fancy tillers that a delicate ten - year - old girl can operate with one hand .
My rototiller is a test of my manhood , a bucking bronco requiring strength and stamina .
Of course , time destroys both people and equipment , and my tiller soon suffered from a long list of woes .
It requires the patience of an advanced Bodhisattva to start , it only works at the deepest setting , it no longer has a reverse , and it cannot run in place and so bolts ahead . . . when you can manage to start it .
However , I only use it a few hours a year , so I suffer with it and consider it a perverse sort of challenge .
One beautiful spring day a few years ago the rototiller was taking me for my annual ride while it bathed me in the blue smoke of burning oil .
I was musing on carrots and rototillers and suddenly had a tiny enlightenment .
The second of Buddhas Four Noble Truths tells us that suffering is caused by desire .
My desire for that delicious carrot juice had chained me to this rototiller for a quarter of a century !
A desire for fresh , sweet carrot juice initially seemed innocent and " spiritually correct , " in that good health is an aid to practicing dharma , but look where it led .
Desire does generate suffering .
However , those blue clouds bellowing from the burned out muffler along with that shattering noise and vibration urged me to deeper reflection .
Upon what is that carrot - desire based ?
The Middle Way clearly answers that desires and aversions are based upon the false belief in independent existence , the idea that beyond my personal associations , relationship , and names for carrots , there is a real , substantial , inherently existent entity .
This substantially existent object , that entity that " exists from its own side , " is the basis upon which we project all our desires and aversions , all our craving for and fleeing from objects .
This innate and unreflective belief in inherent existence divides into two pieces .
First , that phenomena exist independent of mind or knowing .
That " underneath " or " behind " the psychological associations , names , and linguistic conventions we apply to objects like carrot or rototiller , something objective and substantial exists fully and independently from its own side .
Such independent objects appear to provide the objective basis for our shared world .
Second , we falsely believe these objects to be self - contained and independent of each other . [ 2 ]
Each object being fundamentally nonrelational , it exists on its own right without essential dependence upon other objects or phenomena .
In other words , the essential nature of these objects is their nonrelational unity and completeness in themselves .
Since it is so critical to identify inherent existence carefully , let me say it in other words .
Consider the carrot stripped of its sense qualities , history , location , and relation to its surroundings .
All but an advanced practitioner of the Middle Way believes that this denuded carrot has some unique essence , some concrete existence that provides the foundation for all its other qualities .
This core of its being , this independent or inherent existence , is what the Middle Way denies .
The carrot surely has conventional existence ; it attracts rodents and makes great juice .
It functions as a food .
However , it totally lacks independent or inherent existence , what we falsely believe is the core of its being .
In other words , the object or subject we falsely believe independently exists is not actually " finable upon analysis . "
When we search diligently for that entity we believe inherently exists , we cannot actually find it .
It s independent being does not become clearer and more definite upon searching .
Instead , phenomena exist in the middle way because they lack inherent existence , but do have conventional existence .
While reifying carrots , I simultaneously reify the one who desires carrots and consider him as inherently existent too .
Out of the seamless flux of experience , I falsely impute or attribute inherent existence to both the subject and its object of desire and thereby spin the wheel of samsara .
In this way , perception is a double act that simultaneously generates a false belief in inherently existent subjects and objects , gentleman farmers and their carrots .
Then our time is occupied with cherishing our personal ego , putting its desires before all else , pushing others aside to satisfy those desires , and running after objects we falsely believe inherently exist .
We think those objects will make us happy , but in fact they can never satisfy us .
Perhaps time " is a fire that consumes me , but I am the fire . "
Was not this the point of the Buddhas fire sermon ?
According to the Middle Way , we can put out the fire by deeply appreciating the doctrine of emptiness , the lack of inherent existence in all subjects and objects , in all phenomena .
This requires not only an intellectual formulation as given here , but a profound transformation of our whole being at many levels a process that usually takes many life times .
Just so that you will have the whole story , I recently bought a new tractor to replace my 1934 hand - cranking model ( also the source of many deep lessons ) .
With the new tractor , I bought a huge rototiller that attaches to it and makes garden preparation a breeze .
However , I have given the old rototiller , now called the dharma - tiller , to my son hoping that he will grow good vegetables and a deeper understanding of emptiness .
The description of emptiness given so far is negative , a thoroughgoing denial of what we wrongly believe is the core of existence .
Next , let me turn to a more positive description of phenomena , including carrots .
If phenomena dont independently exist than how do they exist ?
The Middle Way tells us that they dependently exist in three fundamental ways .
First , phenomena exist dependent upon causes and conditions .
For example , carrots depend upon soil , sunlight , moisture , freedom from rodents , and so forth .
Second , phenomena depend upon the whole and its parts .
Carrots depend upon its greens , stem , root hairs , and so on and the totality of all these parts .
Third , and most profoundly , phenomena depend upon mental imputation , attribution , or designation .
From the rich panoply of experience , I collect the sense qualities , personal associations , and psychological reactions to carrots together , and name them or designate them as " carrot . "
The minds proper functioning is to construct its world , the only world we can know .
The error enters because along with naming comes the false attribution of inherent existence , that foundation for desire and aversion .
For the Middle Way , dependent arising is a complementary way of describing emptiness .
We can understand them as two different views of the same truth .
Therefore , contrary to our untutored beliefs , the ultimate nature of phenomena is its dependency and relatedness , not isolated existence and independence .
One of the difficulties in understanding emptiness is that we can easily assent to the importance of relatedness , while falling prey to the unconscious assumption that relations are superimposed upon independently existent terms in the relation .
In fact , it is the relationships , the interdependencies that are the reality , since objects or subjects are nothing but their connections to other objects and subjects .
We might ask what would phenomena be like if they did in fact inherently or independently exist .
The Middle Way explains that inherently existent objects would be immutable , since in their essence they are independent of other phenomena and so uninfluenced by any interactions .
Conversely , independently existent objects would also be unable to influence other phenomena , since they are complete and self - contained .
In short , independently existent objects would be immutable and impotent .
Of course , experience denies this since our world is of continuously interacting phenomena , from the growth of carrots nourished by sun , rain , and soil , to their destruction by rodents .
From the subjective side , that we do not independently exist implies that it is possible to transform ourselves into Buddhas , exemplars of infinite wisdom and compassion .
Critics of the Middle Way often say that if objects did not inherently exist , they could not function to produce help and harm .
Carrots lacking independent existence could not give sweet juice or make soup .
The Middle Way turns this around 180 degrees , and answers that it is precisely because objects and subjects lack independent existence that they are capable of functioning .
So the very attribute that we falsely believe is at the core of phenomena would , if present , actually prevent them from functioning .
Now how does all this relate to the Middle Way notion of time ?
As I mentioned above , if phenomena inherently existed then they would of necessity be immutable and impotent , unable to act on us or we on them .
Since , in truth , phenomena are fundamentally a shifting set of dependency relations , impermanence and change are built into them at the most fundamental level .
That the carrot exists in dependence upon causes and conditions , its whole and parts , and on our attribution or naming is what makes it edible , allows me to experience it and be nourished by it .
More important for impermanence , these defining relations and co-dependencies and their continuously shifting connections with each other guarantee that all objects and subjects are impermanent , ceaselessly evolving , maturing , and decaying .
In short , emptiness and impermanence are two sides of the coin of existence and therefore transformation and change are built into the core of all entities , both subjective and objective .
In this way , the doctrine of impermanence is a direct expression of emptiness / dependent arising .
Because I lack inherent existence and am most fundamentally a kinetic set of shifting experiences , with no eternal soul , as we normally understand it , then " Time is the substance I am made of . "
Borges compact sentence seems like a Middle Way aphorism .
Being substantially of time guarantees my continuous transformation and death .
Indeed , time " is a fire that consumes me , but I am the fire . "
These philosophic truths of emptiness and impermanence are central to Buddhist practice , and I return to them later .
Now let us turn to physics and its view of time .
III .
Time in Modern Physics
As mentioned in the introduction , we all have a natural belief in the absoluteness of time , meaning that , for example , one minute is the same for all observers .
Let me again proceed by way of example .
My carrots take 70 days to harvest time .
Our belief in the absoluteness of time or its independent existence appears in the view that this time is something intrinsic to the carrot .
As long as the growing conditions are normal , it does not matter how this time is measured or who measures it .
It has an independent or absolute nature .
However , let an astronaut take the same seeds and grow them in a space ship traveling at 90 percent the speed of light relative to the Earth .
Then relativity theory tells us that the days to harvest ( as measured by an Earth - based observer ) would be 161 days .
[ 3 ]
Figure 1 shows the days to harvest , as observed on Earth , plotted against the velocity of the space ship , relative to Earth , divided by the speed of light , c . So for example when v/c = .9 then we move straight upward from that point on the horizontal axis and intersect the curve at 161 days .
Only in a reference frame at rest with respect to the observer ( the rest frame ) is the days to harvest 70 days .
-------------------
Figure 1--------------------
Relativity emphatically states that no value of the days to harvest time is any more real or intrinsic than any other .
For example , if the astronaut looked back at my garden she would correctly measure my time to harvest as 161 days .
Since time intervals depend directly upon the relationship between the object and the observer , they are essentially relational .
We cannot consider time independent of a particular reference frame .
In Middle Way language , it lacks independent existence .
If the seed manufacturers were devotees of relativity they would state on the package , " The time to harvest is 70 day only in the rest frame .
For other reference frames consult the graph on the back . "
That graph would be Figure 1 .
We can attempt to evade this relational nature of time by saying that humans never travel at any significant fraction of the speed of light , and so this is just an academic consideration .
This move denies the conceptual import of relativitys view of time and the thousands of experiments done all over the planet every day that rely on it .
If we clarify the idea of the present moment , the essentially relational nature of time intervals , whether decades or microseconds , is complemented by a thoroughgoing relativity of the present .
Take the reasonable definition that all the simultaneous events that take place for an observer at one time defines the present moment .
Lets say I plant my carrots at exactly 9:00 AM on a given day and at that moment a friend in New Deli boards a plane , while my son enters a classroom in a distant city .
Relativity teaches that those simultaneous events defining the moment of carrot planting are only simultaneous in my gardens reference frame .
If our farmer - astronaut , moving at 90 percent the speed of light , passes directly over my garden at 9:00 AM he observers a different set of simultaneous events and thus his present moment differs from mine .
While a second astronaut , traveling at a different speed over my garden at 9:00 AM , finds yet a third set of simultaneous events and thus a different present from mine or the first astronaut .
Therefore , relativity makes both time intervals and individual moments relative to a given reference frame , leaving our old absolute view of time far behind .
There are similar things to say about other primary qualities of objects , but these points about time are enough for the present .
A more interesting and profound quality of time comes from understanding how it has an arrow .
We store our carrots in the cellar where there is a cool , even temperature .
However , even there , they rot after four to six months .
We have never seen rotten food return to its fresh state .
Rotting , whether of vegetables , teeth , or our entire bodies , is an irreversible process .
Given that the quantum mechanical laws , which govern the chemical changes of rotting , are time symmetric , this is mysterious .
The great Austrian physicist , Ludwig Boltzmann , made the first significant progress in understanding this mystery .
He realized that irreversibility comes from reversible underlying laws only when you have large numbers of particles in the system .
Boltzmann started by considering a simple box containing many gas particles governed by Newtons laws .
In analyzing this system , he assumed that it was totally isolated from the rest of the universe .
There were no influences of the universe on the box and its contents or vice versa .
Now this should give anybody influenced by the Middle Way philosophy some real discomfort , since he is assuming that the system independently exists .
More about that later .
Boltzmann then imagined a partition in the middle of the box with all the particles in just one half of the box .
The other half is totally empty .
To proceed further we need to understand the concept of entropy , or measure of disorder .
The more disorder , the less knowledge we have about the details of the system , the higher the entropy .
When the partition is removed , the overwhelmingly most probable configurations of the new equilibrium condition involve the gas spreading evenly throughout the box .
In principle , it is possible for the gas to bunch up in only one quarter of the box .
However , it is overwhelmingly more probable that it will attain a new equilibrium configuration diffused throughout the box .
Such equilibrium states have maximum entropy .
Through this reasoning , Boltzmann proved the famous Second Law of Thermodynamics , which says that any isolated systems entropy must either stay the same or increase .
Therefore , when the egg hits the floor it is overwhelmingly likely to go to a state of greater entropy .
What is more , the increase in entropy defines the direction of the arrow of time .
Time advances in the same direction in which entropy increases what we call the future .
This does not deny that there are local decreases in entropy , like the growth of a child , but the global entropy relentlessly increases with time .
For several years , I taught our junior - senior level course on statistical physics .
We used the standard textbook and followed Boltzmanns derivation of the Second Law of Thermodynamics , with the appropriate level of mathematical sophistication .
In the last few years , I found that there were arguments as far back as 1877 that showed Boltzmann was deeply wrong .
I review some of these problems elsewhere in nontechnical language ..[ 4 ]
Here , I take a different approach and follow an elegant and simple argument by P.C.W.
Davies .
[ 5 ]
As we will shortly see , entropy increases , but not the way Boltzmann thought .
Why several revisions of this famous text persist in the error is a mystery .
-------------
Figure 2 ---------------
The basic difficulty , which can be seen in several independent ways , is that completely isolated systems , like the box of gas , can generate no directionality to time because of the time - symmetric laws governing the system .
Figure 2 displays the entropy , S , of an isolated box of gas plotted versus time , t . We see that the random gas motions give occasional deviations below the maximum .
Although it is unlikely , the random motions spontaneously generate states of greater order or lower entropy , which are then brought back to maximum disorder by the same randomization .
This is like the shuffling of playing cards that , on rare occasions , puts them into states of greater order , with continued shuffling returning them to disorder .
----------------
Figure 3
----------------
Now imagine the following experiment illustrated in Figure 3 .
We just patiently monitor the system until its entropy spontaneously drops to the value S 1 or below at a time t 1 .
If we choose S 1 low enough , this could take a long time .
The virtue of choosing a small value of S 1 is that once it occurs , we know we are very likely to be near the bottom of a dip in the entropy curve , rather then part way down a larger dip .
This is simply because the even larger dips are so much less likely .
At t 1 , when the low entropy , S 1 , occurs , since we are very likely at the minimum of a dip , an increase in entropy with time happens in either direction .
At time t 1 + e , where e is some small time interval , the entropy increases .
We consider this the future .
However , the entropy also increases in the past at t 1 - e .
Therefore , the symmetry of the underlying laws of physics gives no directionality to entropy increase or time .
Even before I began getting instruction from my rototiller 25 years ago , the problem of the arrow of time had largely been resolved , although there are still technical subtleties .
Much to the delight of the Middle Way , the main problem lies in assuming we have a totally isolated system independent of interaction with its environment .
We now understand that we must account for how Boltzmanns box got into the low entropy state of all particles in just one half .
This did not result from just waiting a long time for random motions to throw the gas all to one side , but from Boltzmann evacuating one half and placing gas in the other .
Preparing the box in a low entropy state must generate more entropy elsewhere in the universe .
For example , Boltzmann consumed calories from lunch and radiated energy from himself and his equipment that eventually went into deep space .
In other words , the box had its entropy put into a low condition by processes outside itself , but at the expense of a much greater entropy increase elsewhere in the universe .
Let me give an example closer to the garden .
I walk in the garden to check on whether the mice have eaten the carrots .
My footprint in the soft soil gives it more order and structure , thus lowering its entropy .
However , this lower entropy comes from a much greater generation of entropy from my metabolic processes , which eventually degrade to heat radiated to the universe .
As we have long known , the energy emitted into deep space from our activities can only radiate into space because the universe is expanding .
If the universe were not expanding then it is so large that any line of sight from the Earth , when extended far enough , would land on a star surface .
Then the effective temperature of deep space would be that of the surface of stars , which is typically 6000 °K , rather than the 3 °K it actually has .
Since entropy can only increase when energy moves from high to low temperature regions , the simple process of radiating our body 's energy into space would be blocked in a static universe .
Thus , there would be neither a Boltzmann nor the ability to reduce entropy locally in the box by generating more entropy elsewhere in the universe .
All systems organizing themselves or decreasing their entropy , whether the growing of a carrot , a snowflake , or a child , are decreasing entropy in one location that must be accompanied by a greater entropy generation in another .
Not only is the energy from Boltzmanns food and his equipment eventually traced back to our sun , but the suns low entropy is critical .
Energy generation processes , whether the digestion of our food or the workings of a nuclear power plant , are totally dependent upon our solar system being in a low entropy condition .
What causes the sun and other stars to be in a low entropy condition ?
This occurs because the expansion of the universe was faster than the nuclear generation rates in the first three minutes of the big bang .
Then , when nearly all the helium ( about 25 % of the total mass of the universe ) was formed , the universe expanded so quickly that after three minutes it was too cool for nuclear reactions to occur .
If the expansion and associated cooling were much slower , then all the matter in the universe would form into a very stable isotope of iron , an inert and high entropy condition .
Then the stars would not shine , there would be no great entropy gradients in the universe , no time asymmetry , and , of course , no life .
Local time - asymmetry , such as the decay of any biological system , from carrots to our own bodies , must be accounted for by connecting it to the expansion of the universe and its earliest evolution .
This extraordinary beautiful result has many technical twists and turns , but the central idea is clear : increasing entropy and time - asymmetry owe their existence to the largest and earliest processes in the universe and its continued expansion .
This is a long way from the notion of an isolated and noninteracting system , so abhorrent to the Middle Way .
In this way , when you put cold milk into your coffee and the mixture comes to the same temperature and a higher entropy than when the fluids were separated , you are profiting from the universes expanding and cooling before iron - 56 could form .
Similarly , that we must all face the irreversible process of death , with its massive entropy increase , is traceable to the earliest and largest processes in the universe .
In other words , the impermanence and decay found all around us is due to the earliest and most distance process in the universe and its continued expansion .
On a more positive note , irreversible processes are also essential to life .
If metabolic processes did not irreversibly transform my lunch , not only would I get indigestion , I would not live .
That which sustains me also destroys me .
Indeed , time " is a fire that consumes me , but I am the fire . "

Comparisons and Connections
As I have said in my recent ruminations [ 6 ] about the relationship between physics and Buddhism , it is a mistake to connect any Buddhist principle too closely with any particular phenomena from physics .
Physical theories are prime examples of impermanence .
What happens if I make an argument that some physical effect verifies some great principle of Buddhism and then the physics is replaced by a new theory ?
Does that damage Buddhism ?
Are the foundations of Buddhism to tremble at every scientific revolution ?
A more fruitful dialogue between Buddhism and science can occur when comparisons and connections are done at a more philosophic level .
For example , here I have tried to focus on emptiness , the philosophic heart of Buddhism , and make connections with questions of comparable philosophic significance in physics .
If the connections mutually illuminate both the physics and the Buddhism , without trying to reduce one to the other , then our understanding of both disciplines deepens .
In the present example , the erroneous assumption of a thermodynamic system being completely isolated from any form of external interaction was a critical error .
This error could have been avoided if the philosophic principle of emptiness were more widely understood and appreciated in the scientific community .
Physics is always done in a philosophic context .
In the case of classical statistical physics and thermodynamics , it was done within Cartesian dualism .
Although Descartes vision helped both physics and western philosophy , it has also hindered us in more ways than we can count .
I suggest that the principle of emptiness , if more fully appreciated within science , could actually further the scientific enterprise .
What does Buddhism gain from such connections and comparisons as attempted here ?
I see at least two benefits .
First , understanding such things as the relativity of time ( the 70 days to harvest example ) and the relativity of the present moment helps us appreciate the closely parallel arguments made in the Middle Way about times lack of inherent existence .
There is a well - known and difficult section in Nagarjunas Mulamadhyamakakarika that analyzes time and leads to the modern interpretation , " Time is thus merely a dependent set of relations , not an entity in its own right , and certainly not the inherently existent vessel of existence it might appear to be . " [ 7 ]
Such critical , but difficult , points are illuminated by understanding Einsteins relativity of time .
In short , science can help us understand ancient , but pivotal , philosophic aspects of Buddhism .
Second , Buddhism is a portable religion that has wandered far from the home of the original Prince .
In each movement , whether to China , Japan , or Cambodia , it takes on the hues of the local culture without losing its original spiritual impulse .
Science is clearly a cultural dominant in the West .
Therefore , if Buddhism is to come to the West , in the best and fullest sense of the term , then interaction with science is both inevitable and necessary for a real transplant to take place .
The present effort at understanding some common ground and even synergy between Buddhism and science can be part of the effort to translate Buddhism into terms that are easier for a Westerner to assimilate .
V. Summary and Conclusions Reflecting on the relativity of time and how the irreversible nature of my little friends disease connects to the first few minutes of the universe and its continued expansion gives me little comfort .
Yes , intellectually these ideas strongly support the principle of emptiness , that both the mother and the little boy along with the one who writes these words lack independent existence .
Yes , we are all a system of interdependent relations and thereby subject to the law of impermanence .
Nevertheless , the heartache remains .
That little boy will be consumed by the " fire of time " before he reaches the age of my two sons .
According to the Middle Way , my inveterate projection of that false quality of independent existence is the foundation for my attachment and consequent suffering .
It all comes back to my inability to put these ideas fully into practice .
This is often the plight of those who can articulate ideas but not fully live them .
Or being kinder to myself , perhaps I have assimilated just enough of the principle of emptiness to give me a deep appreciation of the mothers sorrow , but not enough to dispassionately see it all as an embodiment of the First Noble Truth , that all experience is suffused with suffering .
What then do we do ?
The Middle Way advises us to take refuge in the Three Jewels : the Buddha or fully enlightened One , the Buddhas teaching , and the community of those seeking enlightenment .
The Buddha shows that we can do it .
We suffering humans , nurtured and destroyed by time , can become full embodiments of wisdom and compassion and break free from the suffering of samsara , the endless torment of repeated death and rebirth .
The Buddhas teaching , which includes emptiness and much more , is the work at hand among those who support our efforts at realizing these great truths including the mother and her sick child .
If I could reflect deeply enough on the relativity of the twenty years as the maximum allotted to this child and that the very irreversibility of his condition , and my own , is due to deep cosmological connections , then perhaps my sense of connectedness to others and the cosmos could increase .
Could I realize more deeply that my ego and yours are dependent , not inherently existent , but fundamentally co-dependent systems of relationships ?
Could I profoundly appreciate that there is no speaker without a listener , no griever without a dependently related object of grief ?
If I could , then the centrality of my own ego and my self - cherishing would surely diminish .
Such a realization of my egos emptiness and our mutual co-dependency must result in compassion , not just for this little boy and his mother , but for all sentient beings .
Assimilating these great truths and shifting my ego off center stage is surely not easy , but the promised increase in understanding and compassion keeps me trying .
If I could deeply appreciate that any irreversible process , whether the rotting of carrots or my body , is due to the earliest and largest scale structure of the cosmos , then how much easier it would be to appreciate that my neighbors loss or gain is not separate from mine .
Then the suffering in one cell of the body of humanity is truly the suffering of all .
Perhaps , we could even realize that compassion is actually in our own enlightened self - interest and that the survival of our very planet requires a profound understanding of our co-dependence .
In contrast , we could ask what happens when our philosophic view embraces the false notion of independent existence .
The late David Bohm , known for both the depths of his physics and philosophy , said it very directly when he wrote :
It is proposed that the widespread and pervasive distinctions between people ( race , nation , family , profession , etc. , etc. ) , which are now preventing mankind from working together for the common good , and indeed , even for survival , have one of the key factors of their origin in a kind of thought that treats things as inherently divided , disconnected , and " broken up " into yet smaller constituent parts .
Each part is considered to be essentially independent and self - existent . [ 8 ]
According to Bohm , many of the evils of our modern world are traceable to a view where " Each part is considered to be essentially independent and self - existent . "
In other words , one in which things inherently exist .
I tried to show above that , although we commonly assume for simplicity that a system , such as Boltzmanns box , is independent from its surroundings , such a view misleads us .
This is bad enough in physics , but when a race , nation , or person views themselves as fundamentally independent , then the stage is set for calamity the stuff of our daily headlines .
As we stand on the threshold of ever more powerful theories in science , it is more urgent then ever that we find a coherent world view that can guide our science as well as our moral actions .
Consider how the advent of quantum mechanics and relativity brought about the wonders of the information age , along with our horrendous weapons of mass destruction .
Then imagine what wonders and horrors might be released by a grand unified theory or " theory of everything " that today occupies some of the best minds in physics .
What benefits and horrors can we expect from the revolution already underway to understand the complete genetic code ?
Ill conclude with one small example .
Despite it not being " spiritually correct , " I enjoy watching professional football on TV .
I usually hope for a close game with plenty of action .
Occasionally , I find myself rooting for one team .
I urge them on to victory , and even try to exert mental influence through my TV set .
I catch myself and wonder what I am doing .
" Hey , these guys are getting millions of dollars to beat each other up , what do I care who wins ? "
After a little reflection , I realize that " my teams " are those I have some connection with , even it if is only because they are from the State of New York or I go through the Pittsburgh airport on most of my flights .
These flimsiest of connections give me affection and concern for those gladiators .
What would happen if I could more deeply appreciate the profound interdependence implied by the Middle Way ?
What would happen if I could more deeply appreciate , as more than interesting physics , how the irreversible processes that sustain and destroy my life occur because of my connection to the first few minutes of the big bang and the continuing expansion of the universe ?
Then how much do my loyalties expand ?
If I could appreciate that the relativity of time is logically extended to all my subjectivity , then how could I rationally support my selfishness and self - cherishing ?
It is overwhelming to think about extending my loyalties beyond a small circle of family and friends to the cosmos .
Now that we know of more planets outside our solar system than within , does the Bodhisattva vow of working for the liberation of all sentient beings , embrace even those beyond our solar systems ?
Surely , experiencing the sadness of more parents and their mortally sick children would crush me .
How then can I possibly cultivate compassion on a cosmological scale ?
Perhaps the ecological activists can offer guidance .
In the face of daunting global ecological problems , they advise us to " think globally and act locally . "
Following their counsel , I try to keep the cosmological picture in mind and simultaneously act in the present with the person in front of me .
Then it seems small ripples of compassionate action gradually flood beyond my little circle of family and close friends .
The ideal is to extend our concern out in ever widening radii , until it encompasses more and more of the great suffering body of humanity .
If in fact , I lack inherent existence then my present limitations are not fixed , in place for eternity , and I can work toward this ideal .
Let us begin to widen the circle of concern beyond the narrow confines of " our team " and " our friends . "
How else can we live with that devouring tiger of time , that inexorably includes our final irreversible process ?

This mobile quadruped was one of three real and simulated robots used in the study .

A neuroscientist from Indiana University and a roboticist from the University of Tokyo have created a new way to objectively quantify an idea that philosophers , educators and psychologists have discussed for decades -- that the many ways in which our bodies interact with our environment produces better information that helps the brain .
Olaf Sporns , associate professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at IU Bloomington , and UT's Max Lungarella used real and simulated robots in Sporns ' Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Laboratory to create this mathematical framework , which they consider the first step toward the development of an explicit quantitative framework that unifies neural and behavioral processes .
Their findings , published in the journal Public Library of Science Computational Biology on Oct. 27 , could provide insight into how the brain operates and shed light on how it may have evolved , Sporns said .
" Really , this study has opened my eyes , " Sporns said .
" I 'm a neuroscientist , so much of my work is primarily concerned with how the brain works .
But brain and body are never really separate , and clearly they have evolved together .
The brain and the body should not be looked at as separate things when one talks about information processing , learning and cognition -- they form a unit .
This holds a lot of meaning to me biologically . "
An example of this union is how body morphology ( the structure of sensors such as the eyes , for example ) played a role in the kind of sensory information produced by Sporns ' robots , a role that could be precisely measured .
The production of good information and how an organism acts on it ultimately could mean the difference between survival and extinction .
Sporns can see the mathematical framework , as it develops , being used for designing more capable robots and as a tool in basic research on how organisms have evolved .
A classical view of cognition is one of inputs and outputs -- the brain receives information to process and then produces an output -- all independent of the rest of the body as if the brain were a machine or computer .
Philosophers such as educational reformer John Dewey have argued long ago that " doing " is a key part of learning , espousing the influence of a person 's engagement in his or her environment on cognition .
Any living thing with a nervous system is continually interacting with its environment , Sporns said .
He and others in the growing field of embodied cognition think this interaction leads to better and more information .
Quantifying this neural - behavioral relationship , however , has been difficult , if not impossible , until recent mathematical advances let Sporns and others begin to create critical measurement tools .
Sporns and Lungarella measured the information flow from the environment to a series of robots , and then from the robots back to the environment by recording what the robots saw and what they did .
They altered the robots ' visual sensors during the study by changing the density and spatial arrangement of their photoreceptors .
At times , they also disrupted the coupling between the robots and their environment .
They also looked at it in a simple learning context by including a " rewarding object " component to the study design .
Sporns and Lungarella consistently found that well - coordinated and learned actions of the robots created additional structure in their own sensory inputs .
This additional structure may be used by the brain to more efficiently process information .
" When it comes to information processing , brain and body work together .
If this insight is correct , there is a strong message here for how we might understand the human mind , and for how we might go about designing artificial intelligence , " Sporns said .
The research was funded by the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science and by the James S. McDonnell Foundation .

The union is concerned about Muslims in particular
The National Union of Teachers said there had been problems in some areas .
Teachers from minority ethnic groups , particularly Muslims , might also be vulnerable from some pupils and parents , its guidance said .
General secretary Steve Sinnott said open discussion was the best way to counter ignorance and prejudice .
' Determined '
" The terrorists ' actions were timed to coincide with workers ' and pupils ' travelling to offices and schools , " he said .
" We are determined that they will not cause division in our schools . "
Pupils and teachers must be protected from abuse and threats .
" The best way to deal with such problems is to bring them out in the open , to discuss them and ensure that all involved understand that racism is not acceptable .
" Pupils and teachers must be able to carry on their normal lives free from fear . "
He said negative and stereotyped views of Islam and Muslims contributed to prejudice .
Teachers should be especially vigilant for signs of name - calling , abuse and bullying and intervene early to prevent things from escalating .
But the NUT said no attempt should be made to take a politically partisan approach or to belittle a particular set of opinions .

Throughout history , there have been those who have predicted the Coming of the End , the Consummation of All Things , the Return of Christ , Armageddon , Ragnarok , what - have - you .
The majority of these seers and prognosticators were wise enough to leave the date unspecified , presumably to avoid embarrassment when the expected event failed to materialize .
Others , such as Nostradamus and Bishop Ussher , put the date far into the future , long after their corporeal bodies had returned to dust .
There are those few brave souls , however , who are willing to stick their necks out , and give us a date in the near future , when they themselves will presumably still be around to either bask in the glow of glory , or suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune , should the cosmic plan go awry .
It is to these , the few , the brave and most importantly , the Web - enabled that this list is dedicated .
Date Author Event Status

Too many to mention
The so - called " millenium bug " will result in a massive computer outage on 1/1/2000 , caused by that fact that in the good old days of yore , many COBOL programmers decided to save a bit of memory by using only two digits to encode a year on date fields .
Obviously , when " 00 " rolls around , these programs will think that it is January 1 , 1900 , and every algorithm that relies on a date sort routine will fail .
It should be noted that very few of the doom - and - gloom purveyors are actually programmers .
Those of us ( like your ever humble list maintainer ) who are involved with these systems on a daily basis tend to suspect that while there may be widespread outages and related problems , the worst that will happen is that a whole host of unlucky nerds will have to pull several all - nighters in front of their terminals .
But we will get it fixed .
Update ( 1/4/2000 ) : I think it is fairly safe to say that this prediction has mercifully failed .
Was it a case of over - hype , or timely solution ?
You decide .
In the meantime , would anyone like 800 tins of Beanie - Weenies ?

However , Gary seems to be holding out some hope that death and destruction will slowly creep upon us in the coming months .
I think not .

April 5 , 2000 Michael Rood Almost missed this one .
Michael updated his guess for Tishri 1 , 6001 to April 5 , 2000 .
This day " starts out with bloodshed , plagues , and all manner of pestilence " .
Sounds like a pretty good description of the Nasdaq roller - coaster to me .
Sigh .

May 5 , 2000 Richard Noone
The coming Ice disaster .
Polar shifts .
Global disaster .
Or something ... ( May 5 , 2000 is the date of the next Grand Conjunction , when the planets line up .
Anyone remember 1982 ?
The year of the last Grand Conjunction ?
When the world utterly failed to end ? )
Update ( 5/6/00 ) :
To the complete surprise of almost no - one ( except , possibly , Mr. Noone ) , the end of the world has once again failed to arrive as scheduled .
To his credit , Richard did strongly pepper his recent articles with weasel - words like " potential " and " possibly " , but one suspects that life has once again thrown a would - be Jeremiah the proverbial curve ball .
Now all Richard has to do is figure out where those voices in his head really came from ...
Update ( 6/18/00 ) : An addendum on Noone 's home page makes the insightful observation that " ... most earth change activity has not affected high population areas ... " .
It does point out that there have been earthquakes across the Pacific Rim , however .
Golly gee .
Earthquakes in the most active tectonic plates on the planet ?
Who woulda thunk it ...

May 17 , 2000 Rebecca Harrison
Also known as St John ( hey , why not ? ) , this starry - eyed soothsayer presents a wealth of future unfolding .
May 17 , 2000 , Jesus is scheduled to debut his presence here on EArth .
( That is not a typo , by the way .
All you classical lit buffs should know what it means .
Think " Gilgamesh " . )
Then , in June of 2003 , the final battle takes place .
Jesus said " no man knows the day or hour " , but apparently the month and year were not covered .
Also , there will be a forty day period of fasting from August 20 to September 30 .
You have been warned .
( Finally , a use for all those Y2 K canned meats ! )

June 10 , 2000 Ron Reese Based on an extremely trustworthy source ( a " revelation " ) and some convoluted logic , Ron thinks that a " flood - like " event will occur on June 10 .
Before we dismiss this as yet another of Ron 's ravings ( he has graced this list before ) , we should point out that Bonnie Gaunt was able to confirm this revelation through the use of oh - so - trustworthy numerology .
So there .
Failed
June 11 , 2000 Marilyn Agee
Third time 's the charm .
Update ( 6/18/2000 ) :
Well , it seems that Marilyn's third date for the first rapture came and went with no obvious Heavenly fanfare .
What of the future ?
Marilyn seems to think that the Church is currently in a 10 - day waiting period , based on Rev 2:10 .
That means that June 20 should see the Rapture .
This time for sure .
Update ( 6/25/2000 ) :
A new note on Marilyn's front page reads as follows : Messianic Rabbi Michael Rood [ www.6001.com] announced today on the Prophecy Club that the corrected Solar Calendar proves that Shavuot begins this year on July 9th .
This because the barley was ' Abib ' , green / ripe , on June 5th .
This makes Oct. 28th Tishri 1 , 6001 .
If his calculations are correct then the Pentecost Rapture may still occur this year .
So there .
Update ( 7/2/2000 ) :
More stupid calendar tricks .
Poor old Noah has been pressed into service yet again as a harbinger of the End .
In a long and very confusing piece of eisegesis , Marilyn somehow arrives at Av 19 ( Aug 20 ) as a possible date for the Rapture .
Says Marilyn : " I wonder if the indwelling Holy Spirit of Christ will fly the dove ( Bride ) to her rest , Heaven , on Av 19 ( Sunday , Aug. 20 , 2000 ) ? " Uh ... that would be a " no " .

July 7 , 2000 Robert Hallman Combining UFO 's ( do n't trust those greys - they are " Satan 's Soldiers " ! ) , Nostradamus and Biblical prophecy , Robert arrives at a tentative date ( or two ) for the Rapture .
Robert has also exposed the Antichrist for all to see .
Update ( 7/17/00 ) : Most of Robert 's pages are now gone , with the exception of a home page that sports a spiffy image of a morphing alien coupled with a rather pathetic poem .
Still he admonishes us not to trust those greys .
I intend to take him seriously .
Alien cookout , anyone ?
Hmmm ... tastes like chicken ...

July 2000 Melody Mehta Drawing data from such prophetic heavyweights as Gordon Michael Scallion , Nostradamus and Mother Shipton , Melody thinks that Phobos , one of the moons of Mars , will be knocked out of orbit by a passing comet .
Guess where it 's going to land up ?
Yup - it 's metal helmet time , as several billion tons of rock come crashing down on us unsuspecting homo sapiens .
And , with such remarkably accurate soothsayers on her side , how can Melody possibly fail to be wrong ?

August 20 , 2000 Ephraim Begin preparations for the Battle of Armageddon .
Ephraim reinterprets the book of Daniel for the umpteenth time , and arrives at a timeline for the Last Days .
Unfortunately , this timeline calls for the Rapture to occur in March of 2000 .
Oops .
Not to worry , our resourceful exegete points out that several events in this time period confirm his predictions .
O ye of little faith ...
Update ( 8/27/00 ) : Well , the Battle of Armageddon remains as elusive as ever .
Have no fear , however , as Ephraim remains convinced that September 30 will mark the beginning of the Great Tribulation , and October 22 the Rapture .
( Cool !
On my birthday , too ... )

September 2 , 2000 Jerry Grenough September 2 sees the end of the Jewish year 5760 .

September 6 , 2000 Daniel Adam Millar
The peace accord between Israel and Palestine on September 13 , 1993 marked the beginning of the seven - year tribulation .

September 16 - 19 , 2000 Phil Stone The Coastlands disaster .
Phil sees all of Biblical history as a blueprint for the last days .
The Gulf War , for example , was simply a replay of the story of Moses , substituting each year of the story for one day in modern times .
Now that that 's all clear , Phil sees the story of the Exodus as predicting a massive increase in the sea - level , resulting in catastrophic loss of life in the Summer of 2000 .

September 29 , 2000 Michael Rood
He 's back .
Michael believes that the accepted Hebrew calendar is all meshuga , and has kindly taken it upon himself to produce a corrected version .
His version states that the seventh millenium actually began either on April 6 , 2000 or May 5 , 2000 .
( It depends on when his barley actually ripened .
I kid you not . )
This means that he expects the invasion of God and Magog either at the end of September , 2000 or October 28 , 2000 .

September 30 , 2000 Jim Bramlett
Citing several erudite end - times scholars , one of whom is our own Marilyn Agee , Jim arrives at a window of 2004 - 2007 for the Second Coming .
Citing a few more scholars and remarkable parallels , Jim tentatively points to Fall 2000 as the date of the Rapture .
One should also note that Jim has a page pointing to June 1 , 2000 as a possible date for the Rapture , though he seems to be unsure about how seriously it should be taken , considering the source .

October 1 , 2000 Byron Weeks The National ID Card system will be implemented on October 1st .
President Clinton will declare martial law sometime in September or October , and the World Government will start rounding up the separatists and patriots .

November 12 , 2000 James van der Worp Okay , you 're going to have to pay attention for this one .
James was suspicious of NASA 's silence concerning comet 76P .
Following a chain of what we will generously call reasoning , James visits Mother Shipton , Gordon - Michael Scallion and that old stalwart Nostradamaus , and decided that there is an outside chance that 76P could knock Phobos out of Mars orbit , and directly into the path of the Earth .
He projects an impact date of November 12 , 2000 , although he seems to think that a more likely period would be sometime in October .
Whenever it hits , I , for one , intend to hold my umbrella up high .

November 17 , 2000 David Zavitz Another eisegesis fan ( look it up ! ) , David sees the Oslo Accord of September 13 , 1993 between President Arafat and the late President Rabin as the start of the seven - year tribulation countdown .
Somehow , this means that November 17 of 2000 will see " Faith 's big reward " ( ? ) , followed in short order by the resurrection of Daniel himself .

But just in case , wonder no more .
These nice folks have kindly figured out the True Bible Code for us .
And is sure has some interesting things to say .
Apparently , the UN will take over the world sometime between March 26th and April 24th of 2001 .
No - one will be able to buy or sell anything without UN authority after May 2001 .

May 28 , 2001 David Parker David , also known ( for some reason ) as CAPS , has latched onto the story of the Baptism of Fire in Acts 2 , and somehow transformed it into a potential date for the Rapture at Pentecost of 2001 .

May 28 , 2001 Marilyn Agee While Marilyn is desperately taking pot-shots at a date for the Rapture , she has in the meantime decided on an appointment for the start of the Tribulation .
This date should see the beginning of the ministry of the two end - time witnesses , as well as the unveiling of the Antichrist .
She notes that she expects the Rapture between now and the start of the Tribulation .
Anyone want to take bets that this is going to come down to the wire ?
Update ( 5/30/01 ) : Marilyn seems to be in her quiet phase right now .
Traditionally , there will be a few days of utter silence from the Agee camp while she desperately tries to figure out why she is still here .
This will be followed by the equally traditional " Monkey Throwing Darts at the Calendar " phase , after which she will announce that , in fact , the Rapture was actually scheduled for next year all along .
Go Marilyn !
Update ( 6/15/01 ) : The Monkey / Dart phase is now in full swing .
Having already seen June 9/10 go whizzing by , Marilyn is ( cautiously ) pointing the marker to June 21 .
It is on this day , apparently , that the Moon will be New , and the Eclipse will be in Gemini , or somesuch .
One can only hope that Jupiter aligns with Mars , and Peace guides the planets as well ...

November 11 , 2001 Bob Ware
In a post that , for some reason , reminds me of a session of the Kevin Bacon Game gone hideously wrong , Bob repeatedly singles out the date of 11 -22-01 as being somehow significant .

It appears that one - half second before midnight on April 14 , 2002 , the Doomsgate will open , Jesus will appear for his saints .
Nuclear war will begin 45 days after this point , earth shifts and global cataclysms just before it .
At other points in this meandering , barely coherent diatribe , we are told that America will probably be under totalitarian rule before the end of Summer , 1999 , and that Y2 K ( anyone remember that ? ) will signal the start of an inevitable slide into economic disaster .
Seems that a few updates are called for .

Clay Cantrell
You have to love this one .
Clay based his estimate of the date for the Rapture on the dimensions of Noah 's Ark ( converted to inches ) , taking special note of the location of the " escape window " , and followed by some esoteric calculation involving the rotation of sun through the sky .
Barnum was only half right .
Update ( 2/22/01 ) : Clay explains his " reasoning " ...
2004 Watcher Ministries The Tribulation began in 1997 , and Christ will return seven years later in 2004 .
All this is based on an analysis of the Great Pyramid of Giza .
2005 Everett Vasek Everett believes that the Rapture will occur on the Jewish feast day of Rosh Hashanah , sometime between 1998 , and October 4 , 2005 .
He bases this date on the timing of the Jewish feasts , the upcoming Israeli peace treaty , and the possible length of a biblical generation being 14,000 days long .
1999 - 2007 Thomas Chase Thomas has a number of predictions for this period .
He foresees the arrival of the Antichrist sometime in 1999 - 2000 , the approach of Cassini in August 1999 as a " holographic or parallel event " signaling a possible nuclear crisis in Russia , and Armageddon , another nuclear war , in 2007 .

The list of " somethings " include a hyperspatial breakthrough , planetesimal impact , alien contact or even a quasar ignition at the galactic core .

Claim : Photograph shows a “ fire rainbow ” over Idaho .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , 2006 ]
THIS IS A FIRE RAINBOW — THE RAREST OF ALL NATURALLY OCCURING ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA .
THIS IS A FIRE RAINBOW — THE RAREST OF ALL NATURALLY OCCURING ATMOSPHERIC PHENOMENA .
THE PICTURE WAS CAPTURED ON THE IDAHO / WASHINGTON BORDER .
THE EVENT LASTED ABOUT 1 HOUR .
CLOUDS HAVE TO BE CIRRUS , AT LEAST 20 K FEET IN THE AIR , WITH JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF ICE CRYSTALS AND THE SUN HAS TO HIT THE CLOUDS AT PRCEISELY 58 DEGREES .
Origins :
This image of a “ fire rainbow ” is a real photograph of a brightly colored atmospheric phenomenon known as a circumhorizon ( tal ) arc .
The
example shown above was captured on camera as it hung for about an hour across a several - hundred square mile area of sky above northern Idaho ( near the Washington border ) on 3 June 2006 .
In general , a circumhorizontal arc ( or “ fire rainbow ” ) appears when the sun is high in the sky ( i.e. , higher than 58° above the horizon ) , and its light passes through diaphanous , high - altitude cirrus clouds made up of hexagonal plate crystals .
Sunlight entering the crystals ’ vertical side faces and leaving through their bottom faces is refracted ( as through a prism ) and separated into an array of visible colors .
When the plate crystals in cirrus clouds are aligned optimally ( i.e. , with their faces parallel to the ground ) , the resulting display is a brilliant spectrum of colors reminiscent of a rainbow .

Linux Journal celebrated the publication of its 100th issue in 2002 with the release of the Linux Timeline .
It 's now 2006 , Linux itself turns 15 this year and Linux Journal , a little older , grayer and wiser , is soon to release it 's 150th issue .
In celebration and in honor of an amazing community 's history we 're compiling the significant events of 2002 through 2006 ( and of course anything from earlier years that we may have previously missed ) .
We ask you to take a few minutes of time and help record history .
Consider this article post a giant whiteboard -- comment on the event or events you find to be most significant in Linux 's recent history , you 'll likely see our editors doing just the same .
We 'll compile the events and re-release the timeline for all to share in the upcoming months .
Ready ?
Here we go :
August 1991 ``Hello everybody out there using minix - I 'm doing a ( free ) operating system ( just a hobby , wo n't be big and professional like gnu ) for 386 ( 486 ) AT clones .
This has been brewing since april , and is starting to get ready .
I 'd like any feedback on things people like / dislike in minix , as my OS resembles it somewhat ( same physical layout of the file - system ( due to practical reasons ) among other things ) .
I 've currently ported bash ( 1.08 ) and gcc( 1.40 ) , and things seem to work .
This implies that I 'll get something practical within a few months , and I 'd like to know what features most people would want .
Any suggestions are welcome , but I wo n't promise I 'll implement them :-)
Linus ( PS .
Yes - it 's free of any minix code , and it has a multi - threaded fs .
It is NOT protable ( uses 386 task switching etc ) , and it probably never will support anything other than AT - harddisks , as that 's all I have :-(.''
September 1991 Linux version 0.01 is released and put on the Net .
April 1992

June 1994
While at a conference in New Orleans , Jon ``maddog ' '
Hall persuades Linus to port Linux to DEC 's 64 - bit Alpha computer processor chip .
Less than two weeks later , maddog had also persuaded DEC to fund the project .
An Alpha workstation was immediately sent to Linus. ``Digital [ DEC ] and the Linux community formed the first truly successful venture of suits and Linux geeks working together '' , said maddog .
Linux International , a nonprofit vendor organization , is founded by Jon ``maddog '' Hall .
Linux International goes on to become a major contributor to the success of Linux , helping corporations and others work toward the promotion of the Linux operating system .
August 1994
Linux trademark dispute : is Linux trademarked ?
William R. Della Croce , Jr. files for the trademark ``Linux '' on August 15 , 1994 , and it is registered in September .
Della Croce has no known involvement in the Linux community yet sends letters out to prominent Linux companies demanding money for use of the trademark ``Linux ' ' .
A lawsuit is filed in 1996 against Della Croce .
Plaintiffs in the suit include Linus Torvalds ; Specialized Systems Consultants , Inc. ( publishers of Linux Journal ) ; Yggdrasil Computing , Inc. ; Linux International ; and WorkGroup Solutions ( also known as LinuxMall ) .
The plaintiffs prevail , and in 1997 announce the matter as settled by the assignment of the mark to Linus Torvalds on behalf of all Petitioners and Linux users .
September 1994
Linux is first mentioned in the mainstream press .
Wired magazine features an article titled ``Kernel Kid ' ' , by Seth Rosenthal .
He writes : ``So , is Linus going to become the Bill Gates of Finland ?
Maybe not .
He claims to be ' by no means a good student ' and is in no hurry to graduate since ' Linux has taken a lot of time from my studies , and I like the work I have at the University which keeps me alive . '''
Randolph Bentson reports on the world 's first vendor - supported Linux device driver in Linux Journal .

The price for entry into the exhibit hall and a pass to the conferences ? $ 4 .
January 1997
First ``Linux virus '' discovered .
Called Bliss , it actually works on any UNIX - like OS and offers a helpful - - ``bliss - uninfect - files - please ' ' command - line option .
Alan Cox points out that Bliss ``does not circumvent the security of the system , it relies on people with privilege to do something dumb ' ' and reminds users to install digitally signed software from trustworthy sites only and to check signatures before installing .
`` In fact it 's probably easier to write a virus for Linux because it 's open source and the code is available .
So we will be seeing more Linux viruses as the OS becomes more common and popular . ''-- Wishful thinking from McAfee
January 1998 Linux Weekly News begins publication with Jonathan Corbet and Elizabeth Coolbaugh as founders .
The very first issue , dated January 22 , was just a tiny hint of what LWN was to become .
Netscape announces that they will release the source to their browser under a free software license .
This almost certainly remains one of the most important events of the year ; it opened a lot of eyes to what Linux and free software could provide .
Red Hat Advanced Development Labs ( RHAD ) is founded .
It has since become one of the higher - profile places where people are paid to develop free software and an important component of the GNOME Project .
RHAD is able to attract developers like ``Rasterman '' ( although only for a short time ) and Federico Mena - Quintero .
February 1998
The Cobalt Qube is announced and immediately becomes a favorite in the trade press due to its high performance , low price and cute form factor .
Cobalt 's Linux engineering is done by none other than David Miller , the source of much that is good in the Linux kernel .
The Linux user community wins InfoWorld 's technical support award ; Red Hat 5.0 also won their Operating System award .
But it was the tech support award that truly opened some eyes ; everybody had been saying that Linux had no support .
This was the beginning of the end of the ``no support '' argument .
Eric Raymond and friends come up with the term ``open source ' ' .
They apply for trademark status and put up the opensource.org web site .
Thus begins the formal effort to push Linux for corporate use .
March 1998 Consumer advocate Ralph Nader asks the large PC vendors ( Dell , Gateway , Micron , etc. ) to offer non-Microsoft systems , including systems with Linux installed .
April 1998 Linux is covered by the US National Public Radio news , marking one of its first appearances in the mainstream , nontechnical press .
O'Reilly holds the ``first ever '' Free Software Summit , featuring Larry Wall , Brian Behlendorf , Linus Torvalds , Guido van Rossum , Eric Allman , Phil Zimmermann , Eric Raymond and Paul Vixie .
May 1998
The Google search engine pops up .
Not only is it one of the best search engines around , but it 's based on Linux and features a Linux - specific search page .
Big databases start to arrive .
Support for Linux is announced by Computer Associates for their Ingres system and by Ardent Software for their O2 object database .
June 1998 ``Like a lot of products that are free , you get a loyal following even though it 's small .
I 've never had a customer mention Linux to me .''-- Bill Gates , PC Week , June 25 , 1998 `` ... these operating systems will not find widespread use in mainstream commercial applications in the next three years , nor will there be broad third - party application support . ''-- The Gartner Group says there is little hope for free software .
A Datapro study comes out showing that Linux has the highest user satisfaction of any system ; it also shows Linux to be the only system other than Microsoft Windows NT that is increasing its market share .
IBM announces that it will distribute and support the Apache web server after working a deal with the Apache team .
July 1998
The desktop wars rage as KDE and GNOME advocates hurl flames at each other .
Linus gets in on the act , saying that KDE is okay with him .
In this context , KDE 1.0 is released .
The first stable release of the K Desktop Environment proves to be popular , despite the complaints from those who do not like the licensing of the Qt library .
Informix quietly releases software for Linux .
Meanwhile , Oracle beats Informix to the punch PR - wise and makes a Linux - friendly announcement first , suggesting that they would soon be supporting Linux .
Oracle promises to make a trial version available by the end of 1998 , a deadline they beat by months .
This , seemingly , was one of the acid tests for the potential of long - term success for Linux ; a great deal of attention resulted from both Informix 's and Oracle 's announcements .
Informix announces support for Linux effectively moments after Oracle does so .
Sybase later announces their support for Linux also .
Linus appears on the cover of Forbes magazine .
A lengthy story presents Linux in a highly positive manner and brings the system to the attention of many who had never heard of it before .
Linux begins to become a household word .
September 1998 LinuxToday.com is launched by Dave Whitinger and Dwight Johnson .
The site , later acquired by Internet.com , arguably becomes the most well - read and visited Linux portal of all time .
Microsoft's Steve Ballmer admits that they are ``worried '' about free software and suggests that some of the Windows NT source code may be made available to developers .
The same month Microsoft goes on to list Linux as a competitive threat in its annual SEC ( US Securities and Exchange Commission ) filing .
Speculation abounds that their real purpose is to influence the upcoming antitrust trial .
October 1998 ``For the moment , however , the company from Redmond , Washington , seems almost grateful for the rising profile of Linux , seeing it as an easy way of demonstrating that Windows is not a monopoly , ahead of its antitrust trial , scheduled to begin on October 15 .

The piece that was originally here has been moved .
( The comments remain attached to the present post . )
It was a piece produced for amusement that mined the Amazon reviews for a particular book in search of evidence that Amazon had censored one - star reviews .
It turned out that the evidence did n't stand up .
The piece originally stated that the evidence might not hold up and pointed out the reason it might not , which did in fact turn out to be the case .
The piece got a lot of attention anyway .
At this point I 'd rather have it elsewhere than on my blog .
However , based on the ( limited and anecdotal ) evidence I 've seen , I * think *
Amazon may have guidelines in place that make it harder for negative reviews to get posted than positive ones , even though those guidelines probably are n't " do n't post negative reviews . "
Rather , negative reviews may to have more hoops to jump through .

The Tragedy of General Motors
The Detroit giant is a weird , scarred combination : a carmaker doing poorly , and an insurance company engulfed by its obligations .
It 's heading for a wreck -- which is why CEO Rick Wagoner has the toughest job in business .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) -
It is the instinctive wish of most American businesspeople , even those unlikely to be directly affected , that General Motors not go bankrupt .
True , some people will say , " They had it coming to them . "
But the majority will be more practical , telling themselves that the company is so central to the economy , so sprawling in its commercial reach , that bankruptcy - -" going into chapter , " as restructuring folks say -- is ominous almost beyond contemplation .
And yet the evidence points , with increasing certitude , to bankruptcy .
Rick Wagoner , GM 's 53 - year - old chairman and CEO , may say , as he did in a January interview with FORTUNE in his aerie of an office high above the Detroit River , " I know that things will turn around . "
But he can not know that .
He may not , deep down , even believe it himself .
Bankruptcy is n't going to occur next week .
But down the road -- say , past 2006 - - its probability is high .
That point of view seems supported by the opinions of the bond - rating agencies , which troubled companies must keep informed and which become virtual insiders in their understanding of a company 's finances and operations .
In recent months both Moody 's and Standard & Poor 's have made increasingly grim statements , bald in their talk of bankruptcy and laden with doubts that GM ( Research ) can turn around its reeling North American auto operations , now reduced to an embarrassing market share of 26 % .
In that percentage lies a harrowing , and maybe intractable , revenue problem .
Says one GM executive : " There 's no fix for us unless we get revenues stabilized . "
Nonetheless , Wagoner and crew must also deal with the full range of GM 's problems , and they add up to a Hummer - sized load .
The company lost $ 8.6 billion last year , burning up billions of dollars in North America , earning too little back overseas .
Its product mix in the U.S. , heavily weighted toward trucks , pickups , and SUVs , is on the wrong side of gas prices .
It has a finance subsidiary , GMAC , whose majority interest it needs to sell to keep that business healthy and itself in cash -- and so far , no buyer has emerged .
It is inextricably entangled in the bankruptcy of its biggest supplier , Delphi .
In that imbroglio , as in countless others , it is up against a formidable and sometimes militant union whose ability to accept the full reality of GM 's problems is not assured .
The company is even under investigation by the SEC for accounting sins , as yet unrevealed .
And gravely , it is burdened by health costs , which it supplies for a population bigger than Detroit 's -- that is , for a total of 1.1 million employees , retirees , and dependents .
Its thriving Japanese competitors , such as Toyota ( Research ) , pay health benefits for their U.S. active employees and dependents too .
But Toyota does not have GM 's retiree health burden , a mountain that at year - end totaled an unfunded $ 64 billion and that , in annual effect on the bottom line , adds about $ 1,300 to the cost of every car and truck GM makes in the U.S .
Wagoner is exultant that he and the UAW gruelingly managed last year to make a deal that , if blessed by a federal judge , will cut GM 's unfunded liability by around $ 15 billion and pare cash outlays as well .
But that will still leave Wagoner facing a colossal competitive disadvantage .
The cost is not his fault .
Rather , it is a legacy dumped on him by CEOs of decades ago who gained a certain amount of wage restraint from the union -- and labor peace for their own terms of office -- by granting retiree health benefits that had neither large , immediate cash costs nor , under the accounting rules then applying , much effect on the bottom line .
Today , with health - care costs exploding and the accounting rules stiffened , this mess has come home to roost .
It is the problem , says Wagoner ( almost certainly giving too little weight to his shortage of revenues ) , that more than anything else " affects the future viability of GM . "
In character , today 's GM is a weird and painfully scarred combination of businesses .
It is a car company doing poorly , and it is an insurance company engulfed by obligations way beyond its ability to pay .
Such an enterprise probably cannot escape bankruptcy .
The securities markets flash their warnings with regularity .
The prices of GM 's bonds have fallen severely , and its stock plunged in December to below $ 19 , the lowest price since 1982 .
In early February the stock was $ 23 .
Were it not for GM 's dividend , $ 2 annually , the price would surely be lower than it is .
Is there anything optimistic to say ?
Well , it is important to remember that giant auto companies have been turned around before .
In 1980 , aided by $ 1.5 billion in loan guarantees from the U.S. government and his own pitchman routines on television , Lee Iacocca brought Chrysler back from the abyss .
Nearly 20 years later Carlos Ghosn , an improbable mixture of Lebanese blood , Brazilian birth , French education , and American business experience , grabbed tight hold of Japan 's sinking Nissan Motor and restored it to industry prominence .
Yet these rescue jobs surely pale in comparison to what it would take to turn around General Motors , this giant so large that in the FORTUNE 500's first half - century it ranked No. 1 on the list in 37 years .
( In our last list it was No. 3 . ) One Wall Streeter deeply familiar with the company recently stated the challenge starkly : " I would say that turning GM around is a harder logistical and managerial task than the invasion of Iraq . "
This same Wall Streeter is not kind to the GM generals charged with the rescue job .
Describing the company as a " sclerotic bureaucracy , " he says a good remedy might be firing the top five people and replacing them with outsiders .
A less acid form of criticism has been laid on by the camp of Kirk Kerkorian , whose Tracinda Corp. owns just under 10 % of GM 's stock .
In January , Kerkorian 's advisor Jerry York , a turnaround veteran himself ( at Iacocca 's Chrysler and Lou Gerstner 's IBM ) , gave a long luncheon speech at the Detroit auto show that accused GM 's executives of lacking " urgency " and " sense of purpose . "
York 's reason for growling : Kerkorian 's losses , about $ 172 million of them realized at this point , with the rest -- another $ 223 million -- sitting as unrealized losses on his books .
York and Wagoner have talked about York 's going on the GM board , but -- as of early February , at least -- they had not had a meeting of the minds .
Maybe , one might guess , the Kerkorian camp has wanted both board representation and complete freedom to sell its stock .
That could have been a problem because GM 's general counsel sent a memo last May to a sizable layer of GM executives telling them - - for reasons he left quite vague -- that they should refrain throughout 2005 from either buying or selling the company 's stock .
The prohibition , which still has n't been lifted , is highly unusual because insiders normally have " windows " of time in which they can legally trade .
In this instance , perhaps the insiders ' deep understanding of GM 's problems simply makes it unfair , and therefore also legally perilous , for them to be trafficking in its stock .
Wagoner , in any case , hotly disputes anybody 's notion that GM lacks a sense of urgency .
There 's a " boulder hanging over our heads , " he says , and it 's causing the place to accelerate product introductions ( like new models of its star Silverado and Sierra pickups , racing into showrooms soon ) and otherwise operate with " breakneck speed . "
No doubt thinking back on GM's 98 years of existence -- and to the pantheon of Alfred P. Sloan , Charles Kettering , and lesser gods -- he strikes a poignant personal note as well : " Nobody 's got a bigger stake in this than I do .
I have this little sort of burden of history .
I 'm not going to be the guy that does n't get this company going in the right direction . "
If energy alone could do it , Wagoner might pull it off .
Once a basketball player at Duke , he is tall and broad - shouldered , strong enough in fact to be at least metaphorically matched to the massive corporate weight he carries .
A GM-er for the 29 years of his working life and CEO since 2000 , he was in shirtsleeves as he talked to FORTUNE in January .
Surrounding him were the usual suspects , miniature models of cars .
He was animated to a degree that amazed one of his public relations people , who was n't sure she 'd ever seen him quite so expansive .
And on his mind was the whole of the GM scene , including the need to keep growing in China , to build great products , to keep that boulder off his head .
Naturally , boulder evasion means that GM is deeply and broadly into cost cutting :
It is closing plants to kill its excess capacity , terminating many thousands of people , negotiating with the UAW to free itself at least partially from the nearly un-American JOBS bank , in which laid - off union members get paid for not working .
How many people are in the JOBS bank ?
Analysts ask that repeatedly and are refused an answer , probably because GM thinks nothing can be gained by hanging a number out there that Wall Street and the press can beam their attention on .
But Sean McAlinden , chief economist of the Center for Automotive Research , thinks there were 5,200 employees in the JOBS bank at the end of 2005 .
He figures the annual cost of each to GM is at least $ 100,000 .
Globally GM is once again striving to take advantage of its huge scale to reduce engineering and parts costs ( it has paid lip service to this goal before ) .
In the U.S. it can't easily cut brands ---- dealer franchise laws make that almost impossible -- and that 's a vise , because the eight brands it sells ( Buick , Cadillac , Chevrolet , GMC , Hummer , Pontiac , Saab , and Saturn ) are a big crowd for a 26 % market share .
At the least , the company is working to wedge Pontiac , Buick , and GMC into the same dealerships ---- under the same " rooftops " -- and to sell within them , for instance , only one minivan model rather than two .
GM 's sales and marketing head for North America , Mark LaNeve , calls the cutting of each independent dealer a " little soap opera , " in which entrepreneurs , in some cases with kids they expected to inherit their business , give up their turf by inches .
Perhaps most important for cost cutting at GM , Wagoner has just put a renowned chopper , Frederick " Fritz " Henderson , 47 , into the job of chief financial officer .
Henderson , a mustachioed and candid speed - talker , came from GM's European operations , where he reduced ( though did n't eliminate ) losses and got to be known as Chainsaw Fritz .
He considers cost cutting an unending battle and approvingly cites the " continuous improvement " that is an integral part of the Toyota culture .
In another example of non-arrogance , Henderson listened at a luncheon table , taking notes , as Jerry York gave his January speech .
" He 's a major shareholder , " said Henderson later .
" It 's important that we listen to him . "
But he scoffed at York 's claim that GM is blind to the depth of its troubles : " I 'm in crisis mode and have been for years . "
In all that GM is doing , there is a bleak awareness that no companies have ever turned around because of cost cutting alone .
The essential partner is revenue growth -- and as those losses in market share show , that has been the crucible for GM .
In product design , it lost the magic long ago .
" They need irresistibility and head - turners , " says one car buff , " and they have n't had them . "
The man now on that case is product - development boss Bob Lutz , 74 , who , after retiring from Chrysler , was hired by Wagoner in 2001 .
Tall , elegantly dressed , and outspoken , he is treated like a rock star at auto shows , often attracting more attention than his cars .
At the Detroit show in January , touring GM 's space with reporters , he was pleased to point out classy - looking car interiors - -" some of GM 's used to be grotesque , " he said -- and a level of fit and finishes that he judged superb .
A reporter needled him : " Bob , I miss those bad fits , those gaps , that you had a while back .
I used to store my quarters for tolls in those . "
Lutz -- and all at GM -- are plainly battling the past , when many buyers gave up on its vehicles and turned to foreign cars .
Today , GM has an enormous perception problem : a belief by too many U.S. consumers -- particularly in the East , West , and some of the South , which pretty much leaves GM hugging the Midwest -- that it does n't make cars as reliable as those of foreign producers .
That was indisputably true once .
The current evidence , though , is mixed : Consumer Reports , a bible for many carbuyers , rates GM 's improvements as " inconsistent " and ranks most of its cars as also - rans ; J.D. Power , however , a leading arbiter of quality , gives many of its cars top grades .
Meanwhile , GM people haul out comparison charts showing , for example , that a Chevrolet Malibu outdoes Toyota 's Camry in just about every performance rating going , yet costs $ 2,640 less .
Customers shrug their shoulders and keep on buying Camrys -- their memories are long , and their motivation for returning to GM small .
The gist of GM 's sales problem is summed up by Don Freda , a suburban New Yorker who has run an independent auto - repair shop for 52 years .
What , he is asked , do you think about the quality of GM 's cars these days ?
" They 're very good , " he answers .
" They do n't break like they used to . "
Then , immediately , " But nobody will buy them . "
So it 's no surprise that GM has been the impresario of incentives since 2001 , when it immediately followed up 9/11 by launching the incentive program called Keep America Rolling .
After that , the come - ons never ceased , so buyers quickly realized it would be idiotic to pay anything close to MSRP ( manufacturer 's suggested retail price ) .
Last spring , when Wagoner personally took over the running of the North American business , he said that GM would reduce the use of incentives .
But that pullback was n't immediate : GM needed revenues in 2005 , no matter their quality , and it kept on dishing the incentives out .
It was not until this January that GM officially announced a new pricing program , built on the thought of " selling the product , not the deal . "
The program cuts the MSRP on most of GM 's cars , a change aimed at still giving the buyer an attractive price , but not by way of ballyhooed incentives .
The price of a Tahoe SUV , for example , is dropping from a 2005 level of $ 36,790 to $ 32,990 ( an amount that Wagoner says could still be reduced by ad hoc incentives ) .
A big reason for the change is that about two - thirds of carbuyers these days do comparison shopping on the Internet , where GM feels it must show a " real " price , as opposed to the fictional prices -- before incentives -- that it was presenting before .
As still another part of its new marketing program , GM is planning to cut back on its large - scale sales to rental - car companies , which not only buy at a sharp discount but also quickly flip their vehicles into the resale market and thereby hurt the residual values of GM cars .
In all this , it is important to keep remembering that GM desperately needs to at least stabilize its market share and simultaneously to extract profits from what it sells .
Whether this plan will do any better than the others now discarded is deeply uncertain .
Acknowledging the risk --" The jury 's out , " he says -- Wagoner nonetheless expresses confidence because he believes there is " inherent goodness " in GM 's products that the market will begin to recognize .
But he also knows that every car manufacturer has a provincial view of its own prospects : " We 're all guilty , " he says .
" We go through our design studio and go , ' Wow , we 've got great products .
They 're so much better than what we had .
This is going to turn things . '
What you forget is that the same discussion is going on in every design studio around the world . "
That does n't necessarily make you wrong in your expectations , he says .
But in the end , it 's " a bet . "
And you do n't know -- ca n't know -- whether this time it 's going to bring in the revenue .
That 's a sweat - out matter for GM in 2006 .
As the year begins , the world is also focused on the company 's " liquidity " - - its store of ready assets that would allow it to withstand further operating blows , should they materialize .
On the balance sheet of its auto business at year - end , GM had $ 20.5 billion in liquid assets , made up of cash , marketable securities , and short - term assets in a VEBA - - a " voluntary employees beneficiary association " that holds money dedicated to the payment of health costs .
GM calls this amount of liquidity " strong . "
But this is a company whose auto operations had a negative cash flow last year of nearly $ 6 billion .
Suppose that repeats this year ?
Or suppose -- Wagoner himself volunteers this -- that the price of gas goes to $ 3 a gallon ?
Or that industry sales of autos drop by , say , 5 % , or there 's an outright recession ?
Besides , GM can't possibly spend itself down to its last dollar .
Jerry
York figures that GM needs at least $ 5 billion at any given moment just to operate , and others say the amount might be $ 10 billion .
Success by GM in selling just over half of its finance subsidiary , GMAC , would help GM 's liquidity -- though that really was n't the impetus for putting it on the market .
Here are GMAC 's finer qualities :
It is a well - run company ; a good earner , with profits of $ 2.83 billion in 2005 ( before a goodwill write - off of $ 440 million ) on about $ 22 billion in book value ; and a dutiful corporate child that paid $ 2.5 billion in 2005 dividends to its parent .
So why would GM be unloading this treasure ?
Because GMAC 's raw material is money , and -- thanks to its scruffy parent -- it is losing access to its raw material .
The issue here is that GMAC 's credit ratings are linked to GM's and therefore have been repeatedly lowered .
That means GMAC is no longer welcome -- as it devoutly wishes to be -- in the commercial - paper market , which is in effect a deep - pocketed bank with good interest rates .
So GMAC has been funding itself more expensively , by selling off its loans or borrowing against them .
A sale of , say , 51 % of GMAC to a financially strong buyer would presumably raise its ratings and put it right back in the commercial - paper market .
As to what the sale might deliver to GM , that 's a mystery .
A deal has dragged , partly because prospective buyers are leery of the financial consequences should they make a purchase and then see their co-owner , GM , go bankrupt .
There 's also a downbeat qualification about the money that GM might get :
The company carries out intracompany transactions with GMAC that ordinarily leave GM a net debtor .
It is very likely that any buyer of GMAC , not wanting to be owed by GM , would insist that those debts be paid off as part of any transaction .
That would reduce GM 's take .
Moody's has said unequivocally that " the sale proceeds are critical to GM maintaining adequate liquidity . "
Standard & Poor 's wants this deal done too .
But it questions just how much GM would benefit .
Said S&P's Robert Schulz in January : " GM will be giving up half of an asset that 's provided a lot of earnings .
At the end of the day , it 's hard for us to get excited about that . "
Another boost to GM 's liquidity could be gained by the company 's embracing what Jerry York has labeled " equality of sacrifice " -- that is , compensation cuts for most of its non-union constituencies .
Such moves , for example , might cut the pay of GM 's directors , who include such corporate folk as lead director George Fisher , retired CEO of Kodak , and Stanley O'Neal , CEO of Merrill Lynch .
Base pay for a board member annually is $ 200,000 , though each must put $ 140,000 of that into GM stock -- an investment plan that has n't worked out too well lately .
Among the people escaping the entire GM flameout , it should be noted , is A.G. Lafley , CEO of Procter & Gamble , who exited as a director last spring .
Given that a GM bankruptcy would no doubt put egg on the face of every board member , Lafley 's departure possibly qualifies as Shrewdest Move by a Director in 2005 .
York also wants GM 's executives to cut their pay .
Around headquarters in Detroit , there is muttering about this , since it would be a second blow :
No bonuses were paid for 2005 .
In addition , the executives at the very top have definitely bled with the stock , because they are required by the board to hold multiples of their base salary in GM shares .
The requirement for Wagoner works off his 2004 base salary , $ 2.2 million , and stipulates that he should own seven times that amount in stock , which is $ 15.4 million .
Wagoner may have met that goal at one time ; a precise answer about that has disappeared into proxy - statement fog .
He for sure was still an optimist in March 2005 , when he paid $ 1.5 million to buy 50,000 GM shares at about $ 30 .
Today , though , with the stock down closer to $ 20 , he is way shy of the $ 15.4 million target .
What York sees as truly essential is a 50 % cut in the dividend -- pain for every shareholder , including himself and Kerkorian .
Such a move may be symbolically important .
It is not , though , an economic panacea .
The dividend is only $ 1.1 billion annually - - against a GM market value , in early February , of about $ 13 billion .
Totally eliminating the dividend would , for example , not even cover one - fifth of GM 's annual spending for health care ( about $ 5.7 billion last year ) .
There is another , quite unintuitive , point to be made about the dividend :
With bankruptcy certainly a possibility , you could make a case that GM 's directors might be doing their dead - level best for the shareholders by continuing to pay the dividend .
That is , in a bankruptcy the shareholders are apt to reap nothing ; for now , the dividend is something .
A corollary to that thought is that any unsecured creditor of GM's who thinks bankruptcy will come should logically be protesting every penny paid to the shareholders , since any outflow of cash is money the bankruptcy estate wo n't be getting .
For GM , the problem of whether to cut the dividend is huge -- in scale , way beyond the $ 1.1 billion .
Were a reduction to be made , there would surely be national , and even global , headlines .
That would agitate buyers who are already nervous about GM 's viability -- who worry , for example , about the company 's ability to make good on its warranties .
That 's an unnecessary worry , but it still exists .
It is probably not an overstatement to say that cutting the dividend would be a public relations disaster .
On the other hand , not cutting the dividend gives the finger to the UAW , which has already agreed to a " giveback " of health - care benefits and from which GM needs many more concessions .
" Why , " the UAW is asking , " are we making sacrifices when the shareholders are n't ? "
The GM board was scheduled to meet shortly after this issue went to press , and the betting here is that the dividend will be cut .
That 's because in these intense times , and in anticipation of a contract up for renewal in September 2007 , GM desperately needs decent relations with the UAW .
Keeping peace with the union right now almost has to outweigh a public relations problem .
The truth is that GM is essentially indentured to the UAW because of the union 's power to strike .
To that sign of bondage , add another : GM 's hourly and salaried employees , present and past , essentially own this company , a fact we will prove by describing some bank accounts .
At the end of 2004 , the latest date for which figures are available , GM 's pension funds ( both inside the U.S. and out ) had $ 100 billion in assets -- which is wealth belonging to GM 's employees , retirees , and dependents .
To that you can add $ 19 billion that GM has put in a dedicated account for retiree health benefits .
That makes $ 119 billion that GM has banked for its employees .
In contrast , the shareholders of GM recently owned their grubby $ 13 billion in market value .
That is a bizarre , Alice - in - Autoland result from 98 years in which capitalism supposedly reigned .
The union 's leverage over GM affects everything that the company tries to do in cost cutting .
The burning example is retiree health benefits , surely a competitive cost disadvantage if there ever was one .
At various Berkshire Hathaway meetings , chairman Warren Buffett has envisioned what GM would do if it had contracted many years ago to buy steel at a premium price and had arrived at 2005 needing to get that cost back in line .
" It would simply get out of the contract , " Buffett has said .
GM 's retiree health benefits , arrayed against the benefits that the Japanese companies do n't provide , are like paying extra for steel .
But the odds against GM 's breaking this contract are monumental .
That 's proved by the halting course of events since early last summer , when Wagoner let it be known that GM proposed to unilaterally change its health plan for retirees so as to cut $ 20 billion off its liabilities .
Legally GM may have been within its rights to do this ; at least , that 's what some court precedents say .
The UAW , though , predictably protested , claiming that the benefits were vested and citing precedents of its own .
To have sorted out this argument in court would have taken years that GM did n't have .
So a compromise was reached : The UAW would hire Lazard to come into GM ( at GM 's expense ) to determine just how bad its financial condition was .
Lazard , whose work was led by Jim Millstein , head of its restructuring team , sent in about 20 people and took months to do its work .
GM was n't given Lazard 's report to read .
But one executive thinks he has a good idea what it said .
He is Steve Girsky , who until last summer was an all - star auto analyst at Morgan Stanley ( where he ridiculed GM's incentive programs ) , and who then made a high - wire leap into working for GM as Wagoner 's roving aide - de-camp .
Says Girsky : " Usually the union 's perception is that management is making things look worse than they are .
This time , when Lazard came back to the union , I think it may have said , ' Management is not exaggerating ; in fact , things may be worse than it thinks . ' "
So the union did a " giveback , " agreeing after some deadline - packed weeks to an intricate change in the retiree health benefits that will hurt the retirees moderately but also require the actives ( who ratified the deal ) to chip in by giving up some cost - of - living raises they were due .
GM gets relief of only about $ 15 billion in its liabilities , not $ 20 billion .
And its expected cash savings of about $ 1 billion a year will arrive only slowly .
A further stickiness is that the agreement is not yet final .
Its fairness must be okayed by a judge , who at a hearing scheduled for March can expect to be asked by at least some retirees why in tarnation they did n't have a say in all this .
Beyond any savings that the new plan ultimately delivers , it provides GM with a psychological lift :
A union that detests deadlines and mid-contract negotiations stepped up when pressured and gave something back .
Does n't GM 's success here suggest that it could perhaps erase its whole retiree health problem by driving ahead with unilateral actions and dragging the union along ?
No , says Girsky , absolutely not : " If you have to push to that extreme , you 'll be building cars with three wheels .
At the end of the day , these guys you 're dealing with are the ones who build your products . "
Wagoner is impatient with people who want GM to blast ahead on the union front , pushing hard to gain cost savings .
" Excuse me , " he says he asks them , " were you around in ' 93 , ' 94 , ' 95 , ' 96 , ' 97 , and ' 98 when we took 16 strikes ? "
( It sounds as if he might know the exact dates of those strikes as well as he knows the birthdays of his three sons . )
He quotes the critics further : " Well , you dolts , do n't you know how to deal with the union so it does n't go out on strike ? "
And Wagoner grits his teeth and answers , " Gee , I thought the assignment was to get competitive . "
His bottom line about union negotiations : " There 's an art to this thing . "
Right now , he and GM are working their art at auto - parts maker Delphi ( No. 63 on the last FORTUNE 500 list ) , in whose arcane crisis GM is inextricably -- and dangerously - - entangled .
The distilled story here is that GM split off Delphi in 1999 , retaining an incestuous relationship with it and sticking it with GM - sized wages and benefits that exceed those paid by Delphi 's competitors .
Delphi ultimately floundered under this weight and hired have - gun - will - travel Robert S. " Steve " Miller as CEO .
Out of bullets , Miller put the company into bankruptcy last October and quickly started talking about ways to exit with competitive costs .
He then called on the UAW to accept lower wages -- for example , he wanted to cut pay for skilled workers by 54 % , from $ 27 an hour to $ 12.50 .
( These figures do not include benefits . )
Later he took that proposal off the table .
But the UAW had by then become so infuriated with both the man and the plan that it refused to negotiate with him .
GM , though , was always in this picture , because it and Delphi are virtually joined at the hip .
The separation agreement back in 1999 included deals between GM and the union that made GM contingently liable for post - retirement benefits ( mainly pensions and health ) owed to certain employees if Delphi ever failed to provide them .
With Delphi now in the soup , GM is on the hook -- though for how many dollars is uncertain , because other Delphi / GM transactions figure in too .
At the latest oracular word on Delphi , GM was estimating a total cost between $ 3.6 billion ( an amount indeed taken as a special pretax charge in 2005 ) and $ 12 billion , with the most probable figure toward the low end of that range .
Whatever the cost , most of the need for cash will hit GM slowly , because it will be liable for the retirement benefits only as they come due .
In the meantime , the bankruptcy court has told Delphi , GM , and the union to come up with a plan by August for getting Delphi out of bankruptcy .
" This is three - hand poker , " says Wagoner with a small grin , and the stakes for these struggling parties are way beyond Vegas .
Delphi wants to emerge fit for competition ; GM wants to hold its bailout costs to a minimum and also extract better prices from Delphi ; and the union wants the highest pay possible .
Talking about the cardholders at this table , Steve Miller allows that he , Wagoner , and the president of the UAW , Ron Gettelfinger , have the three toughest jobs in Detroit .
His listener waits for the kicker , and it 's surprising .
" The job that 's the toughest , " Miller says , " is Gettelfinger 's , because he has to get elected . "
That 's technically true -- there 's an election this June - - but UAW incumbents seldom lose .
Nevertheless , the whole Delphi affair has so angered the UAW that it could at some point haul off and order a strike .
That is a true peril for GM .
It can not stand a strike .
GM is hugely dependent on Delphi parts , buying well over $ 10 billion of them a year .
Were there a strike of any duration , GM would not be able to move fast enough to line up alternative sources of supply .
A strike would be a killer , enough to push it over the bankruptcy cliff .
That would not be good for the union , whose members would be threatened with cuts in wages , pensions , and above all , health benefits .
But unions have called strikes before that did n't make sense , and it could happen again .
There are people who assert that GM should just get the suspense over and file for bankruptcy , thereby paring its liabilities to a manageable size and meanwhile continuing to sell its products .
When he is asked about this scenario , Bruce Clark , a senior vice president of Moody 's and its lead automobile analyst , turns very serious .
" Bankruptcy would have significant costs , which any company would want to weigh , " he warns .
This is not the airlines , he says , where the dollar risk is a plane ticket , worth maybe a few hundred .
With car companies , in sharp contrast , you have big - ticket items , $ 20,000 and more .
" And you have buyers , " says Clark , " to whom the warranty period is very important and who have a general expectation that service will be available . "
In other words , a buyer just might avoid any company in bankruptcy .
And avoidance is hardly what GM needs ; it 's already had enough of that .
There is the big question , naturally , of whether some sort of extraordinary intervention might save GM from bankruptcy .
Should it care to make the effort , the UAW would have the means : massive givebacks .
Does that sound likely ?
No .
Then there 's the U.S. government , whose bailout ability has been proved often .
Clearly Washington could at some point decide that a GM bankruptcy was a nightmare it could n't face and could step in with a massive infusion of money that would buy the company time -- to shrink back , perhaps , to a viable size .
Beyond that , what is Washington to do ?
Urge its citizens to pick up a Malibu with their tax refund ?
Pass national health insurance with the snap of a finger ?
Certainly it wo n't be President Bush pushing the GM cause .
He gave American auto companies the back of his hand in January , telling the Wall Street Journal that they needed to both deal with their costs and come up with " relevant " products .
That no doubt mainly referred to hybrids , to which GM is a Johnny - come - lately .
There 's an implied message in what Bush said --" W to GM : Drop Dead . "
Which it probably will .
There 's a note to be added about our old friend " urgency . "
It turns out that GM has a program , mentioned in last year 's proxy statement and still extant , through which it will match up to $ 5,000 given by any of its 140,000 U.S. employees ( and its directors as well ) to a college or university .
Matching - gift plans , especially big , splendid ones such as that , are admiringly welcomed by many people in the U.S.
But when you are a company running on empty -- and GM is -- does not the continued existence of that program say that somebody never exactly caught on to what a sense of urgency is all about ?
That raises a point made by a fellow - - you will see why he does n't want his name mentioned -- in the GM dealer organization : " I ca n't really believe , " he says , " that the people who got GM into this mess are going to be the people who can get GM out . "

No school , no books , no teacher 's dirty looks By Traci Tamura and Thelma Gutierrez
CNN
" Unschooled " Nailah Ellis , 10 , plays piano at home in Marietta , Georgia , while her mother Barbara watches .
YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Family John Holt or or Create Your Own ( CNN ) --
It 's a child 's dream .
Wake up whenever you want , with nobody telling you what to do and when to do it .
And here 's the kicker :
No school to rush off to .
Welcome to the world of " unschooling " -- an educational movement where kids , not parents , not teachers , decide what they will learn that day .
" I do n't want to sound pompous , but I think I am learning a little bit more , because I can just do everything at my own pace , " said Nailah Ellis , a 10 - year - old from Marietta , Georgia , who has been unschooled for most of her life .
Nailah 's day starts about 11 a.m. , her typical wake - up time .
She studies Chinese , reading , writing , piano and martial arts .
But there 's no set schedule .
She works on what she wants , when she wants .
She 'll even watch some TV -- science documentaries are a favorite -- until her day comes to an end about 2 a.m .
An extension of home - schooling , " unschooling " is when parents give their children total freedom to learn and explore whatever they choose .
According to Holt Associates , an " unschooling " advocacy group , in 2005 , about 150,000 children were unschooled , about 10 percent of the estimated 1.5 million home - schooled children in the United States .
The term " unschooling " was first coined in 1977 by John Holt , an education reformer , the founder of Holt Associates and author of the book , " Teach Your Own . "
Holt felt traditional home - schooling did n't go far enough .
He believed parents should not duplicate schools in their homes .
He favored an education more freewheeling in nature , one that depends on the child for direction .
The expectation is that along the way they will get an education .
There are no mandatory books , no curriculum , no tests and no grades .
Nailah 's parents are in touch with the local school district and she takes the district 's required tests .
While " unschooling " could be characterized as the ultimate indulgence by a parent , Nailah 's stay - at - home mother , Barbara Ellis , does n't see it that way .
" When you get to travel around , that 's education to me .
That 's learning .
You 're doing it firsthand .
You 're not reading it from a book .
You are not hearing it from a teacher , " Ellis said .
But proponents of the public education system suggest these children may be missing a key part of the educational experience .
" There is nothing like the texture of kids having contact with each other , making friends and relating to different adults in a school setting , " said David Tokofsky , a longtime educator and member of the Los Angeles Unified School District Board of Education .
Nailah , who would be in 4th grade if she attended a regular school , seems to enjoy the " unschooled " lifestyle , even if she 's a bit confused when asked what exactly she is learning .
" I actually do n't know what I 'm learning , " Nailah said .
" I think I 'm just having a good time . "

In the quiet waters off the coast of Vietnam lies an area known as Bach Ho , or White Tiger Field .
There , and in the nearby Black Bear and Black Lion fields , exploration companies are drilling more than a mile into solid granite -- so - called basement rock - - for oil .
That 's a puzzle :
Oil is n't supposed to be found in basement rock , which never rose near the surface of the earth where ancient plants grew and dinosaurs walked .
Yet oil is there .
Last year the White Tiger Field and nearby areas produced 338,000 barrels per day , and they are estimated to hold about 600 million barrels more .
Bach Ho ( White Tiger ) , Vietnam 's largest oilfield , produces almost 280,000 barrels of oil per day from granitoid basement .
Recently , a basement - reservoir play extension in the nearby Su Tu or " lion " fields generated wide industry interest .
The Su Tu Den ( Black Lion ) field currently produces about 80,000 barrels per day , but PetroVietnam expects to increase output to 200,000 barrels per day within three years .
Wallace G. Dow , an AAPG member and consultant in The Woodlands , Texas , calls the Cuu Long oil " paraffinic , classic lacustrine crude " expelled into fractured basement from lower source rock .
" The oils in the basement are virtually identical to the oils in the sandstone sitting around the basement , " Dow said .
" This is the key -- they migrate updip through faults into the basement , in horst blocks , " he said .
Dow emphasized that the oil 's components indicate a lacustrine organic facies with lipid - rich , land - plant debris and fresh - water algal material , refuting theories of abiogenic origin in this area .
During the CNBC interview , Smith claimed that Vietnam 's White Tiger and Black Lion fields proved that abiotic oil was a reality and used this argument to support his general claim that worldwide oil depletion is a fiction .
More information is available at EIA 's Vietnam Analysis Country Brief .
These kinds of claims have been around for the last few years .
Back in 2003 , Julie Creswell wrote Oil Without End ( orignally from Fortune Magazine 02/15/03 ) and reportedSo , the " mystery " here is that oil is being extracted from porous granite basement rock which has presumably always been deeply buried , not sedimentary ( source ) rock that was formed by the burial , heating , chemical transformation and compaction of organic matter .
Looking further , I consulted an article from the American Association of Petroleum Geologist 's ( AAPG ) Explorer series entitled Vietnam Finds Oil in the Basement to find out what was really going on here .
First , these offshore fields are producing .
But most importantly , what it the geological context ?
The bottom line is that the fractured basement granite containing the oil has been lifted up due to rifting and is now underlain by sandstone source rock .
This is the source of the oil , which has migrated up into the basement granite .
These fields areat all .
For a rebuttal of abiotic oil , read Richard Heinberg 's The " Abiotic Oil " Controversy
What is disturbing is that these abiotic oil arguments are presented in the mainstream media ( MSM , here CNBC ) without any critical analysis .
In the short interview format TV allows , Simmons was unable ( or unwilling ) rebut Smith 's claim .
Many fantastic and unbelievable claims are being put forward now as people scramble around to dispute oil depletion -- abiotic oil is one of these .
It is perhaps the most insidious of these false claims with its implicit promise that , to paraphrase Duffeyes , everything is OK because " God [ the deep hot biosphere ] will put more oil in the ground " .

This “ Financial Times article ” : https://registration.ft.com/registration/barrier?referer=&location=http%3A//news.ft.com/cms/s/df63c89c-89fb-11da-86d1-0000779e2340.html ( sub required ) has a quote from an email written by Michael Scanlon , former bagman for Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff , which sums up the modern Republican party in two sentences .
bq. Michael Scanlon … explained the strategy in an e-mail to a tribal client .
“ Simply put , we want to bring out the wackos to vote against something and make sure the rest of the public lets the whole thing slip past them , ” he wrote .
“ The wackos get their information [ from ] the Christian right , Christian radio , e-mail , the internet and telephone trees . ”
Fundamentalist wackos , stirred up by cynical political operators in it for the money .
Not a pretty picture .
I got to spend some time with Eric , Larry , and a dozen other journalists yesterday after the amazing keynote .
The story everyone wanted to talk about–and Eric and Larry did n’t –was Google going into the operating system , deskop computer , and office suite business ( let ’s call those three things “ Google Desktop ” for simplicity ) .
Eric kept saying the Google vision is to index the worlds information , but we all know that is a smoke screen .
Google ’s business is to make money from targeted advertising ( i.e. AdSense ) .
Let ’s look at the facts :
1. 99.9 % of Google revenue comes from Adsense .
2. Google search is not necessarily the most efficient carrier of Google Adsense ( content based websites and applications are very good at carrying Adsense as well )
3 . Google is doing projects like Google Pack , GTalk , Orkut , and GMail that have NOTHING to do with indexing the worlds data–these projects are all carriers for Adsense .
4 . Google has built the largest grid computing networking in the world with hundreds of thousands of computers –extending this to a desktop OS would be a cake walk .
5. Google has hired folks who worked on Open Office .
6. GMail ’s WYSIWYG is 90 % of Microsoft Word .
Everyone and their brother is making web - based word processors and spreadsheets today .
7. Google is about to launch a calendar according to reports .
That ’s a no brainer since they have contacts and email already .
7a . Email , contacts , and calendar=Outlook .
Outlook =Microsoft Office .
Office=Microsoft ’s main revenue stream .
8 . Most folks are fine with web - based applications now .
AJAX has made web - based email competitive with desktop email–case is closed on that issue .
9 . Google ’s server network is the only one in existence that could handle a hosted office suite–GMAIL has proven that .
10 .
Google is getting involved in the light $ 100 laptop project–which is really close to the Google Desktop concept .
11 . Bill Gates himself said that there will be a huge market for advertising - based software , and Microsoft is making a web - based version of Office a major priority .
12 . Tech CEOs lie through their teeth all the time–they have to .
Steve Jobs said that he would never make a video iPod for two years –then he did .
I would task Eric ’s comments that they are not interested in making a desktop OS , Office Suite , etc. with a grain of salt .
If they were interested –and i know they are –they would never tip their cards .
Now , I do n’t think Google will make a PC .
I think Google will :
a. launch calendar and office suite in the next six months .
b. by the end of the year they will come out with a Linux - based OS and offer it for free to PC makers .
Those PC makers will love Google for giving them a free OS and Google will love extending the reach of their money maker : google Adsense .
The big win : Google can offer PC makers something they have never had : reoccurring revenue .
Not only can Google give a free OS and office suite , they could offer them 10 % of the Google Adsense revenue of that computer / user–FOR LIFE !
Can you imagine if Dell or Compaq could not only sell a computer for $ 500 with $ 50 in profit , but also make another $ 25 - 50 a year in Adsense revenue ?
The person keeps the computer for another two years and Dell makes more from the Adsense than the computer .
The Google Desktop is the greatest growth opportunity for Google right now , and Google needs to find growth if they are going to live up to their valuation .
For those reasons I think this is a done deal .
Thoughts ?
Epilogue : Almost eight years ago Bill Gross pitched me on this idea and started a company called FreePC .
Your PC came with a banner fixed to the bottom of the screen .
Bill Gross also created Overture –the original version of Google Adsense .
When Google launches their free PC or free OS / office suite they will have taken two of Bill Gross ’ ideas to the bank .
Somewhere Bill Gross is feeling pretty darn good about himself ( I always thought the guy was brilliant ) .
i.e .
i.e .
And any sign that says we 're going to leave before the job is done simply emboldens terrorists and creates a certain amount of doubt for people so they wo n't take the risk necessary to help a civil society evolve in the country .
This is a campaign -- I 'm sure they 're watching the campaign carefully .
There are a lot of good , decent people saying , get out now ; vote for me , I will do everything I can to , I guess , cut off money is what they 'll try to do to get our troops out .
It 's a big mistake .
It would be wrong , in my judgment , for us to leave before the mission is complete in Iraq .
The most material points of difference are these : -- First .
The President will have only the occasional command of such part of the militia of the nation as by legislative provision may be called into the actual service of the Union .
The king of Great Britain and the governor of New York have at all times the entire command of all the militia within their several jurisdictions .
In this article , therefore , the power of the President would be inferior to that of either the monarch or the governor .
Second .
The President is to be commander - in - chief of the army and navy of the United States .
In this respect his authority would be nominally the same with that of the king of Great Britain , but in substance much inferior to it .
It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces , as first General and admiral of the Confederacy ; while that of the British king extends to the declaring of war and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies -- all which , by the Constitution under consideration , would appertain to the legislature .
i.e .
It is too true , however disgraceful it may be to human nature , that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it ; nay , absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it , but for the purposes and objects merely personal , such as thirst for military glory , revenge for personal affronts , ambition , or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans .
These and a variety of other motives , which affect only the mind of the sovereign , often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people .
A somewhat overlooked part of President Bush 's Press Conference this week was his comments strongly suggesting that he believes only he -- and not the Congress -- has the power to decide when the war in Iraq ends , as well as whether we will begin a new war with Iran .
All of the debates we are having about what to do about Iran and Iraq are meaningless if the President believes ( as he seems to ) that all power to decide these matters rests with him .
As Atrios noted the other day , the administration 's intentions regarding a war with Iran are unclear .
The most likely reason that it 's unclear is because the administration is still undecided about whether to start that war , most likely because the more extremist warmongers in the administration have yet to convince those who need to be convinced of the war 's necessity ( at least its pre-November necessity ) .
No reasonable person can doubt that political considerations will play a significant role in all of this .
Will forcing a mere debate over military action against Iran be enough for Karl Rove to create the warrior - appeaser dichotomy which is all he knows , or will more be required , , an all - out military conflict in order to generate war - based support for the President and his party ?
But whatever the administration 's plans are , there is , as I have written about before , a very real question as to whether the administration believes it can attack Iran on its own , , without the approval of the American people through the Congress .
The theories of executive power embraced by the administration leave little doubt that they believe , at least in theory , that decisions about whether to go to war against Iran , or to end the war in Iraq , are for the President alone to make , and that Congressional authorization is unecessary to attack Iran , and for the same reason , Congress cannot end the war in Iraq .
When speaking about Iraq at his Press Conference this week , the President seemed to make rather clear that he believes Congress has no role to play in decisions concerning when wars begin and end : That is very deliberate wording ; he went out of his way to point out that the only thing Congress could do to " try " to compel a withdrawal of troops is to cut off funding .
The President clearly has been involved in discussions where it was told to him that he does not need Congressional authorization to fight wars and that Congress cannot force him to end a war by voting , for instance , to revoke the 2002 Authorization to Use Military Force in Iraq .
Clearly , the President believes he can stay in Iraq even if such authorization is revoked .
That the President believes Congress is powerless with regard to war matters seems independently clear from the President 's emphatic declaration that " . "
Senators have introduced and debated legislation to compel troop withdrawals from Iraq , but the President quite clearly believes that such debates are meaningless because only he -- not the American people 's representatives -- decides if and when troops are to be withdrawn from Iraq .
The significance of these views for the Iran situation is obvious .
It seems quite clear that the President believes he has the power to begin a war with Iran without Congressional approval , or even in the face of Congressional opposition to such a war .
That view is plainly contrary to core principles of our system of government .
In Federalist 69 , Hamilton sought to assuage fears that creating a President would lead to monarchical rule , and to do so , he contrasted the " inferior " powers of the President with those of the British King , particularly in the area of war - making ( last emphasis added ) : How much clearer could that be ?
The President does not have the power to simply deploy armies at will .
He merely commands armies which Congress deploys into battle .
Congress decides when and if wars will be fought ; the President merely decides as the " first General " how they will be fought .
As John Jay explained in Federalist 4 , requiring that the American people approve of wars ( through their Congress ) is essential for avoiding unnecessary wars , because Presidents will start wars that are unnecessary , for their own benefit , if they can do so without the authorization of Congress : That is why it was critical to the Founders that wars not be waged unless those wars have the support of the people through the Congress .
The Founders recognized the danger of vesting power to start wars with the President -- a power which President Bush clearly believes he has .
As Jay made clear , allowing Presidents the power to decide when wars begin and end would ensure that America wages wars in order to aggrandize the personal interests of the President rather than to serve the national interest .
It 's nice that so many people seem interested in debating whether military confrontation with Iran is prudent and / or whether we should withdraw from Iraq , but there is a real question as to whether the President thinks the outcome of those debates matters .
Indeed , he has made clear that he believes only he can decide when wars begin and end .
Finding out from the administration whether they believe they can wage war on Iran without Congressional approval , and / or whether Congress has the power to compel the end of the war in Iraq , is something that probably ought to be a high priority for our nation 's journalists .
The American people should know whether the President believes they have any role in deciding matters of war and peace .
“ It certainly sounded like Microsoft leadership committed to us , our customers , our partners , and our shareholders that Vista would be out in 2006 , ” Mini-Microsoft , a blog from a Microsoft insider , vents .
“ Slip ! ”
“ We should have asked for more details around the ‘ or else ’ part of that commitment , ” Mini-Microsoft writes .
“ I was upset at missing the back - to - school market .
Now we ’re missing the holiday sales market .
All of those laptops and PCs are going to have XP on it .
What percentage will upgrade to Vista ?
Well , I guess that ’s the little dream that I need to give up on .
Vista ’s deployment is going to come from people buying CPUs with the OS pre-installed , not dancing down the CompUSA aisle as they clutch that boxed version of Vista to their loving chest .
So not only did we miss last year ’s opportunity , we ’re missing this year ’s opportunity , too .
With the convergence of high - tech media , this holiday season would have been an explosive nodal point to get Vista out for a compounded effect . ”
Mini-Microsoft writes , “ People need to be fired and moved out of Microsoft today .
Where ’s the freakin ’ accountability ? ”
Some of our favorite comments to the article over on Mini-Microsoft , many of them presumably from Microsoft employees , include :
• Fer cripes sake , just get a Mac already .
• Being a 10 + year [ Microsoft ] vet I feel ashamed and sad .
This company is a mess on so many levels .
• Here ’s the way out : MS should swallow real hard , ante up half of what they blew on Longwind , and buy an OS X license from Apple .
That would be about $ 10B up - front , and a hefty royalty .
MS would have to assume the burden of making it run on all the crapbox PCs out there , which have had all the quality squeezed out of them , due to MS ’s having sucked up the lion ’s share of the profit from all PCs for the last 20 years or so .
The benefit is that MS could finally ship a securable OS , and the users would n’t have to lose countless hours trying to work around the malware .
Meanwhile , the only semi-competent part of the company , the Mac Business Unit , would take the lead in Apps development .
• Vista is a disaster .
The “ reset ” you mention is nothing less than a FAILURE to SHIP .
What you ’re working on now is n’t Longhorn , it ’s SP4 .
Do n’t kid yourself .
If you want to salvage your career , flee to Office , or better yet , get the heck out of the company before it all collapses .
• Ballmer is incompetent .
The interview mentioned previously is terrible .
Ballmer has presided over the fall of Microsoft .
He sucks .
When are internal folks going to stop falling for this mythological aristocracy ?
He and Bill are just weak men who are n’t in control .
• Compare this to OS X , where people fall all over themselves trying to get the newest version running on their old hardware because there ’s actual value in the new features .
So Vista has its guts ripped out , slips , and we wait another 5 years for a potentially insipring version of Windows , meanwhile Apple ships another 3 updates to OS X .
• God , we look like DEC more and more every day .
• I took part in a computer trade show early this month in Germany , and Microsoft was showing Vista , and the Microsoft fans were saying it looks like OS X ( Apple was n’t there ) .
Apple is on a roll , and we ’ve just given them enough time to get the next version of OS X out the door ( whatever animal name it is going to be ) .
And we can guess right now what their marketing push will be : Stop waiting for those guys who ca n’t even copy our old stuff in time .
Get the original from us — we ship on time , we ’re shipping right now .
• I wonder how many employees at PC hardware companies are wishing they had some way to call up Apple and license OS X for Intel .
They could have 10.4 “ Tiger ” on PC hardware in a matter of weeks .
• What ’s the difference between Mac OS X and Vista ?
Microsoft employees are excited about Mac OS X .

マトリクスをつかって、物事を整理することは良くやると思うが、それを発展させるときには、マトリクスをかけ合わせると発想を得られやすくなる。
IDEA HACKS !
」を読んでいたら、そんな話と共にSWOT分析での例が載っていた。私もマトリクスを使うときにはよくやるHackなのでご紹介。SWOT分析は、「強み 」、「弱み 」、「機会 」 、「脅威」という切り口で、状況を整理していく手法なのだが、ここから得られるのは、整理されてはいるが事実の列挙だけである。それだけでは意味が無いので、整理された情報を見ながら考えていくことになるのだが、思いついたことを書く場所を用意することで、漠然とではなく、考える手順に組み込んでしまおうという話である。どうするのかというと、2×2のマトリクスなら、3×3に広げてそれぞれの切り口をかけ合わせる場所を用意するだけだ。普通にSWOTで整理した後、こう広げると、かけ合わせる場所ができる。そうすると、そこに列挙されている情報がクロスされて、発想を刺激してくれる。以前このブログでも、アイデアは組み合わせから生まれるという話に触れたことがあるが、ここでもその法則が生きている。また、3×3のマトリクスの真ん中に、考えたいことを書き、その周辺の空いているマスに発想されることを埋めていくマンダラートという思考ツールがあるが、これは空いているマスが発想を刺激してくれる仕組みだそうだ。マトリクスを広げるやり方は、この仕組みに通じる部分もあるので、マンダラートと同じ効果も期待できるかもしれない。ここでは、例としてSWOT分析をあげているが、マトリクスを使って情報をまとめたとき全般に使えるHackである。物事の整理によく使われるマトリクスだが、使い方しだいで発想するツールとしても役立てることができる。原尻 淳一 小山 龍介SWOT 分析の話以外にも色々役立つHackが盛りだくさん。フランス・ヨハンソン

MILTON FRIEDMAN won the John Bates Clark Medal , awarded to an outstanding American economist under the age of 40 , in 1951 .
Many consider it harder to win than a Nobel Prize .
One of the measures of his greatness is that when he got it , he still had not done any of the work for which he would become most famous .
Still to come were the permanent - income hypothesis , his groundbreaking “ A Monetary History of the United States ” ( co- written with Anna Schwartz ) and the proposal of a natural rate of unemployment .
These works revolutionised the conduct of central banks around the world .
But to non-economists
Mr Friedman 's great achievement is not his challenge to Keynesian demand management but the popular writings that challenged a consensus favouring ever - greater state intervention in the economy .
This work , too , came long after his peers had recognised him as a leading light .
At the time of his death on Thursday November 16th , the 94 - year - old economist was still working to spread his ideas about free markets , this time through a documentary for American public television .
It is another mark of his greatness that so many of the ideas that seemed crazy when he came up with them — from blaming the Depression on bad central - bank policy , to school vouchers and the volunteer army — have gained mainstream acceptance .
But Mr Friedman always recognised that his success was fragile ; free markets and stable money have lots of enemies , particularly among politicians .
He has left us a staggering legacy of economic theory and public - policy prescriptions — but is that inheritance growing or shrinking ?
Certainly , on the monetary side , Mr Friedman remains a giant .
His critics point out that central bankers no longer try to target the money supply directly , but to those who remember the inflationary 1970s it is perhaps more important that futile attempt to push unemployment to zero no longer trigger inflationary spirals .
In developed countries politicians may talk like Keynesians , but they behave like monetarists , looking to the central bank , rather than fiscal policy , to stave off inflation and recession .
And what of his other crusades ?
His proposal of a volunteer military force , once rejected as impractical , is now so deeply ingrained in American culture that politicians who proposed bringing back the draft for the war in Iraq were dismissed as crackpots or worse .
His quest to replace anti-poverty programmes with a “ negative income tax ” that would give cash to the working poor has come to fruition in the form of the earned - income tax credit .
This is now the favoured policy prescription on both left and right for boosting incomes at the bottom .
School vouchers , too , are making progress , albeit slowly .
And where they are not , the idea that students should be able to choose between public schools is nonetheless bringing competition to America 's educational system .
Even outside his homeland , his ideas continue to make inroads .
He was pilloried for briefly advising the Pinochet regime in Chile , where his students , “ the Chicago boys ” , ran economic policy .
Thirty years later that oppressive government is gone but his free - market reforms have made Chile the economic star of Latin America .
The World Bank and IMF continue to push for stable financial systems and market - based reforms around the world .
Proposals like the negative income tax were forerunners of the consensus growing in Europe ( and elsewhere ) that governments should provide safety nets through taxation and distribution of cash benefits rather than heavy regulation of markets .
But despite Mr Friedman 's work , thickets of regulation thrive in most countries , particularly his homeland .
Nor has he succeeded in trimming back the state , which is still growing in many places , including America .
Ironically , another legacy may be to blame : income - tax withholding , which he helped to invent during the second world war .
The fact that the tax is deducted from most peoples ' pay before it reaches their pockets is perhaps the main reason why the state has been able to grow so large .
Mr Friedman deeply regretted this contribution to economic science — but like his other inventions , it will long outlive him .
Saving Venice - Venice is Sinking into the Sea Similarly , Raising New Orleans to be back above Sea Level
I realized that the many layers of sediments which form near a river mouth contain sediments of different sizes , and they eventually form different types of sedimentary rocks .
Large particles of sediment like sand or pebbles can form into sandstone rock .
Extremely fine sediment particles such as clay are microscopic and they can form into clay and eventually shale rock .
The distinction is very important here .
Sand and sandstone are very PERMEABLE where water freely passes through .
Shale and even clay are made of sub-microscopic particles which are smaller than even water molecules and so they are IMPERMEABLE to water .
I just needed to find two stable layers of shale or clay , and to then enclose the outer edges between those layers to create a relatively sealed water tank .
I knew I only needed to send water down into that chamber at very minimal pressure , and the river water falling down the wells will easily do that .
For example , if an area of 10 miles square are intended to be raised , and the ' roof ' of the enclosed water tank is 100 feet deep , we know that about 250 billion cubic feet of soil is involved , with total weight of about 20 billion tons .
The amount of new water needed to raise this entire area up just ONE INCH in a month is about 1.2 billion gallons , over the 43,000 minutes of a month , so we only need to add about 30,000 gallons of water every minute , down a number of wells spread over that large area .
The area of the ' roof ' is 2.5 billion square feet or 350 billion square inches .
Therefore the needed new pressure in the water is just ( 20 billion tons load / 350 billion square inches area ) or around 100 PSI , all of which comes about naturally by gravity as the water falls down those wells .
So we easily create the needed PRESSURE to raise up the billions of tons of soil and city , to actually physically LIFT the entire city and region UP at the rate of ONE INCH VERTICAL EVERY MONTH .
In a five year period of this ( natural ) process , we should lift Venice and the entire region by about FIVE VERTICAL FEET , thereby totally solving Venice 's problem .
The process is NATURAL ( river water falling down wells to develop pressure ) and amazingly cheap and easy to do !
The method I propose is what is called ' metastable ' where a continuing minimal addition of river water would forever be needed , since the underground water chamber will certainly not be absolutely water - tight .
Otherwise , after the five years of hydrostatically lifting , that pressurized water would eventually seep out and let Venice sink back to where it is today .
The rate of water flow of a river affects the size of the particles which are carried along as sediments .
During a river 's long lifetime , it sometimes flows slow enough to deposit layers of clay and at other times , the flow is fast enough to deposit layers of sand .
The Grand Canyon is an excellent example of the variety of layers of sediments which the Colorado River deposited over many millions of years .
Some layers are impermeable shale / clay layers while others are very permeable sand or sandstone layers .
What I had realized was that UNDER the city of Venice were certainly many hundreds of sedimentary layers , some of which were layers of clay and others which are layers of sand .
Sedimentary layers are laid down very horizontally , and often over many miles of area .
Geologists have bored down to get samples of the various layers , so this is all known .
Let us consider an example where a layer of clay now extends from 10 feet deep to 20 feet deep .
Then several layers of sand now extend from that 20 feet depth down to 120 feet deep .
Then another layer of clay from 120 feet deep down to 130 feet deep .
Then many other layers for hundreds of feet deeper , alternating sand and clay layers .
In our example , water which happens to now be in the layer from 20 to 120 feet is somewhat TRAPPED in that layer , by the clay layers above and below it , but the water INSIDE that layer is relatively free to seep around through the permeable sand layers in it .
THIS is the secret of my concept !
That layer can act as a PRESSURIZED CHAMBER holding water .
See some photos and movies of my ( heavy ) car resting on a standard waterbed .
By simply ADDING some more water inside the waterbed , at surprisingly low pressure , a basic law of science called Pascal 's Law causes ALL of the water inside the enclosed chamber to become slightly pressurized .
The result in my demonstration was that by only adding the minimal pressure that I could provide by squirting water with my mouth , it was possible to RAISE the heavy automobile !
The similar result regarding Venice would be that a SIMPLE water well could be used to PUMP river water DOWN into that enclosed chamber between the clay layers , which can then RAISE MILLIONS OF TONS of soil and city !
The concept described here suggests a possible way that either or both cities might be actually physically raised up ( at the rate of only around an inch per month ) , such that either or both cities might eventually be high enough not to have to have survival concerns regarding being inundated by water .
In the case of Venice , by the year 2050 , if nothing is done , the old ( historic ) portion of Venice will be permanently lost under the Adriatic Sea .
In the case of New Orleans , the city 's future really depends on how well all the hundred miles of levees can withstand hurricanes and terrorist bombings .
This approach depends on three conditions :
Water is essentially incompressible ;
Venice is built on layers of sediment and sedimentary rock ;
Some of those layers are permeable to water , and at least two are impermeable .
I devised and then Engineered this system in November 2002 .
This presentation was first placed on the Internet in November 26 , 2002 .
In 2003 , I did a small demonstration to prove that this concept works .
It is based on Pascal 's Law , where any fluid creates pressure against every surface which surrounds it .
A person has internal blood pressure which is roughly 1/8 of atmospheric pressure ( 95 mmHg / 760 mmHg ) .
That can therefore drive many processes in the human body up to that pressure , which is around two pounds per square inch ( 1/8 of atmospheric ) .
So you can blow up balloons , spit water , urinate , etc .
Here are TWO AVI videos of that day .
The first is a better quality movie , but it is about 5.7 Megabytes in size .
The second is a grainier movie , but it downloads a lot faster as it is only 2.1 Megabytes in size .
The two PHOTOS are different , a before and after !
here ( 5.7 MB )
or here ( 2.1 MB )
The point of this demonstration was to show that a surprisingly small amount of pressure differential is necessary to create impressive upward force !
For example , if an increase in pressure of just 2 PSI is created underground by pumping river water down existing abandoned wells , consider the results !
A square mile is 5280 feet square , or 63,360 inches each way , or a total of over FOUR BILLION square inches !
With an increase of just 2 PSI , that would mean that over 8 billion pounds of lift would be created , or 4 million tons .
That is for a single square mile !
Just as human breath down a hose can easily raise a massive automobile more than 6 " vertically , pumping ( a LOT of ) river water down a lot of existing wells can raise an entire city such as Venice , Italy !
Even I see that as amazing , but I also had doubts about me raising up my car on a standard waterbed !
The city leaders have gotten to the point of being desperate for a solution .
In recent years , they have begun pursuing an incredibly expensive and unusual project to try to preserve their city .
The concept involves the installation of enormous movable steel " gates " under the waters of their lagoon .
The idea is that , when high tides are coming in , these gates would be raised to block off the Mediterranean from their lagoon , much like the concept of the doors of a lock of a canal .
Their application is very different from that of a lock , and massive engineering has been proceeding for some time .
By the time they expect to be able to start installing their gates , which they hopefully expect in around ten years , they will spend at least two to three billion euros .
That approach has very serious potential problems , in addition to the enormous price tag .
It still involves the city continuing to sink and the sea level rising due to global warming .
Even if they pay for and install those gates , and even if they work as the promoters claim they will , few people expect them to have useful effect beyond two or three decades .
At that point , Venice 's problems will be even more severe , assuming it still exists , because it will be virtually entirely below the average sea level .
It is a sign of how desperate the city leaders are to be seriously pursuing this extremely expensive and unproven technology .
They are extremely aware that the very existence of their city is at risk .
An Alternative Approach
During the NOVA program , there was a brief mention of a situation that occurred in the middle of the 20th century .
From around the 1930s to the 1970s , factories in the nearby Port Marghera drilled a number of wells and pumped substantial amounts of groundwater up and out from underneath the city , for their various industrial processes .
Much of that used water then ran off out into the Mediterranean Sea .
The city leaders were soon horrified to find that their city had begun sinking much faster than ever before .
When they suspected a relationship with the wells , they were ordered closed , and the sinking soon slowed to its normal rate .
During that period , the city of Venice dropped around 9 " or 22 cm .
Water is essentially incompressible , and by removing a given volume of water , that much volume of underlying supporting material no longer exists under the city .
For many locations , that might just leave air - filled caves or smaller chambers between the solid particles of material .
But Venice is built on sedimentary materials which tend to slowly flow to fill in such voids , as a response to gravity .
That is the reason why pumping water out caused an increase in the rate of the land sinking .
THIS I believe is the secret to solving Venice 's dilemma !
The technical name for the process where the land is sinking is called subsidence .
During approximately that same time period , farmers in the San Joachim Valley in California pumped enormous amounts of water for irrigation .
While that water had been deep in the sedimentary layers , it had acted to hydrostatically support the overlying layers .
Once it had been pumped out , the land level subsided .
In the case of that California Valley , so much water had been removed that the surface level dropped by around 10 meters vertically !
My suggestion is that I believe that it is possible to cause " reverse subsidence " !
I believe that Venice should immediately reactivate those industrial wells , and potentially drill more wells .
However , instead of drawing water FROM the wells , I propose to pump water , under standard pump pressure , INTO the wells .
The two important facts are that ( 1 ) water is incompressible ; and ( 2 ) all sedimentary soils and rocks necessarily have pore spaces between the grains of the materials .
It does not matter that weight has compressed the materials , the pore spaces between the grains of the material cannot be completely removed .
Yes , those pore spaces under Venice are smaller than they used to be , which is why the city has sunk .
But the majority of those pore spaces cannot be made to completely disappear , except by an extreme situation of metamorphosis into rock , which can only occur deeper than around 8,000 meters deep .
Any Geologist knows that around 40 % of the volume of nearly any sediment is actually these pore spaces .
One of the earliest things a Geophysics student learns is that a container filled with spherical ball bearings has about that much pore volume .
If any sedimentary material replaces the ball bearings , the proportion of pore space remains about the same , 40 % void space .
The particle - to - particle contact actually supports the upper layers , but the pore spaces do not disappear !
Imagine a kitchen glass filled with spherical marbles .
There is a lot of space between the marbles that can not be eliminated .
If an underground layer was only 10 meters thick , and somehow ALL the pore spaces were eliminated , the land surface would have dropped by around 4 meters !
The fact that the actual drop in recent centuries is less than 1/10 of that establishes that around 90 % of the volume of the pore spaces are still present .
They represent paths for water to again easily flow .
That is essentially why water wells can work in the first place !
The specific nature of the sediment affects how rapid and easy this flow might be .
A layer of sand has very large pore spaces , so water can flow very easily and rapidly .
If the layer is the much finer clay materials , the pore spaces still exist and still allow water flow , but the smaller pore spaces represent smaller pathways for the water to seep through .
This has the effect of allowing slower seepage flow for clay layers as compared to sand layers .
When the well was first drilled , the driller must certainly have drilled it to a depth where a permeable layer was present .
Otherwise , the well would not have worked in the first place .
That essentially ensures that all existing wells could be " reversed " .
By pumping water down into the ( existing ) wells , it will flow into those existing pore spaces .
Since the water is incompressible , it must then necessarily take up space ( volume ) .
By adding this volume of water into those pore spaces , the particles might be slightly pushed apart , and the combined volume of soil , sediments , sedimentary rock and water is therefore increased .
This necessarily requires that the land surface must rise as a direct consequence .
This is actually basic Physics , and anyone familiar with Physics can confirm this logic .
It might first seem that extremely powerful pumps would be needed .
That is not the case .
If the water was allowed to just flow down the wells ( unpumped ) the pressure in that water would rise as it went deeper .
For every 10 meters in depth , it rises naturally by around 700 Pa ( 15 PSI ) .
Therefore , even water that just drained into wells would arrive at the bottom at a pressure that was essentially the same as that existing in nearby areas .
The ( standard ) water pumps would be necessary to give that water a slight additional local pressure ( say 3 kPa ( 50 PSI ) , if that was the rating of the pump ) such that it would quickly seep outward ( due to that differential pressure ) through the sedimentary materials down there .
Again , if the layer was a clay layer , possibly a stronger pump might be needed , but no well driller would have first drilled the well into such an impermeable layer .
Therefore , standard ( economical ) water pumps could certainly be used .
There are several nearby rivers that should provide adequate supplies of freshwater .
Examination of the quantities of water removed during the mid-20th century should give a guideline to the quantity of water that would represent each inch of altitude for the overlying layers , and the city itself .
Let 's say , for argument 's sake that the entire 500 square kilometers of the land and lagoon area would be involved deep underground .
Simple calculations show that 2.5 cm ( 1 " ) thick of water for that huge area would be the equivalent to about 13 million cubic meters of water .
Therefore , if the wells collectively pumped , say , 20 million cubic meters of water down the wells ( which provides for a substantial amount of natural horizontal outward seepage ) , and since water is not compressible , there would be little alternative to the entire land surface rising around 2.5 cm ( 1 " ) in altitude !
Even a modest sized industrial pump can pump 400 liters ( about 100 gallons ) per minute , or 600 cubic meters per day , down into a well .
One thousand such pumps would therefore pump around 600,000 cubic meters of water down into the underground aquifer each day .
In a month , that is around the desired 20 million cubic meters of water .
Therefore , in just a single month , it should be very practical to raise the entire 500 square kilometer lagoon region by 2.5 cm or one inch , each month .
Additional wells and pumps , or using larger pumps , could make the effect even more rapid .
Also , if the affected area happens to be less than the full 500 square kilometers we have been considering , the local rise of the land could be substantially quicker .
However , even with just this moderate effort , in one year , the entire region could be raised by around 30 cm ( one foot ) .
At whatever point when the city leaders felt the land was high enough , pumping could be slowed , to just provide for that lateral seepage , to maintain that altitude .
It seems certain that even a rise of three to five feet in altitude should be reasonable .
Rather than spending several billion euros on the gates project , which may or may not work for a few decades , and which could only begin to have any productive effect ten years from now , I strongly recommend that Venice immediately attach pumps to all the existing wells and start pumping river water down into the wells .
If the gates project was still to proceed , both approaches could be pursued simultaneously .
Many of those pumps may already exist and only need to be reversed .
Since a number of wells were already drilled , and they may still have pumps attached , there would be virtually zero expense involved in beginning this approach .
Access to river or sea water would obviously be necessary , so some surface piping might be necessary , but the total cost is extremely low .
At the very most , a few thousand euros expense would be involved in reversing the plumbing on a single existing well pump , to confirm that large amounts of water can be pumped down the well .
Even with such a limited experiment , modern instrumentation is so advanced as to be able to measure very small fractions of an inch rise in the surface immediately around the well .
The nearby industrial companies may even be willing to absorb the expense of doing that to wells adjacent to their factories , in order to get positive press coverage of attempting to help save Venice .
In that case , the total cost to the city would be exactly zero for many of the wells !
Rather than having to wait for at least ten years before any productive effect might occur , cessation of the current sinking would occur almost immediately and reversal of it soon afterwards ( for that immediate area ) .
That would confirm the validity of this approach , in an extremely low - cost , immediate experiment .
All the experts agree that even a single inch in altitude has tremendous importance for Venice , and this proposal could certainly raise the entire city by an inch within the first month !
Again , if it was considered truly urgent to raise the city farther and faster , to better preserve the brickwork that is dissolving in the seawater , then larger pumps and additional wells could certainly be added .
It does not seem to be out of the question to raise the entire region by several feet within one year , should that be desired .
However , such a rapid raising might tend to be initially somewhat localized .
Depending on the permeability of the sub - surface layers being affected , water flow horizontally outward from a well takes some amount of time .
If extremely large quantities of water were quickly injected into a specific well , a local " bulge " would be likely to occur in the land surface in that immediate area , which would gradually spread outward .
If a very rapid rise - rate was desired , injection wells would need to be drilled in a relatively uniform pattern , such that the entire region was raised at the same rate .
Otherwise , differential stresses might be caused in buildings which could cause potential cracks to form in them .
At the suggested one - inch - per - month surface rise rate , this effect of differential rising would be unmeasurable , the buildings would be fine , and existing wells should perform excellently .
There are NO environmental difficulties associated with this approach !
Pumping freshwater down into aquifers and subsurface sedimentary layers occurs naturally anyway , but very slowly .
No bad environmental effects would occur as a result of this approach .
The easy access and convenience of Adriatic seawater might encourage consideration of injecting seawater instead .
Such an effort would add several complications .
Pumps and piping tend to corrode faster when exposed to saltwater , and pump maintenance costs would certainly be higher .
Future use of that subsurface permeable layer as a well source would be eliminated as it would have saltwater in it .
Also , salt accumulations would certainly occur within the pore spaces of the permeable layer , which would likely gradually restrict the ability of water to spread outward from the well in the permeable layer .
There is also no downside to doing water injection .
This activity would not affect or eliminate any other approaches that might otherwise be considered .
Even if the effects would be considered less than desired ( which could only occur if too large an amount of the pumped water was able to seep out without productive effect ) no other alternatives would be affected .
However , even if a large amount of seepage was found to occur , it is certain to be possible to pump even more water in and possibly under higher pump pressure , to always be able to accomplish the desired effect .
This approach can allow the entire city ( and region ) to be physically raised to a slightly higher altitude , in order to always be above sea level .

I had also been invited to make a presentation on this concept at a Scientific Conference in Pescara , Italy , in July 2004 .
Those records should still be present and available in the Proceedings of that Conference .
So it was quite peculiar to see the BBC News Reporter , a Mark Duff , in November 2005 , describing a " new plan " just presented by a " panel of engineers and geologists from the respected University of Padua " , which happens to be an inferior but nearly identical attempt at my describing plan !
Three years after I had informed many of those same scientists at the University of Padua and nearly everywhere else of my approach !
I note two very sad aspects to that story !
First , that people from a " respected University " demonstrate such poor ethics and principles as to not even mention that it was actually MY concept !
Second , and nearly as troubling , they noted a cost of " 100 million euros " in contrasting to the fifty times more expensive ( foolish ) movable sea gates project that they have all long loved .
What I find troubling is that THIS ( original ) page indicates that the actual cost would be FAR less still than even they claim , where here I discussed THOUSANDS of dollars instead of over a hundred million !
What troubles me about that is that there had been ZERO interest in actually HELPING Venice when I indicated that the cost to Venice would be quite minimal .
But now that they think they have found a way to use ( my ) invention to try to capture 100 million to pay for their efforts , it sure seems to me that they only became interested when they saw significant money available to them .
How come no one actually does anything good for anyone else anymore unless they feel absolutely guaranteed that they will receive huge profits ?
They even seemed to have used some of my results of calculations , in making their prediction of raising Venice by 30 centimeters ( or one foot ) in ten years .
They may not have read my presentation very carefully ( or the letters or e-mails that I had sent to them in late 2002 ! ) as my complete calculations show the capability of significantly greater and faster rise than that .
I do n't mind being conservative regarding expectations , but if they are going to steal an invention , at least they should try to do a decent job of being accurate about it !
They also apparently decided to alter my concept in two minor ways , but also did not realize that both were really dumb changes !
They describe using ocean water ( saltwater ) to pump down , rather than the fresh river water I insisted on .
Apparently , they do not care that they would absolutely and permanently contaminate EVERY water well in the entire region !
When saline water gets to a water well , that 's it , it can never be used again .
The other ( slight ) variation from my version was to only use TWELVE giant pipes to send water down there ( instead of my multitude of standard conventional drilled wells as for water supply ) .
They are apparently unaware of the concept of erosion , where the ferocious flow rates they describe would do massive erosional damage to everything inside surrounding where they tried to do their version .
They would certainly create some huge caves with their poor idea , which would then result in sinkhole collapses at the surface .
How could ANYONE think that either of those fairly minor variances could be a GOOD thing ???
I suppose that is why they feel they deserve the " big bucks " which would be available from their 100 million euro price tag , to pay for all that " deep thinking " !
I have not been able to confirm whether or not they have ever done any experimental tests .
I almost hope not , because their results would certainly be disastrous !
How ( and why ) do people take a perfectly good concept and insist on " adding changes to it " without actually having any idea what they were doing ?
It seems that it can only be explained by the Greed aspect of human nature of wanting to somehow justify whatever alleged contribution to earn the big bucks .
I just find it rather disgusting , and that they SHOULD simply have put the future of Venice above their own personal motivations .
I sort of wonder if Venice will actually be saved by anyone !
I am also somewhat disappointed that my Italian - translated letter to the Mayor and City Council Members , were not remembered by those individuals when people approached them to promote my concept three years later .

I have been using Lighttpd for almost a year and Nginx for a month on my servers .
I know that they were created to be massively scalable , solving the C10 k problem .
However their asynchronised - IO model and small memory foot - print also make them suitable as alternative HTTP servers for memory - limited VPS .
Alternative = Anything but the current defacto Apache .
I will be writing more about Lighttpd and Nginx later during the year , but will try to use this post to draw some comparison between Nginx , the new darling of these light - weight web servers , and Lighttpd , many Web 2.0 developers ’ all time favourite .
Lighttpd
I have been running Lighttpd ( pronounced “ lighty ” ) on my home servers and development boxes since the beginning of 2006 .
It is a great replacement for Apache if you have the whole box to yourself , i.e. you do n’t need to worry about supporting .htaccess files that your users might use .
Currently this website is hosted on lighttpd - 1.4.13 on a Gentoo VPS .
Pros
Light weight .
Clean restart of 1.4.13 takes no more than 2Mb RSS on this 64bit VPS .
It binds the port , drops the privilege and that ’s it !
A single process does all the tricks even when you have hundreds of concurrent connections .
No more pre-fork MPM with mis-configured MaxClient that sends you to swap hell .

Community .
It has got a Blog , a Wiki / bug tracker and a forum .
It is easy to find help when you need one .
Cons
Stability ( or lack of according to the RoR folks ) .
I had quite a lot of issues using Lighttpd as proxy +HTTPS front - end for our Python stuff , but the same app runs fine with just lighttpd + proxy without HTTPS .

Update :
Here ’s an article I have written on Drupal clean URL on Nginx and Lighttpd , which looks at the URL rewrite options of these two web servers .

Memory leak .
The RSS of my lighty process grows by about 1.5 Mb per day , but then I do n’t have lots of traffic ( less than 50 k requests a day ) .
At the end I just need to restart it once a week .
Many people have far worse memory leaking issues I heard .
Nginx
I have been running Nginx ( pronounced “ engine X ” ) on my development box and two of my VPS ’s since December 2006 .
It is Russian , fast and very configurable .
I am currently using 0.5.5 for my sites , but do n’t be deceived by its version number — it is very stable .
Pros
Light weight .
It is not as light weight as lighttpd when it clean - starts .
At least two processes are needed — one master process running as root that binds to the port , and one or more worker processes that handle the actual requests .
Around 7 Mb RSS together on my 64bit VPS ( and only 4.5 Mb on 32bit VPS ) .
Still beats
Apache hands down .

Fast .
Some benchmarks have shown that Nginx has a slight edge over Lighttpd , but so far I have n’t been able to notice any .
Again , much faster than Apache over static file serving or proxying , especially when you turn up the value of keep alive ( more than 1 minute for example ) .

There are many modules available on Nginx .
Some very useful , and some are just plain weird .
While lighttpd has Lua embedded , you can now also embed the whole Perl interpretor inside Nginx .

Better Rewrite Module .
A much better rewrite module than Lighttpd that supports complex conditions .
Porting mod_rewrite rules from Apache is actually now feasible without touching the apps themselves .

Lack of community .
Where can I find help regarding Nginx ?
There ’s only IRC as far as I know .
And while the lead developer writes beautiful code , all documentation were initially in Russian which was a big stumbling block before the English docs came along .

No CGI support .
Oh well , maybe I am the only one who still hacks small CGI scripts .
Apparently Nginx does not spawn CGI or FastCGI processes , which means you need to either ( 1 ) convert it into external - spawn FastCGI , or ( 2 ) proxy to another web server that does CGI .

No simple virtual host support .
Lighttpd has mod_simple_vhost and mod_evhost to let you quickly deploy lots of name - based virtual hosts .
You can somehow do the same with using $ server_name in root and a wild - card in server_name , but it ’s still not as clean as lighttpd .
At the end you will find Nginx configuration files much more verbose if you run lots of small sites off a single web server .

No X - sendfile support .
I found Lighttpd ’s X - sendfile support very useful when my scripts need to send back large files , and was disappointed to find out that Nginx does not have it .
X - Accel - Redirect is different as it requires extra configuration on web server , which makes your web - app less portable .
Conclusion
I do n’t think I am a suitable judge to say which one is better , as ( 1 ) I have only been running Nginx for a month , and ( 2 ) my level of traffic does not really stress test these high - performing web servers .
At the moment I think I like Nginx better purely because it does not leak , and its rewrite module that enables me to run many off - the - shelf open source PHP apps with clean URL .
Again , I might change my mind in 3 months time when I find out more warts about Nginx .
We will see .
The change would lead to many intriguing questions :
For example , would a man who becomes a woman be able to marry another man ?
( Probably . )
Would an adoption agency be able to uncover the original sex of a proposed parent ?
( Not without a court order . )
Would a woman who becomes a man be able to fight in combat , or play in the National Football League ?
( These areas have yet to be explored . )
The Board of Health , which weighs recommendations drafted by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene , is scheduled to vote on the proposal in December , and officials say they expect it to be adopted .
At the final public hearing for the birth certificate proposal last week , a string of advocates and transsexuals suggested that common definitions of gender , especially its reliance on medical assessments , should be abandoned .
They generally praised the city for revisiting its 25 - year - old policy that lets people remove the sex designation from their birth certificate if they have had sexual reassignment surgery .
Then they demanded more freedom to choose .
Michael Silverman , executive director of the Transgender Legal Defense and Education Fund , said transgender people should not have to rely on affidavits from a health care system that tends to be biased against them .
He said that many transgender people cannot afford sex - change surgery or therapy , and often do not consider it necessary .
Another person who testified , Mariah Lopez , 21 , said she wanted a new birth certificate to prevent confusion , and to keep teachers , police officers and other authority figures from embarrassing her in public or accusing her of identity theft .
A few weeks ago , at a welfare office in Queens , Ms. Lopez said she included a note with her application for public assistance asking that she be referred to as Ms. when her turn for an interview came up .
It did not work .
The woman handling her case repeatedly addressed her as Mister .
“ The thing is , I do n’t even remember what it ’s like to be a boy , ” Ms. Lopez said , adding that she received a diagnosis of transgender identity disorder at age 6 .
She asked to be identified as a woman for this article .
On the face of it , the return of huge numbers of refugees has gone remarkably well , but in every province there are hundreds of land disputes and complaints of illegal occupation , and tens of thousands of returnees remain in tents , crammed in with relatives , or in public buildings .
The pressure for housing and land remains enormous .

This village is one such example .
The whole population , 200 families , fled one night , with just the clothes on their backs , in 1980 after a raid by Soviet troops that killed 40 people .
Now they number 360 families , they said .
They arrived in a long convoy of trucks and cars , laden with animals , household belongings , even roof beams .
Despite the war and the hardships of the refugee camps , they had prospered and multiplied in their 26 years away .
Haji Abdul Momin , 75 , has two wives , 10 children and 10 grandchildren , and he has taken a plot big enough to house the whole family .
“ I used to live in the village — we were very few then , ” he said .
“ Now we have increased .
We are 23 people , and I do n’t have enough land . ”
Every family interviewed said the same .
Only one man , Sirajuddin , 45 , a butcher who uses one name , had rebuilt his family home in the old village .
He and his brothers had agreed he would live in the house and farm the fields , and his brothers had secured one of the new plots for their families , he said .
His neighbor , Mr. Jabar , had started rebuilding his family house in the village but never moved in .
“ I would gain the enmity of my brothers , so I have left it empty , ” he said .
While it is clear they all need more space , their haste in occupying the land was driven by other concerns , the villagers admitted .
Other people from different parts of the province had begun to settle here , said one villager , Haji Paiwand , 50 .
So the whole village , who are all from one Pashtun tribe , decided to return home together to stake their claim to the land before others took it all , he said .
“ The whole tribe decided to come back , and if one family had stayed behind it would not have looked good , ” Mr. Momin said .
Earth has warmed by 0.6C ( 1F ) over the past 30 years , research shows
Nasa climatologists said the Earth had warmed by about 0.2C ( 0.4 F ) in each of the last three decades .
Pollution from human activity was pushing the world towards dangerous levels of climate change , they warned .
As a result , plant and animal species were struggling to migrate fast enough to cooler regions , they said .
" The evidence implies that we are getting close to dangerous levels of human - made pollution , " warned James Hansen , head of Nasa 's Goddard Institute for Space Studies , New York .
Ice melt
The study by researchers from Nasa , Columbia University and the University of California at Santa Barbara ( UCSB ) , showed that warming was greatest at high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere , and was more pronounced over land than the oceans .
The reason behind the rise in temperatures in this region was a result of a loss in snow and ice cover , the researchers said .
As the Earth warmed , melting snow and ice exposed dark land surfaces which absorbed more energy from the Sun , resulting in more warming - a process known as " positive feedback " .
Warming was less over the ocean than over the land because of the great heat capacity of the deep - mixing ocean , which causes warming to occur more slowly there .
Simon Tett , a scientist at the UK's Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research , said the findings supported Dr Hansen 's earlier predictions , which had been criticised in some quarters .
" The results of this study show that James Hansen 's predictions of the late ' 80s are consistent with what has happened , " Dr Tett said .
" Modelling has moved on since then , but the idea that early predictions were done to cause panic and were wrong has been proved to be not the case . "
Ocean data
The study also showed that the recent warming had brought temperatures within about 1C ( 2 F ) of the estimated maximum of the past one million years .
The Nasa researchers , alongside a team from UCSB , made the comparison by looking at past tropical ocean surface temperatures .
They did this through measurements of magnesium content in the shells of microscopic sea surface animals found in ocean sediment .
This study showed that the Western Equatorial region of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean was as warm , if not warmer , since the end of the last major ice age , approximately 12,000 years ago .
The researchers said this findings was important because these ocean areas were indicative of global temperature shifts .
Keith Briffa , from the University of East Anglia 's Climatic Research Unit , said the tropical ocean regions were among the more reliable areas from which to infer large - scale temperature changes .
" If you were looking for somewhere that was indicative of global average temperatures then you would go for the tropical oceans because modern studies based on instrumental records show that these are places that seem to represent relatively accurately global temperature variations over the last century . "
But Professor Briffa said using data such as magnesium content in shells , otherwise known as " proxy data " , over long periods raised a number of potential problems .
" The assumptions that we base our interpretations on are more likely to hold up when applied to data since the last ice age , or the last few millennia .
The further back you go though , the more likely it is that the story is more complicated and the uncertainties in our interpretations of proxy data are likely to be much greater , " Professor Briffa added .
" One of the big problems we have is that when you are looking at hundreds of thousands of years or longer timescales , we have no direct data to calibrate the proxy records rigorously . "
Extinction fears
The team warned that the rate animal and plant migration was not keeping pace with recent temperature rises .
" That means that further global warming of 1C defines a critical level , " Dr Hansen said .
" If warming is kept to less than that , effects of global warming may be relatively manageable .
But if [ it ] reaches two or three degrees , we will likely see changes that make Earth a different planet to the one we know , " he added .
" If we do not slow down the rate of global warming , many species are likely to become extinct .
In effect , we are pushing them off the planet . "
WASHINGTON —
The staff of U.S. Rep Marty Meehan wiped out references to his broken term - limits pledge as well as information about his huge campaign war chest in an independent biography of the Lowell Democrat on a Web site that bills itself as the “ world ’s largest encyclopedia , ” The Sun has learned .
The Meehan alterations on Wikipedia.com represent just two of more than 1,000 changes made by congressional staffers at the U.S. House of Representatives in the past six month .
Wikipedia is a global reference that relies on its Internet users to add credible information to entries on millions of topics .
Matt Vogel , Meehan ’s chief of staff , said he authorized an intern in July to replace existing Wikipedia content with a staff - written biography of the lawmaker .
The change deleted a reference to Meehan ’s campaign promise to surrender his seat after serving eight years , a pledge Meehan later eschewed .
It also deleted a reference to the size of Meehan ’s campaign account , the largest of any House member at $ 4.8 million , according to the latest data available from the Federal Election Commission .
“ Meehan first ran for Congress in 1992 on a platform of reform , ” the pre-edited entry said .
“ As part of that platform Meehan made a pledge to not serve more than four terms , a central part of his campaign .
This breaking of the pledge has been a controversial issue in the 5th Congressional District of Massachusetts . ”
The new entry reads in part : “ Meehan was elected to Congress in 1992 on a plan to eliminate the deficit .
His fiscally responsible voting record since then has earned him praise from citizen watchdog groups .
He was re-elected by a large margin in 2004 . ”
Vogel said , “ It makes sense to me the biography we submit would be the biography we write . ”
The change doubled the length of the entry on Meehan , corrected errors and replaced “ sloppy ” writing , Vogel said .
“ Let the outside world edit it .
It seemed right to start with greater depth than a paragraph with incorrect data from the ’ 80s . ”
Wikipedia ’s online honor system has made it ripe for abuse by vandals .
Recently , a user wrote in a Wikipedia bio that Virginia Congressman Eric Cantor “ smells of cow dung . ”
Another wrote that Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is “ ineffective . ”
These statements were traced to the House Internet - protocol ( IP ) address .
In November and December , The Sun has learned , users of the House ’s IP address were temporarily blocked from changing content because of violations described by the site as a “ deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the encyclopedia . ”
“ I ’m not denying it , ” Jon Brandt , a spokesman for the Committee on House Administration , which oversees the House computer network , said when asked to confirm House ownership of the address .
For security reasons , Brandt declined to say to whom the address is assigned .
While vandalism is a problem , deleting factual information raises ethical concerns , said Geoffrey Bowker , director of the Center for Science , Technology , and Society at Santa Clara University .
“ The vandalism is just plain childish , ” Bowker said .
“ The term - limit pledge ( that was changed by Meehan ’s staff ) is a much more serious case .
That ’s someone trying to alter the public record .
“ To knowingly remove a truthful statement is just wrong , ” he added .
“ It ’s not the place of any special - interest group to tamper with the facts available to the public . ”
Most of the 1,000 House changes were meant to enhance various encyclopedia entries .
Slurs against Cantor and Frist , which have been removed , are the first examples of abuse that Wikipedia ’s founder Jimmy Wales has seen derived directly from the legislative branch of the U.S. government .
Wikipedia records every change to its site and who made it .
The encyclopedia prefers that editors log in with a user name , but it ’s not necessary .
Many editors make changes anonymously ; Wikipedia identifies these users by tracking the number assigned to their Internet entry point , called an IP address .
But Wales said the deletion of factual information goes against the principles of Wikipedia , which promotes a “ neutral point of view ” policy .
“ You do n’t delete it , ” Wales said .
“ If they wanted to put in their side of things , that would seem ethically relevant , rather than just omitting it . ”
Mistakes were inserted into the Meehan entry at different points of its evolution , according to an examination of the edits .
One editor erroneously said Meehan attended Harvard College ; another indicated it is likely that Meehan would run for Sen. Edward Kennedy ’s seat .
Wikipedia reaches around the globe , having 3.1 million articles published in more than 200 languages .
The English - language version is the largest category , with more than 910,000 articles and 856 million words .
That ’s more than six times larger than Encyclopedia Britannica — the largest reference printed in English .
And people read it .
Yesterday , Wikipedia was ranked the 19th - busiest site on the Internet , according to alexa.com , a subsidiary of Amazon.com that tracks Webtraffic .
A new reference to Meehan ’s term - limit pledge was inserted in the Wikipedia entry in November by a person not using the House address .
On Dec. 27 , someone using the House IP address reduced the reference to a single sentence : “ ( Meehan ) also supported term limits , pledging to serve no more than four terms . ”
Vogel said he did not authorize the change .
No reference to Meehan ’s top-rated campaign account has been reintroduced .
The changes by Meehan ’s staff are not as “ reprehensible ” as inserting derogatory comments in someone else ’s entry , said Stephen Potts , former director of the federal Office of Government Ethics , which establishes conduct standards for the executive branch .
But the sheer breadth of changes emanating from the House reflects an abuse of public time and equipment , said Potter , now chairman of the Ethics Resource Center .
“ That kind of usage , plus the fact that they ’re changing one person ’s material , is certainly wrong and ought to be at a minimum the focus of some disciplinary action , ” he said .
Evan Lehmann ’s e-mail address is elehmann.com .
A reader sent me an email several weeks ago with this question :
I have always wanted to work for a small start up that was growing form 8 to 20 people , but I never know where to find them .
Everyone hears about the big companies and I can search Craigslist and Monster , but what is the best way to find small , fast growing companies ?
I always hear about them too late .
It 's a great question and I 'll attempt to give you all some pointers on this question .
First of all Craigslist is a good resource for startup jobs .
Most startups do n't want to pay listing fees so I would venture to guess that more startup jobs are on Craigslist than any other job board .
But why search Craigslist when you can search Indeed.com ?
Full disclosure - Indeed is one of our portfolio companies , but its value proposition is undeniable .
One search , all jobs .
But it does n't stop there .
You can subscribe to Indeed job searches via RSS .
When that plum startup job hits Craigslist , you 'll be alerted via Indeed .
I have no idea why everyone who is looking for a job does n't use Indeed .
I asked the Indeed team if they could create a custom search term for startup jobs and they did just that this past weekend .
So now , if you enter the word startup in the Indeed search ( just like this ) , you 'll get only startup jobs .
You can still filter by location , job type , etc as well .
Hopefully , that will be great help to everyone looking to join a startup .
But waiting for the job to be listed is n't enough .
You need to become part of the " startup community " in the area you live in .
In NYC , there are a bunch of networking events like the NYC Tech Meetup , NextNY , and a number of other networking opportunities .
Go to them .
Meet people , build relationships , let people know you are looking for a young company to be part of .
It wo n't take long before you start getting calls and emails .
But a word to the wise , be picky about what startup you join .
Do your homework .
Ask around about the founders .
Ask the company about their funding situation .
Make sure you meet more than the boss before you take the job .
Find out what it is like to work there before you take the job .
Because as my former partner Jerry Colonna likes to say , " all startups are dysfunctional families " .
But if you get the right one , its the most fun you can have in a work situation .
I am sure of that .
Experts warn of an accidental atomic war / Nuclear missile modified for conventional attack on Iran could set off alarm in Russia
2006-10-06 04:00:00 PDT
Washington -- A Pentagon project to modify its deadliest nuclear missile for use as a conventional weapon against targets such as North Korea and Iran could unwittingly spark an atomic war , two weapons experts warned Thursday .
Russian military officers might misconstrue a submarine - launched conventional D5 intercontinental ballistic missile and conclude that Russia is under nuclear attack , said Ted Postol , a physicist and professor of science , technology and national security policy at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Pavel Podvig , a physicist and weapons specialist at Stanford .
" Any launch of a long - range nonnuclear armed sea or land ballistic missile will cause an automated alert of the Russian early warning system , " Postol told reporters .
The triggering of an alert would n't necessarily precipitate a retaliatory hail of Russian nuclear missiles , Postol said .
Nevertheless , he said , " there can be no doubt that such an alert will greatly increase the chances of a nuclear accident involving strategic nuclear forces . "
Podvig said launching conventional versions of a missile from a submarine that normally carries nuclear ICBMs " expands the possibility for a misunderstanding so widely that it is hard to contemplate . "
Mixing conventional and nuclear D5s on a U.S. Trident submarine " would be very dangerous , " Podvig said , because the Russians have no way of discriminating between the two types of missiles once they are launched .
Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the project would increase the danger of accidental nuclear war .
" The media and expert circles are already discussing plans to use intercontinental ballistic missiles to carry nonnuclear warheads , " he said in May .
" The launch of such a missile could ... provoke a full - scale counterattack using strategic nuclear forces . "
Accidental nuclear war is not so far - fetched .
In 1995 , Russia initially interpreted the launch of a Norwegian scientific rocket as the onset of a U.S. nuclear attack .
Then - President Boris Yeltsin activated his " nuclear briefcase " in the first stages of preparation to launch a retaliatory strike before the mistake was discovered .
The United States and Russia have acknowledged the possibility that Russia 's equipment might mistakenly conclude the United States was attacking with nuclear missiles .
In 1998 , the two countries agreed to set up a joint radar center in Moscow operated by U.S. and Russian forces to supplement Russia 's aging equipment and reduce the threat of accidental war .
But the center has yet to open .
A major technical problem exacerbates the risk of using the D5 as a conventional weapon : the decaying state of Russia 's nuclear forces .
Russia 's nuclear missiles are tethered to early warning radars that have been in decline since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 .
And Russia , unlike the United States , lacks sufficient satellites to supplement the radars and confirm whether missile launches are truly under way or are false alarms .
The scenario that worries Postol , Podvig and other weapons experts is what might happen if the United States and North Korea come to blows and a conventional D5 is launched against a target there from a submerged Trident submarine .
Depending on the sub's location , the flying time to Russia could be under 15 minutes so the Russians would have little time to confirm the trajectory -- using decaying equipment -- before deciding to launch a nuclear strike on the United States .
The D5 missile project involves the removal of nuclear warheads from as many as two dozen D5 ICBMs that are carried aboard the U.S. fleet of 12 Ohio- class Trident submarines .
The Pentagon has the project on an accelerated schedule , with the goal of fielding the weapons alongside their nuclear variants in two years .
Each Trident submarine carries 24 D5 missiles , and the plan calls for using two of those as conventional weapons in each sub .
The rocket fired by a submerged submarine would barrel up through the ocean powered by its three - stage engine and rapidly ascend through the atmosphere at speeds up to 20,000 feet per second into outer space .
The warhead compartment of the missile would then plummet back to earth , guided to its target within about 50 feet by sophisticated sensors .
Defense officials believe it would gain enough speed and force to penetrate underground command bunkers .

Bruce Tate ’s Beyond Java is really Web- centric ; he argues forcefully that lightweight Web apps are one of the forces driving people towards things like Ruby on Rails and Seaside , as opposed , say , to Java EE .
My observations are mostly consistent with Bruce ’s , which as a Sun employee makes me think a lot about how we can haul the Java platform into the lightweight - web - app sweet spot .
( So far I ’ve failed to convince the Software organization to redirect most of the Java EE engineering resources into a radical pursuit of Convention over Configuration .
[ He ’s kidding - Ed . ] )
But Bruce ’s book had me all cranked up to write about the Right Way To Program The Web , and then synchronicity whacked me upside the head with a demo I saw today , and I ’m bathing in Web- architectural angst .
Bruce explains why programming for the Web is hard .
Stateless query - response message interchange is empirically a terrific architecture for world - scale highly - dynamic hypertextual information systems ; at least for the only one that ’s ever actually worked .
But it ’s a major pain in the butt for programmers , who would like to think they ’re in a controllable linear dialogue with their users ( after all , that ’s more or less how the users see it ) while still supporting the “ Back ” button .
Hence all the session and containerization voodoo in Java EE , which to its credit is trying to solve the whole problem in the general case in a flexible way .
Bruce claims that the “ continuation ” facility , commonly found in dynamic languages , snaps neatly onto the problem of making the Web look like a linear dialogue .
Clearly , continuations are kind of hard to understand and not for casual or novice programmers .
No problemo , says Bruce , frameworks like Seaside ( layered over Smalltalk ) hide the weirdness and let you just carry on an orderly dialogue with a user via a Web browser .
In my mind I was screaming “ No ! No ! No ! ” because I ’ve generally felt that the pain and complexity involved in object - relational and object - XML and object - messaging mapping outweigh the benefits ; that if your application is based on exchanging messages , then the message exchange has to be visible to the application programmer .
I ’m not alone in having this kind of reflex .
Well , it seems that both Ruby on Rails and Seaside would tend to disagree , and the evidence is building up on their side .
And today I had a date with a Vancouver startup that I ’ll write up when they ’re ready ; they have a very damn sophisticated Web app that I wish I ’d been smart enough to think of , solid useful function and a ton of graceful little flourishes ; and it ’s all Seaside , all continuations , all simple methods that conduct orderly dialogues with the user .
Maybe I ’m wrong .
Maybe you can abstract the Web away .
Hmph .
How to shoot a bullet through your startup David 70 comments Latest by Mark
Are you thinking about starting a company in the web space ?
Step one , do n’t listen to Business 2.0 and their How to build a Bulletproof Startup nonsense !
They ’ll tell you that you need to burn between $ 1.6 and $ 4.5 million to get to launch .
They ’re wrong .
They ’ll tell you that working on a prototype is about drawings and photoshop abstractions , that you need advisory boards , big staffs , and a huge lawyer tab before you get to building something real .
They ’re wrong .
The web is no longer a category that ’s useful to lump together with all other sorts of businesses .
Prudent advice for getting ready to produce real widgets is likely to be exactly the opposite of what ’s sensible for starting a new web service .
The cost structure is entirely different , the agility is entirely different , and the priorities should be totally different too .
Let me just cherry pick a few of the silliest pieces of advice :
To develop a beta you ’ll need a T - 1 broadband connection and enterprise - strength email …
Although it ’s shrewd to source talent globally , your core product - development team should be local
The assumption these days is that software and Web companies should break even after $ 20 million in investment
A rule of thumb is that a company should have about 20 employees at the time of launch
So to recap .
First you blow some $ 3 million getting the product ready to ship , then fuel the flaming payroll to 20 heads , and finally you expect to burn through another $ 17 million before you ’re at BREAK EVEN .
Not a profit , just break even .
What a freaking depressing scenario to set up as supposedly best practice .
People often ask us “ what should I do to build a company like 37signals ? ” .
I think we finally have a succinct answer now :
Do exactly the opposite of what Business 2.0 tells you to .
Part of one of the four regions of the sky in the direction of the Galactic Bulge in which the astronomers measured the iron and oxygen abundances in stars .
This particular field is in the vicinity of the so - called ' Baade 's Window ' , a region with relatively low amounts of interstellar " dust " that could block the sight , allowing astronomers to peer into the central parts of the Milky Way galactic centre and beyond .
The globular cluster NGC 6528 is visible in the lower left corner .

Using VIMOS on ESO 's Very Large Telescope , a team of French and Italian astronomers have shown the strong influence the environment exerts on the way galaxies form and evolve .
The scientists have for the first time charted remote parts of the Universe , showing that the distribution of galaxies has considerably evolved with time , depending on the galaxies ' immediate surroundings .
This surprising discovery poses new challenges for theories of the formation and evolution of galaxies .
The ' nature versus nurture ' debate is a hot topic in human psychology .
But astronomers too face similar conundrums , in particular when trying to solve a problem that goes to the very heart of cosmological theories : are the galaxies we see today simply the product of the primordial conditions in which they formed , or did experiences in the past change the path of their evolution ?
In a large , three - year long survey carried out with VIMOS , the Visible Imager and Multi-Object Spectrograph on ESO 's VLT , astronomers studied more than 6,500 galaxies over a wide range of distances to investigate how their properties vary over different timescales , in different environments and for varying galaxy luminosities .
They were able to build an atlas of the Universe in three dimensions , going back more than 9 billion years .
This new census reveals a surprising result .
The colour - density relation , that describes the relationship between the properties of a galaxy and its environment , was markedly different 7 billion years ago .
The astronomers thus found that the galaxies ' luminosity , their initial genetic properties , and the environments they reside in have a profound impact on their evolution .
" Our results indicate that environment is a key player in galaxy evolution , but there 's no simple answer to the ' nature versus nurture ' problem in galaxy evolution , " said Olivier Le Fèvre from the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille , France , who coordinates the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey team that made the discovery .
" They suggest that galaxies as we see them today are the product of their inherent genetic information , evolved over time , as well as complex interactions with their environments , such as mergers . "
Scientists have known for several decades that galaxies in the Universe 's past look different to those in the present - day Universe , local to the Milky Way .
Today , galaxies can be roughly classified as red , when few or no new stars are being born , or blue , where star formation is still ongoing .
Moreover , a strong correlation exists between a galaxy 's colour and the environment it resides in : the more sociable types found in dense clusters are more likely to be red than the more isolated ones .
By looking back at a wide range of galaxies of a variety of ages , the astronomers were aiming to study how this peculiar correlation has evolved over time .
" Using VIMOS , we were able to use the largest sample of galaxies currently available for this type of study , and because of the instrument 's ability to study many objects at a time we obtained many more measurements than previously possible , " said Angela Iovino , from the Brera Astronomical Observatory , Italy , another member of the team .
The team 's discovery of a marked variation in the ' colour - density ' relationship , depending on whether a galaxy is found in a cluster or alone , and on its luminosity , has many potential implications .
The findings suggest for example that being located in a cluster quenches a galaxy 's ability to form stars more quickly compared with those in isolation .
Luminous galaxies also run out of star - forming material at an earlier time than fainter ones .
They conclude that the connection between galaxies ' colour , luminosity and their local environment is not merely a result of primordial conditions ' imprinted ' during their formation - but just as for humans , galaxies ' relationship and interactions can have a profound impact on their evolution .
Results from this study are published in volume 458 ( 1 ) of Astronomy & Astrophysics , " The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey : The build - up of the colour - density relation " , by O. Cucciati et al .

The trauma of losing the Eurovision Song Contest can do funny things to a country .
In Finland , where the words " nul points " are burned into the national psyche , they have decided to take radical action and appoint hard - rocking death metal band Lordi as their Eurovision entry for 2006 .
A far cry from the breezy folk tunes and ultra-safe pop of traditional Eurovision fare , Lordi have scored hits with songs such as Blood Red Sandman .
They wield chainsaws on stage , and never perform or give interviews without wearing their rubber fright masks .
Lordi's Eurovision entry , Hard Rock Hallelujah , opens with the lines , " The saints are crippled on this sinners ' night / Lost are the lambs with no guiding light " , and goes on to celebrate something called " the day of rockoning " .
Perhaps unsurprisingly , the choice of Lordi has been greeted with dismay by religious groups both in Finland and abroad .
A group of Greek protesters known as the Hellenes have called on the Finnish government to intervene : " We ask the Finnish Commission of the Eurovision Song Contest to cancel the procedure and choose another song .
This evil and satanic Finnish band is not welcome in Greece . "
( This year 's contest will take place on May 20 in Athens ) .
Lordi's supporters argue that the band could hardly make Finland 's Eurovision record any worse .
Since the country began competing in 1961 , it has never troubled the top five , and on three occasions Finnish contestants have come home with the dreaded zero point score .
" It 's been a total failure , it is truly a national trauma to us , " says Kimmo Valtanen , the managing director of Sony BMG Music Finland , Lordi 's record label .
Lordi's lead singer , Mr Lordi ( real name : Tomi Putaansuu ) vehemently denies that his band are satanists .
" We have absolutely nothing to do with devil worship , " he says .
" I mean , Hard Rock Hallelujah !
Would a satanic band write a song title like that ?
No .
Our second single was called The Devil Is a Loser .
Although we are not a gospel band , either . "
Putaansuu , an Arctic Laplander , cites classic hard rockers Twisted Sister , Kiss and Alice Cooper among his influences , and admits that he will be surprised and disappointed if his band is eliminated from the competition .
" We are bringing rock credibility to the Eurovision song contest , " he insists .
" I always said that it does n't matter where you perform .
If you do a good painting , it should look the same whether it's on the wall of a museum or if it's on the wall of your toilet . "

Everyone loves Fast and Furious , I mean they made like freakin’ 15 of them already .
Now what would happen if they made a Mission Beach Jet Ski Rental movie to add to the series ?
All kidding aside , Fast and Furious is one of the best series of movies ever created .
One of the highest paying too .
You know what else is high paying ?
Getting in the right niche and crushing it .
If only there was some way to have super powers and crush it every time , yay or nay !?
Well , our buddies over at San Diego Jet Ski Rentals and Tours really hooked us up this time and decided to let us do some filming out on a jet ski rental in Mission Bay , close to downtown San Diego ( D town baby ) .
So we went out and got this epic shot !
… sort of .
JK , lol .
Okay we did n’t take this picture , but it sure looks sexy does n’t it ?
You know , the best part about renting jet skis — especially in Mission Bay harbor is the big open mile stretch of water that you can literally go full - throttle on without a care in the world .
It ’s the essence of the American Dream , Freedom baby ( yeah ) .
Damn it felt good to say that .
You see , most people think lead generating has to be boring but it does not .
Especially when you ’re bringing more people to ride jet skis .
San Diego Jet Ski Rentals was really smart about their marketing .
What they did is threw a huge even in Summer over at their Mission Beach Jet Ski Rentals location , and made a huge party out of it !
So everyone got to talking about renting wave runners and jet skis , and they started DOING it !
Imagine that !
Man !
Well , it got me thinking , we may as well throw huge parties all the time if it ’s good for marketing .
I ’ll keep that one on the shelf for now though .
So we did end up going to the San Diego Jet Ski party and we had a blast .
Got to ride some jet skis and they even had a boat out on the water .
Alright , I ’m starting to run out of things to talk about so if you decide to read on from this point , please be warned .
It ai n’t gonna be pretty .
I love jet skis .
They are awesome .
All I want to do is go out and ride wave runners and wake boards on my boat around Mission Beach for hours on end with a hammock posted on the side of the bay and some friends barbecuing it up .
Man I ca n’t believe I ’ve been doing this for over 5 years .
And I still write these articles exactly the same as when I started back then .
Good thing I have a lot of people who work for me though !
That way I can go out and ride jet skis into the sunset sipping mimosas like it ’s going outta style .
Alright sweet .
That ’s gonna hit the quote for words on this one ; ) .
Well it ’s been fun guys , I hope you appreciate my antics and see how easy this really can be .
This one should put us over the edge and then boom .
We ’re in the money .
See you on the green — oh yeah I almost forget , visit Mission Beach Jet Ski Rentals to have a blast and bring your momma on that trip while you ’re at it !
Bon Voyage .

As part of an information offensive in Iraq , the U.S. military is secretly paying Iraqi newspapers to publish stories written by American troops in an effort to burnish the image of the U.S. mission in Iraq .
The articles , written by U.S. military “ information operations ” troops , are translated into Arabic and placed in Baghdad newspapers with the help of a defense contractor , according to U.S. military officials and documents obtained by the Los Angeles Times .
Many of the articles are presented in the Iraqi press as unbiased news accounts written and reported by independent journalists .
The stories trumpet the work of U.S. and Iraqi troops , denounce insurgents and tout U.S. - led efforts to rebuild the country .
Though the articles are basically factual , they present only one side of events and omit information that might reflect poorly on the U.S. or Iraqi governments , officials said .
Records and interviews indicate that the U.S. has paid Iraqi newspapers to run dozens of such articles , with headlines such as “ Iraqis Insist on Living Despite Terrorism , ” since the effort began this year .

The operation is designed to mask any connection with the U.S. military .
The Pentagon has a contract with a small Washington - based firm called Lincoln Group , which helps translate and place the stories .
The Lincoln Group ’s Iraqi staff , or its subcontractors , sometimes pose as freelance reporters or advertising executives when they deliver the stories to Baghdad media outlets .
The military ’s effort to disseminate propaganda in the Iraqi media is taking place even as U.S. officials are pledging to promote democratic principles , political transparency and freedom of speech in a country emerging from decades of dictatorship and corruption .
It comes as the State Department is training Iraqi reporters in basic journalism skills and Western media ethics , including one workshop titled “ The Role of Press in a Democratic Society . ”
Standards vary widely at Iraqi newspapers , many of which are shoestring operations .
Underscoring the importance U.S. officials place on development of a Western - style media , Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld on Tuesday cited the proliferation of news organizations in Iraq as one of the country ’s great successes since the ouster of President Saddam Hussein .
The hundreds of newspapers , television stations and other “ free media ” offer a “ relief valve ” for the Iraqi public to debate the issues of their burgeoning democracy , Rumsfeld said .

The military ’s information operations campaign has sparked a backlash among some senior military officers in Iraq and at the Pentagon who argue that attempts to subvert the news media could destroy the U.S. military ’s credibility in other nations and with the American public .
“ Here we are trying to create the principles of democracy in Iraq .
Every speech we give in that country is about democracy .
And we ’re breaking all the first principles of democracy when we ’re doing it , ” said a senior Pentagon official who opposes the practice of planting stories in the Iraqi media .
The arrangement with Lincoln Group is evidence of how far the Pentagon has moved to blur the traditional boundaries between military public affairs -- the dissemination of factual information to the media -- and psychological and information operations , which use propaganda and sometimes misleading information to advance the objectives of a military campaign .
The Bush administration has come under criticism for distributing video and news stories in the United States without identifying the federal government as their source and for paying American journalists to promote administration policies , practices the Government Accountability Office has labeled “ covert propaganda . ”

Military officials familiar with the effort in Iraq said much of it was being directed by the “ Information Operations Task Force ” in Baghdad , part of the multinational corps headquarters commanded by Army Lt. Gen. John R. Vines .
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were critical of the effort and were not authorized to speak publicly about it .
A spokesman for Vines declined to comment for this article .
A Lincoln Group spokesman also declined to comment .
One of the military officials said that , as part of a psychological operations campaign that has intensified over the last year , the task force also had purchased an Iraqi newspaper and taken control of a radio station , and was using them to channel pro-American messages to the Iraqi public .
Neither is identified as a military mouthpiece .
The official would not disclose which newspaper and radio station are under U.S. control , saying that naming them would put their employees at risk of insurgent attacks .

U.S. law forbids the military from carrying out psychological operations or planting propaganda through American media outlets .
Yet several officials said that given the globalization of media driven by the Internet and the 24 - hour news cycle , the Pentagon ’s efforts were carried out with the knowledge that coverage in the foreign press inevitably “ bleeds ” into the Western media and influences coverage in U.S. news outlets .
“ There is no longer any way to separate foreign media from domestic media .
Those neat lines do n’t exist anymore , ” said one private contractor who does information operations work for the Pentagon .
Daniel Kuehl , an information operations expert at National Defense University at Ft. McNair in Washington , said that he did not believe that planting stories in Iraqi media was wrong .
But he questioned whether the practice would help turn the Iraqi public against the insurgency .
“ I do n’t think that there ’s anything evil or morally wrong with it , ” he said .
“ I just question whether it ’s effective . ”

One senior military official who spent this year in Iraq said it was the strong pro-U.S. message in some news stories in Baghdad that first made him suspect that the American military was planting articles .
“ Stuff would show up in the Iraqi press , and I would ask , ‘ Where the hell did that come from ? ’
It was clearly not something that indigenous Iraqi press would have conceived of on their own , ” the official said .
Iraqi newspaper editors reacted with a mixture of shock and shrugs when told they were targets of a U.S. military psychological operation .
Some of the newspapers , such as Al Mutamar , a Baghdad - based daily run by associates of Deputy Prime Minister Ahmad Chalabi , ran the articles as news stories , indistinguishable from other news reports .
Before the war , Chalabi was the Iraqi exile favored by senior Pentagon officials to lead post -Hussein Iraq .
Advertisement
Others labeled the stories as “ advertising , ” shaded them in gray boxes or used a special typeface to distinguish them from standard editorial content .
But none mentioned any connection to the U.S. military .
One Aug. 6 piece , published prominently on Al Mutamar ’s second page , ran as a news story with the headline “ Iraqis Insist on Living Despite Terrorism . ”
Documents obtained by The Times indicated that Al Mutamar was paid about $ 50 to run the story , though the editor of the paper said he ran such articles for free .
Nearly $ 1,500 was paid to the independent Addustour newspaper to run an Aug. 2 article titled “ More Money Goes to Iraq ’s Development , ” the records indicated .
The newspaper ’s editor , Bassem Sheikh , said he had “ no idea ” where the piece came from but added the note “ media services ” on top of the article to distinguish it from other editorial content .
The U.S. military - written articles come in to Al Mutamar , the newspaper run by Chalabi ’s associates , via the Internet and are often unsigned , said Luay Baldawi , the paper ’s editor in chief .
Advertisement
“ We publish anything , ” he said .
“ The paper ’s policy is to publish everything , especially if it praises causes we believe in .
We are pro-American .
Everything that supports America we will publish . ”
Yet other Al Mutamar employees were much less supportive of their paper ’s connection with the U.S. military .
“ This is not right , ” said Faleh Hassan , an editor .
“ It reflects the tragic condition of journalists in Iraq .
Journalism in Iraq is in very bad shape . ”
Ultimately , Baldawi acknowledged that he , too , was concerned about the origin of the articles and pledged to be “ more careful about stuff we get by e-mail . ”
After he learned of the source of three paid stories that ran in Al Mada in July , that newspaper ’s managing editor , Abdul Zahra Zaki , was outraged , immediately summoning a manager of the advertising department to his office .
Advertisement
“ I ’m very sad , ” he said .
“ We have to investigate . ”
The Iraqis who delivered the articles also reaped modest profits from the arrangements , according to sources and records .
Employees at Al Mada said that a low - key man arrived at the newspaper ’s offices in downtown Baghdad on July 30 with a large wad of U.S. dollars .
He told the editors that he wanted to publish an article titled “ Terrorists Attack Sunni Volunteers ” in the newspaper .
He paid cash and left no calling card , employees said .
He did not want a receipt .
The name he gave employees was the same as that of a Lincoln Group worker in the records obtained by The Times .
Although editors at Al Mada said he paid $ 900 to place the article , records show that the man told Lincoln Group that he gave more than $ 1,200 to the paper .
Advertisement
Al Mada is widely considered the most cerebral and professional of Iraqi newspapers , publishing investigative reports as well as poetry .
Zaki said that if his cash - strapped paper had known that these stories were from the U.S. government , he would have “ charged much , much more ” to publish them .
According to several sources , the process for placing the stories begins when soldiers write “ storyboards ” of events in Iraq , such as a joint U.S. - Iraqi raid on a suspected insurgent hide - out , or a suicide bomb that killed Iraqi civilians .
The storyboards , several of which were obtained by The Times , read more like press releases than news stories .
They often contain anonymous quotes from U.S. military officials ; it is unclear whether the quotes are authentic .
Advertisement
“ Absolute truth was not an essential element of these stories , ” said the senior military official who spent this year in Iraq .
One of the storyboards , dated Nov. 12 , describes a U.S. - Iraqi offensive in the western Iraqi towns of Karabilah and Husaybah .
“ Both cities are stopping points for foreign fighters entering Iraq to wage their unjust war , ” the storyboard reads .
It continues with a quote from an anonymous U.S. military official : “ ‘ Iraqi army soldiers and U.S. forces have begun clear - and - hold operations in the city of Karabilah near Husaybah town , close to the Syrian border , ’ said a military official once operations began . ”
Advertisement
Another storyboard , written on the same date , describes the capture of an insurgent bomb - maker in Baghdad .
“ As the people and the [ Iraqi security forces ] work together , Iraq will finally drive terrorism out of Iraq for good , ” it concludes .
It was unclear whether those two storyboards have made their way into Iraqi newspapers .
A debate over the Pentagon ’s handling of information has raged since shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks .
In 2002 , the Pentagon was forced to shut down its Office of Strategic Influence , which had been created the previous year , after reports surfaced that it intended to plant false news stories in the international media .
Advertisement
For much of 2005 , a Defense Department working group has been trying to forge a policy about the proper role of information operations in wartime .
Pentagon officials say the group has yet to resolve the often - contentious debate in the department about the boundaries between military public affairs and information operations .
Lincoln Group , formerly known as Iraqex , is one of several companies hired by the U.S. military to carry out “ strategic communications ” in countries where large numbers of U.S. troops are based .
Some of Lincoln Group ’s work in Iraq is very public , such as an animated public service campaign on Iraqi television that spotlights the Iraqi civilians killed by roadside bombs planted by insurgents .
Besides its contract with the military in Iraq , Lincoln Group this year won a major contract with U.S. Special Operations Command , based in Tampa , to develop a strategic communications campaign in concert with special operations troops stationed around the globe .
The contract is worth up to $ 100 million over five years , although U.S. military officials said they doubted the Pentagon would spend the full amount of the contract .

Mazzetti reported from Washington and Daragahi reported from Baghdad .
Two years ago , I launched Upcoming.org and announced it to the world .
Today , along with my partners Gordon Luk and Leonard Lin , I ’m unbelievably proud to announce that Upcoming.org is now a member of the Yahoo ! family .
I ’ve always had a warm and fuzzy feeling about Yahoo .
It ’s been my browser homepage since forever , and I still have akebono.stanford.edu / yahoo/ stuck in muscle memory .
Recently , the nostalgia has been replaced by admiration as I ’ve watched them making smart decisions , acquiring great companies ( Flickr , anyone ? ) , and hiring all of my friends .
The end result is that they ’re doing some of the most interesting work online , and I found myself linking to them more and more over the last year .
So when Stewart asked if we’d be interested in coming to Yahoo , we were surprised and flattered .
It ’s immensely satisfying for a company as interesting and high - profile as Yahoo to validate the hard work we ’ve done , and to see the future potential for growth .
After all , Upcoming was always a side project , fueled by passion and caffeine in the spare hours when we were n’t at our respective day jobs .
When I think about how much we were able to pull off with so little , and what we ’ll now be able to do with the staggering resources Yahoo has to offer …
Well , it blows my mind a little .
Sunnyvale , here we come !
I ’ve posted more details on Upcoming.org , and both Gordon and Leonard have written about it on their own sites .
For Yahoo ’s take on it , Paul Levine from the Yahoo !
Local team wrote about the news on the company blog .
Oh , and a profound thanks to everyone who ’s supported the site since the beginning .
I kiss you !
October 10 , 2005 : Thanks so much to Leonard for answering questions and covering e-mails while I was at Web 2.0 last week .
We ’re all getting ready for the big move later this month , but I ’ll be around by e-mail and IM if you want to say hi .
Those of us who 've been wondering where all of that cash the government poured into improving the UK 's rail network actually went can take heart in the fact that , instead of squandering it on improved signalling and new track , Britain 's rail operators actually used the money to develop the world 's first stealth train :
Impressive stuff .
The Eurostar in question is seen here decloaking as it approaches London 's Waterloo station - presumably to avoid waiting passengers seeing it appear from thin air once at the platform .
A quick bit of research by our black ops directorate revealed that the UK has in fact been operating stealth transport technology for some years , which explains why you never see a number 73 bus when you need one . ®

Thanks to Sam Wallace for the tip - off .
Event - Based Programming without Inversion of Control .
Philipp Haller and Martin Odersky .
Scala is different from other concurrent languages in that it contains no language support for concurrency beyond the standard thread model offered by the host environment .
Instead of specialized language constructs we rely on Scala 's general abstraction capabilities to define higher - level concurrency models .
In such a way , we were able to define all essential operations of Erlang 's actor - based process model in the Scala library .
However , since Scala is implemented on the Java VM , we inherited some of the deficiencies of the host environment when it comes to concurrency , namely low maximum number of threads and high context - switch overhead .
In this paper we have shown how to turn this weakness into a strength .
By defining a new event - based model for actors , we could increase dramatically their efficiency and scalability .
At the same time , we kept to a large extent the programming model of thread - based actors , which would not have been possible if we had switched to a traditional event - based architecture , because the latter causes an inversion of control .
( There 's not really a proper abstract .
The above is from the conclusion . )
I enjoyed this paper .
It 's a quick read and a nice demonstration of some of Scala 's cool features .
It 's also a good example of using exceptions as delimited control operators , and in fact the one substantial restriction is imposed by the lack of the more powerful operators .
They use Scala 's type system to reduce the burden of this restriction , however , since they 're able to state that a particular statement never returns normally ( and thus must not be followed by more statements ) .
Those interested in the language / library boundary will also find it interesting for this reason :
The techniques presented in this paper are a good showcase of the increased flexibility offered by library - based designs .
It allowed us to quickly address problems with the previous thread - based actor model by developing a parallel class hierarchy for event - based actors .
Today , the two approaches exist side by side .
Thread - based actors are still useful since they allow returning from a receive operation .
Event - based actors are more restrictive in the programming style they allow , but they are also more efficient .
They have some fairly impressive empirical scalability results as well .
I�m sure most of you know what an exit interview is .
It �s an interview that a person takes after leaving his job .
If you are into something funny right now , take a few minutes and see these pictures that are describing an exit interview at Verizon , a well known ISP .
I took the liberty of posting this for you , as I happen to work in Customer Care .
Enjoy ;)

Fun Filled New Year May Your Dreams Come True Sparkling Happiness And Good Times etc. Posted by Mikko @ 10:41 GMT
Massive amounts of fake New Year 's greetings cards are being sent by Tibs.jy ( aka Luder ) .
According to both our public and private virus statistic systems , the numbers are big enough .
So we 've just raised Luder .
A to Radar alert Level 2 .
In any case , this is hopefully the last post of 2006 .
Have a Good Year .
First MMS exploit for phones has been released Posted by Jarno @ 08:41 GMT
On late Friday the 29th of December , Collin Mulliner published proof - of - concept exploits of MMS vulnerabilities that he discovered six months ago .
When Collin first discovered the vulnerabilities he informed the software vendors , but as he has not received a report within half - a- year , he decided to now publish the exploit at the 23rd Chaos Communication Congress in Berlin .
The proof - of - concept exploits target vulnerabilities in the SMIL presentation control language in MMS messages .
Region tags in MMS SMIL are vulnerable to buffer overflow causing arbitrary code execution .
In other words , if those tags get too large in content it makes it to possible for a malicious MMS message to execute code on the target device .
It is still unknown which phones are vulnerable to this exploit .
Collin 's research has confirmed a vulnerability in the IPAQ 6315 and i-mate PDA2 k , but it is quite likely that all Pocket PC 2003 and Windows Smartphone 2003 devices are also vulnerable .
The good news is that the only devices for which the proof - of - concept code is available are the IPAQ 6315 and i-mate PDA2k .
And even in those devices the attacker needs to guess the correct memory slot where the MMS processing code is executing and send correctly crafted exploit code .
This means that a malicious MMS message will most likely only be able to crash the device , not to to exploit it .
So while Collin 's discovery is very significant , it does not pose immediate danger to any large group of users .
And although it is possible to create an MMS worm or other malware that uses the vulnerability , this particular exploit cannot be directly used in creating malware .
But to be safe , we have included detection for the exploits on Saturday the 30th in F - Secure Mobile Anti-Virus for the platforms that can be affected by this vulnerability .
As the device vendors have not given confirmation that the exploit has been fixed , we cannot confirm that patches are available .
But as always , it 's a very good idea to have the latest updates installed on your devices .

Modified versions of the malicious New Year cards Posted by Mikko @ 13:45 GMT
We 're now seeing slightly modified versions of the Happy New Year postcard .
exe attachments that were first spotted on Friday .
This time the e-mail subjects vary a lot but are always themed around New Year greetings .
For example , " Fun Filled New Year " , " May Your Dreams Come True ! " , " Sparkling Happiness And Good Times ! " , or " Sender Happy 2007 ! " .
The attachment name is " greeting card.exe " , " Greeting Postcard.exe " , or something else along those lines .
The attachments have been modified slightly to avoid detection by antivirus programs , but we detect them as Trojan - Downloader .
Win32.Tibs.jy .
There are also some corrupted attachments floating around : those might not be detected , but they wo n't work either .
Details of this malware are available in our description .

BlackLight Beta for Windows Vista and Windows 2003 Server x64 Posted by Antti @ 12:37 GMT
We 've just published a new beta version of our free BlackLight rootkit scanner , which now also supports Windows Vista ( 32 - bit only ) and Windows 2003 Server x64 Editions .
The same BlackLight executable will work on all supported platforms .
You may find it interesting that we 're adding support for 64 - bit operating systems , even though there are currently no rootkits for them !
The reason is that while 32 - bit rootkits do not work on 64 - bit platforms it is not impossible to create a 64 - bit compatible rootkit .
It just requires extra effort .
For example , a user - mode rootkit would have to hook 64 - bit processes with 64 - bit code but also make sure everything is hidden from 32 - bit applications running under WOW64 emulation .
As the number of computers running 64 - bit Windows has remained low , the rootkit authors have not had a reason to spend the extra effort to target those systems .
When they do , we hope to be ready .
More malicious New Year postcards Posted by Mikko @ 07:43 GMT
There 's a large scale spam run underway , sending short e-mail messages .
No text , just the subject field of " Happy New Year ! " and a file named postcard .
exe as an attachment .
The attachments are variable , but so far we detect them all as Trojan - Downloader .
Win32.Tibs.jy .
We have a description online too .
In general , kill all files named " postcard.exe " .
They always seem to be bad news .

More Christmas - themed malware Posted by Mikko @ 10:47 GMT
Unfortunately there seems to be more Christmas - related malware floating around .
Now there 's a backdoor named Christmas_Puzzle.exe .
This one uses a rootkit to hide its presence on a system .
We detect it as Trojan - Spy. Win32.Ardamax.e .
As a decoy , this one displays a Christmas - themed jigsaw puzzle game .
And then there 's a PowerPoint file named Christmas + Blessing - 4.ppt .
This one uses MS06 - 012 or a related vulnerability to drop and execute two embedded programs .
As a decoy , the exploit has been embedded in an innocent Christmas - themed PPT slideshow that has previously made the rounds .
We now detect this PPT file as Exploit .
MSPPoint.Agent.g .

Careful with Christmas.exe Posted by Mikko @ 14:10 GMT
We 've just received a sample of something that 's named CHRISTMAS .EXE .
When run , this IRCBot variant will try to download various malicious executables from web servers at waiguadown .008.net and user.free.77169.net .
As a decoy , it shows this Christmas - themed image :
Obviously , a gift that keeps on giving .
To be avoided .

Phishing Filters - No Add-ons Required Posted by Sean @ 15:50 GMT
Today Opera released version 9.1 of its browser for Windows .
A new security feature is included – Fraud Protection .
Using a whitelist from GeoTrust and blacklists from GeoTrust and Phishtank , Opera now alerts users of fraudulent sites .
When the option is enabled , each URL visited will be checked to confirm its security and the user is presented with a warning rather than being taken to a phishing site .
Firefox 2.x and Internet Explorer 7 also have their own anti-phishing filters built into the browsers .
IE7 checks against locally stored files , then against the URL Reputation Web Service ( URS ) hosted by MSN , and then uses built - in heuristics to validate the URL .
Firefox 2.x has two options – either it checks against Google 's AntiTrust database , or it uses a downloaded list of suspected sites .
The site list is local to the user 's hard drive , so anyone concerned about privacy might prefer this method .
The download file is updated frequently .
Firefox 's Warning :
IE 's Warnings :
Safari 3.0 will reportedly include similar functionality .
On another front , we 've also noticed Yahoo !
Mail started blocking non-standard URLs at some point .
Outlook as been doing so for a while now .
Any unusual URLs prompt the user with the following warning :
We see these updates as a very positive development for the typical Web consumer and hope to see the features widely enabled .
If you have n't updated your browsers , do so now . —
There 's a Firefox security update today as well …
And for those of you that have the great pleasure of being your family 's IT support – put this on your Christmas to - do list .

Skype Worm Posted by Mikko @ 11:58 GMT
We 've received some queries about a Skype worm .
The situation is a bit confusing right now , but here 's what we know :
There is no massive outbreak going on
There is something spreading on Skype , but only in limited numbers
It is not exploiting a vulnerability in Skype but simply sending chat messages asking you to download and run the infected executable
There are two different and separate malware samples being talked about relating to this case , confusing things further
One of them is named " sp.exe " .
We received a sample of this yesterday and added detection .
This one is connecting to nsdf.no - ip.biz in its attempt to download additional components
The other one is described in here .
This one downloads additional components from marx2.altervista.org , and it 's actually not new at all : we 've detected it since beginning of October

' Tis the Season ... Posted by Era @ 10:58 GMT
Every year around Christmas , the spammers have arranged something like a Gold Rush , ramping up the number of messages they send for the Christmas shopping season .
However , this year , what we are seeing is a completely new phenomenon .
It seems that multiple unfortunate events have coincided , resulting in an unprecedented rise in spam levels .
Now , if you look around for statistics , you will find that some claim that spam is now up to a record high 60 % of all email in the world , and others claim that spam is at a record high 90 % of all email , and some undoubtedly see close to 100 % ( my personal inbox would be a good example ) .
Whenever you see such numbers , you have to ask yourself whose numbers these are , and how they calculate them .
Who has the data to correctly measure all the email in the world ?
Does that include email sent within corporate intranets , too ?
How do you account for blocked email which would have been sent if the block was n't in place ?
Etc .
But however you measure it , the consensus is clear : Spam is worse than ever .
Right now , we are identifying three contributing factors :
1. Well , it 's Christmas Gold Rush again .
2 . It looks like the spam nets established by email worms over the last couple of years , and especially during this autumn ( Warezov ) , are now entering a new phase , with massive volumes of spam being sent .
3 . Possibly the same spammers have come up with techniques to introduce much more variation in their messages , which enables them to bypass many content - based filters which used to work better .
If you want some numbers , in spite of what was said above , here are some numbers .
It 's not clear how well they generalize , but this is what we are seeing :
- The average size of a spam message has doubled in the last year or so .
No doubt , this is mainly because of the increase in image - based spam .
- The number of spam messages in a typical honeypot mailbox has tripled in two years .
The growth is not constant ; it has accelerated markedly in the last year .
- Combining and extending the two previous observations , the volume of spam in bytes has grown more than fifteen - fold in two years .
We are hard pressed to find any good news to report in order to balance this account , but it appears that at this rate , we will soon exceed the pain threshold for passing international legislation against spam .

Wireless Client Update Posted by Sean @ 13:45 GMT
Windows XP SP2 Update KB917021 was published on October 17th 2006 .
What 's that you say ?
It 's an update to " help prevent the Windows wireless client from advertising the wireless networks in its preferred networks list " .
Those of you that travel with confidential information might want to investigate this patch .
It was n't included in Microsoft 's monthly updates .
Advertising the name of your preferred networks creates the potential for a man - in - the - middle attack .
This patch wo n't stop your Windows notebook from using a spoofed network , but it will fix it so that the hacker would have to guess the name .
You can find more details on this from Brian Krebs and Knowledge Base article 917021 .
You can download it from Microsoft 's Download Center – Validation Required .

Tuesday Patch Time Posted by Francis @ 20:52 GMT
Microsoft has released its monthly updates .
As Patrik posted earlier , Microsoft 's December update does not include a patch for the number of recently discovered Word vulnerabilities .
Nonetheless , Microsoft 's monthly update package includes three critical patches — one being a patch for Windows Media Player Remote Code Execution vulnerability MS06-078 .
At the moment , we have n't seen any malware that takes advantage of this vulnerability .
But it 's possible that we 'll see something using this exploit as a potential worm vector .
For instance , a mass mailer that spams file attachments of specially crafted .ASF or .ASX files with exploit code or perhaps an Instant Messenger worm spamming links of malicious sites hosting exploited Windows Media Player files .
Who knows ?
Better patch now before it 's too late .

QuickTime Flaw is Cross Platform Posted by SGMasood @ 14:28 GMT
Yep .
We tested the two security issues mentioned in our previous post on Mac OS X with QuickTime v7.1.3 .
We found that the .qtl issue works on the Mac .
So , now we have an unpatched QuickTime vulnerability that affects both Windows and Mac OS users .
Any malicious JavaScript code exploiting it would affect the users of both operating systems .
Phishing and Quickspace - type web application worms are two examples of attacks that are possible .
Click here to view a screenshot from our test .
Also , let us reiterate once again that this is not a MySpace only issue – this affects every other website that allows the embedding of QuickTime content .
We tested two other well - known social networking sites .
Just a side note : the HREF track and .qtl issues seem to affect users of QuickTime Alternative as well .
Two Unpatched Apple QuickTime Vulnerabilities Still Imperil Users Posted by SGMasood @ 11:14 GMT
You all know the story by now – A week ago MySpace was attacked by the Quickspace worm that abused an alleged " feature " of Apple QuickTime movie files to inject and execute malicious javascript in user profile pages .
The malicious code attempted to phish accounts and to offer spyware to an unspecified number of users with obvious hopes of financial gain by the perpetrators .
The primary cause that made the attack possible is not a MySpace flaw , but rather an Apple QuickTime feature that is clearly a security vulnerability .
QuickTime fails to enforce the same origin policy and to warn the user before loading and executing javascript from external resources – two things that all similar applications are expected to do .
For example , Flash allows embedded scripts , but it warns the user when a flash application tries to access an external resource .
We have yet to see Apple acknowledge this as a security issue .
On the contrary , it has claimed that this is a legitimate feature .
A temporary , trivially evadible , fix was provided by Apple to MySpace that was , controversially , distributed only to MySpace users and only to those MySpace users who use IE .
All other users of Apple QuickTime , including MySpace users who use a browser other than IE , are still vulnerable .
And , since this fix was given only to MySpace users , other websites are still vulnerable to an attack by a worm similar to Quickspace .
We did some investigation and found that —
1. Apart from the HREF track flaw exploited by the worm , Apple QuickTime is still vulnerable to another similar flaw that has been publicly known for quite some time .
This flaw can be exploited in the same way to achieve the exact same results as the first flaw .
The second flaw is obscure and it still remains unfixed .
We have n't yet seen anyone bringing attention to it or talk about fixing it .
Any patch that fixes the first flaw but not the second one is inadequate .
2. MySpace is still vulnerable to both the flaws and nothing prevents another web application worm from exploiting them .
3 . We tested a few other social networking sites and all the sites we tested were also vulnerable to web application worms utilizing the two flaws as an attack vector .
With no fix available , currently the only feasible workaround for these social networking sites , and also other websites on the Net , is to completely block users from uploading Apple QuickTime content .
Though scrubbing javascript from the content before accepting it is a solution , it is complex enough to make it impractical in this case .
Recommendation : Websites should block Apple QuickTime content completely until a patch is available from Apple for both vulnerabilities .
Bottom line :
These are security vulnerabilities , not " features " .
Yet another Word vulnerability Posted by Patrik @ 02:34 GMT
Last week we posted on a new vulnerability in Word .
Today , the Microsoft Security Response Center reported on yet another Word vulnerability .
The new vulnerability affects Word 2000 , 2002 , 2003 , and Word Viewer 2003 but not Word 2007 .
The vulnerability allows a malicious person to automatically execute code on the target machine when a DOC file is opened , so it 's very similar to most of the other Word vulnerabilities we 've seen during 2006 .
As it is actively being exploited , although the distribution so far is very limited , and there is no patch available we can only continue to use the same workaround as previously recommended – not to open or save any DOC files from untrusted sources or files that you have unexpectedly received from sources you trust .

Word hole will remain open Posted by Patrik @ 02:39 GMT
Microsoft just announced the patches that they will release on Tuesday the 12th .
And as we feared , the Word vulnerability disclosed earlier this week will not be fixed .
Looks like we 'll have to not open or save Word files from untrusted sources , or unexpectedly received from trusted sources , for another month .
No one sends DOC files in e-mails anyway , right ?
The dropped files we have seen used together with the Word vulnerability are detected as Trojan - Downloader .
Win32.Cryptic.ec , Trojan - Downloader .
Win32.Cryptic.f and Trojan - Downloader .
Win32.Tiny.y .
The patches that Microsoft will release are five security patches for Windows where the highest severity rating is Critical .
A patch for Visual Studio with a severity rating of Critical will also be released .
In addition , 14 non-security related patches will be released .

Mobile Phone Spam Posted by JP @ 14:50 GMT
The lab is receiving numerous reports of SMS Spam in Europe .
The reports have occurred during the last few days and it looks to be a very interesting case .
The SMS arrives with a URL that can only be accessed via a WAP gateway .
Putting the URL into a computer 's web browser returns a page declaring that the service is unavailable .
The URL in the SMS is also is tied to the phone 's number , so only that phone can use the link .
Forwarding the message to another phone renders it inaccessible .
While new to phones , this stuff looks like typical spam found on PCs and includes offers for free stuff .
Example : Download a free ring tone .
Or at least the first one is free .
Reading the download agreement carefully shows that more downloads will be pushed weekly thereafter at a cost of � 2 each .
Receiving SMS messages does n't usually cost the phone user , responding to these will …
Also interesting to note is the localization .
We have found several examples of German language and we ourselves have received this type of spam in Finnish .
Searching Yahoo !
Yielded a few cached examples in English .
The spam 's links point to vkap .
net — registered to a German address .
Searching for discussions online show that German speakers received some of these messages a couple of months ago .
We think this must have been " beta " testing .
Here we have some examples of the Finnish Spam :
Guardian comments on " .bank " gTLD Posted by Mikko @ 09:48 GMT
Today 's Guardian has a story about a topic we raised last month : how come museums have a secure , restricted . museum top - level domain but banks do n't have . bank ?
You would think that banks get phished via fake look - a- life domains much more than museums do .
" There are no safeguards whatsoever against someone registering a domain name and using it for nefarious purposes , " says Richard Martin , a business security consultant at the UK clearing bank group Apacs .
Barnaby Davis , director of electronic banking for Barclays , says : " We 're well past the tipping point when something needs to be done that makes it harder to register URLs or makes the consequences for misuse harsher . "

Hole in Word Posted by Patrik @ 00:21 GMT
Microsoft has just released a security advisory about a new zero - day vulnerability found in a bunch of versions of Word and Works : Word 2000
Word 2002
Word 2003
Word Viewer 2003
Word 2004 for Mac
Word 2004 v. X for Mac
Works 2004
Works 2005
Works 2006
So far the use of this vulnerability is limited and we 're monitoring the situation .
Interestingly enough this vulnerability was n't found the day after Microsoft 's Patch - Tuesday which has been the case for most of the other Office vulnerabilities found during 2006 .
Let 's just hope Microsoft can get this fixed in time for the next batch of monthly patches which is on the 12th of December .
In the meanwhile , we can all follow this useful workaround suggested by Microsoft :
Do not open or save Word files that you receive from untrusted sources or that you receive unexpectedly from trusted sources .

Greetings from AVAR 2006 which this year was held in Auckland , New Zealand !
The conference was excellent , lots of interesting topics and the place was perfect .
New Zealand is a truly beautiful place and people are nice and helpful .
I also had a chance to meet some of the old stars , including Peter Szor .
Unfortunately , I forgot to bring my copy of � The Art of Computer Virus Research � book with me to get it signed .
Well , maybe some other time then …
The picture is from Peter Ferrie�s presentation about attacks on virtual machine emulators .
It explained known and new tricks to detect the presence of different virtual machines and also some newly discovered attacks against them .
I also had a chance to present my paper about kernel malware explaining what they are , how they work , and what makes their detection and removal challenging .

New MySpace worm using a Quicktime exploit Posted by Mikko @ 20:52 GMT
We were contacted tonight by a user who pointed out that several of his friends have had their MySpace profile page modified .
The case looked like simple MySpace phishing , but it was n't obvious to us how the profiles were modified .
After investigating a bit further , it seems that we have a MySpace worm on our hands , using a malicious Quicktime MOV file to spread .
Infected MySpace pages are easy to find .
They 've had their standard MySpace header replaced with a new one :
The links here do not point to MySpace like they should .
Instead they point to four different sites , hosting MySpace look - alike pages :
When you visit an infected page with IE , an embedded MOV movie file ( piAF2iuswo.mov ) will be downloaded .
The MOV file contains a Javascript snippet that will download a Javascript file ( js.js ) which will modify YOUR MySpace profile ( if you have one ) .
After that , everybody who visits your MySpace profile gets hit too .
The final target seems to be to steal MySpace logins in mass quantities .
The infected files are hosted on several different sites , including :
www.daviddraftsystem.com, www.tm-group.co.uk, www.cake.fi and almobty.com .
We 've seen two different versions of the malicious Quicktime file .
We detect them with updates 2006 - 12-02_01 as JS / Quickspace .A.
More on this case from a blog entry at SpywareGuide .

JK Rowling insisted on carrying her manuscript on to her flight
Rowling was not prepared to stow her top secret notes for book number seven in her check - in baggage when she flew back from a book festival in August .
Eventually she was allowed to take them on the flight , bound in elastic bands .
Air passengers recently faced baggage restrictions following the discovery of an alleged plot to blow up airliners .
The writer said she would have considered sailing back to the UK if security officers had not relented .
Her seventh Harry Potter book is to be the last in the hugely popular series .
Handwritten notes
The author was returning from New York where she took part in a charity book reading with fellow authors Stephen King and John Irving .
She wrote on her website : " The heightened security restrictions on the airlines made the journey back from New York interesting , as I refused to be parted from the manuscript of book seven .
" A large part of it is handwritten and there was no copy of anything I had done while in the US .
" They let me take it on thankfully , bound up in elastic bands .
I do n't know what I would have done if they had n't - sailed home probably . "
Rowling was recently named the celebrity world 's ninth highest earner , making £ 41 m in 2005 according to US business magazine Forbes .
Film adaptations
Worldwide sales of the Potter books are reported to have topped 300 million .
The first four film adaptations have helped make Rowling one of the UK 's richest people , with an estimated personal fortune of £ 500m .
Filming has begun on the fifth instalment of the movie franchise , Harry Potter and the Order of The Phoenix .
The author also revealed she has yet to choose a title for the long - awaited conclusion to the boy wizard 's adventures , and is choosing between two possibilities for the novel .
" I was quite happy with one of them until the other one struck me while I was taking a shower in New York , " she wrote .
The robbers disappeared among Carnival revellers
The thieves reportedly brandished a hand grenade to threaten security guards at the Chacara do Ceu museum .
They shut down the security cameras and then slipped away in a crowd of Samba revellers , said museum officials .
Police numbers have been increased in Rio as the five - day celebration officially got under way on Friday .
Disappeared
Pablo Picasso's
The Dance , Salvador Dali's The Two Balconies , Henri Matisse 's Luxembourg Gardens and Claude Monet 's Marine were stolen .
The paintings were considered the museum 's most valuable pieces but their exact value was not immediately available .
" They took advantage of a carnival parade passing by the museum and disappeared into the crowd , " said museum director Vera de Alencar .
She said the robbery appeared to have been masterminded by specialists , probably from international gangs .
A number of tourists who were visiting the museum at the time were also mugged by the gang .
A nationwide alert has been issued by the federal police to try to prevent the artworks from leaving the country .

Tehran , IRAN ( CNN ) --
It is a country where the call to prayer echoes throughout the capital every morning , where women must cover their heads at all times , where a Supreme Leader has the final say over everything .
But when it comes to stem cell research , Iran is cutting edge .
Iran has some of the most liberal laws on stem cell research .
Scientists say the clergy here define life as beginning three months after conception , which gives scientists access to human embryonic stem cells left over from fertilization trials .
Scientists here are testing treatments on mice for everything from heart disease to multiple sclerosis .
And they claim to have successfully cloned a sheep last month and that the sheep is still alive .
Foreign observers have been invited to verify the claim .
We traveled both to a government run laboratory and a private hospital in Tehran .
Men and women were laboring over microscopes and Petri dishes .
And all told us things that most scientists in the West would envy .
" It 's quite open , we can do our work very easily , we do n't have any restriction , any problem , " one of the country 's leading stem cell researchers told me .
Iranian history , going back to the Persian empire , is laced with scientific achievements and one doctor told me , " the scientists would now like to go back to this era and for this reason young scientists are really excited . "
The new - found pride is not just about stem cells .
It 's also about nuclear energy .
The fact that Iranian scientists figured out how to enrich uranium without having to do so in a foreign country is a big reason the people and politicians say they wo n't back down from the United Nations ' demands to stop .
It seems science of all kinds is pushing ahead in Iran without pause .

I have to rant to someone .
I cannot tell this to my friends .
I am a partner in a growing company .
Business tends to slow down a little in November and December and I find myself pushing my people harder and harder .
I did n't come to be one of the owners overnight .
I worked hard for many years and for a boss that was cruel and heartless .
I rose above it all .
Now he 's gone and I run all of the divisions everywhere .
I swore I would never , ever treat an employee like he did .
Well , I forgot .
It ’s easy to drive my Mercedes home listening to my favorite CD or watching the game on my 60 " TV or heading to Vegas for some fun .
But in the mix of become important I forgot who I was and I forgot the promise I made .
Today , one of my employees who have been particularly aloof or unable to concentrate lately set me off and I sent her packing .
She threw nothing short of a fit and I had her escorted to the door ASAP so that her sobbing would not distract the rest of the staff .
A couple of hours ago I noticed one of my senior staff was not back from lunch .
She 's a good and trusted employee and manager .
But today I was " kicking ass and taking names "
So I called to find out how dare she be late and heard the sound of a little girl in the background .
This employee does n't have any kids so I asked where she was .
Turns out she was at the home of the employee I had dismissed .
That employee as it turns out was so aloof and distracted because her husband had abandoned her and her kids some weeks ago and she was too ashamed to say anything .
Today was her 4 year old girls birthday and she could n't afford a cake leave alone candles to put on it !
She 's been paying all the bills since her husband left her and is nearly broke .
All of her distant behavior and inability to perform suddenly made sense .
But I was too busy worrying about my bottom line to be bothered to notice .
I fired this woman today and she went home wondering how she could even give her daughter a gift for her birthday because I just took her primary source of income away from her .
I just got back from the store .
I bought all of the presents and food I could grab up in a short amount of time but suffice it to say this little girl will have a great party this evening .
Thier refrigerator will have food in it and there ’s plenty of pizza and ice cream and gifts .
Her mother has a job to come back to Monday morning and me ?
Well , I have some lessons to learn and some soul searching to do .
I was n’t raised to be such an arrogant , uncompassionate son of a bitch but I somehow managed to get there .
You do n't need to know my name .
It ’s not important .
I just needed to get this off my chest and to share this in hopes that someone else like me , will read this and remember who we really are and where we came from .
I thought I was a big man but found out today I am very , very small .
Please , do something to help someone truly in need .
God bless all of you this Holiday Season and Merry Christmas
The Brazilian employment ministry said its officials raided 183 farms , the highest number since Swat - style teams were introduced 10 years ago .
In total 4,133 workers were freed , with R$ 7.4 m ( £ 1.8 m ) paid to victims , the ministry said .
" What we know about is the tip of the iceberg , " said Father Ricardo Rezende , an anti-slavery campaigner and author of Stepping Out of the Shadow : Slavery for Debt in Contemporary Brazil , the first study of modern - day slavery in Brazil .
Although slavery was officially abolished in Brazil in 1889 , Fr Rezende said the official estimate of just 25,000 slaves in Brazil could be way off the mark : " The real figure could be 250,000 . "
Brazil 's modern - day slave trade began to boom again during the 1964 military dictatorship .
Following the creation of Sudam , a regional development agency which opened up industry in the Amazon region in 1966 , business people and cattle ranchers flocked to the rainforests to make money .
The landowners employed middlemen , known as gatos , who found unemployed workers in Brazil 's impoverished rural communities , often in north - eastern Minas Gerais .
" The gato arrives in a community and says he can get legal work in a certain place , " said Fr Rezende .
" They say the person will be able to send money home to their family ... [ but ] when they arrive they discover they owe money for the transport and the food .
The first imprisonment is that of the soul .
" Often a worker will have the false sense that he is in the wrong [ if he flees ] . "
Neide de Oliveira was the first prosecutor in Brazil to secure a conviction against a farmer for using slave labour in 1998 .
She says landowners manipulate workers , knowing that slavery is , for many , a more attractive proposition than unemployment .
" I once interviewed a worker with malaria and the farmer had given him a paracetamol and told him he would have to work for two months to pay for it , " she told the Guardian .
" I said to him , ' Why do n't you run away , ' and he replied , ' Run away to where ?
I do n't have any money and I can't go home like this . ' "
The campaign against slavery has taken centre stage since President Lula da Silva came to power in 2002 .
In 2003 a national action plan drafted a blacklist of companies involved .
Yet campaigners say a shield of impunity still exists for many slave owners and warn that until a new bill is passed allowing the confiscation of land , little progress will be made .
In the past several politicians have been denounced for exploiting slave labour .
Last year , Senator Joao Ribeiro was fined R$ 760,000 after 38 men , working in slave - like conditions were found on his farm .
Fr Rezende , who fled northern Para state after receiving death threats from pistoleiros ( hired guns ) , claimed that the landowners reasoned the workers were uncivilised , and that they were offering them work and food .
" It is a cultural problem , " added Ms Oliveira " The landowners say , ' Everybody does this , so why should I be different ? "
" Wait a sec , " Ove N. said , " your current network support guy charges a monthly retainer and hourly fees ?
You know , it 's supposed to be one or the other ; not both . "
Ove 's client - to - be looked a bit dismayed , " that 's what we thought ; but he said that this is just how it 's done ! "
It was a pretty easy sell for Ove ; not only could he save the company $ 400 / month in retainer fees , but his hourly support rate was $ 25 less than the current support guy .
After signing the support contract ,
Ove offered to do a Network Assessment , just to make sure things were properly licensed , backups were functioning , and so on .
The company declined , saying that they had been running smoothly for the past two years and only needed someone in case of an emergency .
Maybe in a year or so they 'd look to revamp the whole network .
Ove was just fine with that .
Things were very quiet over the next few months , with Ove remoting in once or twice to add a new user .
And then he received a panicked call : a week 's worth of email and faxes had vanished , and week - old messages were suddenly showing up as unread .
This called for an on - site visit .
When
Ove arrived onsite , he was lead -- for the fist time -- over to the server room .
And by " server room " I mean a vacant office with desktop and tower computers stacked on top of each other , cables strewn all over the place , and plugged - in monitors sitting in random places on the floor .
Unventilated , it was at least 90 °F in there .
Ove questioned the setup , to which his client replied , " it did seem a little off ; but the last network guy said that this is just how it 's done . "
Ove looked around the server room some more and noticed that there were six hard drives laying on a desk , each mounted in a hot - swap case with a weekday name written on the front .
He asked what they were all about .
" Those are our backup drives , " the custom replied , " at the end of each day , we swap the current drive with the one that has tomorrow 's day written on it ; each Friday , we take one drive home and bring back another to the office .
That way , we always have a full backup off - site , not more than a week old . "
Being familiar with backup routines , this rotation scheme came as no surprise to Ove .
The thing that worried him was that these were hard drives , not backup tapes .
He logged on to the server and opened the RAID - 1 administration console .
A pop-up message with a red exclamation mark greeted him : " Warning : RAID - 1 is degraded ! "
He ducked under the desk and , sure enough , one of the disks had a red light above it .
The bad disk was labeled " master . "
The other disk was labeled " Wednesday . "
Then it dawned on him exactly what kind of backup scheme this was : one drive ( the " master drive " ) was left permanently in the server and each day the secondary drive was pulled out and replaced with another .
The RAID - 1 controller would then see the array as failed and rebuild it using the " master " drive .
A few hours later , the second drive would be rebuilt .
Now , it would seem that the " master " drive was not too happy about being abused like this , and after a couple years of constantly being used to rebuild the other drive , it seized up .
Not noticing the red flashing light above the " master " drive , the customer removed the only functioning drive from the array and replaced it with a week - old drive .
Hence the " week - old emails " problem .
Ove explained the problem and how wrong this set - up was .
Like a broken record , the client pleaded " but he said that this is just how it 's done . "
Fortunately , only half a day of emails and faxes were lost .
Ove simply replaced the broken " master " drive with the previous days , and things were just like they the night before .
It did n't take much for Ove to convince his client to not only get a tape backup system , but to go ahead and do that Network Assessment .
And each step of the way , he was reminded that the set - up was " just how it 's done . "
She has local and national reporters who are EAGER to speak to voters who have been harassed by repetitive robocalls .
We need to put some meat on the bones of this story .
If you have been called repeatedly please contact me .
If you have recorded these calls even better because then it might be covered by the TV media , not just the print media .
They want to speak to New York State voters only for this story .
I am the conduit for this .

Sorry this diary is so short but time is of the essence .
One of the biggest problems on Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects is vandalism .
By this , we mean the introduction of non-sequiturs into articles and pages promoting their product , ( lack of ) typing skills , opinion , genitalia size , sports team or , indeed , the sexual orientation of their friends .
Vandalism constitutes a serious weakening of a wiki's moral fibre .
Vandalism is an important issue ; it drains literally minutes of valuable time each day from more dedicated contributors , who could be spending that time in more productive pursuits , such as Minesweeper or watching educational videos .
Several suggestions have been made to identify types of editors that are more likely to commit vandalism than others ; see Anonymous users should not be allowed to edit articles for one such idea .
The problem with most of the suggested blocking strategies is that they do n't accurately identify vandals .
It is apparent that we need to analyze content of vandalism edits to understand who vandals are .
This is the only way we can get a fine - grained blocking mechanism that allows legitimate editors to work with pages , while preventing those most likely to vandalize from having access to our system .
Types of vandals
A systematic analysis of vandalized pages on Wikipedia has turned up the following six categories of potential vandals :
Friends of gays .
The most active group of vandals is , unfortunately , overly proud friends and acquaintances of gays and lesbians .
While being proud of one 's gay acquaintances is n't necessarily a negative characteristic , Wikipedia is not the place to publicly announce a friend 's sexual orientation or proclivities .
Some examples : " BRANDON IS GAY " " Judy Anderson is a lesbian ! "
.

Many instances of vandalism show the telltale sign of typing students abusing Wikipedia to practice their home - row keyboard technique .
Although editing wiki pages is an educational pursuit , we are not here to provide a blank white page for prospective stenographers .
Typical examples : " asdfasdfgjkl ;asdfasdfjkl ; ;lkj " " aaaaaasssssddddddffffff " " sad fag had gas "

Typical examples :
This type of vandalism should be undone immediately , or Wikipedia will run out of these letters .
However , some of these users may in fact be pets or babies with access to keyboards , and it may be important to grok their attempted contributions .
The curious .
Another community of vandals are curious people .
These individuals ignore the sandbox and misuse the main namespace of Wikipedia to investigate their questions about wiki in general and web browsers in particular .
This is the wrong forum for such experimentation because , as we all know , Wikipedia is for people who are already certain about everything .
Some examples of vandalism by the curious : " Does this really work ? "
" TEST TEST TEST TEST " " Just seeing if this actually works . "
" Why am I allowed to write here ? "

Some examples of vandalism by the curious : Critics .
People who hate things should n't be allowed within ten kilometers of the edit button .
Thanks to the NPOV policy , Wikipedians can't have opinions , even outside Wikipedia ; otherwise , they might develop a habit of having a point of view , which is evil .
[ citation needed ]
Examples of critical vandalism include : " THIS FILM SUCKS DICK . " " CLOUD IS DUMB ! " " JAR JAR BINKS IS THE WORST CHARACTER SINCE QUI -GON JINN ...OH WAIT ... " " this book is stupid and i hate reading it cuz i have a test on it tomorrow " A subcategory of the above category are devoted to providing similar helpful criticism about Wikipedia and other projects .
Examples include : " Wikipedia is fake ! " " Wikipedia sucks ' cause anyone can edit it "

Examples of critical vandalism include : Men with big penises .
There seems to be a proliferation of editors who have enormous equipment .
Some edit in the third person , so it 's hard to tell if the editor is , himself , bragging , or if it might be his girlfriend , or just somebody who has been impressed while changing in the shower room .
While having the largest penis in the world may be something to see a doctor about , there is nothing that anyone at Wikipedia can do to assist you .
That is , until such time that someone writes an article on penis reduction techniques , which , if the number of people with alleged gigantic penises is any indication , will be very popular and widely read and acted upon .

Some edit in the third person , so it 's hard to tell if the editor is , himself , bragging , or if it might be his girlfriend , or just somebody who has been impressed while changing in the shower room .
While having the largest penis in the world may be something to see a doctor about , there is nothing that anyone at Wikipedia can do to assist you .
That is , until such time that someone writes an article on penis reduction techniques , which , if the number of people with alleged gigantic penises is any indication , will be very popular and widely read and acted upon .
Cheerleaders .
Pom -pom wielding young ladies tend to proudly announce how awesome they are , as well as their team , their school , and their friends , as if they 're mistaking Wikipedia for their mega phone .
They also like to add things like smiley faces and hearts to make articles look prettier .
Some examples : Englewood is awesome because Bailey and Jen live there !
Go Pirates !!!!!! ♥ < 3 :) =]

Best cheerleader in the world ( added to a list of notable alumni ) The Miami Dolphins are going to pwn the Super Bowl this year !!!!!!

Conclusion
Some Wikimedians have postulated that these statements are made by immature childish editors who use " gay " and similar as a derogatory term .
Any Wikimedian who thinks about this a little longer will realise that this is extremely unlikely , as being gay is not a negative qualification .
A more reasonable conclusion is thus that the writers of these phrases are merely friends of the subject , who are so proud of the sexual orientation of the subjects they feel the need to shout it from the rooftops .
Note that almost no vandals write " I AM VERY GAY " or " I , Anita Flugelhorn , appreciate a good roll in the hay every once in a while with another woman . "
The rare exception to this rule is those who self - identify on other people 's user pages .
However , it can usually be inferred that gays and lesbians are exceptionally good Wikipedia contributors , and only some of their very proud but misguided acquaintances feel the need to abuse articles to broadcast their friends ' sexual orientation .
Editing process
It should be apparent that we need to , at all costs , prevent people in these six groups from having edit access to Wikipedia .
For this reason , the following process for preventing access is proposed .
Prospective editors must submit an application on an online form to get access privileges .
The form fields will include their name and home mailing address .
Each prospective editor will receive a copy of a form letter ( see below ) through regular post .
The prospective editor will fill out the form letter , sign it , get it notarized , and return it by mail to the Wikimedia Foundation .
After careful review , the editor 's user account will be activated and they can then edit pages .
A draft of the form letter follows :
I , the undersigned , do hereby declare that , to the best of my knowledge :
1 . I already know how to type , or if not , I am not currently learning to type , nor do I plan to learn in the near future .
2 . I am not curious about the way things work .
I do not tinker with or take apart machines or other apparatus to see how they function .
I never pull up curtains , check out strange noises , experiment , tinker , hack , or otherwise show curiosity or a quest for knowledge .
3 . I can assure the reader that I have no opinions whatsoever , even on things outside of Wikipedia .
4 . I have attached a nude photo of myself demonstrating that I do not have a penis , or that I have a penis length of no more than two standard deviations above the mean .
5 . I have never been a cheerleader , and I do not associate with any cheerleaders in any way .
6 . I myself may or may not be homosexual , but I do not know anyone else who is gay , bisexual , lesbian , transgendered , or otherwise queer .
Additionally , I have no friends who fall under the following categories : savants , female dogs , people who tend to lose a lot , the mentally handicapped .

Phase II
Preventing these six groups from using Wikipedia should cut down vandalism to zero .
However , the main problem with the above proposal is that editors ' non-membership in the groups is self - reported .
There is no way to tell if the people are lying or not .
Particularly dangerous would be curious people , who would have a strong desire to fill out and send in the letter , just to see what happens .
For this reason , a phase II stage of the project would be to hire private investigators to do background checks on prospective editors .
These private eyes could look for clues that would indicate membership in one of the above groups , including but not limited to :
Although the cost may be high , this phase II effort is the only way to truly eliminate vandalism once and for all .
The tens of thousands in the New Orleans diaspora passing through the area and leaving their drowning city behind have to travel 200 miles north , to Monroe near the Louisiana - Arkansas border , before they can hope to find a motel .
And then they may balk at the price : even the most flea - bitten hostels have raised their prices as demand for rooms has rocketed .
Those evacuees prepared to stump up cash spend their days sitting around motel swimming pools , mobile phones glued to their ears , waiting for news .
Most evacuees , however , have no choice but to take refuge in one of the hundreds of church shelters that have mushroomed across Louisiana and Texas , some of which now house hundreds of people .
But , as the last of those who refuse to leave New Orleans are forcibly evacuated , many shelters now have signs saying Full .
It is a word that is fast becoming synonymous with much of Louisiana .
Baton Rouge 's population is estimated to have doubled to 500,000 in the past week as an estimated 250,000 people have poured into the state capital , turning it into Louisiana 's most populous city .
The sudden influx has dramatically altered the region 's demographics .
Before Katrina , about 50 per cent of Baton Rouge 's population was estimated to be black .
New Orleans , by comparison , is 70 per cent black .
Elsewhere , in the nearby towns of Lafayette and Alexandria , it is a similar story .
But as the towns fill up , the Deep South 's famed hospitality is stretched to breaking point and the mood is turning ugly .
Gun stores say local people are buying weapons to protect themselves against a perceived threat from outsiders .
Signs saying ' We have guns , we buy gold ' are now seen frequently outside pawn shops , adding to the post - apocalypse atmosphere .
Local people 's anxiety is explored on talk radio shows and in whispered conversations in the long queues at Wal - Mart .
Residents complain of longer queues in the rush hour and waiting at fast - food restaurants where people used to be served immediately .
' I work in heating and cooling .
Last week I sent a man on a 10 - minute trip and it took him three hours , ' one man , who declined to be named , said .
' And now they say it may be 80 days before they can fully drain New Orleans .
We can't wait that long .
Baton Rouge had already outgrown its infrastructure as it was , ' he said .
In Ouachita Parish , a poor , God-fearing part of Louisiana about 250 miles north of New Orleans , the sheriff , Richard Fewell , articulated what some of his fellow residents are thinking when he expressed reservations about ' the quality ' of the evacuees pouring out of a city now inextricably linked to lawlessness in the minds of many Americans .
Some local people were outraged by his comments .
Most nodded in agreement .
Further south , at the River Centre in Baton Rouge , where several thousand are housed , evacuees talk about being labelled as second - class citizens .
' We wear these bracelets to show where we 're staying .
You can see [ local ] people glance at them and you can read the thoughts going through their minds , ' said Chantelle , 22 , a shop assistant from New Orleans .
' I applied for a job at Jack in the Box [ a burger bar ] .
And when I told them where I was from , you should have seen their faces , ' said her friend , Denise , 19 .
The River Centre evacuees are eyed suspiciously by private security patrols whenever they venture close to nearby Europe Street , a leafy , well - to - do stretch of attractive wooden houses with quaint porches in the heart of one of the city 's most desirable areas .
The culture clash with the endless rows of camp beds and refugees crammed into the River Centre is almost tangible .
The President 's mother , Barbara Bush , underlined the division between the evacuees and their hosts last week , suggesting those fleeing the flood may be better off because of the hurricane .
' So many of the people in the arena here , you know , were underprivileged anyway , ' she said after visiting Houston Astrodome , where thousands are being housed .
' So this is working very well for them .
As many evacuees will not be able to return to New Orleans for months , possibly more than a year , the state authorities are drawing up plans to house some in semi-permanent trailer park homes across Louisiana .
One of the biggest of these is likely to be in Port Allen , a joyless industrial area that clings to the west bank of the Mississippi and is home to smoke - spewing refineries and countless breakers ' yards .
Given the options of staying put in such grim surroundings or moving on , many New Orleans residents have decided to put as much distance as they can between themselves and their old city .
Igor Szymanski , 37 , was living in a $ 400 - a- month apartment in the city when the hurricane struck .
As the waters rose he stayed inside , aware a man had been shot five times outside his door when he would not surrender his bicycle to looters .
Szymanski had a revolver .
A police officer offered to give him ammunition to protect himself from looters , but the officer had only 9 mm bullets for a pistol .
A friend eventually drove him out of the city .
A Pole by birth and an IT expert , Szymanski is now heading for Chicago , which has a large , tightly - knit Polish community , with the hope of starting a new life .
Like many others who ended up in New Orleans , Szymanski had visited it on holiday and decided to stay .
He and his girlfriend took dead - end jobs , the city 's bewitching aura compensating for the low pay .
But the city no longer holds a magic allure .
' We 're heading up north to Chicago to get on to higher ground .
To a city with a different energy , ' Szymanski said .
He feels the Windy City wo n't leave him isolated as New Orleans did , should it suffer a natural catastrophe .
' Chicago is a central point , there 's a multitude of options if something goes wrong there , ' Szymanski said .
He is typical of thousands of others who , having little in the way of roots in New Orleans , other than lowly jobs and rented apartments , now under water , have decided to make new lives elsewhere .
Katrina , it seems , has acted as a catalyst , convincing the Big Easy 's residents to follow the yellow brick road to a new life elsewhere .
According to the Louisiana Department of Social Services , there are now 130,000 people staying in shelters in Texas and Louisiana and a further 20,000 in other states across the US .
The figures do not include those who are staying with family or friends or in hotels .
Several thousand people in the two states are already estimated to have checked themselves into long - term accommodation , a sign that they do not intend to return to New Orleans soon .
Of the 15,000 or so evacuees who were housed in the Houston Astrodome , only about 3,000 are now left , many having managed to find work and housing in the Lone Star state .
The federal government 's Department of Veterans has already started selling some of its housing stock , accrued through foreclosing on homes owned by former soldiers who defaulted on their mortgage payments , to New Orleans 's evacuees wanting to make new lives further north in Louisiana or neighbouring Alabama .
In addition , about 6,000 children from the New Orleans area have been enrolled at schools in Texas , and a further 12,000 in Louisiana , creating emotional links that may prove difficult for their parents to break whenever they are given the green light to return .
Many former residents of the Gulf Coast region believe it is inevitable that another Katrina will visit the area and have convinced themselves to start afresh in a lower - risk area .
' I 'm not going back .
You can't live in a bowl , ' said Alice , 73 , referring to the way New Orleans is built below sea level , protected by the 350 - mile network of levees surrounding the city .
' I got relatives in Florida .
They tell me life is good there , so I 'm going , ' said Duane Williams , 23 , a trainee mechanic .
There were concerns about New Orleans 's demographics long before Katrina rent her destruction .
The city 's population has been shrinking for decades , thanks in part to rising unemployment and crime levels which have driven people away .
Today it is estimated that about 450,000 people are counted as living there , compared with 630,000 in 1960 .
Situated on the border between the states of Mississippi and Louisiana , the city is in one of the poorest regions in the US .
The average wage in Mississippi is $ 24,650 , the lowest in the US and more than $ 7,000 below the national average .
Louisiana was ranked 42nd poorest state with an average wage of $ 27,795 .
The city 's mayor , Ray Nagin , had been acutely worried about the city 's shrinking population and had drawn up a $ 4 billion development programme to stimulate the economy and create jobs before Katrina struck .
But the programme , and with it the hopes of securing New Orleans 's long - term future , has been subsumed by Hurricane Katrina .
There are doubts about whether the numerous casinos built on barges in the Gulf of Mexico , now reduced to matchsticks , will be rebuilt , something that would see the loss of thousands of jobs in the area .
Big blue - chip companies are already moving their Louisiana headquarters from New Orleans to other parts of the state .
Given the increase in insurance premiums they will need to pay to return to the city , many could end up deciding to make the switch permanent .
It is estimated a third of the city 's 34,000 businesses will end up having to move offices for some time .
' This is all moving very , very quickly , ' said Stephen Moret , president of the Baton Rouge Chamber of Commerce .
' I 'm told businesses are making permanent decisions now , ' he told the Advocate newspaper .
Experts say it is likely that the poorest , predominantly black sections of New Orleans 's society will feel the economic downturn hardest , raising questions over whether they will want to return to a city with dubious prospects .
Experts are already predicting that unemployment on the Gulf Coast will rise to 25 per cent in the short to medium term as a result of Katrina .
Again , inevitably , the poorest will be hit the hardest .
' There 's no question that the recovery is going to be much longer and more painful for the 28 per cent of the local population in the New Orleans area living below the poverty line , ' Liz Ann Sonders , chief investment strategist at stockbroker Charles Schwab told the News Star newspaper .
' The population in Louisiana and Mississippi is incredibly poor .
Most of the damage was from flooding , which does n't tend to be covered by insurance , ' Mark Vitner , the senior economist at Wachovia Bank , said .
' That combination adds up to an incredibly long and painful rebuilding process - I think five to 10 years , ' Vitner said .
It is a gloomy prognosis , but one with which many of New Orleans 's institutions seem to concur .
Louisiana 's supreme court has moved to a temporary new home in Baton Rouge .
And , perhaps , most symbolically , the New Orleans ' Saints , the city 's American football team , has decamped , at least temporarily , to San Antonio in Texas .
For years the team 's owner , Tom Benson , has been fighting the authorities to replace the team 's stadium , the Superdome , which was home to about 25,000 evacuees following the flood and which has been left badly damaged .
Local sports pundits believe that Benson may now use Katrina as an excuse to move the team to Texas or , perhaps , Los Angeles , which is without a National Football League team .
Whether New Orleans can reclaim its status as one of America 's great cities now hinges on the federal government 's economic response .
It is estimated that Katrina 's damage may end up totalling more than $ 100 billion , roughly five times the cost of the 11 September atrocities .
This at a time when the Bush administration wants to make budget cuts in welfare and health programmes to reduce a $ 316bn budget deficit .
Some senators have even expressed doubts about whether it makes sense to resurrect a city built on swampland , despite its distinguished heritage .
For his part , Nagin , who seems to be battling hard to suppress his anger at the way that Louisiana Governor Kathleen Babineaux Blanco and the federal authorities have handled Katrina 's aftermath , is trying to paint a bright future for New Orleans .
' We will rebuild , ' he pledged last week in the middle of a city now denuded of almost all its people .
But thousands of New Orleans 's residents no longer care for such promises .
They have gone to forge new lives elsewhere .
And they are not coming back .
So what is this ?
Is it a supernatural powers of Russian women ?
Or maybe it ’s just a photoshoped image ?
No !
This boulder is from pumice - stone , the lightweight mineral which is formed from volcano lava .
So even the boulder of such size can be lifted easily .
And not only by Russian women .
It 's not quite as exciting as , say , the idea of exploding Segways , but a software glitch that has those iconic Personal Transporters suddenly reversing torque and falling over ain't nothing to scoff at .
Segway has today announced the recall of all 23,500 Segway units sold between March 2002 and now ( as in , every single one ) , and involves the i167 , i170 , i180 , p133 , XT , GT and i2 models .
It is n't Segway 's first time around the old recall wheel , in September of 2003 they recalled all 6,000 Segways sold to date due to another falling glitch .
This time apparently the Human Transporter " can unexpectedly apply reverse torque to the wheels , " as in , go in reverse while the rider is leaning forward -- spelling certain doom for the nerd aboard .
Segway has gotten six reports of head and wrist injuries so far , and is recalling the units to local service providers who can apply a simple software update and have you on your way in no time .

This is the third part in a series of posts on steps managers and employers of IT staff can take to improve the morale and , by extension , the performance of their workers .
Read PART ONE and PART TWO if you have n’t already .
In response to some discourse in the comments for the last part I thought I ’d start by clarifying : these posts are n’t intended to be an empty whine ( although that can be therapeutic ) they are actually addressing real issues that ultimately hurt employers as much as employees .
I did admit from the start that the Cabal Of Disaffected and Exploited Information Technology ( CODE - IT ) workers have a tendency to complain but when simple steps are available to keep good staff happy , why not take them ?
Bad workplaces drive employees away while good workplaces attract and keep good staff .
And any manager who thinks they do n’t have to look after their staff is living in denial .
The best you can hope for is the death of 1000 cuts – your bad staff wo n’t jump ship because they ’re afraid nobody else will employ them .
Your good staff will be the first to wake up to the fact they deserve better .
And with each person you lose your performance will go downhill until you reach some appalling plateau of hopelessness or collapse altogether .
I ’ve worked in places where the management was perfectly happy to have barely above minimum performance because it made them feel like they were completely in control .
They were largely right : most of the staff who stayed there more than a year or so were too hopeless to get a job anywhere else , so they were totally at the manager ’s mercy .
If that ’s your goal as a manager , do n’t waste your time reading this – there ’s nothing here for you .
Actually , if that ’s your company policy and your company is publicly traded , let me know your stock ticker symbol so I can short your stock ( I ’m learning trading tips from Howard ’s blog ) .
And yes , that line ’s stolen from Joel Spolsky .
This post is the second half of my thoughts on work environment wherein I provide some straightforward suggestions on how to improve the environment for CODE - IT workers to everyone ’s benefit .
This is a personal favourite of mine as it ’s possible to forget about how much money you do or do n’t have , it ’s possible to forget that there might not be any future in your job but you ca n’t ignore what ’s going on around you .
If you want to improve the well - being of your staff immediately and the performance of your company long term , then improve the working environment .
It ’s important to remember that the overall concept of work environment and facilities for IT workers goes beyond the physical environment .
This includes their work “ tools ” : PCs and / or mobile computing hardware , software , printers , scanners and any other gadgets that make their job possible or seem like fun .
It ’s common for managers not to be sure how much to provide CODE - IT workers on the system / resources front .
Here ’s the short answer : give them what they ask for .
Where possible give them more .
Before they ask for it .
IT system costs can spiral out of control quickly , particularly when a large IT department is involved – I ’m not suggesting bankrupting a company by outfitting every desk with frivolous widgets .
But do n’t be too quick to veto requests to beef up the machines used by your CODE - IT brigade .
The difference in productivity that can be gained by boosting the quality of the hardware and software available can be phenomenal .
And for god ’s sake , make your judgements on a case - by - case cost / benefit analysis – do n’t apply standard rules across the company .
Even within an IT group , system requirements will vary wildly between individuals depending on their actual work .
But is seems some managers need the obvious pointed out to them : the system needs of a CODE - IT worker are not the same as someone doing customer service or someone working in accounts .
They are n’t even close .
Underpowered machines have two disadvantages .
First , they are slower in performing the tasks required of them ( or in some cases I have experienced , completely incapable of performing the tasks ) which has a direct impact on productivity .
Each task takes longer so less tasks get done each day .
QED .
A second problem which can cause more problems long term is that each time a CODE - IT worker experiences an unnecessary delay because of underpowered systems they get that little bit more pissed off with their work .
I ’m complaining again .
So here ’s a tip for a quick easy win : give your CODE - IT workers two monitors .
You might think I ’m being flippant but there are a number of quite respectable studies that show a sharp improvement in productivity with multi-monitor setups .
Monitors are getting cheaper every day and you do n’t even have to provide particularly flash ones ( on the other hand , if you have the money – go to town ) .
If you get in quick while this practice is still a relative novelty you can invest a few hundred dollars per head to get two 17 ″ monitors on every desk and make your CODE - IT workers think you love them .
We might have a tendency to complain but really we just want to feel loved .
There is a lot of argument around whether cubicles , open plan or individual offices are the best solution for housing staff but really there is n’t an absolute answer .
Different people prefer different things so talk to your staff to find out what the consensus is .
And if you ca n’t meet what people want , above all , be open about your decision .
Explain the reasons for your decision and be prepared for some complaints but at least if you are honest you can hold your head up .
Go back to part two in this series for an example of how to really piss off CODE - IT workers in this area .
I ’ve already said this in previous posts , but the one universal truth regarding seating for CODE - IT workers is GIVE US ENOUGH SPACE !
The majority of IT workers require much more space than the average office worker to perform effectively .
Skimp on this at your peril .
Another magical environment booster is donuts .
I wo n’t engage in a debate on the health issues involved in allowing your CODE - IT hordes to gorge on junk food .
If this sort of think ( junk food abuse ) upsets you , imagine I ’m using donuts as a metaphor .
But I ’m not – I mean literally provide fresh donuts every morning .
One workplace I know did this and had the earliest rising CODE - IT crew I have ever met .
Early arrival in and of itself is not a guarantee of good work but it did n’t hurt that everyone started the day with a positive attitude .
When the inevitable happened and a bean counter cut the donuts off because it was “ frivolous ” , the direct result was morale , early arrivals and overall performance took a nosedive .
Not so much from lack of donuts , everyone could afford $ 2 for a donut if they wanted one but more because everyone got the unmistakeable message : this entire department does not deserve a small luxury .
At the same time the CEO is in news for receiving multi-million dollar bonuses .
Do n’t underestimate the power of little things in the work environment .
This counts for both good and bad things but I ’m trying to be more positive today .
Some extremely good CODE - IT workers will only work in places that give them the freedom to wear casual clothes ( “ I could earn twice as much somewhere else , but they ’d probably make me wear shoes ” was one rather disturbing quote I uncovered during my research ) .
In short , any small thing you can do to improve the work environment should be done .
You may be surprised which things the staff values .
Very few managers I know think showers in the workplace add any value , but you never know .
Some years back , an explosion cut off gas supplies in Melbourne .
This meant an extremely large number of people ( those with gas hot water systems ) had no running hot water in their homes for a couple of months .
People with working hot showers at their workplace were showing up for work real early and were in a much better mood than those with no showers .
The one caveat I would offer when considering adding little perks to the work environment is only do it if you ’re in it for the long haul .
I almost hate to admit it , but the majority of CODE - IT staff will get more angry at having something taken away than they will at never having it in the first place .
It ’s that whininess coming in again .
Whatever you do , do n’t underestimate the importance of the environment in making your staff less angry .
When you improve the environment you are saying “ I want you to be in a good place , I want you to be happy here , I want you to stay here . ”
And not many people would argue that ’s a bad thing .
The next part of this series will explore how to make CODE - IT staff less angry by making their work more interesting and fulfilling .
READ PART FOUR
READ PART FIVE
May 2004
When people care enough about something to do it well , those who do it best tend to be far better than everyone else .
There 's a huge gap between Leonardo and second - rate contemporaries like Borgognone .
You see the same gap between Raymond Chandler and the average writer of detective novels .
A top -ranked professional chess player could play ten thousand games against an ordinary club player without losing once .
Like chess or painting or writing novels , making money is a very specialized skill .
But for some reason we treat this skill differently .
No one complains when a few people surpass all the rest at playing chess or writing novels , but when a few people make more money than the rest , we get editorials saying this is wrong .
Why ?
The pattern of variation seems no different than for any other skill .
What causes people to react so strongly when the skill is making money ?
I think there are three reasons we treat making money as different : the misleading model of wealth we learn as children ; the disreputable way in which , till recently , most fortunes were accumulated ; and the worry that great variations in income are somehow bad for society .
As far as I can tell , the first is mistaken , the second outdated , and the third empirically false .
Could it be that , in a modern democracy , variation in income is actually a sign of health ?
The Daddy Model of Wealth
When I was five I thought electricity was created by electric sockets .
I did n't realize there were power plants out there generating it .
Likewise , it does n't occur to most kids that wealth is something that has to be generated .
It seems to be something that flows from parents .
Because of the circumstances in which they encounter it , children tend to misunderstand wealth .
They confuse it with money .
They think that there is a fixed amount of it .
And they think of it as something that 's distributed by authorities ( and so should be distributed equally ) , rather than something that has to be created ( and might be created unequally ) .
In fact , wealth is not money .
Money is just a convenient way of trading one form of wealth for another .
Wealth is the underlying stuff — the goods and services we buy .
When you travel to a rich or poor country , you do n't have to look at people 's bank accounts to tell which kind you 're in .
You can see wealth — in buildings and streets , in the clothes and the health of the people .
Where does wealth come from ?
People make it .
This was easier to grasp when most people lived on farms , and made many of the things they wanted with their own hands .
Then you could see in the house , the herds , and the granary the wealth that each family created .
It was obvious then too that the wealth of the world was not a fixed quantity that had to be shared out , like slices of a pie .
If you wanted more wealth , you could make it .
This is just as true today , though few of us create wealth directly for ourselves ( except for a few vestigial domestic tasks ) .
Mostly we create wealth for other people in exchange for money , which we then trade for the forms of wealth we want . [ 1 ]
Because kids are unable to create wealth , whatever they have has to be given to them .
And when wealth is something you 're given , then of course it seems that it should be distributed equally . [ 2 ]
As in most families it is .
The kids see to that .
" Unfair , " they cry , when one sibling gets more than another .
In the real world , you can't keep living off your parents .
If you want something , you either have to make it , or do something of equivalent value for someone else , in order to get them to give you enough money to buy it .
In the real world , wealth is ( except for a few specialists like thieves and speculators ) something you have to create , not something that 's distributed by Daddy .
And since the ability and desire to create it vary from person to person , it 's not made equally .
You get paid by doing or making something people want , and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want .
Top actors make a lot more money than B - list actors .
The B - list actors might be almost as charismatic , but when people go to the theater and look at the list of movies playing , they want that extra oomph that the big stars have .
Doing what people want is not the only way to get money , of course .
You could also rob banks , or solicit bribes , or establish a monopoly .
Such tricks account for some variation in wealth , and indeed for some of the biggest individual fortunes , but they are not the root cause of variation in income .
The root cause of variation in income , as Occam 's Razor implies , is the same as the root cause of variation in every other human skill .
In the United States , the CEO of a large public company makes about 100 times as much as the average person . [ 3 ]
Basketball players make about 128 times as much , and baseball players 72 times as much .
Editorials quote this kind of statistic with horror .
But I have no trouble imagining that one person could be 100 times as productive as another .
In ancient Rome the price of slaves varied by a factor of 50 depending on their skills . [ 4 ]
And that 's without considering motivation , or the extra leverage in productivity that you can get from modern technology .
Editorials about athletes ' or CEOs ' salaries remind me of early Christian writers , arguing from first principles about whether the Earth was round , when they could just walk outside and check . [ 5 ]
How much someone 's work is worth is not a policy question .
It 's something the market already determines .
" Are they really worth 100 of us ? " editorialists ask .
Depends on what you mean by worth .
If you mean worth in the sense of what people will pay for their skills , the answer is yes , apparently .
A few CEOs ' incomes reflect some kind of wrongdoing .
But are there not others whose incomes really do reflect the wealth they generate ?
Steve Jobs saved a company that was in a terminal decline .
And not merely in the way a turnaround specialist does , by cutting costs ; he had to decide what Apple 's next products should be .
Few others could have done it .
And regardless of the case with CEOs , it 's hard to see how anyone could argue that the salaries of professional basketball players do n't reflect supply and demand .
It may seem unlikely in principle that one individual could really generate so much more wealth than another .
The key to this mystery is to revisit that question , are they really worth 100 of us ?
Would a basketball team trade one of their players for 100 random people ?
What would Apple 's next product look like if you replaced Steve Jobs with a committee of 100 random people ? [ 6 ]
These things do n't scale linearly .
Perhaps the CEO or the professional athlete has only ten times ( whatever that means ) the skill and determination of an ordinary person .
But it makes all the difference that it 's concentrated in one individual .
When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid , what are we really saying ?
In a free market , prices are determined by what buyers want .
People like baseball more than poetry , so baseball players make more than poets .
To say that a certain kind of work is underpaid is thus identical with saying that people want the wrong things .
Well , of course people want the wrong things .
It seems odd to be surprised by that .
And it seems even odder to say that it 's unjust that certain kinds of work are underpaid . [ 7 ]
Then you 're saying that it 's unjust that people want the wrong things .
It 's lamentable that people prefer reality TV and corndogs to Shakespeare and steamed vegetables , but unjust ?
That seems like saying that blue is heavy , or that up is circular .
The appearance of the word " unjust " here is the unmistakable spectral signature of the Daddy Model .
Why else would this idea occur in this odd context ?
Whereas if the speaker were still operating on the Daddy Model , and saw wealth as something that flowed from a common source and had to be shared out , rather than something generated by doing what other people wanted , this is exactly what you 'd get on noticing that some people made much more than others .
When we talk about " unequal distribution of income , " we should also ask , where does that income come from ? [ 8 ]
Who made the wealth it represents ?
Because to the extent that income varies simply according to how much wealth people create , the distribution may be unequal , but it 's hardly unjust .
Stealing It
The second reason we tend to find great disparities of wealth alarming is that for most of human history the usual way to accumulate a fortune was to steal it : in pastoral societies by cattle raiding ; in agricultural societies by appropriating others ' estates in times of war , and taxing them in times of peace .
In conflicts , those on the winning side would receive the estates confiscated from the losers .
In England in the 1060s , when William the Conqueror distributed the estates of the defeated Anglo - Saxon nobles to his followers , the conflict was military .
By the 1530s , when Henry VIII distributed the estates of the monasteries to his followers , it was mostly political . [ 9 ]
But the principle was the same .
Indeed , the same principle is at work now in Zimbabwe .
In more organized societies , like China , the ruler and his officials used taxation instead of confiscation .
But here too we see the same principle : the way to get rich was not to create wealth , but to serve a ruler powerful enough to appropriate it .
This started to change in Europe with the rise of the middle class .
Now we think of the middle class as people who are neither rich nor poor , but originally they were a distinct group .
In a feudal society , there are just two classes : a warrior aristocracy , and the serfs who work their estates .
The middle class were a new , third group who lived in towns and supported themselves by manufacturing and trade .
Starting in the tenth and eleventh centuries , petty nobles and former serfs banded together in towns that gradually became powerful enough to ignore the local feudal lords .
[ 10 ]
Like serfs , the middle class made a living largely by creating wealth .
( In port cities like Genoa and Pisa , they also engaged in piracy . )
But unlike serfs they had an incentive to create a lot of it .
Any wealth a serf created belonged to his master .
There was not much point in making more than you could hide .
Whereas the independence of the townsmen allowed them to keep whatever wealth they created .
Once it became possible to get rich by creating wealth , society as a whole started to get richer very rapidly .
Nearly everything we have was created by the middle class .
Indeed , the other two classes have effectively disappeared in industrial societies , and their names been given to either end of the middle class .
( In the original sense of the word , Bill Gates is middle class . )
But it was not till the Industrial Revolution that wealth creation definitively replaced corruption as the best way to get rich .
In England , at least , corruption only became unfashionable ( and in fact only started to be called " corruption " ) when there started to be other , faster ways to get rich .
Seventeenth - century England was much like the third world today , in that government office was a recognized route to wealth .
The great fortunes of that time still derived more from what we would now call corruption than from commerce . [ 11 ]
By the nineteenth century that had changed .
There continued to be bribes , as there still are everywhere , but politics had by then been left to men who were driven more by vanity than greed .
Technology had made it possible to create wealth faster than you could steal it .
The prototypical rich man of the nineteenth century was not a courtier but an industrialist .
With the rise of the middle class , wealth stopped being a zero - sum game .
Jobs and Wozniak did n't have to make us poor to make themselves rich .
Quite the opposite : they created things that made our lives materially richer .
They had to , or we would n't have paid for them .
But since for most of the world 's history the main route to wealth was to steal it , we tend to be suspicious of rich people .
Idealistic undergraduates find their unconsciously preserved child 's model of wealth confirmed by eminent writers of the past .
It is a case of the mistaken meeting the outdated .
" Behind every great fortune , there is a crime , " Balzac wrote .
Except he did n't .
What he actually said was that a great fortune with no apparent cause was probably due to a crime well enough executed that it had been forgotten .
If we were talking about Europe in 1000 , or most of the third world today , the standard misquotation would be spot on .
But Balzac lived in nineteenth - century France , where the Industrial Revolution was well advanced .
He knew you could make a fortune without stealing it .
After all , he did himself , as a popular novelist . [ 12 ]
Only a few countries ( by no coincidence , the richest ones ) have reached this stage .
In most , corruption still has the upper hand .
In most , the fastest way to get wealth is by stealing it .
And so when we see increasing differences in income in a rich country , there is a tendency to worry that it 's sliding back toward becoming another Venezuela .
I think the opposite is happening .
I think you 're seeing a country a full step ahead of Venezuela .
The Lever of Technology
Will technology increase the gap between rich and poor ?
It will certainly increase the gap between the productive and the unproductive .
That 's the whole point of technology .
With a tractor an energetic farmer could plow six times as much land in a day as he could with a team of horses .
But only if he mastered a new kind of farming .
I 've seen the lever of technology grow visibly in my own time .
In high school I made money by mowing lawns and scooping ice cream at Baskin - Robbins .
This was the only kind of work available at the time .
Now high school kids could write software or design web sites .
But only some of them will ; the rest will still be scooping ice cream .
I remember very vividly when in 1985 improved technology made it possible for me to buy a computer of my own .
Within months I was using it to make money as a freelance programmer .
A few years before , I could n't have done this .
A few years before , there was no such thing as a freelance programmer .
But Apple created wealth , in the form of powerful , inexpensive computers , and programmers immediately set to work using it to create more .
As this example suggests , the rate at which technology increases our productive capacity is probably exponential , rather than linear .
So we should expect to see ever - increasing variation in individual productivity as time goes on .
Will that increase the gap between rich and the poor ?
Depends which gap you mean .
Technology should increase the gap in income , but it seems to decrease other gaps .
A hundred years ago , the rich led a different kind of life from ordinary people .
They lived in houses full of servants , wore elaborately uncomfortable clothes , and travelled about in carriages drawn by teams of horses which themselves required their own houses and servants .
Now , thanks to technology , the rich live more like the average person .
Cars are a good example of why .
It 's possible to buy expensive , handmade cars that cost hundreds of thousands of dollars .
But there is not much point .
Companies make more money by building a large number of ordinary cars than a small number of expensive ones .
So a company making a mass - produced car can afford to spend a lot more on its design .
If you buy a custom - made car , something will always be breaking .
The only point of buying one now is to advertise that you can .
Or consider watches .
Fifty years ago , by spending a lot of money on a watch you could get better performance .
When watches had mechanical movements , expensive watches kept better time .
Not any more .
Since the invention of the quartz movement , an ordinary Timex is more accurate than a Patek Philippe costing hundreds of thousands of dollars .
[ 13 ] Indeed , as with expensive cars , if you 're determined to spend a lot of money on a watch , you have to put up with some inconvenience to do it : as well as keeping worse time , mechanical watches have to be wound .
The only thing technology can't cheapen is brand .
Which is precisely why we hear ever more about it .
Brand is the residue left as the substantive differences between rich and poor evaporate .
But what label you have on your stuff is a much smaller matter than having it versus not having it .
In 1900 , if you kept a carriage , no one asked what year or brand it was .
If you had one , you were rich .
And if you were n't rich , you took the omnibus or walked .
Now even the poorest Americans drive cars , and it is only because we 're so well trained by advertising that we can even recognize the especially expensive ones . [ 14 ]
The same pattern has played out in industry after industry .
If there is enough demand for something , technology will make it cheap enough to sell in large volumes , and the mass - produced versions will be , if not better , at least more convenient . [ 15 ]
And there is nothing the rich like more than convenience .
The rich people I know drive the same cars , wear the same clothes , have the same kind of furniture , and eat the same foods as my other friends .
Their houses are in different neighborhoods , or if in the same neighborhood are different sizes , but within them life is similar .
The houses are made using the same construction techniques and contain much the same objects .
It 's inconvenient to do something expensive and custom .
The rich spend their time more like everyone else too .
Bertie Wooster seems long gone .
Now , most people who are rich enough not to work do anyway .
It 's not just social pressure that makes them ; idleness is lonely and demoralizing .
Nor do we have the social distinctions there were a hundred years ago .
The novels and etiquette manuals of that period read now like descriptions of some strange tribal society .
" With respect to the continuance of friendships ... " hints Mrs. Beeton 's Book of Household Management ( 1880 ) , " it may be found necessary , in some cases , for a mistress to relinquish , on assuming the responsibility of a household , many of those commenced in the earlier part of her life . "
A woman who married a rich man was expected to drop friends who did n't .
You 'd seem a barbarian if you behaved that way today .
You 'd also have a very boring life .
People still tend to segregate themselves somewhat , but much more on the basis of education than wealth . [ 16 ]
Materially and socially , technology seems to be decreasing the gap between the rich and the poor , not increasing it .
If Lenin walked around the offices of a company like Yahoo or Intel or Cisco , he'd think communism had won .
Everyone would be wearing the same clothes , have the same kind of office ( or rather , cubicle ) with the same furnishings , and address one another by their first names instead of by honorifics .
Everything would seem exactly as he'd predicted , until he looked at their bank accounts .
Oops .
Is it a problem if technology increases that gap ?
It does n't seem to be so far .
As it increases the gap in income , it seems to decrease most other gaps .
Alternative to an Axiom
One often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would increase the income gap between rich and poor .
As if it were an axiom that this would be bad .
It might be true that increased variation in income would be bad , but I do n't see how we can say it 's axiomatic .
Indeed , it may even be false , in industrial democracies .
In a society of serfs and warlords , certainly , variation in income is a sign of an underlying problem .
But serfdom is not the only cause of variation in income .
A 747 pilot does n't make 40 times as much as a checkout clerk because he is a warlord who somehow holds her in thrall .
His skills are simply much more valuable .
I 'd like to propose an alternative idea : that in a modern society , increasing variation in income is a sign of health .
Technology seems to increase the variation in productivity at faster than linear rates .
If we do n't see corresponding variation in income , there are three possible explanations : ( a ) that technical innovation has stopped , ( b ) that the people who would create the most wealth are n't doing it , or ( c ) that they are n't getting paid for it .
I think we can safely say that ( a ) and ( b ) would be bad .
If you disagree , try living for a year using only the resources available to the average Frankish nobleman in 800 , and report back to us .
( I 'll be generous and not send you back to the stone age . )
The only option , if you 're going to have an increasingly prosperous society without increasing variation in income , seems to be ( c ) , that people will create a lot of wealth without being paid for it .
That Jobs and Wozniak , for example , will cheerfully work 20 - hour days to produce the Apple computer for a society that allows them , after taxes , to keep just enough of their income to match what they would have made working 9 to 5 at a big company .
Will people create wealth if they can't get paid for it ?
Only if it 's fun .
People will write operating systems for free .
But they wo n't install them , or take support calls , or train customers to use them .
And at least 90 % of the work that even the highest tech companies do is of this second , unedifying kind .
All the unfun kinds of wealth creation slow dramatically in a society that confiscates private fortunes .
We can confirm this empirically .
Suppose you hear a strange noise that you think may be due to a nearby fan .
You turn the fan off , and the noise stops .
You turn the fan back on , and the noise starts again .
Off , quiet .
On , noise .
In the absence of other information , it would seem the noise is caused by the fan .
At various times and places in history , whether you could accumulate a fortune by creating wealth has been turned on and off .
Northern Italy in 800 , off ( warlords would steal it ) .
Northern Italy in 1100 , on .
Central France in 1100 , off ( still feudal ) .
England in 1800 , on .
England in 1974 , off ( 98 % tax on investment income ) .
United States in 1974 , on .
We 've even had a twin study : West Germany , on ; East Germany , off .
In every case , the creation of wealth seems to appear and disappear like the noise of a fan as you switch on and off the prospect of keeping it .
There is some momentum involved .
It probably takes at least a generation to turn people into East Germans ( luckily for England ) .
But if it were merely a fan we were studying , without all the extra baggage that comes from the controversial topic of wealth , no one would have any doubt that the fan was causing the noise .
If you suppress variations in income , whether by stealing private fortunes , as feudal rulers used to do , or by taxing them away , as some modern governments have done , the result always seems to be the same .
Society as a whole ends up poorer .
If I had a choice of living in a society where I was materially much better off than I am now , but was among the poorest , or in one where I was the richest , but much worse off than I am now , I 'd take the first option .
If I had children , it would arguably be immoral not to .
It 's absolute poverty you want to avoid , not relative poverty .
If , as the evidence so far implies , you have to have one or the other in your society , take relative poverty .
You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending their money they create jobs , but because of what they have to do to get rich .
I 'm not talking about the trickle - down effect here .
I 'm not saying that if you let Henry Ford get rich , he 'll hire you as a waiter at his next party .
I 'm saying that he 'll make you a tractor to replace your horse .
Notes
[ 1 ] Part of the reason this subject is so contentious is that some of those most vocal on the subject of wealth — university students , heirs , professors , politicians , and journalists — have the least experience creating it .
( This phenomenon will be familiar to anyone who has overheard conversations about sports in a bar . )
Students are mostly still on the parental dole , and have not stopped to think about where that money comes from .
Heirs will be on the parental dole for life .
Professors and politicians live within socialist eddies of the economy , at one remove from the creation of wealth , and are paid a flat rate regardless of how hard they work .
And journalists as part of their professional code segregate themselves from the revenue - collecting half of the businesses they work for ( the ad sales department ) .
Many of these people never come face to face with the fact that the money they receive represents wealth — wealth that , except in the case of journalists , someone else created earlier .
They live in a world in which income is doled out by a central authority according to some abstract notion of fairness ( or randomly , in the case of heirs ) , rather than given by other people in return for something they wanted , so it may seem to them unfair that things do n't work the same in the rest of the economy .
( Some professors do create a great deal of wealth for society .
But the money they 're paid is n't a quid pro quo .
It 's more in the nature of an investment . )

In the early empire the price of an ordinary adult slave seems to have been about 2,000 sestertii ( e.g. Horace , Sat. ii.7.43 ) .
A servant girl cost 600 ( Martial vi.66 ) , while Columella ( iii.3.8 ) says that a skilled vine - dresser was worth 8,000 .
A doctor , P. Decimus Eros Merula , paid 50,000 sestertii for his freedom ( Dessau , Inscriptiones 7812 ) .
Seneca ( Ep. xxvii .7 ) reports that one Calvisius Sabinus paid 100,000 sestertii apiece for slaves learned in the Greek classics .
Pliny ( Hist. Nat. vii.39 ) says that the highest price paid for a slave up to his time was 700,000 sestertii , for the linguist ( and presumably teacher ) Daphnis , but that this had since been exceeded by actors buying their own freedom .
Classical Athens saw a similar variation in prices .
An ordinary laborer was worth about 125 to 150 drachmae .
Xenophon ( Mem. ii.5 ) mentions prices ranging from 50 to 6,000 drachmae ( for the manager of a silver mine ) .

[ 7 ] One of the biggest divergences between the Daddy Model and reality is the valuation of hard work .
In the Daddy Model , hard work is in itself deserving .
In reality , wealth is measured by what one delivers , not how much effort it costs .
If I paint someone 's house , the owner should n't pay me extra for doing it with a toothbrush .
It will seem to someone still implicitly operating on the Daddy Model that it is unfair when someone works hard and does n't get paid much .
To help clarify the matter , get rid of everyone else and put our worker on a desert island , hunting and gathering fruit .
If he 's bad at it he 'll work very hard and not end up with much food .
Is this unfair ?
Who is being unfair to him ?
[ 8 ] Part of the reason for the tenacity of the Daddy Model may be the dual meaning of " distribution . "
When economists talk about " distribution of income , " they mean statistical distribution .
But when you use the phrase frequently , you can't help associating it with the other sense of the word ( as in e.g. " distribution of alms " ) , and thereby subconsciously seeing wealth as something that flows from some central tap .
The word " regressive " as applied to tax rates has a similar effect , at least on me ; how can anything regressive be good ?

If asked to choose which was more expensive , a well - preserved 1989 Lincoln Town Car ten- passenger limousine ( $ 5,000 ) or a 2004 Mercedes S600 sedan ( $ 122,000 ) , the average Edwardian might well guess wrong .

To say anything meaningful about income trends , you have to talk about real income , or income as measured in what it can buy .
But the usual way of calculating real income ignores much of the growth in wealth over time , because it depends on a consumer price index created by bolting end to end a series of numbers that are only locally accurate , and that do n't include the prices of new inventions until they become so common that their prices stabilize .
So while we might think it was very much better to live in a world with antibiotics or air travel or an electric power grid than without , real income statistics calculated in the usual way will prove to us that we are only slightly richer for having these things .
Another approach would be to ask , if you were going back to the year x in a time machine , how much would you have to spend on trade goods to make your fortune ?
For example , if you were going back to 1970 it would certainly be less than $ 500 , because the processing power you can get for $ 500 today would have been worth at least $ 150 million in 1970 .
The function goes asymptotic fairly quickly , because for times over a hundred years or so you could get all you needed in present - day trash .
In 1800 an empty plastic drink bottle with a screw top would have seemed a miracle of workmanship .
[ 16 ] Some will say this amounts to the same thing , because the rich have better opportunities for education .
That 's a valid point .
It is still possible , to a degree , to buy your kids ' way into top colleges by sending them to private schools that in effect hack the college admissions process .
According to a 2002 report by the National Center for Education Statistics , about 1.7 % of American kids attend private , non-sectarian schools .
At Princeton , 36 % of the class of 2007 came from such schools .
( Interestingly , the number at Harvard is significantly lower , about 28 % . )
Obviously this is a huge loophole .
It does at least seem to be closing , not widening .
Perhaps the designers of admissions processes should take a lesson from the example of computer security , and instead of just assuming that their system can't be hacked , measure the degree to which it is .

Been playing around with the Ideal Budget Calculator over at CNN Money and now I ’m absolutely appalled by the amount of money I spend on food .
What am I ?
A whale ?
I make a decent wage , but my food costs still approach 15 % of my income and often outstripped my meager efforts to save and invest .
And I know I 'm not alone .
While many expenses are fixed , groceries often roam freely over one 's budget like a hurd of buffalo .
With these tips I aim to get out the shot gun and the skinning knife and put an end to this stampede once and for all .
Yeah yeah , every newspaper , magazine , television show , and dog has been telling you to plan your meals , but do you ?
Do you know you can actually live quite frugally with minimal effort ?
As the Hillbilly Housewife discusses in her $ 45 Emergency Menu you can very easily eat a large and varied diet with just a little bit of planning .
Man , just reading these recipes I wish I ate at least this well on what I spend right now .
Bankrate has a nice 20 ways to save on groceries article that I found very useful .
They highlight the fact that you should shop around the edges where the milk , bread , fruits , vegetables , and meats can be found .
These items are not only healthier , but they can actually work out to more meals for the dollar .
Think about it , you can go a lot further with a sack of potatoes than you can with a bag of tator tots .
Likewise a little meal planning will turn a package of hamburger into two or three meals that will end up being half the price of the equivalent frozen dinners and can of Campbell ’s Chunky soup ( can you believe they named it Chunky ?
How un-politically correct . ) .
The classic joke goes something like this : back in soviet Russia your lunch would bring you to work !
Ok , so maybe that is lame .
The point is that you should avoid eating out at all costs ( pun intended ) .
In iamnext 's College Finances : Spend Less on Groceries article they remind us that bringing your lunch is easy , cost effective , and often better smelling and tasting than the alternative ( bankruptcy ) .
Did you know that studies show that for every 30 seconds you spend in a store over 30 minutes you will spend $.50 that you would n't have spent before ?
I have little doubt in my mind that stores take advantage of this by spreading things out as much as possible , moving their location from time to time , and placing all those tasty snacks at the end of each isle .

Ever wonder why your table is not 6 feet tall ?
You'd be less inclined to use it ( Duhh ! ) .
The same is true on the grocery isle .
Marketers know you are more likely to put something at chest level into your cart , so that is where they put the higher margin and more expensive products .
Use the top and bottom shelves to find non-name brand products that are just as good and cost a lot less .
Marketers also know that lots of smart shoppers already ignore their high margin product placements , so they often launch " ugly " brands ( products with ugly wrapping ) to sit on the bottom shelf .
They do n't really care if you spend $ 1.99 or $ 1.29 for that can of soup , just as long as you buy it from them .
Even Dummies know that !
So there you have it .
I hope this helps you .

Michael Morris and Jeff Lowenstein would n't have recognized each other if they 'd met on the street , but that did n't stop them from getting into a shouting match .
The professors had been working together on a research study when a technical glitch inconvenienced Mr. Lowenstein .
He complained in an e-mail , raising Mr. Morris 's ire .
Tempers flared .
" It became very embarrassing later , " says Morris , when it turned out there had been a miscommunication , " but we realized that we could n't blame each other for yelling about it because that 's what we were studying . "
Morris and Lowenstein are among the scholars studying the benefits and dangers of e-mail and other computer - based interactions .
In a world where businesses and friends often depend upon e-mail to communicate , scholars want to know if electronic communications convey ideas clearly .
The answer , the professors conclude , is sometimes " no . "
Though e-mail is a powerful and convenient medium , researchers have identified three major problems .
First and foremost , e-mail lacks cues like facial expression and tone of voice .
That makes it difficult for recipients to decode meaning well .
Second , the prospect of instantaneous communication creates an urgency that pressures e-mailers to think and write quickly , which can lead to carelessness .
Finally , the inability to develop personal rapport over e-mail makes relationships fragile in the face of conflict .
In effect , e-mail cannot adequately convey emotion .
A recent study by Profs .
Justin Kruger of New York University and Nicholas Epley of the University of Chicago focused on how well sarcasm is detected in electronic messages .
Their conclusion :
Not only do e-mail senders overestimate their ability to communicate feelings , but e-mail recipients also overestimate their ability to correctly decode those feelings .
One reason for this , the business - school professors say , is that people are egocentric .
They assume others experience stimuli the same way they do .
Also , e-mail lacks body language , tone of voice , and other cues - making it difficult to interpret emotion .
" A typical e-mail has this feature of seeming like face - to - face communication , " Professor Epley says .
" It 's informal and it 's rapid , so you assume you 're getting the same paralinguistic cues you get from spoken communication . "
To avoid miscommunication , e-mailers need to look at what they write from the recipient 's perspective , Epley says .
One strategy : Read it aloud in the opposite way you intend , whether serious or sarcastic .
If it makes sense either way , revise .
Or , do n't rely so heavily on e-mail .
Because e-mails can be ambiguous , " criticism , subtle intentions , emotions are better carried over the phone , " he says .
E-mail 's ambiguity has special implications for minorities and women , because it tends to feed the preconceptions of a recipient .
" You sign your e-mail with a name that people can use to make inferences about your ethnicity , " says Epley .
A misspelling in a black colleague 's e-mail may be seen as ignorance , whereas a similar error by a white colleague might be excused as a typo .
If you 're vulnerable to this kind of unintentional prejudice , pick up the phone : People are much less likely to prejudge after communicating by phone than they are after receiving an e-mail .
Kruger and Epley demonstrated this when they asked 40 women at Cornell to administer a brief interview , 20 by phone and 20 by e-mail .
They then asked a third group of 20 , the " targets , " to answer the phone interviewers ' questions .
They sent a transcription of the targets ' answers to the e-mail interviewers .
The professors then handed each interviewer what they said was a photo of her subject .
In reality , each got a picture of either an Asian or an African - American woman ( in reality , all were white ) .
E-mail interviewers who thought the sender was Asian considered her social skills to be poor , while those who believed the sender was black considered her social skills to be excellent .
In stark contrast , the difference in perceived sociability almost completely disappeared when interviewer and target had talked on the phone .
E -mail tends to be short and to the point .
This may arise from the time pressures we feel when writing them :
We know e-mail arrives as soon as we send it , so we feel we should write it quickly , too .
On the other hand , letters depend on postal timetables .
A letter writer feels he has a bigger window of time to think and write .
Psychologists Massimo Bertacco and Antonella Deponte call this characteristic " speed facilitation , " and they believe it influences our episodic memory - our ability to recall events .
They found that e-mailers wrote shorter messages and were less likely to " ground their communications " in memories of shared experience than letters writers were .
The brevity of e-mail and the absence of audiovisual cues can endanger business and personal relationships unless e-mail is supplemented with the rapport that comes from more personal communication .
" Rapport creates a buffer of positive regard , " says Professor Morris , " and when it 's not there negotiation becomes brittle , vulnerable to falling apart . "
Morris , who studies negotiation at Columbia , led a study that found that negotiators exchange more than three times the information in face - to - face interactions as they do via e-mail .
Though Morris and his colleagues concluded that e-mail lets negotiators make " more complex , multiple - issue offers , " they ultimately built less rapport , thereby increasing tensions and lowering the average economic value of the agreements .
Rapport " is an interpersonal resonance of emotional expression , " Morris says , " involving synchronous gesture , laughing , and smiling together .
Once this rapport exists , it 's a buffer against a moment in the negotiation when there 's some friction . "
This buffer is hard to develop without speaking over the phone or in person .
Those who negotiated by e-mail in Morris 's study trusted each other less and were n't as interested in working together again .
But the pitfalls of e-mail interaction were easily overcome by a single phone call .
Morris ran a second round of negotiations , all conducted via e-mail , but made half of the corresponding pairs chat on the phone before negotiating - " just for five or 10 minutes , " Morris explains , " and the key thing is we told them , ' Do n't get into the issues .
It 's just an icebreaker . ' "
The result was dramatically improved agreements .
So if you want to buy something on Craig 's List , Morris says , " make a brief phone call , even if it 's not practical to do the whole negotiation by phone .
You can establish a favorable bias with someone and then proceed in a less rich medium , but it 's very hard to just get right into the negotiation on a medium that is n't rich . "
This year IAVA is reinventing Veterans Day .
The IAVA SAV March is a first of its kind virtual parade across this beautiful country .
On November 11th , all of our mini parades combined will virtually take us from coast to coast for a combined 2.093 miles .
Grab your flags , invite your friends , and make plans now .
He was interviewed following a speech on the theme of business innovation organised by Italian student groups and the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University .
Schmidt also said his company was working on how to allow users to maintain basic control of their personal data .
Currently , Google stores consumer data on hundreds of thousands of its own computers in order to provide additional services to individual users .
The company is looking to allow consumers to export their web search history or email archives and move them to other sites , if they so choose .
" We are working to ensure that as long as it is yours , we want to give you the equivalent of number portability , " Schmidt said at another conference earlier this week .
Portability is a government - mandated program that allows consumers to retain their mobile phone numbers when they switch carriers .
This undertaking is both a recognition of users ' right to control their personal information , an effort to head off regulatory action and a response to an increasing trend on the internet toward openness rather than exclusivity , he said .
" Data should never be held hostage .
We might as well get ahead of it before a law gets passed forcing us to do that . "
Google is experimenting with delivering text , brand - image and video ads onto small - screen mobile phones .
It is enjoying early success in its strategy to win phone network allies in Japan , where TV viewing and shopping on phones is advanced , he said .
The Google executive said his own company had no plans to directly give away phones itself , nor is he aware of any effort by partners such as phone makers Nokia or Motorola or mobile operators like Vodafone to make such a radical move , he said .
Schmidt acknowledged that mobile phones may never become totally free to the consumer .
Newspapers are still not completely free a hundred years after they started relying on advertising , but they certainly are inexpensive , he noted .
The company , which will derive virtually all of its expected $ US10 billion ( $ A13.04 billion ) in revenue this year from selling text ads to computer users who use Google to search the web , has said previously it expected mobile phone advertising to match computer - based ad revenue over time .

Bigger babies tend to be more healthy
A team at the University of Newcastle upon Tyne studied nearly 1,000 women and their newborn babies .
Low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of serious health problems , including respiratory disorders and diabetes .
The research is published in the British Journal of Nutrition .
FOLATE
Also known as folic acid , or Vitamin B9 Found in vegetables ( broccoli , spinach ) , fruit ( oranges , grapefruits ) and wholemeal products like bread or cereals Recommended intake is 200 micrograms per day Women are advised to take an additional 400 micrograms a day before conception and during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy
Women are already advised to take folic acid supplements if trying to conceive , and through the early weeks of pregnancy as the vitamin is known to reduce the risk of neural tube defects such as spina bifida .
But this is the first time the vitamin has been linked to birth weight .
Smoking factor
The Newcastle team say their work adds weight to the argument that bread and cereals should be routinely fortified with folic acid .
They found pregnant women who smoked were more likely to have lower levels of folate in their blood - which might explain why women who smoke often have lighter babies .
It is estimated that around 7 % of all babies born in the UK are low birth weight - defined as less than 2.4kg ( 5.5lbs ) .
THE BENEFITS Ruth Reckitt took folic acid before and during pregnancy
She had twins : Jude was 2.6kg ( 5 lb 10 oz ) and Nell was 2.9 kg ( 6lb7oz )
Ruth said : " I knew that folic acid was good for me and my babies in many ways . "
Medical evidence suggests that folic acid influences birth weight because it is an essential nutrient for growth and plays a role in gene expression in the foetus .
The researchers say smoking is likely to reduce a women 's folate levels because it may alter the ability of the cell to metabolise and ultimately store the vitamin .
Lead researcher Dr Caroline Relton said : " Folic acid is highly important in preventing birth defects which affect a small number of pregnancies .
" This study suggests that it is also important in every pregnancy to help the developing baby reach a healthy birth weight .
" However , many women are missing this critical window in the first few weeks of gestation during which their baby really needs folic acid to grow and develop .
" The evidence from this study strengthens the argument for fortifying everyday foods like bread and cereals with folic acid .
FORTIFICATION
The Food Standards Agency has opposed fortification of foodstuffs with folic acid
It is concerned increasing the amount of folic acid we eat could make it harder to spot a deficiency of vitamin B12 , which can lead to neurological damage
The FSA will reconsider its position after an investigation by a top team of scientists reports on the issue later this year
" Fortifying a range of foods promises to be a more effective solution than a campaign to encourage women to take folic acid supplements .
" Our previous research shows younger women and those from deprived backgrounds are less likely to take these supplements , and although some cereals are currently fortified in the UK , they tend to be the more expensive , brand - name products . "
Dr Robert Frazer , an expert in obstetrics at Royal Hallamshire Hospital , Sheffield , told the BBC News website more work was required to prove cause and effect .
He said low levels of folate were also associated with a poor diet in general , which might have a negative effect on a baby 's growth .
But he said : " There is already a strong case for fortification of flour to prevent neural tube defects , and if it turns out that higher levels of folate are also associated with improved growth rates for the baby , then that would be important as well . "

Copying class notes after the fact is a time - consuming way to study for an exam , but it was the only thing that truly worked for me back in college .
But next week I 'll be in a classroom again for the first time in 8 years , pen poised over notebook , and this time I 'm going to perfect a strategy that gets my notes right the first time : the Cornell Note - taking method .

We 've mentioned the Cornell method in passing here and there , but today we 'll dive deep into how to transcribe a lecture in a way that makes studying and cross-references a breeze throughout the semester - no copying involved .
Cornell Notetaking Method I wish I 'd had a system in place for my own notetaking when I was a student .

Lay out your page for the Cornell Method
Using the Cornell method , you split your notes page into three sections , as shown below .
Notes column ( right )
Record the lecture here during class using short sentences and fragments that transcribe the facts you 'll need .
Eliminate all unnecessary words .
Use bulleted lists for easy skimming , and as much shorthand as possible ( without sacrificing readability . )
Develop a vocabulary of abbreviations you always use , like " ex " for " for example , " " v. " for " very , " " tho " for " though , " " 1st " and " 2nd " for " first and second . "
Finally , leave lots of whitespace between points and paragraphs so you can go back and fill in sections later .

Study and review your Cornell - formatted notes
The Cornell Note - taking method 's creator , Walter Pauk , outlined a six - step study system to use along with this note format .
The BYU web site breaks down the 6 R's : Record , Reduce , Recite , Reflect , Review and Recapitulate .
While those steps are worth a read , personally I think this system boils down even further .
Advertisement
In short , once you 've attended class and filled in the notes area , that evening , review them and fill in the cues and summary area .
When the time comes to study for an exam , read through your notes .
To quiz yourself , cover up the right side and use the cues on the left to jog your memory and help you rebuild the factual narrative in your mind .
When you 've got a paper to write , use the summary section of each notes page to flip through and find relevant facts to cite in your paper .
In essence , with the Cornell method , instead of straight transcription , you 're creating your study guide as you go instead of waiting till it 's time to cram for the test .

Scientists ’ interest in religion seems to come in waves .
One arrived after the publication of Darwin ’s Origin of Species in 1859 .
Another followed in the 1930s and 1940s , inspired by surprising revelations from quantum mechanics , which suggested the insufficiency of conventional physical theories of the universe .
And now scientists are once again writing about religion , apparently provoked this time by the controversy surrounding intelligent design .
During the last year , a number of popular books on religion by scientists or philosophers of science have appeared .
Daniel Dennett kicked things off with his Breaking the Spell ( 2006 ) , an investigation into the possibility of a science of religion .
Reviewing evolutionary , psychological , and economic theories of the origin and spread of belief , Dennett covered much ground but reached few conclusions .
In the last few months , three prominent scientists — all biologists — have published their own books on belief .
Richard Dawkins , the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University , has given us The God Delusion , an extended polemic against faith , which will be considered at length below .
Lewis Wolpert , an eminent developmental biologist at University College London , has just published Six Impossible Things Before Breakfast , a pleasant , though rambling , look at the biological basis of belief .
While the book focuses on our ability to form causal beliefs about everyday matters ( the wind moved the trees , for example ) , it spends considerable time on the origins of religious and moral beliefs .
Wolpert defends the unusual idea that causal thinking is an adaptation required for tool - making .
Religious beliefs can thus be seen as an odd extension of causal thinking about technology to more mysterious matters .
Only a species that can reason causally could assert that “ this storm was sent by God because we sinned . ”
While Wolpert ’s attitude toward religion is tolerant , he ’s an atheist who seems to find religion more puzzling than absorbing .
Joan Roughgarden , on the other hand , is sold on religion .
An evolutionary biologist at Stanford University and a recent convert to Christianity , she attempts in Evolution and Christian Faith both to explain evolutionary biology to fellow believers — laying out what is known , what is speculative , and what is unknown — and to discuss what the Bible has to say on matters relevant to evolution .
These are ambitious aims , particularly for so brief a book , and Roughgarden ’s own views — that , as she writes , “ what evolutionary biologists are finding through their research and thinking actually promotes a Christian view of nature ” — are not supported by sufficiently detailed arguments .
1 .
Among these books , Dawkins ’s The God Delusion stands out for two reasons .
First , it ’s by far the most ambitious .
While Wolpert and Roughgarden preach to the choir — each has his or her own audience , rationalist and religious , respectively — Dawkins is on a mission to convert .
He is an enemy of religion , wants to explain why , and hopes thereby to drive the beast to extinction .
Second , Dawkins has succeeded in grabbing the public ’s attention in a …
What if New York had its own currency ?
In a sense , it already does .
Our dollar looks the same as the better - known U.S. version , but it does n’t go nearly as far here as anywhere else .
How much is it really worth ?
Based on a few scientifically imprecise calculations , a New York dollar would lag somewhere behind a Canadian buck .
Here ’s why :
HOUSING
A 2002 study by Michael H. Schill , then a professor at New York University Law School , concluded that a host of factors — regulations , zoning , unions , the building code — made the cost of building a home one - third higher in New York City than in 21 other cities .
Nationwide , housing and shelter eat up 42 percent of a typical consumer ’s disposable income .
For a buyer to acquire New York housing that ’s equivalent in quality to the same type elsewhere , he would have to use 56 percent of his disposable income .
The New York dollar loses 14 cents : 86 cents .
TAXES
An annual study by the city of Washington , D.C. , compares tax burdens in large cities .
A hypothetical family of four living on $ 150,000 in New York would pay the nation ’s highest combination of sales , auto , income , and property taxes : about $ 22,635 , or 15.1 percent of income .
By comparison , the national median is $ 14,219 , or 9.5 percent .
That ’s another $ 8,416 extra per year here , or another 5.6 cents .
Our dollar is down to 80.4 cents .
BASIC COSTS
The Bureau of Labor Statistics says overall prices here are 9.9 percent higher than the rest of the country .
Remove the premium New Yorkers pay for housing and the currency is debased another 4.4 cents , to 76 cents .
LIFESTYLE COSTS
Less quantifiable is the price of status , which tends to matter more in New York than elsewhere .
You might be the best - dressed guy at a Minneapolis cocktail party rocking a Hugo Boss suit ( $ 695 ) from Macy ’s , but it might take a Thom Browne suit from Barneys ( $ 4,330 ) to do the trick here .
While these costs are difficult to measure , it is possible to calculate the added price of living in a city with the best of everything .
Yes , we have better art , food , and entertainment , but you ’ll pay a premium for access to it .
Here , a side - by - side look at lifestyle purchases in Minneapolis — a city with a statistically average cost of living yet some semblance of a cultural life — and New York :
Baseball tickets
Twins premium seats … . . $ 24
Yankee loge box seats … . . $ 50
Museum admission
Walker Art Center … … … $ 8
MoMA … … … … … … $ 20
Movie ticket
The Prestige , St. Anthony Main Theater . . $ 8
The Science of Sleep , BAM . . $ 10
Prix fixe dinner at top restaurant
La Belle Vie … . . $ 80 a person
Per Se… … … .
$ 210 a person
Annual gym membership
Minneapolis Life Time Athletic Club . .
$ 1,439.40
Equinox … … … … … $ 1,895
Marathon entry fees
Minneapolis … … … … . $ 85
New York … … … … … $ 116
Bottom line ?
On average , these life - enhancing amenities cost 85 percent more here than in Minneapolis .
If we assume that the average American deploys 8 percent of total income on such indulgences , a New Yorker will spend 14.8 cents of every dollar on them .
Now we ’re down to 61.2 cents .
WAGES
New York is a high - wage town , up and down the income scale .
Mercer Human Resource Consulting notes that a job that pays $ 30,000 on a national median will pay $ 36,720 in New York , compared with $ 27,840 in Birmingham , Alabama .
According to The American Lawyer , a first - year associate at Manhattan ’s Cravath , Swaine & Moore can expect to make $ 145,000 , while those at Dorsey & Whitney in Minneapolis can expect just $ 105,000 , 28 percent less .
Assuming the wage premium in New York is a generous 15 percent , you add back 15 cents .
Now the New York dollar is worth 76.2 cents .
These cold calculations omit some other important factors , like ambition .
Here in Gotham , a junior banker can aspire to a partnership at Goldman Sachs ; a first - year associate lawyer to a partnership at Cravath ; a waitressing actress to Broadway .
Any of these dreams , if realized , will bring outsize psychic and financial rewards that simply are n’t available in Minneapolis .
And then there are the intangibles .
What price do you place on jogging around the reservoir in Central Park ?
On the Union Square Greenmarket ?
On home delivery of Vietnamese food ?
If the value of a dollar were the only consideration , the vast majority of New Yorkers would be better off in Saginaw , Michigan ; Portsmouth , Ohio ; and Rock Island , Illinois — cities with the most salubrious combination of low costs and comparatively high wages , according to Salary.com .
In that survey , New York ranks dead last .
But how many college graduates are moving to Rock Island this year ?
The “ crap scientific theory du jour ” October 17 , 2006
The “ crap scientific theory du jour ” is that the human species could eventually split into two subspecies of the beautiful rich and the fugly poor .
On the surface of it , in a capitalist society , you can get where they are coming from .
But it does n’t make it a sound theory yet “ Time ” , “ BBC ” and all our local newspapers report it verbatim .
The theory :
With the rich and highly educated marrying the beautiful ( which I do not deny ) you get a genetic run of thin , tall , pretty , rich and ( supposedly ) well - educated people .
The rest of the ‘ tat ’ shag each other senseless producing ugly , dumpy , thick offspring .
I do n’t really care about the egotism or snobbery involved here so I wo n’t bother hammering on about that .
Also , no qualified scientist I , but immediately a theory hole big enough for an articulated truck , the international space station and Oprah on one of her binges to pass through simultaneously presents itself : plastic surgery .
As the ability to change radically one ’s appearance continues to decrease so the concept of this perfect gene pool becomes sulied and ultimately no big difference occur .
Add to this that more and more surveys indicate that both spouses cheat , producing illegitimate children all over the place and the theory bubbles over the edge of the pot and douses any sort of sensible flame keeping it going .
Typical reporting : that will make a great headline , to buggery that it ’s a load of old toot by an idiot with a qualification and a lust for limelight .
Dr. Curry should be ashamed or at least well paid for producing it .
At least the BBC mentined in their piece who the report was commissioned for : mens satellite TV channel “ Bravo ” .
Well known for their scientific credentials and insightful programming .
These are the people who bring you “ Project Runway ” , “ Top Chef ” and “ Celebrity Poker Showdown ” .

The Electric Wallpaper Company , c/o VisionTV , 80 Bond Street , Toronto , Ontario , Canada , M5B 1X2 , 87 minute DVD , web site : www.endofsuburbia.com, US$ 27.75 / C$ 34.50A simple fact of life is that any system based on the use of nonrenewable resources is unsustainable .
Despite all the warnings that we are headed for an ecological and environmental perfect storm , many Americans are oblivious to the flashing red light on the earth 's fuel gauge .
Many feel the " American way of life " is an entitlement that operates outside the laws of nature .
At the Earth Summit in 1992 , George H W Bush forcefully declared , " The American way of life is not negotiable " .
That way of life requires a highly disproportionate use of the world 's nonrenewable resources .
While only containing four percent of the world population , the United States consumes 25 % of the world 's oil .
The centerpiece of that way of life is suburbia .
And massive amounts of nonrenewable fuels are required to maintain the project of suburbia .
The suburban lifestyle is considered by many Americans to be an accepted and normal way of life .
But is this sprawling and energy - intensive lifestyle sustainable ?
Few people are aware of how their lives are dependent on cheap and abundant energy .
It suggests many Americans may be in for a rude awakening .
In a fascinating new documentary , The End of Suburbia - Oil Depletion and the Collapse of the American Dream , the central question is this :
Does the suburban way of life have a future ?
The answer is a resounding no .
Despite the serious subject matter the documentary is actually quite engaging and entertaining .
Not only is it informative for those already familiar with the issues ; it 's also quite accessible and enlightening for the uninitiated .
It serves as great introduction and a real eye - opener for people who are largely unfamiliar with the topic of energy depletion and the impact it will have on their lives and communities .
The End of Suburbia marshals an impressive array of evidence that the growing energy demands of the " American dream " in suburbia will eclipse our planet 's ability to provide it .
The suburban way of life will soon become economically and ecologically impossible to maintain .
We will see the inevitable collapse of the suburban lifestyle and the end of the American Dream .
And it will happen within our lifetimes .
How bad will it get ?
Put it this way .
We may be looking at the mother of all downsizings .
For those who are familiar with the issues of peak oil and resource depletion , the usual suspects are here .
They include Richard Heinberg , Michael Klare , Matthew Simmons , Michael C Ruppert , Julian Darley , Dr Colin Campbell , and Kenneth Deffeyes , among others .
All of these individuals provide valuable information and insights concerning the coming energy crisis and the impact it will have on the lives of people on the North American continent .
But the standout star of the film is author and critic of contemporary culture , James Howard Kunstler .
The sometimes humorous and always entertaining presence of Kunstler is prominent throughout the documentary - and for good reason .
He grabs your attention .
He explains in refreshingly blunt , easy - to - comprehend language that suburbia is screwed .
Kunstler calls the project of suburbia " the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world " and says " America has squandered its wealth in a living arrangement that has no future " .
You immediately get the idea he 's not exactly a fan of suburbia .
How and why did this happen ?
The End of Suburbia outlines the seemingly rational and logical impulse behind the project of suburbia , tracing the beginnings to the late 19th century when it was originally envisioned as an alternative to city life and an escape from the hideous aspects of industrialism .
Modern suburbia traces its beginnings to just after World War II when the suburban project took off with a massive housing boom and the increasing dominance of the automotive industry .
This car - centered suburban project ended up being the template for the massive development of the second half of the 20th century .
That project was wrapped up , packaged , and sold to the American public as " The American Dream " .
The End of Suburbia points out that the rise of the suburbs was made possible by abundant and cheap oil .
It allowed for a lifestyle where millions of people can live many miles away from where they work and where they shop for food and necessities .
But the voracious and expanding energy needs of our industrial society with its ever - expanding consumer culture and increasingly affluent suburban lifestyles are brushing up against the disturbing reality of finite energy resources .
The biggest impact will be felt by those who currently live in the sprawling suburbs of North America .
The End of Suburbia also makes clear that the effects of energy depletion go way beyond paying more at the pump .
It will come down to the question of how you will feed yourself and your family .
Although the documentary mostly avoids the gloom and doom of some peak oil theorists , it does occasionally touch on some of the darker aspects of fossil fuel depletion , notably how it will impact food production .
The film briefly looks at the energy - intensive process needed to bring food to supermarkets .
Our modern industrial agriculture relies heavily on petroleum for pesticides and natural gas for fertilizer , not to mention the energy used in planting , growing , harvesting , irrigating , packaging , processing and transporting the food .
The End of Suburbia shows how the suburban way of life has become normalized and reveals the enormous effort currently put forth to maintain it .
On a foreign policy level , it means continued aggressive attempts to secure access to the remaining reserves of oil on the planet in order to prop up and maintain this lifestyle .
But the film makes it crystal clear that suburban living has very poor prospects for the future .
Any attempt to maintain it will be futile .
Kunstler asserts that the suburbs will become " the slums of the future " .
What about alternative sources of energy ?
The End of Suburbia points out that no combination of alternative fuels can run and maintain our current system as it is now .
What about hydrogen , you ask ?
The film does a great job of shooting down the hysterical applause for hydrogen .
The idea of a hydrogen economy is mostly fantasy .
Hydrogen is not a form of energy .
It is a form of energy storage .
It takes more energy to make hydrogen than you actually get from hydrogen .
Same with ethanol .
It is a net energy loser .
It takes more gasoline to create and fertilize the corn and convert it to alcohol than you get from burning it .
The documentary explores the potential alternatives and comes to the conclusion there is no combination of any alternatives that will allow us to continue consuming the way we do .
What is in our future ?
The consensus from the experts in The End of Suburbia is the suburbs will not survive the end of cheap and easily accessible oil and natural gas .
The massive downscaling of America - voluntary or involuntary - will be the trend of the future .
Kunstler argues we can expect to see " globalization " to reverse itself in the 21st century and he says one of the most important tasks will be to prepare for a very different way of life .
The imminent decline of industrial civilization means we 'll have to organize human communities in a much different fashion from the completely unsustainable , highly - centralized , earth - destroying , globalized system we have now .
There will need to be a move to much smaller , human - scale , localized and decentralized systems that can sustain themselves within their own landbase .
While The End of Suburbia does n't provide any easy answers , it does provide a much needed look at the reality of the situation many in North America will be facing in the coming years .
For that reason , The End of Suburbia is one of the most important must - see documentaries of the year .

In the last days of the Vietnam war , Hue Pham and his wife Hue Tran spent two perilous weeks on a cramped container ship , adrift with no food and little water in the South China Sea .
The couple survived this desperate flight from Vietnam , built a new life in America , and then , three decades later , decided to take a Caribbean cruise on a ship called the Carnival Destiny .
This was the boat journey that they would not survive .
The facts of the couple 's disappearance , as the Destiny sailed between Barbados and Aruba on May 12 2005 , are few .
After a fruitless on - board search , the ship eventually retraced its path , joined by the US coastguard .
No trace of their bodies was ever found .
For the relatives , the deaths left a terrible , insoluble puzzle .
Their son , Son Michael Pham , maintained that his parents had no reason to take their own lives and were in fact planning a trip back to Vietnam , and were looking forward to meeting relatives again .
" Two American citizens with no personal or financial problems , no serious health problems , living the happiest time of their lives , both vanished without a trace or witness , " he later told an inquiry .
The cruise had been a Mother 's Day gift to the couple , and they were on board ship with their daughter and granddaughter .
" I immediately flew down to California , went through their home , and tried to find one clue , something unusual .
I could not , " Son Michael says now .
Since then , with the help of two other bereaved families , Son Michael has helped establish a group called the International Cruise Victims .
In the past weeks , he has been offering his help to yet another family , after the QE2 sailed into Southampton on January 2 this year one passenger short .
Officially , Hampshire police are still investigating how a 62 - year - old German woman , so far identified only as Sabine L , disappeared from a new - year cruise aboard the QE2 somewhere off Madeira .
Her family has launched its own website appealing for help ( www.qe2missing.de).
But the full truth of Sabine L's last moments on the luxury Cunard liner is unlikely ever to be firmly established - beyond the cold fact that she joins more than 30 passengers who , in the past four years , have mysteriously disappeared from cruise ships worldwide .
Last year the cruise industry reported that 24 passengers had disappeared between 2003 and last March .
The information emerged after a US Congressional subcommittee found itself with an unlikely task : to examine the threat posed to citizens by booking a cruise holiday .
Since then , at least 10 more passengers and two crew have been reported missing or overboard , including one Scottish pensioner lost in the Atlantic last November .
These figures do not include known suicides and those who , for one or reason or another - a drunken argument , perhaps , or misplaced bravado - are known to have deliberately jumped .
Of those who have gone mysteriously missing , some may have killed themselves ; other incidents may be alcohol - related mishaps ; but in at least one case , the death of a 52 - year - old woman on the Island Escape in Italy , something more sinister may have gone on .
The FBI is still investigating that case .
After hearing details of those who had gone missing on board ships , subcommittee chairman , Christopher Shays , a Republican congressman , warned of a " growing manifest of unexplained disappearances , unsolved crimes and brazen acts of lawlessness on the high seas " .
Like small cities , he said , cruise ships experienced crimes .
" But city dwellers know the risks of urban life - and no one falls off a city never to be heard of again . "
Going on a cruise was , he said , perhaps " the perfect way to commit the perfect crime " .
There was no evidence of foul play in the disappearance of " M " , a 40 - year - old woman , from Celebrity Cruise Line 's Mercury .
But then , there was precious little evidence at all - and what did emerge was largely due to the persistence of her father , Kendall Carver , a former company CEO , who spent tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees and private investigators in an attempt to discover the truth about her disappearance .
( Carver has asked the Guardian not to use his daughter 's name , to protect the privacy of other family members . )
Carver says it was on the second day of the Mercury 's cruise to Alaska in August 2004 that a cabin steward realised that M's room had not been slept in and reported her absence to his boss , who told him he would deal with it .
Throughout the cruise , the steward continued to place chocolates on the pillow of the unused bed , as he was ordered to do , but no one saw M again .
At the end of the cruise , when the ship docked in Vancouver and all passengers disembarked , M's belongings were packed away .
No one notified the police or her family .
It was only after her father filed a missing person 's report that police discovered that she had disappeared from a cruise ship .
Kendall Carver 's loss was , he says , made worse by a lack of cooperation from the cruise line .
At one point , Celebrity Cruise Line issued a statement in which it called the death a horrible tragedy , and added that " regrettably , there is very little a cruise line , a resort or a hotel can do to prevent someone from committing suicide " .
As Carver points out , the case is still open and his daughter has not been declared dead by the family or the FBI - in his belief , suicide is neither the only nor the most likely explanation .
Celebrity Cruise Line , however , now says : " There is probably nothing we or any company could do that would make the parents feel the company had acted sensitively enough . "
Today , all the company 's passengers pass a computerised checkout at the end of a cruise .
Whatever the truth of what happened , M's case starkly underlines a fact that cruise passengers , potentially thousands of miles from home , should be well aware of : out at sea , there are no police .
It is extremely difficult for any detective to piece together a murder case without a body , and chances of finding a passenger dumped into the ocean are slim indeed .
And while all cruise ships employ security officers , they do not always seal off crime scenes , detain suspects and interview witnesses in the manner that might be expected of them .
Two cases in particular have gripped the US and Australia respectively : the disappearance of honeymooner George Smith [ see below ] and the death of mother of three Dianne Brimble .
The story of Smith , presumed to have gone overboard from the superliner Brilliance of the Seas less than 10 days into his married life , was lapped up by US television networks .
First there was the young , well - connected victim and his telegenic , grieving widow opening up on talkshows ; then family rifts and media - friendly forensic investigators added to the drama .
The details of Brimble 's end , left drugged and naked to die on P&O Australia 's Pacific Sky , emerged in the more low - key surroundings of a New South Wales coroner 's court .
But both cases have been marked by questions over how well initial investigations were handled , by angry allegations from families and rebuttals from cruise lines , and an increased public perception that something was seriously amiss .
Unlike many in the grim litany of victims ' tales , Dianne Brimble did not disappear .
Brimble , 42 , from Brisbane , had saved for two years to go on a cruise with her sister and their daughters .
But by the end of the first night of her holiday in September 2002 , she was lying naked , drugged and dying on the floor of a cabin , ignored and ridiculed by the men who had left her there .
A toxicology report would later show that Brimble had died of an overdose of gamma - hydroxybutyrate , a party drug also known as fantasy , GHB , GBH or liquid ecstasy , and often described as a date - rape drug .
Brimble , her family told Australian TV , did n't even like to take Panadol .
By the time police met the boat in the South Pacific island of Noumea to investigate , the male passengers had been back in to the cabin to tidy up .
No one has been charged in relation to her death , and it took more than three years for the details of her story to emerge at the coroner 's inquest , which reopens next month in Australia .
Eight men were identified as " persons of interest " in the investigation .
Photographs retrieved from a digital camera would reveal that before her death at least one man had sex with Brimble ; photographs were taken even when she was passed out naked on the floor .
The Brimble inquest highlighted a cruise culture far from old - fashioned ideas of shuffle - board , after - dinner dances and G&Ts at the captain 's table .
At one point an advert for P&O cruises was produced in court : a postcard showing a line of sunbathing women and bearing the slogan , " Seamen wanted " .
P&O 's lawyers protested that the cruise line was not on trial .
But the coroner ruled it was admiss - ible evidence ; Brimble , she said , did not die in a vacuum .
If the behaviour of eight " persons of interest " had attracted complaints - a photo of one showed him running naked through the ship on the night of Brimble 's death - ship security officers would reveal that finding drunk , naked people on deck was a relatively common occurrence .
It is just not deaths and disappearances that are a problem on cruise ships .
According to crime statistics supplied to the Congressional hearings by 15 of the biggest lines , covering around 85 % of cruise holidays worldwide , there were 178 reports of sexual assault on cruise ships between 2003 and 2005 .
FBI representatives testified to their belief that the figures were under- reported - and further documents recently obtained under court order by a Miami lawyer , James Walker , show that Royal Caribbean alone , which carries around 25 % of cruise passengers , recorded more than 100 complaints of sexual assault and sexual battery within that time span .
Some British and American security officers claim that the real picture is even worse .
Geoff Furlong , an ex-detective from Liverpool who worked for six years as a security officer for two cruise lines , says : " It does n't matter what the class of ship is .
Young women are particularly susceptible - particularly from crew members .
They hunt in packs . "
He claims often to have discovered crew targeting young female passengers .
" Say I came across the situation : the guy would be up before the captain at the next port of call and thrown off the ship at his own expense , to repatriate him to Costa Rica , or wherever , " he says .
" That was all that happened - there was never any police involvement . "
If passengers complained , they were bought off , he says , " given champagne , free holidays , told about the consequences of going to court , how it would bring shame on their families " .
Such complaints , he says , would frequently not even be logged .
" The cruise companies just want it to go away , " says Randy Jaques , an American security officer .
He claims personally to have dealt with more than 50 complaints , and says hundreds of women have signed " Jane Doe agreements " - meaning they have reached an out - of - court settlement with the cruise lines and signed a confidentiality clause .
Passengers can find themselves in a complex legal situation , potentially under numerous jurisdictions when sailing abroad .
With many cruise ships registered under flags of convenience with relatively slack tax and labour regimes , the relevant laws might be those of Panama , the Bahamas or Bermuda .
Prosecuting , say , a sacked crew member who has returned to his own country brings a whole new dimension of complexity .
Charles Lipcon , a Miami lawyer who has built a 30 - year career on suing cruise lines , says his firm does not normally take on cases without a clear jurisdiction .
" What I 've seen over the years is that it 's a hot potato for everyone , and nothing much gets done , " he says .
In the US , Son Michael Pham 's victim - support organisation has persuaded two members of congress to sponsor a bill , the Cruise Line Accurate Safety Statistics
Act , to put more of an onus on cruise lines to prevent and report crimes at sea .
James
Walker believes that many are unreported , and points out that crew members are far more at risk than passengers .
" You do n't have young Filipino women who have been sexually abused calling in to the guest claims department , " he says .
In fact , convictions of either employees or passengers are virtually unheard of .
" People call and say they are confident that the FBI can solve their crime , " he says .
" We say , ' Well , if it happens with this cruise line , it will be the first time in their history . ' "
Cruise lines , meanwhile , have been at pains to stress that ships are inherently safe , self - contained environments .
In the context of millions of passengers each year , the number of missing people and reported sexual assaults compares well with statistics on land , they say ; crimes such as robbery are negligible .
William Giddons , director of the UK's Passenger Shipping Association , representing the cruise industry , says : " The occurrence is so rare , anything that happens on a cruise ship is news .
Because we 're such a high - profile industry , it 's something we have to live with .
Compare us with a resort or a hotel , where there is virtually no security at all .
" I can't sit here and tell you that all crimes are reported - but the rules are very strict that they should be .
They certainly will be now , if [ they were n't ] in the past . "
Changes are indeed being made .
Drug- and terror - related concerns have seen airport - style security introduced at ports , complete with x-ray machines and sniffer dogs .
The on - board culture on " fun ships " may be changing , too : in Australia , a beleaguered P&O has increased CCTV , stopped 24 - hour drinking , and scrapped its notorious " schoolies cruises " , which often saw unruly passengers expelled on South Pacific islands .
Its ill - fated ship , the Pacific Sky - now linked to four premature passenger deaths through accidents and illness in as many years - has been sold off .
The industry still has some PR work to do , though : disappearances and assaults aside , it has been beset by a roll - call of blights in recent years .
Last year one man died when fire swept through cabins on a Caribbean cruise , and passengers feared for their lives as another cruise ship blazed in the English Channel .
Cunard 's Queen Mary 2 was recently the scene of a very public passenger mutiny after propeller troubles cut every stop from the cruise itinerary .
Other cruises have been hit by the norovirus : a highly contagious sickness with symptoms including diarrhoea , stomach cramps and violent projectile vomiting .
Some older British people had to be stretchered off one ship when it returned to Hull , and at one point successive outbreaks of the virus confined the world 's newest , biggest megaliner , the Freedom of the Seas , to port .
In late 2005 , the luxurious Seabourn Spirit even found itself having to face down pirates with rocket launchers .
The industry has also run into problems on environmental grounds .
In Alaska , where only ships with advanced waste purification systems are allowed to sail , a referendum has led to the tightening of controls and a rise in taxes on cruise ships .
Meanwhile , Californian ports , under the newly green leadership of Arnold Schwarzenegger , are forcing ships to reduce their fuel smoke emissions .
More large fines have been levied on cruise ships for dumping untreated waste .
But despite it all , passengers continue to flock to the ships .
The Passenger Shipping Association estimates that there was a 17 % rise in Britons taking cruises last year - with 1.25 m of us taking a trip - and predicts that 1.55 m will be on board by 2008 .
Worldwide , the figure is expected to pass 15 m people going on a cruise annually .
Bigger ships with astonishing facilities are intermittently unveiled - and monster ships to dwarf today 's megaliners are under construction .
With these huge ships boasting theatres and shopping malls larger than those found in many towns , passengers need hardly know they are at sea at all .
So long , of course , as they do n't go overboard
Profile : George Smith , a young man who went missing on honeymoon
Young , handsome and wealthy , George Allen Smith IV , a 26 - year - old from Connecticut , went missing on a honeymoon cruise in the Mediterranean with his new wife , Jennifer Hagel Smith .
After a lavish wedding in Rhode Island , the couple had fl own to Europe , and in Barcelona boarded Royal Caribbean 's Brilliance of the Seas , a large resort ship that caters for the younger and more active end of the market .
On the seventh day of the cruise , July 5 2005 , Smith was reported missing .
The newlyweds had spent the previous evening in the bar and casino with acquaintances from the cruise , drinking heavily .
Hagel Smith said she remembered nothing after leaving the bar , allegedly after rowing with her husband .
At around 3.30 am , Smith , intoxicated , was helped back to his cabin .
His wife was not there .
The next morning , a passenger noticed a large bloodstain on a canopy below the Smiths ' cabin , and called security .
Jennifer was tracked down to the ship 's spa , where she was having a massage .
George was missing without a trace .
Turkish forensic investigators were called in , as was an FBI agent holidaying in the area .
By evening , the bloodstain was cleaned away and the ship continued on its voyage .
If anyone had been responsible for Smith 's death , that person was on the cruise : in the words of the dead man 's sister , Bree Smith , who is convinced that there was foul play , " the Brilliance of the Seas sailed off into the sunset with the murderers on board " .
In June 2006 , Smith 's family filed a lawsuit against the cruise line .
Hours later , Royal Caribbean announced that the widow , Jennifer Hagel Smith , separately from the family , had agreed to a settlement .
Hagel Smith told the press : " As many great peace and spiritual teachers have said , through great suffering comes great awareness . "
Details of the settlement were revealed last week : Hagel Smith received a payment worth one million dollars .
Profile : Annette Mizener , a mother who disappeared on a cruise she won as a prize
Annette Mizener , 37 , from Wisconsin , was reported missing on the last night of a nine - day cruise to the Mexican Riviera on the Carnival Pride .
Both her parents and daughter were accompanying her on the cruise , which she had won as a prize in a competition .
On the evening of her disappearance on December 4 2004 , Mizener performed Britney Spears ' Baby One More Time at a karaoke night with her daughter , then went to the casino .
Later than evening she was due to meet her parents again for bingo .
But she never made it .
Her parents , Wally and Heidi Knerler , were immediately concerned .
When an announcement came over the Tannoy that her purse had been found , they rushed to find cruise staff .
The damaged purse had been discovered near a railing on the lower deck .
The local coastguard led a fruitless search of more than 800 k m2 of water well into the next day .
The FBI later investigated , but no explanation was ever forthcoming .
A CCTV camera nearby had been obscured - covered up by a map of the ship .
Finally a judge declared Mizener offi cially dead , but the family - who rule out suicide and suspect foul play - still have no answers .
Carnival have since agreed an out - of - court , confidential settlement with Mizener 's husband , John .

Angelina Jolie has taken her baby daughter Shiloh Nouvel to see her dying mother .
The ' Tomb Raider ' star 's mum Marcheline Bertrand - who has terminal cancer - was unable to be by Angelina 's side when she gave birth in Namibia last month .
To grant her mother 's final wish , the actress has arrived in Los Angeles - where Marcheline is being cared for - to properly introduce Shiloh to her grandmother .
A source was quoted in Britain 's The Sun newspaper as saying : " Angelina and her mum are really close .
Their time apart during the latter stages of her pregnancy was tough .
" She originally wanted to give birth to Shiloh in France - the country where her mum was born and raised .
" But Marcheline simply was n't well enough to make the long - haul flight to be by her daughter 's side .
Angelina has been determined to let her mum hold Shiloh before it was too late .
" The reunion was said to have left the brunette actress - who already has two adopted children , 4 - year - old Maddox , and 16 - month - old Zahara with Brad Pitt - extremely emotional .
The source added " Angelina was overwhelmed that her mum managed to battle through to see her granddaughter at last . "
Although Marceline - who had Angelina with her ex-husband actor John Voight - could not be present at her granddaughter 's birth , Angelina 's elder brother James Haven was in Namibia as the actress underwent a Caesarean section .
Recently , it seems like everyone 's been focused upon creating The One Framework -- the Ruby on Rails of Python .
In fact , I 'm almost as guilty as everyone else .
We have failed in this regard , and we will continue to fail .
We 've been struggling to find the best practices and combination of tools to create Joe User 's average database - backed dynamic web site and application , and not only can't we agree on how to do it , no actual end - users care when polished solutions like Rails and ASP.
NET are in town .
Not only that , by many accounts Ruby seems to be overtaking Python in its rate of growth .
Personally , I 'd rather write Python .
But oh , how quick are we to forget Python 's smashing successes in the Web world .
We 've got Plone , probably the most popular and comprehensive CMS out there .
We 've got the platform its built on , Zope , which is ( from what I hear ) fairly popular , too .
We 've had PyBloxsom , which until WordPress came along was a very widespread blogging system .
Let 's also not forget MoinMoin and Mailman , some of the most widespread Wiki and mailing list applications on the Web today .
And hell , we 've got Python 's " killer " web app , Trac , which just about everyone is using these days .
And oh , BitTorrent .
I know it 's not a Web application in the traditional server - side sense , but it just shows how capable Python truly is .
What do all of these applications have in common ?
They certainly do n't share a web framework ; most of them are developed specific to that application and tailored to various deployment platforms ( CGI , FastCGI , custom server , mod_python ) .
Python appears to be falling behind in the world of custom - made Web applications , but in the world of generic , reusable Web applications , Python is doing great .
And let 's not forget about the great achievement of Web - SIG : WSGI .
Now , we have a system that lets us write an application once and deploy it upon any WSGI - compliant server or gateway ( to name a few , ISAPI , mod_python , CGI , FastCGI , SCGI , custom HTTP server ) .
Here 's what I propose : screw Web frameworks for now .
We wo n't win in the Rails generation .
Perhaps when some ingenious Python programming comes up with that next - generation Web framework ( Seaside + ZODB + LINQ + ASP.NET + PyMeld + LivePage + CrackAJAX , anyone ? ) , we can give the Web framework wars another shot .
For today , let 's work on making generic Python products .
Let 's make a kick - ass community forums system , an incredible blogging system , a news script , a CPanel / Webmin clone that people will use because of their features , not their programming language .
Commentary is a great example of what I 'm talking about .
Let 's not forget to make sure Trac , Plone , and all of our applications run seamlessly on WSGI , and let 's make our WSGI gateways ironclad and diverse .
And , most importantly , let 's all get behind what I believe is the most pressing and important concept in the Python web development world today : Paste Deploy .
What Python needs more than anything is a brainless , quick - and - easy way of connecting applications to gateways .
I want to drop a CGI file on to a Web server , point its config file to ( the fictional ) pyBB - 1.0.0.egg , chmod it , and have it Just Work .
I want to do the same thing for FastCGI .
In fact , what I would love more than anything would be a portable mod_wsgi across Apache , LightTPD , and IIS : a module that would let me drop a .egg file into a directory and have it automatically pick up and install the WSGI application from the archive .
Once we 've got this , a standard , portable way of easily installing ANY Python web app , we 'll be getting somewhere .
Happy hacking .

Instead , there was nothing but eerie emptiness .
The powerful lights of the scientists ' submersible vehicle , piercing through the darkness , showed no trace of anything living .
A scientist working on the Census of Marine Life project , Ron O'Dor , of Dalhousie University in Canada , said : " You 'd expect a site like this to be quickly recolonised , but that has n't happened .
It 's unprecedented . "
The scientists teamed with television crews from the BBC and Discovery Channel to investigate the heart of the deadliest tsunami on record .
On Boxing Day last year an earthquake with a magnitude of 9.3 tore the earth apart off the west coast of Sumatra .
Part of the ocean floor was thrust up to create a 40 - metre - high undersea cliff that then collapsed .
Huge volumes of water were displaced in the process , creating the giant waves that killed more than 270,000 people .
" Normally , when you go to the bottom of the sea anywhere and take a sample or look around , there 's always something alive , " Professor O'Dor said .
" But five months after the earthquake , this entire plain , created by the collapse of the cliff , was essentially devoid of life . "
The group had expected to find several species of fish , plus cephalopods , sea cucumbers , brittle stars , corals and sponges , crustaceans and worms .
Professor O'Dor thought the collapsing cliff had buried the food sources of bottom feeders , which in turn had an effect on larger predators .
" No one has ever got to a site like this so quickly before , " he said .
" It may just be that it takes a while for things to get back to normal .
The sea is very cold at this depth , and typically the speed of life is proportional to temperature .
Nothing happens very fast at 4C . "
The tsunami epicentre findings were included in a report marking the halfway point in an ambitious project to catalogue all life in the oceans by 2010 .
About 1700 scientists from 73 countries are taking part in the project .
So far they have electronically tagged almost 2000 animals from 21 species , including sharks , fish , birds , turtles , seals and sea lions .
Large numbers of new species have also been discovered in some of the deepest and remotest corners of the ocean .
Scientists believe that all the marine species known at present may only account for about a tenth of those that exist .

Sascha and Patchara Meissmer , last week said they were certain a girl they have seen in a grainy photograph on a website taken after the tsunami was their five - year - old daughter Solitaire .
They were scheduled to meet the governor of Phuket yesterday to seek his help in finding her .
But Colonel Khemarin Saisiri , who heads the victim identification effort , said the parents took the body of Solitaire on August 8 for cremation in the province of Loei .
The girl was identified by DNA testing that was confirmed by Thai and German officials .
Colonel Khemarin said he had personally handed the parents compensation funds for the loss of their child .

The simple double - pendulum model of the golf swing , showing key angles , lengths , and masses .
For instance , m 1 , m 2 , and m 3 are the masses of the arms / hands , club head , and ball , respectively ; L 1 is the length of the arms / hands , and L 2 is the length of the club head ) .
( a) The system before the club is released and ( b ) when the club is about to strike the ball .
What happens when a golf - loving researcher injures a shoulder and can't play for three months ?
Rod White , a metrologist ( measurement scientist ) , used the spare time off the course to undertake an analysis that revealed the foundation of an effective golf swing .
As it turns out , it 's all in the wrists .
“ Even the most able golfers experience occasions when a ball hit deliberately with little effort inexplicably travels further than expected , ” said White , of technology company Industrial Research Ltd. in Lower Hutt , New Zealand , to PhysOrg.com .
“ But there is an explanation .
A double pendulum model , which represents the golf swing reduced to its simplest elements , explains this effect and how to make a swing more efficient . ”
A double pendulum consists of one pendulum tacked on to the end of another .
The upper pendulum swings from a fixed pivot point and the lower pendulum swings from the end of the upper one .
In golf , the equivalent components are the shoulders ( acting as the fixed pivot ) , arms and hands ( the upper pendulum ) , and the club shaft and club head ( the lower pendulum ) .
There are several factors influencing the efficiency of a golf swing .
Among them are the length of the club , the length of the player 's arms , the mass of the club head , the wrist - cock angle – how far backward the wrists are bent during the swing – and whether the wrists actively twist during the swing , resulting in wrist torque .
White 's analysis is the first to consider wrist - cock angle .
His model is also very simple in a Physics 101 kind of way , explaining the mechanics of the golf swing in terms of the club 's changing moment of inertia .
These two points distinguish his work from similar analyses by C.B. Daish1 and the late University of Nebraska physicist Theodore Jorgensen2 .
White shows that the energy and momentum of the arm - club system are redistributed during the swing as a direct result of the uncocking of the wrists that takes place before the club strikes the ball .
“ As the wrists uncock near the bottom of the swing , the club head and the hands are moving in different directions , which means the club pulls against the hands and slows them down , ” White said .
“ This means , in turn , that the kinetic energy in the shoulders and arms is transferred to the club .
Without wrist - cock , most of the kinetic energy stays in the arms and shoulders and the swing is inefficient .
Best of all , the golfer does not have to do any extra work to make the transfer happen . ”
Thus , wrist - cock is the make - or - break factor in a good golf swing .
The full range of motion of the double pendulum is described by two complicated equations .
In fact , White says , they are too complicated to be of much help in a study of the golf swing .
“ They obscure the basic mechanism by which the golf swing derives its efficiency . ”
He simplified the equations by removing the components that account for radial motion – motion away from the shoulders , such as what would happen if the club handle slipped down slightly in the golfer 's hands during the swing .
There are two key points in the swing where radial motion does not factor in : at the end the first half of the swing when the golfer is holding the club at a fixed wrist - cock angle and about to release the club , and the instant before the club head strikes the ball , when the golfer 's arms and the club line up vertically .
By using these two snapshots ,
White broke the swing down into a much more basic and manageable system .
“ This model helps explain why learning a good swing can be difficult , ” he concludes .
“ Both the extraordinary effectiveness of wrist cock in gaining distance ( without having to do additional work ) and the loss in distance that occurs with the application of wrist torque are counter - intuitive . ”

WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
The Magazine answers ...
A detox dinner
If celebrities such as Carol Vorderman are to be believed , a detox diet can be a life - changing experience .
It can reportedly help people lose weight , beat cellulite , banish bloating and make your skin glow .
The theory behind the diet is that bodies are continually overloaded with toxins , which build up in a person 's system and cause problems .
Clearing the system by detoxing promises all kinds of results and is now a multi-million pound industry , with products and supplements to help expel unwanted toxins .
But making dietary changes is at the core of most .
' Meaningless '
The foods allowed and banned can vary widely , but generally fruit , vegetables , beans , nuts , seeds , herbal teas and massive amounts of water are allowed .
In contrast , wheat , dairy , meat , fish , eggs , caffeine , alcohol , salt , sugar and processed foods - most of the foods that many people love - are banned .
But if our body is already designed to expel waste , what is the point of detoxing ?
There is n't any point , according to new research , which says the body can recover from the excesses of Christmas on its own .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular feature in the BBC News Magazine - aiming to answer some of the questions behind the headlines
" The detox fad - or fads , as there are many methods - is an example of the capacity of people to believe in and pay for magic despite the lack of any sound evidence , " says Martin Wiseman , visiting professor of human nutrition at the University of Southampton .
Most of the pills , juices , teas and oils that are sold for their detoxifying effects on the body have no scientific foundation for their claims , according to the research .
People would be better off drinking tap water and having an early night .
The British Dietetic Association says detox diets are marketing myths rather than nutritional reality .
" Detox is a meaningless term that is used all the time and because it has n't been defined , it 's impossible to say if it has worked or if it has n't , " says a spokesman .
' Empty promises '
" The body is set up to deal with the chemicals it does n't want , and excrete them . "
HAVE YOUR SAY
It seems obvious that the best way to ' detox ' is to not overload your body with toxins in the first place
Graham Briggs , Cambridge , UK
Send us your comments
Scientists and dieticians argue that the benefits people feel are not due to their body getting rid of excessive toxins but are due to changing from what is likely to have been a " poor " diet .
Fewer headaches , for example , is probably the result of being fully hydrated due to drinking so much water and better skin may be due to eating more antioxidant - packed fruit and vegetables .
Dr Rob Hicks , who writes for the BBC 's health website , says another misconception of detox diets is that fruits and vegetables are low in toxins while meat and fish lead to the accumulation of harmful substances in the body .
Carol Vorderman detoxifies twice a year
Detoxing can actually be dangerous for groups such as teenagers or pregnant women , who cannot afford to deprive themselves of food groups .
But some health experts say detoxing does have its benefits and can improve people 's diets .
Independent fitness consultant Jane Gray says like any diet , detoxing should be done sensibly .
" Following a detox can help change people 's bad eating habits and re-educate them about food .
As long as they still have a varied diet , eat enough and get all the required nutrients , it can help improve people 's health .
Troops are patrolling the streets of Dhaka
State media reported his departure just hours after he had announced a state of emergency and a curfew in the country .
Mr Ahmed then went on television to say that the 22 January vote was being put back .
" It 's not possible to hold the elections on schedule , " he said .
A major political alliance says the vote is being rigged .
Weeks of violence have left more than 40 people dead .
' Fair vote '
Mr Ahmed said he would stay on in his largely ceremonial post of president .
Nine of 10 members of his caretaker administration are also reported to have resigned .
We need a flawless voter list to ensure that the elections are free , fair and credible
President Iajuddin Ahmed
Analysis :
Will democracy win out ?
The president said one of his advisers , Fazlul Haque , would serve as head of the caretaker government until he had named a replacement .
" I will , in a couple of days , appoint a new interim leader to hold an election in which all parties will be able to participate , " he told the nation .
Mr Ahmed did not specify a new general election date , but made clear there should be key changes before the vote is held .
" We need a flawless voter list to ensure that the elections are free , fair and credible . "
The Awami League party and its allies announced last week they were boycotting the vote because they said it was not going to be fair .
Amending the electoral register was a central demand , as was Mr Ahmed 's removal as chief adviser to the caretaker government .
The alliance said the announcement was a " victory for the people " .
It has led mass demonstrations which have at times brought the country to a standstill in recent months .
There have been violent clashes between police and supporters of rival political groupings .
Curfew
A late night - early morning curfew ( 2300 - 0500 local time ) was announced by state media earlier on Thursday .
By admitting that the voter list had errors , and quitting as head of the interim government , he has in fact accepted our main demands
Awami League spokesman Abdul Jalil
State television said the curfew affected more than 60 cities and towns across Bangladesh .
as well as the capital , Dhaka .
Under the state of emergency news broadcasting by private television channels is suspended .
The media are not allowed to criticise the the government or its policies .
All political activities are also banned .
Hours earlier , the UN and the EU said they were suspending assistance for the election , sending a strong signal that the vote should be postponed .
There have been weeks of violent protests over the vote
The Awami League has long alleged electoral bias in favour of its bitter rival , the Bangladesh Nationalist Party ( BNP ) , which left office in October .
The BNP rejected the allegations of bias and had said it would take part in the vote .
The state of emergency raised concern in a country which has experienced periods of military rule and coup attempts since independence from Pakistan in 1971 .
Under the Bangladesh constitution the caretaker government must organise elections within 90 days - Thursday 's developments take the country into uncertain and uncharted territory .
Tags with MySQL fulltext を参考にして試してみた 。
Femoの中で、タグの絞り込み機能を実装したのに続いて、「完了」や「 finish」と言ったタグがついている場合表示しないというオプションを考えている。
そうなってくると 、SQLをどう書けばいいのか、また複雑なSQLを構築したときにパフォーマンスは大丈夫なのかと心配。そこで、上記のURLを参考にしながらMySQLの全文検索に注目。
create table ft_tags ( id int unsigned not null auto_increment primary key , tags text , unpack text , fulltext ( unpack ) )

Immediately following a whirlwind romance and quick marriage to actor Dean McDermott , Life & Style is reporting that Tori Spelling is pregnant .
We first thought she was pregnant when we saw this picture in May .
She apparently blurted out the happy news during a recent shopping trip to chic West Hollywood maternity store Petit Tresor .
As wonderful as that store may be , it seems to leak a lot of celebrity baby news .
Here 's more :
“ Tori looks about four months pregnant and has been looking at big items like cribs and changing tables .
Tori told me that when she finds out the sex of the baby , she ’ll order appropriately , but right now she ’s picking out for both genders , ” the insider says .
“ She bought several baby items — layettes , blankets , onesies .
Tori said she ’s a bit upset having to go through all that 's happening in her life now with a baby on the way . ”
This news comes about a month after Tori 's father Aaron passed away .
She is still fighting with her mother and brother .
The soap opera continues .
If only Aaron could see all this now .

" Our data has been effectively hijacked by the U.S. under cover of secret agreements and entirely undisclosed terms , " said the civil liberties advocate , Simon Davies , the director of Privacy International , a London - based organization focused on the intrusion on privacy by governments and businesses .
" There will be a snapping point , and this may be it . "
Initial reaction from global banks was muted , with one executive saying that while the privacy of information was a contentious issue within the industry , the Swift operation had so far generated few complaints .
In Washington on Friday , privacy groups and civil liberties advocates were critical of the program , as were some Democrats and one prominent Republican on Capitol Hill .
The executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union , Anthony D. Romero , condemned the program , calling it " another example of the Bush administration 's abuse of power . "
Lauren Weinstein , the head of the California - based Privacy Forum , an online discussion group , raised concerns about lack of independent review of the operation .
" Oversight is the difference between something being reasonable and something being abuse , " he said .
Senator Arlen Specter , Republican of Pennsylvania and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , said he had sent letters on Friday to both Treasury Secretary John W. Snow and Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales on the issue .
While he declined to release the letters , he said he was concerned about the legal authority for the operation .

Mr. Specter has been at odds with the administration over another previously secret counterterrorism operation , the National Security Agency 's domestic eavesdropping program .
The senator said he was particularly troubled that the administration had expanded its Congressional briefings on the financial tracking program in recent weeks after having learned that The New York Times was making inquiries .
Journal publishers lock horns with free - information movement .
The author of Nail ' Em ! Confronting High - Profile Attacks on Celebrities and Businesses is not the kind of figure normally associated with the relatively sedate world of scientific publishing .
Besides writing the odd novel , Eric Dezenhall has made a name for himself helping companies and celebrities protect their reputations , working for example with Jeffrey Skilling , the former Enron chief now serving a 24 - year jail term for fraud .
Although Dezenhall declines to comment on Skilling and his other clients , his firm , Dezenhall Resources , was also reported by Business Week to have used money from oil giant ExxonMobil to criticize the environmental group Greenpeace .
“ He 's the pit bull of public relations , ” says Kevin McCauley , an editor at the magazine O'Dwyer 's PR Report .
Now , Nature has learned , a group of big scientific publishers has hired the pit bull to take on the free - information movement , which campaigns for scientific results to be made freely available .
Some traditional journals , which depend on subscription charges , say that open - access journals and public databases of scientific papers such as the National Institutes of Health's ( NIH's ) PubMed Central , threaten their livelihoods .
From e-mails passed to Nature , it seems Dezenhall spoke to employees from Elsevier , Wiley and the American Chemical Society at a meeting arranged last July by the Association of American Publishers ( AAP ) .
A follow - up message in which Dezenhall suggests a strategy for the publishers provides some insight into the approach they are considering taking .
The consultant advised them to focus on simple messages , such as “ Public access equals government censorship ” .
He hinted that the publishers should attempt to equate traditional publishing models with peer review , and “ paint a picture of what the world would look like without peer - reviewed articles ” .
Dezenhall also recommended joining forces with groups that may be ideologically opposed to government - mandated projects such as PubMed Central , including organizations that have angered scientists .
One suggestion was the Competitive Enterprise Institute , a conservative think - tank based in Washington DC , which has used oil - industry money to promote sceptical views on climate change .
Dezenhall estimated his fee for the campaign at $ 300,000 – 500,000 .
“ Media messaging is not the same as intellectual debate . ”
In an enthusiastic e-mail sent to colleagues after the meeting , Susan Spilka , Wiley 's director of corporate communications , said Dezenhall explained that publishers had acted too defensively on the free - information issue and worried too much about making precise statements .
Dezenhall noted that if the other side is on the defensive , it does n't matter if they can discredit your statements , she added : “ Media messaging is not the same as intellectual debate .
Officials at the AAP would not comment to Nature on the details of their work with Dezenhall , or the money involved , but acknowledged that they had met him and subsequently contracted his firm to work on the issue .
“ We 're like any firm under siege , ” says Barbara Meredith , a vice - president at the organization .
“ It 's common to hire a PR firm when you 're under siege . ”
She says the AAP needs to counter messages from groups such as the Public Library of Science ( PLoS ) , an open - access publisher and prominent advocate of free access to information .
PLoS 's publicity budget stretches to television advertisements produced by North Woods Advertising of Minneapolis , a firm best known for its role in the unexpected election of former professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship of Minnesota .
The publishers ' link with Dezenhall reflects how seriously they are taking recent developments on access to information .
Minutes of a 2006 AAP meeting sent to Nature show that particular attention is being paid to PubMed Central .
Since 2005 , the NIH has asked all researchers that it funds to send copies of accepted papers to the archive , but only a small percentage actually do .
Congress is expected to consider a bill later this year that would make submission compulsory .
Brian Crawford , a senior vice - president at the American Chemical Society and a member of the AAP executive chair , says that Dezenhall 's suggestions have been refined and that the publishers have not to his knowledge sought to work with the Competitive Enterprise Institute .
On the censorship message , he adds : “ When any government or funding agency houses and disseminates for public consumption only the work it itself funds , that constitutes a form of selection and self - promotion of that entity 's interests . ”
Editor 's note :
In the original version of this story , Susan Spilka was reported as emailing a note that said " Media massaging is not the same as intellectual debate . "
It should have read " Media messaging " , and has been changed accordingly .

Blondes may have more fun but redheads have more sex , according to new research in Germany .
The study by Hamburg Sex Researcher Professor Dr Werner Habermehl looked at the sex lives of hundreds of German women and compared them with their hair colour .
He said : " The sex lives of women with red hair were clearly more active than those with other hair colour , with more partners and having sex more often than the average .
The research shows that the fiery redhead certainly lives up to her reputation . "
He added that women who dyed their hair red from another colour were signalling they were looking for a partner , and added : " Even women in a fixed relationship are letting their partners know they are unhappy if they dye their hair red .
They are saying that they are looking for something better . "
Psychologist Christine Baumanns said however that it may not be the women who were to blame for the better sex lives of redheads .
She said : " Red stands for passion and when a man sees a redhead he will think he is dealing with a woman who wo n't mess around , and gets straight to the point when it comes to sex . "

I have been looking forward to getting back to adding to this tutorial , but I have not had the chance the past few days .
Now that I have a little time , I can jump in and finish the tutorial .
What this part of the tutorial will address is the edit functionality for our blog application .
Taking a hint from the CRUD functions that is in ErlyWeb , I will do something similar .
( Tip for Erlang newbies : use m( module_name ) to find out about what functions are exported from a module .
Very handy feature ! )
ErlyDB looks like a smart fellow , because it knows that , despite using basic tuples , can figure out if the data is in the database or not .
It probably is n't anything special , and Yariv will probably agree ( since he wrote it ) , but it is interesting nonetheless .
I said this for a reason .
We can similify our code , transforming the functionality in new_post / 1 into something that calls a generic function , new_or_edit / 2 , which will also handle post editing .
This is possible because ErlyDB saves records with same function .
In your entries_controller.erl file , get rid of the new_post / 1 function , and then stick this in :
We exported most of the logic that was in new_post / 1 into new_or_edit / 2 .
Put the new_or_edit / 2 function in :
It is a fact that this function applies to both creating a new entry and editing an entry .
This is true because what we are going to show now , with the edit functionality .
Put this code in : WAIT A MINUTE !
We are doing almost the same thing that is being done in our new function !
Time to do some parameterization , to get rid of that look of cut - and - paste yuckiness .
Look at where the differences are ...
The function that is called to get an entry in " GET " and possibly , the space where we do a redirect .
Let 's add a library function !
But , for you neophytes to functional programming ... we are going to use higher - order functions .
Here is the generic function : Essentially , the form_process / 5 function is just a generalization of what we have been doing before .
Except , this time , we replaced the specific places with function calls - to functions we will define in our new / 1 function .
and then edit/1:( NOTE !
For some weird reason , when I am running new / 1 through the browser , and hit submit , it takes a bit too long to load .
Is this a bug in my code ?
edit / 1 , though , works like a charm .
Go figure . )
So , we developed a pattern using common code and , more importantly , , meaning a common set of expectations .
There is nothing grandiose about the convention , and yes , you can completely ignore it .
The lines of code in my function is not my concern , but whether or not I can make the code more , in the sense that I say " do this in this location , do this in this other location . "
But , I am thinking that the code there can be tightened up even more .
In your entries_view.erl file , add these functions : Yep , we are using the same form for editing and displaying .
However , we made a change .
I needed to make the action in the form generic .
So the new parameters represent the url to go to .
I moved the form to its own module , in a file called " entry_form.et " - I am going for some sense of template organization , by putting one page per ErlTL file .
But , I originally put it in " entries_show.et " .
Note the changes I made with the parameters .
Here is the new lines :
We also want to make a small addition , by adding a " view " function .
This one is quite simple .
In your entries_controller.erl file , add this function :
In your entries_view.erl file , add this function : Add a file called " entry_view.et " for the view , and add this to the file : Maybe , also , add a link to the view in your entries_show .et file .
Put it in your entry / 1 function in the template .
Also , maybe you can finish off the show_entries / 1 function in the same template file with a link to the new entry form .
I 'm lazy - you do it yourself .
:)
Now , go to Yaws , type " start : boot ( ) " and go to your index page .
All of the elements should be visible .
Is it ?
Any problems ?
If there is , this is a good time to learn what Erlang is saying to you .
:P
Now , if there is a problem in the tutorial , do contact me .
eweek .com ’s article on ten programming languages you should learn right now is the most ill - informed pieces I ’ve read in a while .
Here ’s my ( hopefully better ) attempt .
Five Programming Languages
Scheme .
If you come from a “ curly braces ” background you should learn a functional language .
As Eric Raymond says about the very similar Lisp : LISP is worth learning for a different reason — the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it .
That experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days , even if you never actually use LISP itself a lot .
I prefer Scheme because it is purer ( no need for funcall ) .
Erlang .
Another functional language .
Concurrency done right .
In the multiprocessor future this could be very important indeed .
Ruby .
A conscious attempt to make a programming language that is a joy to use .
String handling from Perl , OO from Smalltalk , closures from Lisp / Scheme .
Javascript .
The only way to create a rich UI in current web browsers .
C. For when things must be fast .
Use with Ruby , Python and many other languages when you need to optimize a section of your code for performance .
C , Ruby and Javascript are on the original eweek list .
As for the other seven on there :
Maybe
PHP – Quick and dirty .
Yes , it ’s quick , but it ’s dirty .
Python – Dynamic , fairly intuitive , list comprehensions are great .
But explicit self ?
No ternary if ?
Significant whitespace ?
The OO feels tagged on .
No
VB.NET – Hidebound , moribund offering from equally hidebound and moribund company .
Plus it is inferior to it ’s sibling C# in every conceivable way .
C# – Java with a little extra syntactic sugar .
Not worth paying the Microsoft price for .
Perl – Somewhat deserved reputation as “ write only ” .
Other languages ( Ruby ) have absorbed the lessons of perl ( mainly – have brilliant regex support ) and moved on .
Once important , but less so every day .
Java – Bruce Tate wrote “ Bitter Java ” ( 2002 ) , then he wrote , “ Better , Faster , Lighter Java ” ( 2004 ) , then he wrote , “ Beyond Java ” ( 2005 ) .
You get my point .
Agree ?
Disagree ?
Think I ’m a lunatic ?
Make a comment !

There 's perhaps nothing funnier than a propagandist college dropout trying to explain military strategy to a Rhodes Scholar retired four - star Army General .
Well , maybe a quick Google search that proves the propagandist wrong is a little funnier .
Although General Clarke misspoke and said " seize , clear and hold " -- he meant to say " clear , hold and build " -- he 's dead on that this is not a new strategy .

Hannity : Alright .
You said there was no new strategy .
Let me tell you what the new strategy is ‘ cause clearly uh I guess you ’re missing what the President ’s saying here .
The prior strategy , and the President admitted that there were some mistakes made , was that they go in and they ’d clear out the insurgency and they did n’t stay long enough or hold those areas long enough .
Now the new strategy with the troop surge will be go in , remove the insurgents , hold the areas as pa ... and also accelerate the training of Iraqi troops and police .
That is a new strategy .
GENERAL WESLEY CLARK : : I do n’t think that ’s a new strategy . [...]
I ’ve heard him for a year talking about " seize , clear and hold . "
Hannity : No .
That ’s what it is now .
That 's what the strategy is now ?

It was a very exciting email : " Dave , Binnentech is definitely interested in a trial run !
Can you go to Amsterdam for two weeks to do the setup and presentation ? "
While frequent business travelers might dread such a request , Dave had only been on a single business trip in his career , and even then , it was just an overnighter to Ottawa which was just a few hundred kilometers across the province .
He could n't pass it up an overseas journey like this .
Dave 's company had been courting Binnentech for nearly eighteen months , trying to get them to buy their Enterprise Knowledge Management system .
It was actually a pretty slick system and would have been a great fit for an international giant like Binnentech , if only it was n't so expensive .
Not in terms of licensing costs or fees , but in how much time it would take for Binnentech engineers to migrate to the new system .
Binnentech finally bit when the sales rep told them about a new product : a much simpler knowledge management solution called " Knowledge Essentials " that could be used without a costly migration .
They agreed to pilot this new system at their corporate headquarters to see how it works and , if it was a good fit , roll it out to their global enterprise .
Dave was tasked with installing and presenting the system at Binnentech .
There was just one small problem : Dave had never heard of Knowledge Essentials .
He was n't alone ; none of his coworkers were familiar with Knowledge Essentials , either .
The sales rep exaggerated just a bit when he was talking to Binnentech .
He mentioned that Knowledge Essentials was in the " beta " stage .
In reality , it was in the pre-pre - pre - pre - Alpha stage or , as some refer to it , non-existence .
In terms of code , Knowledge Essentials could be summed up like this :
int main ( int argc , char ** args ) { return 0 ; }
It became pretty clear what Dave was really supposed to do : simulate an installation of Knowledge Essentials , run into " technical difficulties , " gather technical requirements and send them back to the developers , stall for a few days while the developers rush to build a prototype , install the prototype while explaining " technical difficulties " are preventing it from being functional , and then work closely with the marketing team to find a good excuse to reschedule the installation for a few weeks later .
As soon as Dave realized this , he stormed into his manager 's office and angrily proclaimed : you 're kidding ; there is no way I 'm going to do this !
Three days later , Dave was on a plane headed to The Netherlands .
They say everyone has a price ; Dave 's was a 20 % bonus and an extra week 's vacation .
I suppose it 's a good thing that he has no plans to run for any sort of government office .
The long plane ride gave Dave a lot of time to think .
He had a pretty bad feeling about this whole Binnentech thing and was certain that he'd get caught .
His company would get sued , Dave would have to testify , they 'd go bankrupt , and Dave would have to find a new job .
A new job , well , that 's not so bad of a thing ; it'd be an honest job .
A job where he was n't forced ( err , bribed ) to trick clients into thinking they bought a real system .
No more lies , no more deception , and most importantly , no more guilt trips .
Dave finally arrived at Binnentech and realized that none of that would ever happen .
No one -- not the CEO , the sales rep , or the team of developers prepared to work triple - shifts to build the prototype -- expected the purchasing department at Binnentech to be even more inept than they were .
No one bothered to fill out any of the internal approval paperwork for the project , leaving Dave to spend his first two days in The Netherlands waiting around for a " temporary access badge . "
The badge was required just to enter the building .
Things slowed down from there .
While Dave waited for approval to install a new server in their data center , he gathered all the technical requirements and sent them back to the developers .
Several months later , and long after the developers built the real Knowledge Essentials system , Binnentech finally approved the purchase ( despite paying it long ago ) and Dave returned to The Netherlands to do a real install of the system .
A few months later , Binnentech purchased a full license and deployed the system across the globe .
What , were you expecting Dave 's company to fail or at least learn that it's a bad business practice to decieve customers into purchasing non-existant products ?
Sorry , not this time ; I guess we can mark yet another one for the " bad guys " ...
The publishing industry now has an answer .
It is bringing out new editions of some of the great , often unread , works with a fresh emphasis on ' accessibility ' .
Some may call it dumbing down .
The books will be , well , simpler .
One of the first to receive the treatment is Tolstoy 's War and Peace , republished this month by Penguin in a new , reader - friendly translation .
The work of Anthony Briggs , a professor of Russian at Birmingham University who took four and a half years to tackle the original text , the story has been billed by Penguin this time as ' the most melodramatic of soap operas ' .
Later this month an even more radical reworking of another important doorstop book is to be launched on the market .
Bantam Press is to bring out A Briefer History of Time , a condensed version of the science classic by Stephen Hawking that became an international bestseller - shifting more than ten million copies around the world .
Bantam readily admits that ' in the years since its publication , readers have repeatedly told Professor Hawking of their great difficulty in understanding some of the book 's most important concepts ' .
The author , Bantam claims , now wishes to make its content accessible to readers as well as to update some of the research .
The new edition is quite literally ' briefer ' .
Gone are the purely technical concepts
Hawking introduced , such as the mathematics of chaotic boundary conditions , while whole chapters are given over to more popular scientific ideas , such as relativity and quantum theory .
Briggs 's version of Tolstoy 's epic story of love , passion and politics during the Napoleonic wars is the first major translation for nearly 50 years and , Briggs felt , was long overdue .
' I felt it needed refreshing and renewing , ' he said .
In translating the book he aimed to keep the reader in mind all the time .
' You should try to recreate for the reader in English an experience that is as similar to that the Russian reader would have had , ' he said this weekend .
The original translations have the heroine Natasha looking in the mirror after her devastating illness and saying , ' Can this truly be I ? '
This is too slavish a translation for Briggs , who renders the same line as ' Can that really be me ? '
' When you read one of the older translations you feel as if you are being read to by the Queen or by Lady Antonia Fraser , ' said Briggs .
' I am very different to previous translators .
I am a man , for a start , from a pragmatic , lower - class , Northern background , and I hope I have made it more readable for today . '
The third hefty book likely to receive the ' accessibility treatment ' this autumn is Clarke 's novel Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell .
Although the book was a popular hit , its publisher Bloomsbury suspects there are readers out there who were put off by its size .
They are planning to produce a triple edition paperback version of the work .
The hope is that in digestible gobbets the story will be more approachable - much as Victorian epic novels were often produced in serial form rather than in one volume .
Other classic books which might find themselves repackaged in the future are Moby Dick by Herman Melville , Clarissa by Samuel Richardson , Gravity 's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon and Underworld by Don DeLillo .
... but if you 're really in a hurry
War and Peace
by Leo Tolstoy
The scene is Russia , 150 years before the birth of Roman Abramovich .
Noble people , with names that all sound vaguely like Kalashnikov , dance and gossip and do evil things , sometimes all at the same time .
Pierre Bezhukov , playboy bastard son of a rich count , rescues Natasha , falls in love , and marries her .
Napoleon is meanwhile invading Russia , stupidly marching on Moscow , losing the war , and preparing to watch his army get cut to pieces by Cossacks on their way home .
Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell
by Susanna Clarke
The scene is England ( about 150 years before the birth of Roman Abramovich ) .
Mr Norrell is the last magician around , except for Jonathan Strange .
Statues speak , a woman turns into a cat ( and back again ) .
Strange helped Wellington magic roads into existence and bring dead soldiers back to life .
If he had n't , Jacques Chirac would be in Downing Street .
A brief history of time
by Stephen Hawking
Einstein was a Swiss patent office clerk who got lucky with the equation e=mc2 , but I 'm smarter - that 's called relativity .
The universe started with a very big bang and is expanding .
But due to the cosmological arrow , this wo n't last forever .
Once the universe starts shrinking , it 's probably best not to invest in buy - to - let properties .
I 'm a hacker , I have a life ...
Read on for details .
IF AMERICAN law enforcement officers were ever to confront the law school hypothetical case of the captured terrorist who knew about an imminent attack but refused to provide the information necessary to prevent it , I have absolutely no doubt that they would try to torture the terrorists into providing the information .
Moreover , the vast majority of Americans would expect the officers to engage in that time - tested technique for loosening tongues , notwithstanding our unequivocal treaty obligation never to employ torture , no matter how exigent the circumstances .
The real question is not whether torture would be used -- it would -- but whether it would be used outside of the law or within the law .
Every democracy , including our own , has employed torture outside of the law .
Throughout the years , police officers have tortured murder and rape suspects into confessing -- sometimes truthfully , sometimes not truthfully .
The " third degree " is all too common , not only on TV shows such as " NYPD Blue , " but in the back rooms of real police station houses .
No democracy , other than Israel , has ever employed torture within the law .
Until quite recently , Israel recognized the power of its security agencies to employ what it euphemistically called " moderate physical pressure " to elicit information from terrorists about continuing threats .
This " pressure " entailed putting the suspect in a dingy cell with a smelly sack over his head and shaking him violently until he disclosed planned terrorist attacks .
Israel never allowed the information elicited by these methods to be used in courts of law as confessions .
But it did use the information to prevent terrorist acts .
Several attacks were prevented by this unpleasant tactic .
In a courageous and controversial decision , the president of the Israeli Supreme Court wrote a majority opinion banning the use of this tactic against suspected terrorists .
The Israeli Supreme Court left open the possibility , however , that in an actual " ticking bomb " case -- a situation in which a terrorist refused to divulge information necessary to defuse a bomb that was about to kill hundreds of innocent civilians -- an agent who employed physical pressure could defend himself against criminal charges by invoking " the law of necessity . "
No such case has arisen since this court decision , despite numerous instances of terrorism in that troubled part of the world .
Nor has there ever been a ticking bomb case in this country .
But inevitably one will arise , and we should be prepared to confront it .
It is important that a decision be made in advance of an actual ticking bomb case about how we should deal with this inevitable situation .
In my new book , " Shouting Fire : Civil Liberties in a Turbulent Age , " I offer a controversial proposal designed to stimulate debate about this difficult issue .
Under my proposal , no torture would be permitted without a " torture warrant " being issued by a judge .
An application for a torture warrant would have to be based on the absolute need to obtain immediate information in order to save lives coupled with probable cause that the suspect had such information and is unwilling to reveal it .
The suspect would be given immunity from prosecution based on information elicited by the torture .
The warrant would limit the torture to nonlethal means , such as sterile needles , being inserted beneath the nails to cause excruciating pain without endangering life .
It may sound absurd for a distinguished judge to be issuing a warrant to do something so awful .
But consider the alternatives : Either police would torture below the radar screen of accountability , or the judge who issued the warrant would be accountable .
Which would be more consistent with democratic values ?
Those opposed to the idea of a torture warrant argue -- quite reasonably -- that establishing such a precedent would legitimize torture and make it easier to extend its permissible use beyond the ticking bomb case .
Those who favor the torture warrant argue that the opposite would be true :
By expressly limiting the use of torture only to the ticking bomb case and by requiring a highly visible judge to approve , limit and monitor the torture , it will be far more difficult to justify its extension to other institutions .
The goal of the warrant would be to reduce and limit the amount of torture that would , in fact , be used in an emergency .
This is an issue that should be discussed now , before we confront the emergency .
So , let the debate begin . .
Alan M. Dershowitz is a Harvard law professor and a former member of the O.J. Simpson " " Dream Team . "
Last Sunday , he appeared on " " 60 Minutes " to make a case for legal torture .
His latest book is " " Shouting Fire : Civil Liberties in a Turbulent Age " ( Little Brown , 2002 ) .
Google Inc. , the search engine company , said yesterday that it would disclose to advertisers the number of clicks on ads that it deems are invalid in a bid to assuage concerns over “ click fraud . ”
A Google business product manager , Shuman Ghosemajumder , said advertisers could now see how many clicks on ads are excluded from their bills .
An analyst at the market research firm JupiterKagan , Sapna Satagopan , said Google was responding to the demands of advertisers for more information on the effectiveness of their ads .
Companies or individuals using special software can click on an ad repeatedly to artificially increase the marketing costs of a rival or to increase their own ad revenue .
Google sells ads using an online auction in which clients bid for certain search keywords .
Companies pay each time users click on their ads , which appear next to search results .
Mr Ahmadinejad urged students to fight liberal teachers
He told a group of students that they should organise campaigns to demand that the liberal teachers be sacked .
Mr Ahmadinejad said it was difficult to alter secular influences that had been in place in Iran for 150 years , but added that such a change had begun .
The move echoes campaigns of the 1980s , when hundreds of liberal university teachers and students were sacked .
" A student must yell against liberal thoughts and the liberal economy , " the AFP news agency reported Mr Ahmadinejad as saying .
" A student must ask why a secular teacher gives low marks to a student that does not have the same ideas as him . "
Last year , an ayatollah was appointed to run Tehran University , sparking protests by students .
Earlier this year , dozens of liberal professors and teachers were retired .
But the BBC's Frances Harrison in Tehran says many have found new jobs with institutions run by people linked to the president 's political opponents .
1. The Professional
Claudia Menashe needed pictures of sick people .
A project director at the National Health Museum in Washington , DC , Menashe was putting together a series of interactive kiosks devoted to potential pandemics like the avian flu .
An exhibition designer had created a plan for the kiosk itself , but now Menashe was looking for images to accompany the text .
Rather than hire a photographer to take shots of people suffering from the flu , Menashe decided to use preexisting images — stock photography , as it's known in the publishing industry .
In October 2004 , she ran across a stock photo collection by Mark Harmel , a freelance photographer living in Manhattan Beach , California .
Harmel , whose wife is a doctor , specializes in images related to the health care industry .
" Claudia wanted people sneezing , getting immunized , that sort of thing , " recalls Harmel , a slight , soft - spoken 52 - year - old .
The National Health Museum has grand plans to occupy a spot on the National Mall in Washington by 2012 , but for now it 's a fledgling institution with little money .
" They were on a tight budget , so I charged them my nonprofit rate , " says Harmel , who works out of a cozy but crowded office in the back of the house he shares with his wife and stepson .
He offered the museum a generous discount : $ 100 to $ 150 per photograph .
" That 's about half of what a corporate client would pay , " he says .
Menashe was interested in about four shots , so for Harmel , this could be a sale worth $ 600 .
After several weeks of back - and - forth , Menashe emailed Harmel to say that , regretfully , the deal was off .
" I discovered a stock photo site called iStockphoto , " she wrote , " which has images at very affordable prices . "
That was an understatement .
The same day , Menashe licensed 56 pictures through iStockphoto — for about $ 1 each .
i Stockphoto , which grew out of a free image - sharing exchange used by a group of graphic designers , had undercut Harmel by more than 99 percent .
How ?
By creating a marketplace for the work of amateur photographers — homemakers , students , engineers , dancers .
There are now about 22,000 contributors to the site , which charges between $ 1 and $ 5 per basic image .
( Very large , high - resolution pictures can cost up to $ 40 . )
Unlike professionals , iStockers do n't need to clear $ 130,000 a year from their photos just to break even ; an extra $ 130 does just fine .
" I negotiate my rate all the time , " Harmel says .
" But how can I compete with a dollar ? "
He can't , of course .
For Harmel , the harsh economics lesson was clear :
The product Harmel offers is no longer scarce .
Professional - grade cameras now cost less than $ 1,000 .
With a computer and a copy of Photoshop , even entry - level enthusiasts can create photographs rivaling those by professionals like Harmel .
Add the Internet and powerful search technology , and sharing these images with the world becomes simple .
At first , the stock industry aligned itself against iStockphoto and other so - called microstock agencies like ShutterStock and Dreamstime .
Then , in February , Getty Images , the largest agency by far with more than 30 percent of the global market , purchased iStockphoto for $ 50 million .
" If someone 's going to cannibalize your business , better it be one of your other businesses , " says Getty CEO Jonathan Klein .
iStockphoto's revenue is growing by about 14 percent a month and the service is on track to license about 10 million images in 2006 — several times what Getty 's more expensive stock agencies will sell .
iStockphoto 's clients now include bulk photo purchasers like IBM and United Way , as well as the small design firms once forced to go to big stock houses .
" I was using Corbis and Getty , and the image fees came out of my design fees , which kept my margin low , " notes one UK designer in an email to the company .
" iStockphoto's micro-payment system has allowed me to increase my profit margin . "
Welcome to the age of the crowd .
Just as distributed computing projects like UC Berkeley 's SETI@home have tapped the unused processing power of millions of individual computers , so distributed labor networks are using the Internet to exploit the spare processing power of millions of human brains .
The open source software movement proved that a network of passionate , geeky volunteers could write code just as well as the highly paid developers at Microsoft or Sun Microsystems .
Wikipedia showed that the model could be used to create a sprawling and surprisingly comprehensive online encyclopedia .
And companies like eBay and MySpace have built profitable businesses that could n't exist without the contributions of users .
All these companies grew up in the Internet age and were designed to take advantage of the networked world .
But now the productive potential of millions of plugged - in enthusiasts is attracting the attention of old - line businesses , too .
For the last decade or so , companies have been looking overseas , to India or China , for cheap labor .
But now it does n't matter where the laborers are — they might be down the block , they might be in Indonesia — as long as they are connected to the network .
Technological advances in everything from product design software to digital video cameras are breaking down the cost barriers that once separated amateurs from professionals .
Hobbyists , part - timers , and dabblers suddenly have a market for their efforts , as smart companies in industries as disparate as pharmaceuticals and television discover ways to tap the latent talent of the crowd .
The labor is n't always free , but it costs a lot less than paying traditional employees .
It 's not outsourcing ; it 's crowdsourcing .
It took a while for Harmel to recognize what was happening .
" When the National Health Museum called , I 'd never heard of iStockphoto , " he says .
" But now , I see it as the first hole in the dike . "
In 2000 , Harmel made roughly $ 69,000 from a portfolio of 100 stock photographs , a tidy addition to what he earned from commissioned work .
Last year his stock business generated less money — $ 59,000 — from more than 1,000 photos .
That 's quite a bit more work for less money .
Harmel is n't the only photographer feeling the pinch .
Last summer , there was a flurry of complaints on the Stock Artists Alliance online forum .
" People were noticing a significant decline in returns on their stock portfolios , " Harmel says .
" I can't point to iStockphoto and say it 's the culprit , but it has definitely put downward pressure on prices . "
As a result , he has decided to shift the focus of his business to assignment work .
" I just do n't see much of a future for professional stock photography , " he says .
VH1 vice president Michael Hirschorn created the hit show Web Junk 20& to tap the explosion of homemade video .

2. The Packager
" Is that even a real horse ?
It looks like it does n't have any legs , " says Michael Hirschorn , executive vice president of original programming and production at VH1 and a creator of the cable channel 's hit show Web Junk 20 .
The program features the 20 most popular videos making the rounds online in any given week .
Hirschorn and the rest of the show 's staff are gathered in the artificial twilight of a VH1 editing room , reviewing their final show of the season .
The horse in question is named Patches , and it 's sitting in the passenger seat of a convertible at a McDonald 's drive - through window .
The driver orders a cheeseburger for Patches .
" Oh , he 's definitely real , " a producer replies .
" We 've got footage of him drinking beer . "
The crew breaks into laughter , and Hirschorn asks why they 're not using that footage .
" Standards did n't like it , " a producer replies .
Standards — aka Standards and Practices , the people who decide whether a show violates the bounds of taste and decency — had no such problem with Elvis the Robocat or the footage of a bicycle racer being attacked by spectators and thrown violently from a bridge .
Web Junk 20 brings viewers all that and more , several times a week .
In the new , democratic age of entertainment by the masses , for the masses , stupid pet tricks figure prominently .
The show was the first regular program to repackage the Internet 's funniest home videos , but it wo n't be the last .
In February , Bravo launched a series called Outrageous and Contagious : Viral Videos , and USA Network has a similar effort in the works .
The E ! series
The Soup has a segment called " Cybersmack , " and NBC has a pilot in development hosted by Carson Daly called Carson Daly 's Cyberhood , which will attempt to bring beer - drinking farm animals to the much larger audiences of network TV .
Al Gore 's Current TV is placing the most faith in the model : More than 30 percent of its programming consists of material submitted by viewers .
Viral videos are a perfect fit for VH1 , which knows how to repurpose content to make compelling TV on a budget .
The channel reinvented itself in 1996 as a purveyor of tawdry nostalgia with Pop - Up Video and perfected the form six years later with I Love the 80s .
" That show was a good model because it got great ratings , and we licensed the clips " — quick hits from such cultural touchstones as The A - Team and Fatal Attraction — " on the cheap , " Hirschorn says .
( Full disclosure : I once worked for Hirschorn at Inside.com . )
But the C - list celebrity set soon caught on to VH1's searing brand of ridicule .
" It started to get more difficult to license the clips , " says Hirschorn , who has the manner of a laid - back English professor .
" And we 're spending more money now to get them , as our ratings have improved . "
But Hirschorn knew of a source for even more affordable clips .
He had been watching the growth of video on the Internet and figured there had to be a way to build a show around it .
" I knew we offered something YouTube could n't : television , " he says .
" Everyone wants to be on TV . "
At about the same time , VH1's parent company , Viacom , purchased iFilm — a popular repository of video clips — for $ 49 million .
Just like that , Hirschorn had access to a massive supply of viral videos .
And because iFilm already ranks videos by popularity , the service came with an infrastructure for separating the gold from the god-awful .
The model 's most winning quality , as Hirschorn readily admits , is that it's " incredibly cheap " — cheaper by far than anything else VH1 produces , which is to say , cheaper than almost anything else on television .
A single 30 - minute episode costs somewhere in the mid-five figures — about a tenth of what the channel pays to produce so noTORIous , a scripted comedy featuring Tori Spelling that premiered in April .
And if the model works on a network show like Carson Daly 's Cyberhood , the savings will be much greater :
The average half hour of network TV comedy now costs nearly $ 1 million to produce .
Web Junk 20 premiered in January , and ratings quickly exceeded even Hirschorn 's expectations .
In its first season , the show is averaging a respectable half - million viewers in the desirable 18 - to - 49 age group , which Hirschorn says is up more than 40 percent from the same Friday - night time slot last year .
The numbers helped persuade the network to bring Web Junk 20 back for another season .
Hirschorn thinks the crowd will be a crucial component of TV 2.0 .
" I can imagine a time when all of our shows will have a user - generated component , " he says .
The channel recently launched Air to the Throne , an online air guitar contest , in which viewers serve as both talent pool and jury .
The winners will be featured during the VH1 Rock Honors show premiering May 31 .
Even VH1's anchor program , Best Week Ever , is including clips created by viewers .
But can the crowd produce enough content to support an array of shows over many years ?
It 's something Brian Graden , president of entertainment for MTV Music Networks Group , is concerned about .
" We decided not to do 52 weeks a year of Web Junk , because we do n't want to burn the thing , " he says .
Rather than relying exclusively on the supply of viral clips , Hirschorn has experimented with soliciting viewers to create videos expressly for Web Junk 20 .
Early results have been mixed .
Viewers sent in nearly 12,000 videos for the Show Us Your Junk contest .
" The response rate was fantastic , " says Hirschorn as he and other staffers sit in the editing room .
But , he adds , " almost all of them were complete crap . "
Choosing the winners , in other words , was not so difficult .
" We had about 20 finalists . "
But Hirschorn remains confident that as user - generated TV matures , the users will become more proficient and the networks better at ferreting out the best of the best .
The sheer force of consumer behavior is on his side .
Late last year the Pew Internet & American Life Project released a study revealing that 57 percent of 12 - to 17 - year - olds online — 12 million individuals — are creating content of some sort and posting it to the Web .
" Even if the signal - to - noise ratio never improves — which I think it will , by the way — that 's an awful lot of good material , " Hirschorn says .
" I 'm confident that in the end , individual pieces will fail but the model will succeed . "
Engineer Ed Melcarek is one of more than 90,000 ' solvers ' working on science problems for corporations .

3. The Tinkerer
The future of corporate R&D can be found above Kelly 's Auto Body on Shanty Bay Road in Barrie , Ontario .
This is where Ed Melcarek , 57 , keeps his " weekend crash pad , " a one - bedroom apartment littered with amplifiers , a guitar , electrical transducers , two desktop computers , a trumpet , half of a pontoon boat , and enough electric gizmos to stock a RadioShack .
On most Saturdays , Melcarek comes in , pours himself a St. Remy , lights a Player cigarette , and attacks problems that have stumped some of the best corporate scientists at Fortune 100 companies .
Not everyone in the crowd wants to make silly videos .
Some have the kind of scientific talent and expertise that corporate America is now finding a way to tap .
In the process , forward - thinking companies are changing the face of R&D .
Exit the white lab coats ; enter Melcarek — one of over 90,000 " solvers " who make up the network of scientists on InnoCentive , the research world 's version of iStockphoto .
Pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly funded InnoCentive 's launch in 2001 as a way to connect with brainpower outside the company — people who could help develop drugs and speed them to market .
From the outset , InnoCentive threw open the doors to other firms eager to access the network 's trove of ad hoc experts .
Companies like Boeing , DuPont , and Procter & Gamble now post their most ornery scientific problems on InnoCentive 's Web site ; anyone on InnoCentive 's network can take a shot at cracking them .
The companies — or seekers , in InnoCentive parlance — pay solvers anywhere from $ 10,000 to $ 100,000 per solution .
( They also pay InnoCentive a fee to participate . )
Jill Panetta , InnoCentive 's chief scientific officer , says more than 30 percent of the problems posted on the site have been cracked , " which is 30 percent more than would have been solved using a traditional , in - house approach . "
The solvers are not who you might expect .
Many are hobbyists working from their proverbial garage , like the University of Dallas undergrad who came up with a chemical to use inart restoration , or the Cary , North Carolina , patent lawyer who devised a novel way to mix large batches of chemical compounds .
This should n't be surprising , notes Karim Lakhani , a lecturer in technology and innovation at MIT , who has studied InnoCentive .
" The strength of a network like InnoCentive 's is exactly the diversity of intellectual background , " he says .
Lakhani and his three coauthors surveyed 166 problems posted to InnoCentive from 26 different firms .
" We actually found the odds of a solver 's success increased in fields in which they had no formal expertise , " Lakhani says .
He has put his finger on a central tenet of network theory , what pioneering sociologist Mark Granovetter describes as " the strength of weak ties . "
The most efficient networks are those that link to the broadest range of information , knowledge , and experience .
Which helps explain how Melcarek solved a problem that stumped the in -house researchers at Colgate - Palmolive .
The giant packaged goods company needed a way to inject fluoride powder into a toothpaste tube without it dispersing into the surrounding air .
Melcarek knew he had a solution by the time he'd finished reading the challenge : Impart an electric charge to the powder while grounding the tube .
The positively charged fluoride particles would be attracted to the tube without any significant dispersion .
" It was really a very simple solution , " says Melcarek .
Why had n't Colgate thought of it ?
" They 're probably test tube guys without any training in physics . "
Melcarek earned $ 25,000 for his efforts .
Paying Colgate - Palmolive 's R&D staff to produce the same solution could have cost several times that amount — if they even solved it at all .
Melcarek says he was elated to win .
" These are rocket - science challenges , " he says .
" It really reinforced my confidence in what I can do . "
Melcarek , who favors thick sweaters and a floppy fishing hat , has charted an unconventional course through the sciences .
He spent four years earning his master 's degree at the world - class particle accelerator in Vancouver , British Columbia , but decided against pursuing a PhD .
" I had an offer from the private sector , " he says , then pauses .
" I really needed the money . "
A succession of " unsatisfying " engineering jobs followed , none of which fully exploited Melcarek 's scientific training or his need to tinker .
" I 'm not at my best in a 9 - to - 5 environment , " he says .
Working sporadically , he has designed products like heating vents and industrial spray - painting robots .
Not every quick and curious intellect can land a plum research post at a university or privately funded lab .
Some must make HVAC systems .
For Melcarek , InnoCentive has been a ticket out of this scientific backwater .
For the past three years , he has logged onto the network 's
Web site a few times a week to look at new problems , called challenges .
They are categorized as either chemistry or biology problems .
Melcarek has formal training in neither discipline , but he quickly realized this did n't hinder him when it came to chemistry .
" I saw that a lot of the chemistry challenges could be solved using electromechanical processes I was familiar with from particle physics , " he says .
" If I do n't know what to do after 30 minutes of brainstorming , I give up . "
Besides the fluoride injection challenge , Melcarek also successfully came up with a method for purifying silicone - based solvents .
That challenge paid $ 10,000 .
Other Melcarek solutions have been close runners - up , and he currently has two more up for consideration .
" Not bad for a few weeks ' work , " he says with a chuckle .
It 's also not a bad deal for the companies that can turn to the crowd to help curb the rising cost of corporate research .
" Everyone I talk to is facing a similar issue in regards to R&D , " says Larry Huston , Procter & Gamble 's vice president of innovation and knowledge .
" Every year research budgets increase at a faster rate than sales .
The current R&D model is broken . "
Huston has presided over a remarkable about - face at P&G , a company whose corporate culture was once so insular it became known as " the Kremlin on the Ohio . "
By 2000 , the company 's research costs were climbing , while sales remained flat .
The stock price fell by more than half , and Huston led an effort to reinvent the way the company came up with new products .
Rather than cut P&G 's sizable in - house R&D department ( which currently employs 9,000 people ) , he decided to change the way they worked .
Seeing that the company 's most successful products were a result of collaboration between different divisions , Huston figured that even more cross-pollination would be a good thing .
Meanwhile , P&G had set a goal of increasing the number of innovations acquired from outside its walls from 15 percent to 50 percent .
Six years later , critical components of more than 35 percent of the company 's initiatives were generated outside P&G .
As a result , Huston says , R&D productivity is up 60 percent , and the stock has returned to five - year highs .
" It has changed how we define the organ - ization , " he says .
" We have 9,000 people on our R&D staff and up to 1.5 million researchers working through our external networks .
The line between the two is hard to draw . "
P&G is one of InnoCentive 's earliest and best customers , but the company works with other crowdsourcing networks as well .
YourEncore , for example , allows companies to find and hire retired scientists for one - off assignments .
NineSigma is an online marketplace for innovations , matching seeker companies with solvers in a marketplace similar to InnoCentive .
" People mistake this for outsourcing , which it most definitely is not , " Huston says .
" Outsourcing is when I hire someone to perform a service and they do it and that 's the end of the relationship .
That 's not much different from the way employment has worked throughout the ages .
We 're talking about bringing people in from outside and involving them in this broadly creative , collaborative process .
That 's a whole new paradigm . "
4. The Masses
In the late 1760s , a Hungarian nobleman named Wolfgang von Kempelen built the first machine capable of beating a human at chess .
Called the Turk , von Kempelen 's automaton consisted of a small wooden cabinet , a chessboard , and the torso of a turbaned mannequin .
The Turk toured Europe to great acclaim , even besting such luminaries as Benjamin Franklin and Napoleon .
It was , of course , a hoax .
The cabinet hid a flesh - and - blood chess master .
The Turk was a fancy - looking piece of technology that was really powered by human intelligence .
Which explains why Amazon.com has named its new crowdsourcing engine after von Kempelen 's contraption .
Amazon Mechanical
Turk is a Web - based marketplace that helps companies find people to perform tasks computers are generally lousy at — identifying items in a photograph , skimming real estate documents to find identifying information , writing short product descriptions , transcribing podcasts .
Amazon calls the tasks HITs ( human intelligence tasks ) ; they 're designed to require very little time , and consequently they offer very little compensation — most from a few cents to a few dollars .
InnoCentive and iStockphoto are labor markets for specialized talents , but just about anyone possessing basic literacy can find something to do on Mechanical Turk .
It 's crowdsourcing for the masses .
So far , the program has a mixed track record :
After an initial burst of activity , the amount of work available from requesters — companies offering work on the site — has dropped significantly .
" It 's gotten a little gimpy , " says Alan Hatcher , founder of Turker Nation , a community forum .
" No one 's come up with the killer app yet . "
And not all of the Turkers are human :
Some would - be workers use software as a shortcut to complete the tasks , but the quality suffers .
" I think half of the people signed up are trying to pull a scam , " says one requester who asked not to be identified .
" There really needs to be a way to kick people off the island . "
Peter Cohen , the program 's director , acknowledges that Mechanical Turk , launched in beta in November , is a work in progress .
( Amazon refuses to give a date for its official launch . )
" This is a very new idea , and it 's going to take some time for people to wrap their heads around it , " Cohen says .
" We 're at the tippy - top of the iceberg . "
A few companies , however , are already taking full advantage of the Turkers .
Sunny Gupta runs a software company called iConclude just outside Seattle .
The firm creates programs that streamline tech support tasks for large companies , like Alaska Airlines .
The basic unit of iConclude 's product is the repair flow , a set of steps a tech support worker should take to resolve a problem .
Most problems that iConclude 's software addresses are n't complicated or time - consuming , Gupta explains .
But only people with experience in Java and Microsoft systems have the knowledge required to write these repair flows .
Finding and hiring them is a big and expensive challenge .
" We had been outsourcing the writing of our repair flows to a firm in Boise , Idaho , " he says from a small office overlooking a Tully 's Coffee .
" We were paying $ 2,000 for each one . "
As soon as Gupta heard about Mechanical Turk , he suspected he could use it to find people with the sort of tech support background he needed .
After a couple of test runs , iConclude was able to identify about 80 qualified Turkers , all of whom were eager to work on iConclude 's HITs .
" Two of them had quit their jobs to raise their kids , " Gupta says .
" They might have been making six figures in their previous lives , but now they were happy just to put their skills to some use . "
Gupta turns his laptop around to show me a flowchart on his screen .
" This is what we were paying $ 2,000 for .
But this one , " he says , " was authored by one of our Turkers . "
I ask how much he paid .
His answer : " Five dollars . "

Generic production of the drugs could slash costs substantially
Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla said the step was necessary to make the cost of the medicines - Kaletra and Plavix - more affordable .
The move was criticised by pharmaceutical companies but drew praise from Aids campaigners .
There are about half a million people living with HIV in Thailand .
" We have to do this because we do n't have enough money to buy safe and necessary drugs for the people under the government 's universal health scheme , " Mr Mongkol told reporters .
He said at current prices , Thailand could only afford anti-Aids medicine for a fifth of the country 's HIV sufferers .
The minister said the move was permissible under international trade rules in the event of national public health emergencies .
Mr Mongkol said the cost of a generic version of Plavix , a blood - thinning treatment to help prevent heart attacks , would be about a tenth of the cost of the patented product .
Plavix is sold by French - based Safovi-Aventis and US firm Bristol - Myers Squibb Co ; Kaletra is produced by US - based Abbott Laboratories .
' Dialogue '
However the move has angered pharmaceutical firms , who said they were caught by surprise .
It is a brave decision
Kannikar Kijtiwatchakul
Medecins Sans Frontieres
But Aids activists welcomed the government 's announcement .
" It is a brave decision , despite both anticipated pressure from industry and possible threats to withdraw investments , " said Kannikar Kijtiwatchakul , of aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres .
" The authorities have engaged in dialogue with companies before , but the discounts have been marginal .
The licenses will benefit a lot of people and will set an example to other countries who face the same problem . "
Mr Mongkol said he was willing to negotiate with the pharmaceutical companies about importing their products at cheaper prices .
The good
We 're not going to go on about the contributions Apple 's made to consumer electronics and personal computing .
We do n't really actually think they 're all that innovative a lot of the time , they just have a knack for taking what 's out there , what 's a little higher end or out of reach to the average user , and bringing it to the mainstream at just the right time .
Apple is Apple because they bring that technology home , and then package it with a friendly user experience and with an eye for style .
High tech , good user experience , stylish presentation , it 's not like those are n't things being done elsewhere , just usually not all together at the same time .
Perhaps that 's the essence of the Apple mystique .
We 've gathered some of the more groundbreaking devices of Apple 's career ; oh sure , we could have rounded up more , but we had to be fair to the bad and the ugly , too .

Where it all began .
It took a Palo Alto man with a flair for showmanship and a curious love of turtlenecks ( and bowties ) to convince his garage - dwelling , technologically - gifted friend with a love of facial hair to take the simple computer that he was building for personal use and distribute it to the " masses . "
Unlike other computers of the day , which came in kits and required an engineering degree to assemble , the 200 original Apples shipped as complete circuit boards ( although users still had to add their own cases , keyboards , and monitors -- kinda like a Mac mini , actually ) .
Sure , the specs of the Apple I seem humorous today -- 1MHz processor ( even back then they were " thinking differently " and eschewed the popular Intel chip of the day ) , 4KB RAM ( expandable to 32KB ) , 1KB of video memory , and a maximum resolution of 40 x 24 characters -- but the $ 666.66 price tag of the machine was vital in crafting the company 's philosophy : providing consumers with the easiest PC on the market to use and maintain ( and also to look at , if not to afford ) .
While the Apple I may have been a great toy for computer hobbyists , the Apple ] [ was something entirely different : it was the first successful mass - market personal computer .
First released in 1977 with just 12 K of ROM and a maximum 6 - color screen resolution of 280 x 192 , the Apple ] [ took the computing world by storm .
The computer remained a mainstay of Apple 's product line even after the first Macs were released ; the last version , the ||gs , was released in 1986 , and looked a lot like the first Mac II ( which was released the following year -- by then , Apple had also developed a Mac - like GUI for the earlier computer ) .
With its bundled software , relatively affordable storage via cassettes and floppies , the original ] [ and its offspring became popular with corporate users and students alike ( you 'll still find some of them deployed in schools around the country ) .
By 1981 , when IBM launched its first PC , Apple was the undisputed leader of the PC market , with an income of about $ 300 million , all fueled by the ] [ .
Within a few years , of course , IBM ( and , more importantly , cloners such as Compaq ) dominated the market , and the ] [ became known mainly as a tool for students .
But the ] [ proved that there could be a mass market for computers , and helped spur the entire computer revolution of the 1980s .
The original Mac , hyped in the classic " 1984 " commercial and formally introduced by a bow - tied Steve Jobs at Apple 's 1984 shareholders ' meeting ( where the computer quipped about how glad it was to be taken out of Steve 's bag ) , really did change the world of personal computing .
Though GUI - based computers had been available earlier ( including on Apple 's own Lisa ) , the first Mac brought the concept to the masses .
And while the original Mac was underpowered ( no hard drive , just 128 K RAM ) and overpriced ( $ 2,500 ) , it was cheaper than competing GUI - driven computers ( uh , that would be Apple 's Lisa , again ) and more intuitive and user - friendly than most other PCs , which were still using MS - DOS .
Though the Mac never garnered a level of market share comparable to DOS ( and later Windows ) based computers , its influence on the industry was indelible .
While the original Mac may have been underpowered but inspired , the SE / 30 showed that the platform had staying power .
The first compact Mac based on Motorola 's 68030 processor , the SE / 30 was also capable of using up to 32 MB of RAM , compared to just 4MB in its predecessor , the SE .
Introduced in 1989 , the SE /30 essentially marked the high point for the original Mac form factor .
Future models based loosely on this design , including the Classic and Classic II , used the same processor ( but at 16MHz ) , but were less expandable than the SE / 30 .
Which is why it's no surprise the SE / 30 became a popular server platform , and was common in data centers throughout the 1990s ( in fact , the image above shows an SE / 30 currently in use as a web server -- we 're not including a link , since we do n't want to bring it down ) .
The PowerBook 100 gets its spot on our " good " list for being Apple 's first real laptop -- and for being a lightweight , well - designed computer as well .
But it almost did n't make it .
When it was first introduced in 1991 , the PowerBook 100 sold for $ 2,500 -- far too much for a machine with a 16 MHz processor , 2MB RAM and a 20 MB hard drive .
Price cuts the following year brought it to just $ 1,000 ( though an external floppy drive was another $ 250 ) .
The PB100 proved that Apple could make a decent portable -- when they subcontracted out the design work to Sony 's portable computing team , anyway -- and began a line that would continue until this year , when Apple began dismantling the brand in favor of the MacBook ( Pro ) .
Before the iPod was even a glimmer in Apple 's eye , the company made another push into mainstream consumer electronics that , although ahead of its time , helped create the framework that allowed the digital photography market to flourish .
The first Apple camera , the QuickTake 100 ( which was built by Kodak ) , hit stores in 1994 with a VGA resolution , 1MB of internal flash memory , and JPEG , TIFF , and BMP support -- and of course , only worked with Macintosh computers .
Apple later released a Windows - compatible version of the camera called the 150 , and gave the brand its last hurrah after only three years in the form of the media card - friendly QuickTake 200 built by Fuji ( anyone remember the 5v card ? ) .
Ultimately , Kodak and fellow quick - take manufacturer Fuji went on to create their own successful digital camera businesses , and Apple stayed out of the CCD game until the 2003 introduction of the iSight .
There is n't anything very hard to " get " about the Power Mac 9500 .
It just merely contained the most muscle and most expandability of any computer Apple had ever unleashed upon the public .
Starting out at a whopping 120 or 132MHz , the machine eventually ramped up to a Photoshop - munching dual 180MHz PowerPC 604 processor before being replaced by the better looking but less ambitious 9600 .
The 9500 was the first Mac to toss those NuBus slots for the industry - standard PCI expandability , of which it had a whopping six slots .
The computer also had a daughtercard architecture , which allowed easy processor upgrades and kept the box alive well into the G3 and G4 eras .
The machine was coveted by graphic designers and musicians , and it should n't be much of a surprise to see one humming along somewhere crunching through some Pro Tools files or powering a legacy scanner .
When the iMac debuted in May of 1998 , Apple was n't doing so hot .
They 'd churned through their third CEO -- Gil Amelio -- since Jobs had been ousted in 1985 , but recently acquired Stevie 's NeXT Computer , and sat him down once more at the head of the Apple table .
With Jobs back in the driver 's seat it came time to clean house , and those beige box Power Macs and Performas needed a radical counterpoint .
Enter the Jonathan Ive-led Bondi blue Internet Mac , the iMac -- a return to Apple all - in - one basics .
No floppy , no weird plugs , no nothin ' .
Just some simple lines , some USB ports , and a low price ( for an Apple , anyway ) that sold an unreal amount of units -- well enough to lift them out of their financial funk and put them back on their way to shareholder happiness .
But not without first starting a seemingly inescapableiCliché that permeates buzzwords and marketing naming conventions even today .
Like many of Apple 's products , their displays were n't the first of their kind on the market , nor were they particularly affordable during their initial run .
But the devices really came of age as Apple launched the first mass - market widescreen LCD head to consumers in July of 2000 .
They 'd already marketed their own line of flatscreens for years , but your average user was still quite fresh to the idea of a 1600 x 1024 LCD monitor when they loosed the 22 - inch Cinema Display on the world for $ 3,999 .
We 'd like to think it unofficially ushered in the age of widescreen flat panel monitors , actually .
Of course the Apple Display Connector did n't take hold -- and proved itself something of a gadfly standard for years to come -- but the impact of the first 22 - incher was as clear as the acrylic : CRTs were dead , alright , and we 've never looked back .
The PowerBook , in its many , many incarnations , had been a laptop trendsetter since its inception .
One of the first consumer laptops available with 802.11 b -- ever heard of it ? -- even through the Sculley and Spindler years it managed to be Apple 's competitive edge targeted at businessmen and stylish consumers alike .
Which is why Jobs had something to prove when taking his first real stab at revamping their flagship portable line .
What we wound up with was the first consumer widescreen laptop , a device unique for being thinner and lighter than almost any full - size consumer laptop of its day , constructed from exotic Titanium , featuring standard WiFi , and a slot - loading DVD .
Sure the paint coating on the Titanium tended to rub off exposing the coppery - looking metal beneath , the hinges were prone to snapping , and the top of the line 500MHz / 256MB / 20 GB model would set you back $ 3,499 , but the brand was firmly cemented in the minds of consumers , and thin was officially in .
Besides the Walkman , one 's hard pressed to think of a consumer electronics brand that 's had such an impact on consumers ' lives , lifestyles , media , and the way use and understand content .
Love it or hate it , whether or not you use an iPod , have ever owned one , or were rabidly obsessed with the Rio PMP300 ( which came out three years prior ) like we were , the iPod line -- from its then overpriced $ 400 5 GB player in 2001 to its still overpriced $ 400 60 GB player now -- has captured the wallets and the imaginations of gadget lovers the world over , and set the tone for a new century of consumer electronics .
With over a billion songs sold on the iTunes Music Store for playback on the 42 million iPods alive and kicking in the world in the last five years , it 's pretty easy to see that this may be the definitive device for an entire generation .
In 2005 Jobs announced , to many an Apple users ' chagrin , that they'd be transitioning their entire line of products to Intel 's x86 processors .
There were uproarious outbursts : consumers cried foul for yet another Apple platform change , and analysts and stockholders bemoaned expected lost sales due to the Osbourne Effect .
But Apple finished their first Intel - based portable ahead of their expected schedule , and by the time the PowerBook had reached the end of the line in late 2005 , its successor , the MacBook Pro was announced .
Make no mistake about it , the PowerBook paved the way for elegant portable computing , and the MacBook , for what it 's worth , more or less rode on its coattails .
Besides losing 0.1 - inch around the waist and FireWire 800 , and gaining iSight , an Apple Remote sensor , Front Row , and , of course , Intel 's new Core Duo processor , the MacBook Pro is essentially identical to its late predecessor .
The real difference between the PowerBook and the MacBook Pro was less evident than subtly tweaked aesthetics or spec bumps ; despite years of hemming and hawing about the superiority of the G4 chip over its x86 counterparts , the Intel - based MacBook Pro handily outperformed all previous Apple portables , and signaled yet another new beginning for the company ( along with the Intel iMac and Intel Mac mini , of course ) .
We like a good Apple as much as the next guy , but if you think we 're gonna let 'em off easy for their flubs , flops , or complete misjudgments of their consumer base , well , you might not realize we dislike a bad Apple as much as the next guy , too .
Sure , they may have some regrets over the years ( seems to us like most probably come from simply pricing themselves right out of the hands of potential buyers ) but occasionallyandbecomeand , and what you wind up with is a device that people just are n't ready for yet -- or devices that just are n't ready for people yet .
Despite its commercial failure , the Apple III ( or III , if you like ) -- which was the first model designed after Apple 's incorporation -- represented a number of significant advances in the personal computing industry at the time .
Like the members of the II series before it , the 1.83MHz III and its successor the III were mass - produced MOS processor - based computer / monitor / keyboard packages with color video , audio support , and integrated BASIC .
That 's where the similarities end , though , as the III , with its $ 3,500 base price , was targeted specifically at business users and thus sported such niceties as the Sophisticated Operating System , built - in floppy drive , 256KB of RAM , and dedicated numeric keypad .
Even with these innovative features and Apple II emulation , hardware problems with the III ( which were addressed , but too late ) along with the perceived " lack of software " that has dogged Apple throughout its history , doomed the III series to a paltry sell of 65,000 and eventual abandonment in 1985 .
Yes , we 've included the Lisa in our " bad " category .
But that does n't make it a bad computer .
On the contrary , the Lisa incorporated features that were unique at the time : an optional hard drive , a document - based graphical user interface , multitasking , bundled office suite , and consumer - upgradeable innards .
It was a groundbreaking computer , far more advanced computer than the original Macintosh .
However , with an initial price tag of about $ 10,000 ( that 's almost $ 20 K in today 's dollars ) , the Lisa was doomed from the start .
Even slashing the price and rebranding it the " Macintosh XL " did n't help ; so , Lisa ends up on the " bad " list .
But if it had been positioned differently in the market and had n't had to contend with competition from the Mac , it could have easily topped the " good " list , and we could all be running LisaDraw , LisaWrite ( and presumably LisaWeb and LisaTunes ) on our iLisas and Lisa minis right now .
While we 're sure that several of you will take offense to the MessagePad series being categorized as " bad , " we 'd argue that the problematic OS , bulky design , relatively high price point , and difficulty in syncing with a PC rightfully resigned Apple 's devices and others powered by the Newton OS to market failure .
That 's not to say that the MessagePads or the OS lacked good features or were n't ahead of their time ; to the contrary , many staples of the modern PDA such as upgrade slots , flash storage for data integrity , data - sharing among PIM applications , and rotating screen orientation were standard on the platform .
Unfortunately , even regular hardware and OS upgrades , which added more storage , speed , better screens , handwriting recognition could not overcome the perceived lack of value that the original Message Pad ( $ 700 ) , 100 series ( $ 500 to $ 600 ) , 2000 series ( $ 800 to $ 1000 ) or even the QWERTY - sporting , clamshell eMate ( $ 800 ) , offered .
While Apple stopped production of the hardware and support of the software in 1998 after Jobs 2.0 axed it , there is still a fervent community of developers who continue to write drivers , software , and emulators , who will likely keep the Newton alive indefinitely .
If you 're waiting for Apple to unveil a media computer , maybe you should try looking back instead of forward .
In 1997 , the company released its 20th Anniversary Mac ( despite the fact that the company 's 20th birthday was actually a year earlier , in 1996 ) .
The flat - screen PowerPC - based computer included a Bose - designed integrated speaker system , radio and TV tuner -- along with a $ 10,000 price tag .
While it was a sleek computer that foreshadowed future flat - screen models such as the iMac G5 , it ended up being something of a bust -- even as a limited edition model -- and today you can pick one up on eBay for about $ 1,500 with upgrades including a faster processor , RAM , larger hard drive , USB , Ethernet and Firewire .
The Cube was n't a bad computer .
On the contrary , the 8 x 8 x 8 - inch Mac suspended in clear acrylic was blissfully fan free , fairly full - featured , and sexy enough to earn a place in the Museum of Modern Art alongside the original Mac .
The real problem with the Cube was two - fold : the $ 1,800 introductory price tag put the machine out of reach for most mere mortals , but the knockout punch came from the box 's lack of upgradeability .
The pros who could afford themselves a Cube ended up with G4 towers for the expandability or dual processor options .
By the time Apple started slashing prices to $ 1500 and finally $ 1300 , it was , as usual , too little too late , and the Cube was taken off assembly lines in 2001 .
Yet another in the long line of computers to be worshipped by Apple followers , but shunned by their pocket books .
Let 's face it , not every device in Apple 's career has been lustrous , no matter how illustrious Apple may be .
Now , we 're not saying that Apple 's continued success has been reliant strictly upon aesthetics , but there are a number of reasons why 1985 through 1997 were the lean years , and we do n't think John Sculley 's , Michael Spindler's , and Gil Amelio 's sense of style exactly helped .
Hey , even Jobs can't escape the fact that some serious fuglies made their way out the door under his watchful eye .
We could make a gallery of Apple 's egregiously uncomely , but we picked a few of our fav eyesores that we 're no longer cursed by the gadget gods to gaze upon ( at least not until we put together this piece , anyway ) .
Apple 's first attempt at a portable computer may not have been quite as bulky as early suitcase - sized Compaqs and Osbornes , but by the time it came out , those hulking behemoths had already been replaced by boxes closer in appearance to modern laptops .
Into this market , Apple launched a 16 - pound , non-backlit monster .
Although Apple initially claimed that the machine 's active matrix display meant it did n't need a backlight , the company later relented and added one .
But by then it was too little , too late , and the machine was mothballed in 1991 , as Apple prepared its first real laptop , the battery - powered , 5 - pound , backlit , affordable ( after a price cut ) PowerBook 100 .
The Quadra 700 kicked off the Quadra pro-line of Macs , and was Apple 's first foray into tower computers .
The Quadra line stayed at the top of the heap until 1994 when the Power Mac line came along with their too - cool - for - school PowerPC 601 processors , but for 68 k computing the Quadra was hard to beat .
The highlight of the line was easily the Quadra 840av , which was not only among the first Macs to best 33MHz , at a blazing 40 , but included video in and out capabilities , along with real time editing capabilities thanks to a special Digital Signal Processor from AT&T .
Unfortunately the first of the Quadras were n't so hot up in the face , which just goes to show that looks are n't everything , not even for Apple .
The Performa series , Apple 's foray into retail and family computing , was n't quite as aesthetically challenged as the other members of this " ugly " list -- but it was definitely the awkward teenager of the 90s Mac family .
The Performa series merely consisted of rebadged systems from their main line , starting with the Macintosh Classic ( Performa 200 ) in 1992 , and ending with the Power Macintosh 6400 ( Performa 6360 - 6420 ) in 1997 .
The real " crime " committed by Apple with the Performa was merely the sluggish computers and beige box aesthetic typical for Apples at the time , making anything bearing the Performa badge easily snubbable by the Mac elite .
The Performa was neglected by the sales staff due to relatively high prices , and suffered terribly in stores where it sat alone on the shelf , rarely making it home with shoppers who were just looking for something in the way of IBM - compatible .
During the Michael Spindler years when Apple began losing consumer interest as they increasingly attempted to pander to corporate customers , a rogue Unix box made it out the ( back ) door .
It was the Apple Network Server , a pudgy , bulbous box that ran a PowerPC chip at up to 200MHz , rook up to a gig of RAM , and had up to six 9GB hot swappable SCSI drives in RAID -- not your run of the mill Apple .
Its purpose , however , was n't entirely transparent , as its aim was to butt into the enterprise server market with a $ 11,000 - $ 19,000 price tag .
But the fact that it was an Apple rendered this monstrous non-sequitur of box almost unsaleable : corporations surely did n't want an Apple server -- running AIX or not -- in their data centers , and Apple power users neither had the money to afford one , nor the desire to learn how to use AIX .
Its sales were abysmal , and it was quickly nixed after only 14 months on the market .
There was nothing technically wrong with the " Flower Power " iMac .
The computer had plenty of power for a little bit of iMovie enjoyment , and the " SE " version even included a CD burner for enjoying Apple 's new iTunes music player .
Unfortunately , the computer was subject to one of the most hideous case designs of all time , thanks to special techniques developed by Apple that allowed them to apparently imprint drug - induced patterns onto molded plastic .
We all know Jobs and the early Apple crew were hippies -- perhaps the idea for the Flower Power came to him in an acid flashback -- but to make matters worse , it was accompanied by the almost equally atrocious " Blue Dalmatian , " and plain Jane blue iMac in the low end .
All three were quickly replaced by the much classier " Indigo " and " Snow " iMacs , leaving Flower Power and Blue Dalmatian forever relegated to enjoyable Mac- centric cartoons and the desks of a few hippies who thought the color schemes were the best thing since " Freebird . "

Rare is it to find a president whose foreign policy has imploded as dramatically and catastrophically as has that of George W. Bush .
Little more than a year after taking office , the candidate who espoused humility turned into the chief executive who embraced empire .
Four years later , the administration ’s drive for global primacy irrespective of the needs of America , interests of other nations , and wishes of other peoples has dramatically sapped Washington ’s power and influence .
Washington ’s fulminations  about defeating Iraq ’s insurgents , preventing North Korea ’s missile launches , dismantling Iran ’s nuclear program  look increasingly hollow .
Countries and movements once thought to be cowering in Uncle Sam ’s shadow now exhibit flagrant contempt for Washington ’s desires .
It is the administration determined to stay in Iraq , not its critics who advocate withdrawal , that is responsible for the fact that thousands of patriotic men and women , through no fault of their own , will die in vain .
Indeed , not just die in vain , but die in a conflict that is weakening the U.S. and making all Americans less secure .
The president says that the Iraq war is “ straining the psyche ” of America , but it is really the administration ’s botched foreign policy that is straining our psyche .
Consider the international environment on Sept. 12 , 2001 .
Terrorists had struck a shocking blow , but the U.S. held a position of enormous advantage .
America possessed the greatest military on earth , was allied with all of the major industrialized powers , and benefited from a surge of international goodwill reaching even into the Muslim world .
Al - Qaeda was hemmed in , with its leadership tied to the medieval regime in Afghanistan .
Pakistan agreed to sacrifice its ties to Kabul to back America .
Problem states like Saudi Arabia began to address Washington ’s concerns over financial and ideological support for terrorism .
Iraq was contained  impoverished through years of sanctions and threatened by hostile neighbors , most importantly Iran .
Baghdad avoided committing national suicide by attacking the U.S. or collaborating with al - Qaeda .
And , despite endless contrary claims , Iraq possessed no weapons of note , nothing with which to threaten America even if Hussein unexpectedly decided to play jihad warrior .
North Korea , though found to be cheating at the margins of its nuclear agreement with America , nevertheless was not reprocessing its existing store of plutonium .
Iran ’s foreign behavior did not match its theological fervor , and would soon indicate its interest in a dialogue with the U.S .
Washington ’s relations with Russia were good .
Ties with China had survived the spy - plane controversy .
America ’s genuine adversaries could be numbered on one hand : Cuba , Iran , Iraq , North Korea .
America had turned a financial deficit into a surplus .
Although hard feelings remained over the outcome of the disputed 2000 election , Bush would receive bipartisan backing for his handling of 9/11 , which seemed resolute yet restrained .
A poker player with this hand would sweep the pot .
A chess player in this position would play out a classic “ won game ” to collect the victory point .
A competent , knowledgeable , responsible president in this situation would ensure America ’s long - term influence while disarming ongoing security threats .
Unfortunately , we did not possess a competent , knowledgeable , responsible president .
Which explains the world in which America finds itself today .
The U.S. remains the planet ’s premier military power , but at enormous expense : Washington accounts for roughly half of the globe ’s military spending , but is flushing much of that down the Iraqi sewer .
Gross strategic error and practical mismanagement have left the military badly stretched .
The services are maintaining force levels only by lowering enlistment standards and are ill - prepared to handle another serious military contingency .
Perhaps even worse , America ’s illusion of invincibility has been shattered .
As military historian Andrew Bacevich has noted , Muslim insurgents and terrorists have figured out how to counteract America ’s unquestioned military superiority .
The Europeans , Japan , and South Korea remain our allies , but their willingness to back U.S. initiatives is much diminished .
France is dedicated to limiting American power , British Prime Minister Tony Blair is being forced out of office largely because of his support for the Bush administration , and other politicians deemed too friendly to the U.S. have been defeated by angry electorates .
Where friends of Bush have prevailed , such as Australia ’s Prime Minister John Howard , it is despite rather than because they joined with Washington .
Global good will toward America has vanished .
Numbering the countries in which the people support Washington ’s policies is easy  India , Israel , Kuwait .
The U.S. has gone from sympathetic victim to arrogant victimizer .
Hatred of American policies is especially strong among Muslims , stretching from the Mideast to Indonesia to Europe .
Al - Qaeda has been damaged , but a multitude of loose affiliates and independent imitators have sprung up around the world , with more terrorists active than before .
What seemed to be a clear success in Afghanistan is dissolving into civil war and potential chaos , with the arrival of suicide bombing , the tactic of choice in Iraq .
Pakistan , exposed as the globe ’s worst nuclear proliferator , wobbles dangerously as it plays a double game involving Islamists and the West .
Saudi Arabia makes a mockery of the administration ’s emphasis on democracy while funding Wahhabi clerics and madrassas even in America .
These and other “ friendly ” states are under increased pressure as the vision of the U.S. and its ally Israel daily killing Muslims continues to intensify anti-American feeling .
Then there is Iraq .
The U.S. invasion and occupation have created a seething sectarian cauldron .
Ugly authoritarian stability has been replaced by horrific unpredictable slaughter .
Thousands of Americans and tens of thousands of Iraqis have died ; jihadists have gained a vivid recruiting poster for adherents worldwide ; an entire country has become a training ground for urban terrorists .
The so - called Democratic People ’s Republic of Korea has gone from the potential of one or two atomic bombs to a dozen .
Washington ’s refusal to negotiate has only encouraged Kim Jong - Il to play his favorite game of brinkmanship .
Iran , too , appears to be ever more speedily developing nuclear weapons , as America ’s demands seem to have only spurred its efforts .
At the same time , Washington removed Tehran ’s greatest enemy and restraining force by defenestrating Hussein .
Relations with Russia have noticeably cooled , with Washington denouncing President Vladimir Putin ’s turn toward authoritarianism , barring Russia ’s entry into the World Trade Organization , and ignoring Moscow ’s perceived regional interests .
There is less name - calling with China , but Beijing is quietly working with other states to counter American power .
And U.S. policy has left a herd of nations , well beyond its core antagonists , dedicated to limiting its power .
Indeed , the Bush administration has helped bring into being a new international tactic : “ balking . ”
Although Washington ’s critics did not feel so threatened as to organize militarily , they are increasingly prepared to resist and frustrate America ’s demands .
U.S. protestations of its unique benevolence and good will merely serve to encourage opposition .
The Republican executive and legislature have proved to be the most spendthrift government in the last four decades .
Massive deficits will spill forth in coming years , with an explosion of outlays as the population begins growing rapidly older .
And any sense of bipartisanship disappeared in the midst of administration manipulation , deceit , ignorance , incompetence , partisanship , and demagoguery .
That Democratic politicians would attack the administration was inevitable ; that Democratic voters would almost unanimously , and almost all passionately , despise the administration was not .
It is an astonishing record .
Of course , instability and violence overseas are not all President Bush ’s fault .
The seeds of many conflicts were planted long ago .
Counterproductive U.S. policies in the Mideast have been creating enemies for decades .
Other nations would pursue interests at variance with those of America irrespective of who occupies the Oval Office .
Moreover , the administration has been silently shifting away from its most flagrantly arrogant and unilateral behavior .
Still , the president who takes responsibility for nothing is in fact responsible for much .
With a record so bad , his political success is particularly astounding .
Indeed , the president must be recognized as an electoral marvel .
Short on factual analysis , he remains good with empty sound bites about America being attacked , the importance of promoting freedom , and defeating terrorists .
Never mind his resemblance to the man who murders his parents and then asks for mercy as an orphan :
Bush points at the train wrecks that he has caused as the reason to keep him on as the train ’s engineer .
In both 2000 and 2004 , President Bush was able to use a certain populist charm to counteract the fact that he is ill - informed and simplistic , without the slightest intellectual curiosity .
With the temperament of a college jock or frat boy , he makes gut - level decisions , does n’t recognize the possibility of mistakes , refuses to revisit his past handiwork , views opposition as disloyalty , and avoids holding people responsible .
Yet he built an intense , if limited following , and was able push through the most divisive policies on narrow votes along partisan lines .
Even as his foreign initiatives failed , and , in the case of Iraq , failed dramatically , he was able to energize supporters with self - serving calls to rally around the flag .
Only with his popularity falling even among conservatives and Republicans in 2006 did it appear that his divide , polarize , and conquer strategy might finally fail .
That his presidency is different is evident in how he has not only polarized the electorate , but traditional political constituencies .
Six years after his election , all that matters is the war .
The Left has been reduced to snarling impotence , raging at the mere mention of his name .
But a coterie of would - be liberal warriors  well - represented at the New Republic , among Democratic legislators , and in hard leftists such as Christopher Hitchens  backed Bush despite his apostasy on so many other issues .
Similarly , most on the Right rallied around Bush , even though he routinely sacrificed deeply held conservative principles , such as fiscal responsibility and federalism .
Those who once backed tough - minded but limited containment of communism and derided mushy - headed liberalism under Jimmy Carter joined President Bush in hoisting Woodrow Wilson as their role model , advocating warmongering in the name of peace .
A much smaller faction , however , consisting of libertarians , paleoconservatives , and traditionalists , resisted , finding more in common with leftist critics of Bush than with their allies of years , even decades .
On both sides , the division has led to bitter antagonisms .
Longtime friends and allies have been read out of their respective political movements because of their positions on Iraq and the foreign policy vision behind it .
The old Humpty Dumpty of political coalitions might well take years to put back together , if it ever is .
In yet another way , George Bush ’s impact will live on well past his term in office .
Obviously , there are many important issues that distinguish competing political candidates .
Today , however , there is only one decisive issue : America ’s foreign policy .
George W. Bush ’s domestic performance has been poor .
His international performance has been catastrophic .
Where competence , nuance , humility , and caution were called for , he provided deceit , ineptitude , recklessness , and ignorance .
On virtually every individual issue  Iraq , Afghanistan , Russia , North Korea , Iran , Europe , and more  the administration has blundered .
But the destructive whole is greater than the malign sum of the parts .
Most of America ’s unique advantages of just five years ago have been tossed away .
The United States today is weaker , more isolated , and more vulnerable because of the Bush administration ’s policies .
To whom much is given , much is expected , explains the Bible .
And to whom was more given than George W. Bush , who was entrusted with the care of the most powerful nation on earth ?
He has violated that trust .
“ We live in troubled times , ” the president says with unusual understatement , “ but I ’m confident in our capacity to not only protect the homeland but in our capacity to leave behind a better world . ”
America indeed has such an ability , but those goals are likely to be realized only under a different president .
With more than two years left of his presidency , Americans must do everything possible to reduce any further harm he can wreak .

Measurement
“ Thank you for calling Amazon.com , may I help you ? ”
Then — Click !
You ’re cut off .
That ’s annoying .
You just waited 10 minutes to get through to a human and you mysteriously got disconnected right away .
Or is it mysterious ?
According to Mike Daisey , Amazon rated their customer service representatives based on the number of calls taken per hour .
The best way to get your performance rating up was to hang up on customers , thus increasing the number of calls you can take every hour .
An aberration , you say ?
When Jeff Weitzen took over Gateway , he instituted a new policy to save money on customer service calls .
“ Reps who spent more than 13 minutes talking to a customer did n’t get their monthly bonuses , ” writes Katrina Brooker ( Business 2.0 , April 2001 ) .
“ As a result , workers began doing just about anything to get customers off the phone : pretending the line was n’t working , hanging up , or often–at great expense–sending them new parts or computers .
Not surprisingly , Gateway ’s customer satisfaction rates , once the best in the industry , fell below average . ”
It seems like any time you try to measure the performance of knowledge workers , things rapidly disintegrate , and you get what Robert D. Austin calls measurement dysfunction .
His book Measuring and Managing Performance in Organizations is an excellent and thorough survey of the subject .
Managers like to implement measurement systems , and they like to tie compensation to performance based on these measurement systems .
But in the absence of 100 % supervision , workers have an incentive to “ work to the measurement , ” concerning themselves solely with the measurement and not with the actual value or quality of their work .
Software organizations tend to reward programmers who ( a ) write lots of code and ( b ) fix lots of bugs .
The best way to get ahead in an organization like this is to check in lots of buggy code and fix it all , rather than taking the extra time to get it right in the first place .
When you try to fix this problem by penalizing programmers for creating bugs , you create a perverse incentive for them to hide their bugs or not tell the testers about new code they wrote in hopes that fewer bugs will be found .
You ca n’t win .
Fortune 500 CEOs are usually compensated with base salary plus stock options .
The stock options are often worth tens or hundreds of millions of dollars , which makes the base pay almost inconsequential .
As a result CEOs do everything they can to inflate the price of the stock , even if it comes at the cost of bankrupting or ruining the company ( as we ’re seeing again and again in the headlines this month . )
They ’ll do this even if the stock only goes up temporarily , and then sell at the peak .
Compensation committees are slow to respond , but their latest brilliant idea is to require the executive to hold the stock until they leave the company .
Terrific .
Now the incentive is to inflate the price of the stock temporarily and then quit .
You ca n’t win , again .
Do n’t take my word for it , read Austin ’s book and you ’ll understand why this measurement dysfunction is inevitable when you ca n’t completely supervise workers ( which is almost always ) .
I ’ve long claimed that incentive pay is n’t such a hot idea , even if you could measure who was doing a good job and who was n’t , but Austin reinforces this by showing that you ca n’t even measure performance , so incentive pay is even less likely to work .

My Side Project :
The great accomplishment of late - twentieth - century cosmology was putting together a complete inventory of the universe .
We can tell a story that fits all the known data , in which ordinary matter ( every particle ever detected in any experiment ) constitutes only about 5 % of the energy of the universe , with 25 % being dark matter and 70 % being dark energy .
The challenge for early - twenty - first - century cosmology will actually be to understand the nature of these mysterious dark components .
A beautiful new result illuminating ( if you will ) the dark matter in galaxy cluster 1E 0657 - 56 is an important step in this direction .
( Here 's the press release , and an article in the Chandra Chronicles . )
A prerequisite to understanding the dark sector is to make sure we are on the right track .
Can we be sure that we have n't been fooled into believing in dark matter and dark energy ?
After all , we only infer their existence from detecting their gravitational fields ; stronger - than - expected gravity in galaxies and clusters leads us to posit dark matter , while the acceleration of the universe ( and the overall geometry of space ) leads us to posit dark energy .
Could it perhaps be that gravity is modified on the enormous distance scales characteristic of these phenomena ?
Einstein 's general theory of relativity does a great job of accounting for the behavior of gravity in the Solar System and astrophysical systems like the binary pulsar , but might it be breaking down over larger distances ?
A departure from general relativity on very large scales is n't what one would expect on general principles .
In most physical theories that we know and love , modifications are expected to arise on small scales ( higher energies ) , while larger scales should behave themselves .
But , we have to keep an open mind -- in principle , it 's absolutely possible that gravity could be modified , and it 's worth taking seriously .
Furthermore , it would be really cool .
Personally , I would prefer to explain cosmological dynamics using modified gravity instead of dark matter and dark energy , just because it would tell us something qualitatively different about how physics works .
( And Vera Rubin agrees . )
We would all love to out - Einstein Einstein by coming up with a better theory of gravity .
But our job is n't to express preferences , it 's to suggest hypotheses and then go out and test them .
The problem is , how do you test an idea as vague as " modifying general relativity " ?
You can imagine testing specific proposals for how gravity should be modified , like Milgrom 's MOND , but in more general terms we might worry that any observations could be explained by some modification of gravity .
But it 's not quite so bad -- there are reasonable features that any respectable modification of general relativity ought to have .
Specifically , we expect that the gravitational force should point in the direction of its source , not off at some bizarrely skewed angle .
So if we imagine doing away with dark matter , we can safely predict that gravity always be pointing in the direction of the ordinary matter .
That 's interesting but not immediately helpful , since it 's natural to expect that the ordinary matter and dark matter cluster in the same locations ; even if there is dark matter , it 's no surprise to find the gravitational field pointing toward the visible matter as well .
What we really want is to take a big cluster of galaxies and simply sweep away all of the ordinary matter .
Dark matter , by hypothesis , does n't interact directly with ordinary matter , so we can imagine moving the ordinary stuff while leaving the dark stuff behind .
If we then check back and determine where the gravity is , it should be pointing either at the left - behind dark matter ( if there is such a thing ) or still at the ordinary matter ( if not ) .
Happily , the universe has done exactly this for us .
In the Bullet Cluster , more formally known as 1E 0657 - 56 , we actually find two clusters of galaxies that have ( relatively ) recently passed right through each other .
It turns out that the large majority ( about 90 % ) of ordinary matter in a cluster is not in the galaxies themselves , but in hot X - ray emitting intergalactic gas .
As the two clusters passed through each other , the hot gas in each smacked into the gas in the other , while the individual galaxies and the dark matter ( presumed to be collisionless ) passed right through .
Here 's an mpeg animation of what we think happened .
As hinted at in last week 's NASA media advisory , astrophysicists led by Doug Clowe ( Arizona ) and Maxim Markevitch ( CfA ) have now compared images of the gas obtained by the Chandra X - ray telescope to " maps " of the gravitational field deduced from weak lensing observations .
Their short paper is astro - ph / 0608407 , and a longer one on lensing is astro -ph / 0608408 .
And the answer is : there 's definitely dark matter there !
Despite the super - secret embargoed nature of this result , enough hints were given in the media advisory and elsewhere on the web that certain scientific sleuths were basically able to figure out what was going on .
But they did n't have access to the best part : pictures !
Here is 1E 0657 - 56 in all its glory , or at least some of it's glory -- this is the optical image , in which you can see the actual galaxies .
With some imagination it should n't be too hard to make out the two separate concentrations of galaxies , a larger one on the left and a smaller one on the right .
These are pretty clearly clusters , but you can take redshifts to verify that they 're all really at the same location in the universe , not just a random superposition of galaxies at very different distances .
Even better , you can map out the gravitational fields of the clusters , using weak gravitational lensing .
That is , you take very precise pictures of galaxies that are in the background of these clusters .
The images of the background galaxies are gently distorted by the gravitational field of the clusters .
The distortion is so gentle that you could never tell it was there if you only looked at one galaxy ; but with more than a hundred galaxies , you begin to notice that the images are systematically aligned , characteristic of passing through a coherent gravitational lens .
From these distortions it 's possible to work backwards and ask " what kind of mass concentration could have created such a gravitational lens ? "
Here 's the answer , superimposed on the optical image .
It 's about what you would expect : the dark matter is concentrated in the same regions as the galaxies themselves .
But we can separately make X - ray observations to map out the hot gas , which constitutes most of the ordinary ( baryonic ) matter in the cluster .
Here 's what we see .
This is why it's the " Bullet " cluster -- the bullet - shaped region on the right is a shock front .
These two clusters have passed right through each other , creating an incredibly energetic collision between the gas in each of them .
The fact that the " bullet " is so sharply defined indicates that the clusters are moving essentially perpendicular to our line of sight .
This collision has done exactly what we want -- it 's swept out the ordinary matter from the clusters , displacing it with respect to the dark matter ( and the galaxies , which act as collisionless particles for these purposes ) .
You can see it directly by superimposing the weak - lensing map and the Chandra X - ray image .
Clicking on each of these images leads to a higher - resolution version .
If you have a tabbed browser , the real fun is opening each of the images in a separate tab and clicking back and forth .
The gravitational field , as reconstructed from lensing observations , is not pointing toward the ordinary matter .
That 's exactly what you 'd expect if you believed in dark matter , but makes no sense from the perspective of modified gravity .
If these pictures do n't convince you that dark matter exists , I do n't know what will .
So is this the long - anticipated ( in certain circles ) end of MOND ?
What need do we have for modified gravity if there clearly is dark matter ?
Truth is , it was already very difficult to explain the dynamics of clusters ( as opposed to individual galaxies ) in terms of MOND without invoking anything but ordinary matter .
Even MOND partisans generally agree that some form of dark matter is necessary to account for cluster dynamics and cosmology .
It 's certainly conceivable that we are faced with both modified gravity and dark matter .
If the dark matter is sufficiently " warm , " it might fail to accumulate in galaxies , but still be important for clusters .
Needless to say , the picture begins to become somewhat baroque and unattractive .
But the point is not whether or not MOND remains interesting ; after all , someone else might come up with a different theory of modified gravity tomorrow that can fit both galaxies and clusters .
The point is that , independently of any specific model of modified gravity , we now know that there definitely is dark matter out there .
It will always be possible that some sort of modification of gravity lurks just below our threshold of detection ; but now we have established beyond reasonable doubt that we need a substantial amount of dark matter to explain cosmological dynamics .
That 's huge news for physicists .
Theorists now know what to think about ( particle - physics models of dark matter ) and experimentalists know what to look for ( direct and indirect detection of dark matter particles , production of dark matter candidates at accelerators ) .
The dark matter is n't just ordinary matter that 's not shining ; limits from primordial nucleosynthesis and the cosmic microwave background imply a strict upper bound on the amount of ordinary matter , and it's not nearly enough to account for all the matter we need .
This new result does n't tell us which particle the new dark matter is , but it confirms that there is such a particle .
We 're definitely making progress on the crucial project of understanding the inventory of the universe .
What about dark energy ?
The characteristic features of dark energy are that it is smooth ( spread evenly throughout space ) and persistent ( evolving slowly , if at all , with time ) .
In particular , dark energy does n't accumulate in dense regions such as galaxies or clusters -- it 's the same everywhere .
So these observations do n't tell us anything directly about the nature of the 70 % of the universe that is purportedly in this ultra-exotic component .
In fact we know rather less about dark energy than we do about dark matter , so we have more freedom to speculate .
It 's still quite possible that the acceleration of the universe can be explained by modifying gravity rather than invoking a mysterious new dark component .
One of our next tasks , then , is obviously to come up with experiments that might distinguish between dark energy and modified gravity -- and some of us are doing our best .
Stay tuned , as darkness gradually encroaches upon our universe , and Einstein continues to have the last laugh .
Frau Voltaire und nackte Islamisten Thomas Pany
" Like porn " - Eine neue Heldin der Meinungsfreiheit
Der Westen hat eine neue Heldin .
Der deutschen Öffentlichkeit sagt der Name Dr. Wafa Sultan noch nichts , aber das könnte sich ändern .
Im englischsprachigen Netz ist die syrisch - amerikanische Psychiaterin eine Berühmtheit , eine " internationale Sensation " .
Eine Million Mal wurde das Wafa - Sultan - Video im Internet angeschaut , Hunderttausende von Mails sollen es verbreitet haben .
Dazu dürften ein paar Millionen Fernsehzuschauer in der arabischen
Welt kommen , die ihre beiden spektakulären Auftritte in Talk - Shows von al - Jazeera direkt verfolgt haben .
Beim ersten Al - Jazeera - Auftritt Ende Juli des vergangenen Jahres lieferte die muslimisch erzogene Frau , die jedoch den Islam nicht mehr praktiziert und sich selbst als „ säkular “ bezeichnet , einen couragierten Schlagabtausch mit dem algerischen Islamisten Ahmad bin Muhammad über Terrorismus und religiöse Erziehung .
Dieser konnte auf ihre provokanten Fragen und Behauptungen nur ausweichend antworten .
Wafa Sultan stellte dem algerischen Religionsgelehrten sehr direkte Fragen , die wohl jeder beantwortet haben möchte :
Wie es dazu käme , dass sich Jugendliche in der Blüte ihres Lebens mit einer Bombe in einen Bus setzen und sich und andere in die Luft sprengen ?
Wie sich der Kleriker dazu stelle , dass man Kindern im Religionsunterricht schon in den frühesten Jahren mit dem Auswendiglernen von bestimmten Koranversen - " They will be killed or crucified , or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off " - konfrontiere , ohne ihnen eine Interpretation oder eine Einordnung in den historischen Kontext beizugeben .
Dies sei doch der erste Schritt zur Schaffung eines „ großen Terroristen “ .
„ Wir haben nicht einen einzigen Juden gesehen , der sich in einem deutschen Restaurant in die Luft gesprengt hat “
Berühmt gemacht hat sie jetzt ihr zweiter Auftritt bei Al - Jazeera , Ende Februar dieses Jahres ( Transkript - Auszüge hier ) .
Gegenüber dem diesmaligen Talk - Show - Gast , Dr. Ibrahim Al - Khoul , einem Religionsgelehrten , der sich u.a. mit Fragen zur „ Krise des zeitgenössischen religiösen Denkens und wie man sie überwindet “ auseinandersetzt , packte sie noch größere Kaliber aus .
Zunächst konfrontierte sie ihren Opponenten mit dem weidlich bekannten , populären Generalangriff , der sich an der rückständigen „ Mentalität “ der muslimischen Welt entzündet .
Für Wafa Sultan steht außer Frage , dass wir derzeit einen Clash zwischen unterschiedlichen Mentalitäten erleben ; kein Streit zwischen Religionen , auch nicht zwischen Zivilisationen , sondern zwischen unterschiedlichen Epochen .
It is a clash between a mentality that belongs to the Middle Ages and another mentality that belongs to the 21st century .
It is a clash between civilization and backwardness , between the civilized and the primitive , between barbarity and rationality .
It is a clash between freedom and oppression , between democracy and dictatorship .
It is a clash between human rights , on the one hand , and the violation of these rights , on other hand .
It is a clash between those who treat women like beasts , and those who treat them like human beings .
What we see today is not a clash of civilizations .
Civilizations do not clash , but compete .
Das kann man auch im Taxi hören , aber der Vergleich , den sie später bringt , hat es in sich .
Und es ist so erfrischend wie mutig , dass er von ihr in einer arabischen TV - Sendung platziert wurde :
Die Juden haben eine große Tragödie ( dem Holocaust ) durchlebt und die Welt dazu gebracht , sie zu respektieren , mit ihrem Wissen , nicht mit Terror , mit ihrer Arbeit , nicht mit Weinen und Klagen .
Die Menschheit verdankt jüdischen Wissenschaftlern die meisten der wissenschaftlichen Entdeckungen im 19 .
und 20 .
Jahrhundert .
15 Millionen Menschen , die in aller
Welt verstreut waren , vereinigten sich und erwarben ihre Rechte durch Arbeit und Wissen .
Wir haben nicht einen einzigen Juden gesehen , der sich in einem deutschen Restaurant in die Luft gesprengt hat .
Wir haben keinen einzigen Juden gesehen , der eine Kirche zerstört hat .
Wir haben keinen einzigen Juden gesehen , der protestierte , in dem er Menschen tötete .
Muslime haben drei Buddhastatuen zu Staub gemacht .
Es gibt keinen Buddhisten , der eine Moschee angezündet hatte , einen Muslim getötet hat oder eine Botschaft verbrannt .
Nur Muslime verteidigen ihren Glauben , indem sie Kirchen abbrennen , Menschen töten und Botschaften zerstören .
Dieser
Weg wird keine Ergebnisse bringen .
Die Muslime müsse sich selbst fragen , was sie für die Menschheit tun können , bevor sie von der Menschheit Respekt verlangen können .
Im Transkript der Sendung , wie es in Ausschnitten bei MEMRI ( nicht unüblich bei diesem Übersetzungsdienst , der gerne vor allem eine Seite zu Gehör bringt ) zu lesen ist , steht keine Antwort des muslimischen Gelehrten auf diesen Diskussionspunkt .
Schon zuvor hatte Dr. Al - Khoul ziemlich hilflos erklärt , dass er die blasphemischen Äußerungen von Dr. Sultan nicht zurechtweisen müsse , da sie offensichtlich eine Häretikerin sei .
Die in die USA emigrierte Syrerin hatte zuvor erklärt , dass sie weder eine Christin , noch Muslima , noch eine Jüdin sei , sondern ein säkularer Mensch ohne Glauben an ein übernatürliches Wesen .
„ Like porn for moderate Muslims “
Seit das Video der Sendung im Netz kursiert , wird Wafa Sultan nun als mutige Heldin der Meinungsfreiheit gefeiert .
Für den saudi- arabischen Blogger The Religious Policeman ( vgl. Die Mission des Religionspolizisten ) ist sie seine „ neue beste Freundin “ und das al - Jazeera - Video „ like porn for moderate Muslims “ .
Der niederländische Schriftsteller Leon de Winter , der für die Zeitung „ Die Welt “ einen englisch - sprachigen Blog betreibt , feiert die „ Ankunft eines muslimischen Voltaires “ .
Die New York Times widmete Sultan ein ausführliches Porträt in der Wochenendausgabe .
Im Newsletter ( 3. März ) der israelischen Botschaft zitiert man einen Ha’aretz - Kommentar , der bemerkt , „ dass sich in der arabischen Welt ein Wandel vollzieht , zumindest in Bezug auf den Mut , öffentlich seine Meinung kundzutun .
Im Rahmen dieser Offenheit können sich Israel und der Zionismus kaum eine strengere , schnellere und resolutere Sprecherin wünschen als Sultan .
Benyamin Netanyahu und Effi Eitam sind im Vergleich mit ihr schon fast links . “
Neue Öffentlichkeiten der arabischen Welt
Genau hier zeigt sich ein bemerkenswertes Phänomen im Zusammenhang mit der Wiedergeburt von Voltaire als Ex-Muslima .
Die Öffentlichkeit in der arabischen
Welt ist schon längst im Wandel , man will es in der vorherrschenden , regelmäßig aufgetischten Polemik über die eindimensionale , rückständige arabische Kultur nur nicht sehen - Al - Jazeera gilt vielen als bloßes Sprachrohr für Terroristen und Extremisten .
Ironischerweise wird selbst auf der Webseite , auf der Wafa Sultan publiziert , was ihr die Einladung des TV - Sender eingetragen hat , Al - Jazeera als bevorzugter Sender Bin Ladens bezeichnet .
Mit diesem simplifizierenden Feindbild steht „ annaqed “ ( „ Kritik “ ) , so heißt die Seite , in den USA nicht alleine da : Bush wollte die Sendezentrale von al - Dschasira in Katar bombadieren .
Tatsächlich zählt der Moderator der beiden Talk - Shows , in denen Sultan auftrat , Faisal al - Qassem , zu den bekanntesten Persönlichkeiten der arabischen Welt .
Seine Popularität hat er mit Sendungen erworben , die extrem kontroverse Standpunkte an ein großes Publikum verbreiten .
In seinem neu erschienen Buch „ Voices of the New Arab Public “ dokumentiert dies der amerikanische Experte für arabische Öffentlichkeiten , Marc Lynch ( vgl. USA vs. Demokratie " Arab Style " ) auf zig Seiten .
Am Tag nach dem Sultan / Al - Khoul - Debatte , so Lynch in seinem Blog , wagte sich al - Qassem an die Privilegien der Sicherheitskräfte und Militärs in arabischen Ländern :
Shows featuring secularists and Islamists arguing with each other are important , but not especially unusual .
Shows taking on the protections and prerogatives of Arab security services , and giving full voice to those who demand that they be held legally accountable when they violate the law - now that 's unusual , and revolutionary ( not unprecedented on al - Jazeera shows , but still fairly extraordinary ) .
Entsprechend nüchtern kommentiert Lynch auch die „ hyperventilierenden “ Reaktionen der amerikanischen Medien auf die al - Jazeera - Talk - Show mit Sultan .
Dass auf Al - Jazeera einem Islamisten gehörig die Kleider heruntergerissen wurden , sei in etwa so spektakulär wie ein " Dunking " in der amerikanischen Elite - Basketballliga NBA .
Für Lynch stehen die Programme , die Faisal al - Qassem auf al - Jazeera präsentiert , seine Argumentationsweise , die Auswahl der Gäste und Stimmen , seine provokanten Fragestellungen , für eine Entwicklung , die schon seit einigen Jahren , vom Westen weitgehend unbeachtet , ihren Gang nimmt : die Ausbildung neuer öffentlicher Sphären , die dem früheren Konsensdiktat , wie er beispielsweise in den staatlichen Fernsehsendern üblich war , längst abgeschworen haben und „ eindeutig die arabische politische Kultur transformieren .

It ai n’t easy , picking out evil - doers in the urban canyons of the Middle East ; there are so many places to hide .
Taking ‘em out can be even harder , what with all those noncombatants hanging nearby .
But the Air Force thinks it might have an answer to this most vexing problem in counter - insurgency : frisbees .
Not just any frisbees , mind you .
Robotic frisbees .
Heavily armed robotic frisbees .
The Air Force recently tapped Triton Systems , out of Chelmsford , Mass , to develop such a “ Modular Disc - Wing Urban Cruise Munition . “
“ The 3 - D maneuverability of the Frisbee - UAV [ unammned aerial vehicle ] will provide revolutionary tactical access and lethality against hostiles hiding in upper story locations and / or defiladed behind obstacles , ” the company promises .
The circular drones will be lanuched “ from munitions dispensers or by means of a simple mechanism similar to a shotgun target ( skeet ) launcher , ” Triton adds .
Once in the air , they ’ll be tele - operated by soldiers on the ground .
Or , if needed , the fightin ’ frisbees will pilot themselves as they hunt for guerrillas .
Once they catch up to the baddies , the drones will use a series of armor - piercing explosives , shooting jets of molten metal , to eliminate their targets .
And these MEFP [ Multiple Explosively Formed Penetrator ] “ warheads will be controllable so as to provide a single large fragment ( bunker - buster ) or tailorable pattern of smaller fragments ( unprotected infantry or light utility vehicles ) . ”
The decision of whether to go bunker - buster or infantry - annihilator mode can either be determined by the drones ’ human operators , “ or autonomous target classification routine built into the UAV . “
Now , Triton ’s Frisbee - UAV concept is n’t the first time roboticists have looked into disc - shaped drones .
From 1992 to 1998 , the Navy experimented with a set of unmanned , 250 - pound , six - foot - diameter flying saucers .
In 2002 , Norweigan researchers showed off plans for a circular flying robot “ inspired at least partly by the design of Star Trek ’s USS Enterprise , ” New Scientist noted .
Around the same time , at the University of Manchester , Jonathan Potts studied how best to control UAVs “ based on the Frisbee TM sports disc shape . “
“ The Frisbee disc has proven its potential on the sports field as a platform for short free - flights , ” Potts wrote back in an ’01 paper .
Without “ predefined flight orientation , ” a Frisbee drone “ offers novel flight characteristics and manoeuvrability .
It is potentially suitable for a variety of mission objectives fulfilling surveillance , communications , munitions and / or airborne radar warning systems . “
These days , Potts is focusing less on Frisbee - shaped robots — and more on Frisbee competitors .
“ In recent years Jonny has applied his scientific knowledge to develop a range of sports discs with improved aerodynamic performance , ” says the website of his new company , which makes a line of “ super - durable ” spinners for $ 16 apiece .
Explosives and robotic controls are not included .

Cuban , co-founder of HDNet and owner of the NBA 's Dallas Mavericks , also said YouTube would eventually be " sued into oblivion " because of copyright violations .
" They are just breaking the law , " Cuban told a group of advertisers in New York .
" The only reason it has n't been sued yet is because there is nobody with big money to sue . "

From ABC JENNIFER MACEY : Since last year 's Cronulla riots , the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination board has been inundated by calls from Muslim Australians .
One of those calls came from a grade 11 student at Blakehurst High School in Sydney 's south - east , who lodged a complaint against his legal studies teacher for calling him a terrorist .
Wagih Zac
Fares says he 's still hurt by the comment made in front of his classmates .
WAGIH ZAC FARES : I put my bag on the table , looking for a chair to sit at .
I asked the girl next to that chair if the chair was free and her reply was yes .
I sat down next to her , and on that table was her magazine , and I began flicking through it .
Mr Seymour then approached me , and said give me the magazine , in that aggressive tone right from the beginning .
I said sir , please can I just put the magazine back in her bag ?
He said no , you 've come into my classroom , you 've moved desks , and that 's when he outburst ( sic ) , said no , I do n't want to negotiate with a terrorist .
When he said that it hit me , and I was shocked , I was embarrassed , I was just humiliated .
And everyone stopped talking , all conversations dropped and looked at me .
Emotions were building up .
That 's when I banged the table and said sir , that 's wrong .
And unable to control my emotions , I began screaming out , I 'm not a terrorist .
How can you call me a terrorist ?
I ran out of the classroom , punching walls , screaming I 'm not a terrorist , how can you call me a terrorist ?
JENNIFER MACEY : Wagih Fares says he ran from the classroom and was followed by his teacher , who apologised .
When he returned to the school he picked up tables and threw them .
He says he has n't been able to return to his legal studies class and now wants the teacher transferred to another school .
WAGIH FARES : I cannot continue my education and to achieve my personal goals and go on to uni with this teacher there now .
The Department did take a while to come out with a result , and the result was that I had to either move schools , drop the subject , or do in - school tutoring , where I have to do ... make the decisions , where I 've done nothing wrong .
It should be the teacher that must make the decision .
JENNIFER MACEY : The State 's Education Department has investigated the incident and disciplined the teacher .
The investigation found that the teacher had n't intended to embarrass or humiliate the student .
The Department 's Regional Director Dr Phil Lambert says the teacher is truly sorry .
From National Nine News
A year on from the Cronulla riots , it 's words , not actions , that are causing pain .
Blakehurst High student Wagih Fares was called a terrorist by his legal studies teacher .
The conflict today is whether an apology and counselling is punishment enough .
I met Wagih , his parents and brothers and sisters at their Brighton Le Sands home this morning .
They offered coffee to reporters and unwavering support for Wagih 's stand .
" It 's painful , " Wagih said .
" It 's more than words . "
There 's no doubt that for this Lebanese Muslim family the teacher 's words caused deep wounds .
" We are Australians .
My children were born in Australia , " Wagih 's mother said .
Wagih claims that in June he was told in a " loud and very aggressive voice " by legal studies teacher , Michael Seymour , to hand over a magazine .
When he refused the teacher responded : " I do n't want to negotiate with a terrorist . "
The Department of Education 's regional director of schools Phil Lambert said today the teacher had admitted his mistake and apologised .
" In the heat of the moment he said those words and he regrets having said them . "
...
" He was there to have a go at me , " replied Wagih .
" I do n't know why .
Maybe because I'm Lebanese . "
The Fares family want the teacher fired or transferred so that Wagih can return to his legal studies class .
The Education Department believes the teacher has learned his lesson the hard way .
An Anti Discrimination Board investigation will make the final call on whether the teachers remorseful actions are punishment enough for his painful words .
From AAP
" I 've done nothing wrong and to be called that word it 's painful .
It is painful , that 's a good word to describe it , disgusted , it 's still hitting me now , it still gets me now , " Wagih said on Channel 10 .
ASKED for a sound - check at a function in Delhi this month , Bill Gates eschewed the “ 1,2,3 ... ” favoured by ordinary mortals .
“ One billion , 2 billion ... , ” he counted .
They think big , these IT moguls , and especially , these days , in India .
Microsoft later announced plans to invest $ 1.7 billion in India over the next four years , about half of it in adding to its existing research and development ( R&D ) and technical - support operations .
“ The only thing that limits us in India , ” Mr Gates told the local press , “ is the speed at which we can recruit . ”
A few days earlier , Intel , a giant chipmaker , had unveiled plans to invest more than $ 1 billion over five years , much of it in expanding its R&D centre in Bangalore .
In October Cisco Systems , the world 's largest maker of the routers and switches that direct internet traffic , announced its own plans to invest $ 1.1 billion in India .
The euphoria is confined neither to American multinationals , nor to information technology .
It also encompasses India 's own IT industries , and the expanding range of other back - office services that can now be performed remotely .
The three biggest Indian IT - services firms — Tata Consultancy Services ( TCS ) , Infosys and Wipro — are each recruiting more than 1,000 people a month .
And to take just one example of the other services now moving to India , J.P. Morgan Chase , a big investment bank , this month revealed it is to double , to about 9,000 , its staff there .
Anyone who assumes J.P. Morgan will simply be doing low - level “ back office ” tasks in the country — a bit of data entry and paper - shuffling — would be flat wrong .
One task for the new recruits is to settle complex structured - finance and derivative deals , what one insider calls “ some of the most sophisticated transactions in the world ” .
All these investments illustrate that a third stage of the great Indian services - export boom is well underway .
In the first , firms such as TCS developed world - class expertise in software “ application development and maintenance ” , and their low - cost developers became the preferred partners of many Western IT firms .
In the second , Indian firms and the local “ captive ” operations of multinationals started offering low - end back - office services that could take place a continent away — telephone call - centres , transcribing medical records , processing insurance claims and so on .
In the third , in both IT and the broader spectrum of other “ business processes ” , ever - more sophisticated functions are happening in India .
So strong are the forces driving this shift that what seemed improbably rosy projections by NASSCOM , the Indian software - and service - industry lobby , and McKinsey , a consultancy , back in 1999 , are coming true .
This week NASSCOM and McKinsey produced the second full - scale update of their study .
It argues that exports from India 's IT industry and from “ Business Process Offshoring ” ( BPO ) — both from services “ outsourced ” to Indian firms and those performed by captives — are on track to reach $ 60 billion a year by 2010 .
That would be a huge surge from the $ 17.2 billion in the year ending in March 2005 .
But it implies a compounded annual growth rate of 28 % — below that achieved in recent years .
Moreover , according to McKinsey 's estimates , it requires India merely to maintain its present shares of the markets for offshore IT services ( 65 % ) and BPO ( 46 % ) .
This is because the study predicts a massive rise in the size of the overall market , estimated at present to make up just one - tenth of those services that could be sent offshore .
The proportion is expected to rise as demography — a western labour shortage — becomes more pressing than protectionism .
In IT the growth in Indian exports is expected to come both from the software market , and from “ traditional IT outsourcing ” — such as the remote management of whole systems , a market now dominated by the big global IT consultancies .
This is expected to rise from 8 % of Indian sales now to about 30 % in 2010 , while software - development 's share will fall from 55 % to 39 % .
In business - process - offshoring , the big industries will remain banking and insurance .
But rapid expansion is also expected in other areas , like legal services .
The law , in fact , illustrates how vast is the untapped potential market .
About $ 250 billion is spent on legal services world - wide , about two - thirds of it in America , and as yet only a tiny proportion goes offshore .
Forrester , a research outfit , has estimated that , by last year , 12,000 legal jobs had moved offshore , and forecast that this will increase to 35,000 by 2010 .
India , with its English - language skills and common - law tradition is well - placed to secure a big share of the business .
It is not just a question of “ paralegal ” hack work such as document - preparation .
Sanjay Kamlani , of Pangea3 , a small Indian firm , calls it “ real lawyering ” — drafting contracts and patent applications , research and negotiation .
His clients are both big law firms and in - house legal teams .
India 's fundamental attraction has not changed since it first drew software developers : fantastic cost savings .
With American lawyers costing $ 300 an hour or more , Indian firms can cut bills by 75 % .
Across the board , despite climbing rates of pay in IT and BPO , where rapid expansion has brought frantic job - hopping , India remains , say NASSCOM and McKinsey , the lowest - cost of all the main outsourcing destinations .
It also has , among these countries , by far , the largest pool of employable people — those with the necessary language and technical skills .
On this measure , India , which produces 2.5 m graduates a year , 250,000 of whom are engineers , has 28 % of the global available workforce , compared with 11 % in China .
Yet the supply of talent may be the biggest constraint on the Indian industry 's growth .
On these latest projections , the number of people working in IT and business - process exports in India will increase from about 700,000 now to 2.3 m by 2010 .
But on today 's estimates only 1.05 m suitably qualified people will graduate from college between now and then , so there will be a shortfall of nearly 500,000 , with business - processing the worst affected .
McKinsey 's Jayant Sinha believes the education system can be fixed in time to plug the gap .
A bigger worry , he says , is India 's creaking urban infrastructure .
IT firms in Bangalore , for example , are in revolt against the local government for its neglect of basic amenities .
Yet India 's IT and business - process industries will need about 14 m square metres ( 150 m square feet ) of office space by 2010 : “ a new Manhattan ” .
Hectic building is under way , and not just in the big IT and business - processing centres ( Bangalore , Mumbai and around Delhi ) or the “ second tier ” of cities such as Pune , Hyderabad and Chennai ( Madras ) .
The industry 's worry over infrastructure , as over education , is that it cannot do everything by itself .
Having thrived by keeping government at arm 's length , business now needs help .
The New York Times first debated publishing a story about secret eavesdropping on Americans as early as last fall , before the 2004 presidential election .
But the newspaper held the story for more than a year and only revealed the secret wiretaps last Friday , when it became apparent a book by one of its reporters was about to break the news , according to journalists familiar with the paper ’s internal discussions .
The Times report has created a furor in Washington , with politicians in both parties and civil libertarians saying that President Bush was wrong to authorize the surveillance by the National Security Agency without permission from a special court .
Bush and his supporters have fired back , saying that the eavesdropping was needed to protect Americans after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
On Monday , the president called the public reports on the once - secret surveillance “ shameful . ”

Politicians , journalists and Internet commentators have feverishly aired the debate over the timing of the New York Times story in the last four days -- with critics on the left wondering why the paper waited so long to publish the story and those on the right wondering why it was published at all .
Conservatives suggested the Times had timed the story to persuade members of Congress to oppose reauthorization of the Patriot Act , the federal law that granted the government sweeping surveillance powers .
They also charged that the newspaper wanted to short - circuit good news for the Bush administration -- Iraq ’s high - turnout , relatively violence - free elections .
Times Executive Editor Bill Keller rejected those alleged motivations and also the suggestion that the timing of the story was linked to next month ’s scheduled publication of “ State of War : The Secret History of the CIA and the Bush Administration , ” the book by Times reporter James Risen that includes information on the National Security Agency spying program .

“ The publication was not timed to the Iraqi election , the Patriot Act debate , Jim ’s forthcoming book or any other event , ” Keller said in a statement .
“ We published the story when we did because after much hard work it was fully reported , checked and ready , and because , after listening respectfully to the administration ’s objections , we were convinced there was no good reason not to publish it . ”
The newspaper had reported Friday that it held publication of the story for “ a year ” because the White House had argued that it “ could jeopardize continuing investigations and alert would - be terrorists that they might be under scrutiny . ”
In a statement over the weekend , Keller said the paper printed the story after more reporting , which uncovered additional “ concerns and misgivings ” about the surveillance and also persuaded Times editors that they could proceed and “ not expose any intelligence - gathering methods or capabilities that are not already on the public record . ”
The initial Times statements did not say that the paper ’s internal debate began before the Nov. 2 , 2004 , presidential election -- in which Iraq and national security questions loomed large -- or make any reference to Risen ’s book , due out Jan. 16 .

But two journalists , who declined to be identified , said that editors at the paper were actively considering running the story about the wiretaps before Bush ’s November showdown with Democratic Sen.
John F. Kerry of Massachusetts .
Top editors at the paper eventually decided to hold the story .
But the discussion was renewed after the election , with Risen and coauthor of the story , reporter Eric Lichtblau , joining some of the paper ’s editors in pushing for publication , according to the sources , who said they did not want to be identified because the Times had designated only Keller and a spokeswoman to address the matter .
“ When they realized that it was going to appear in the book anyway , that is when they went ahead and agreed to publish the story , ” said one of the journalists .
“ That ’s not to say that was their entire consideration , but it was a very important one of them . ”
Both of the journalists said they thought that Times editors were overly cautious in holding the story for more than a year .
But they said they thought the delays appeared to be in good faith , with the editors taking to heart the national security concerns raised by the Bush administration .

Times management and journalists reacted with particular disgust to the claim , put forward by Sen. John Cornyn ( R - Texas ) over the weekend , that the story had been held , in part , “ as part of a marketing campaign for selling the [ Risen ] book . ”
Risen declined to comment on any aspect of the story , but one of his colleagues called the allegation absurd .
Keller said in his statement that the Times had given Risen a leave to write the book but that the paper “ otherwise has no connection to it . ”
Simon & Schuster Inc. , the book ’s publisher , is not owned by the New York Times Co .

Daniel Okrent , the former public editor at the New York Times , said the disclosure of wiretaps without court authority was an important story and one the newspaper deserved plaudits for bringing into the public debate .
But the story also put the newspaper in a difficult position , he said .
“ You are damned if you do and damned if you do n’t , ” said Okrent , who often wrote critical reviews of the Times before leaving in May to write a book .
“ For the right , this information never should have come out .
And for the left , it never could have come out early enough . ”
Kathleen Hall Jamieson , director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania , said readers would like to have more information to judge why the paper waited more than a year to publish the story .

“ If the concerns were strong enough they did n’t run the story , then it puts them in a very difficult position when it comes time to explain ” because the newspaper had determined that it could not reveal many of the details for national security reasons , Jamieson said .
Nonetheless , Jamieson called on the paper to be as transparent as possible to explain the delay because it had an obligation “ to make sure all possible information was available to voters before the election , as long as that information did not jeopardize national security . ”
Although some Democratic commentators have suggested news of secret , extra-judicial wiretaps would have been a political blow against Bush , Jamieson said too little was known about the surveillance program to draw conclusions .
“ It ’s possible it plays out in a way that favors the Bush administration too , ” she said .
“ We just ca n’t know that yet . ”

You need to go listen to this garbage .
Steve Inskeep actually does a decent job of very calmly taking the long view of what Yoo is saying .
First
Yoo tries to make these Combatant Status Review Tribunals sound like very civilized events , where detainees can challenge their incaraceration , but Inskeep simply points out that detainees do n't get a lawyer for them , they can't see " classified " evidence leading to their detention , and in fact the transcripts we have of these tribunals show them to be nothing more than perfunctory show trials .
Think Kafka
So after that goes nowhere , Yoo actually circles around to his final argument , admitting that the process for denying habeas does virtually guarantee that innocent people will be detained indefinitely , but that war is untidy and if we had to go through the messy process of actually granting all these habeas petitions to prisoners at Guantanamo , well ... it would just be too costly .
There 's no perfect system .
I agree , Steve , that there 's always the chance that there will be people who are detained who are not enemy combatants .
The same is true of our criminal justice system ... that 's why we have all these processes , that 's why we have all these appeal levels , is to try and correct any mistakes that were made and fix errors .
( processes in the criminal justice system , not the military commission system .
Nice bit of attempted conflation there - ed . )
Inskeep :
You said " always a chance . "
Is n't it a certainty , especially given that some cases have already been found to be , almost indisputably , cases of people who were innocent , being held at Guantanamo for a long time and held elsewhere ?
Yoo : I would say yes , in wartime , there 's always people who are going to be picked up ...
Inskeep :
Do you , as a lawyer , who 's worked for the Bush Administration and obviously thought about these issues , think that this law does everything possible to prevent error ?
Yoo : I think we could probably do a lot more , but it'd be a lot more expensive .
I think what we have here is something close to the civilian sytem .
Inskeep : ( shaking his head until his eyes bugged out , I 'm assuming )
Are you saying it would be too expensive to give habeas corpus protection to non-citizens ?
Yoo : Yeah , I think that 's what Congress decided when they passed this law last week ( see , it 's CONGRESS arguing this , not me ! - ed. ) is that , you could have the possibility of hundreds and hundreds of habeas corpus proceedings , and they do impose a cost .
They impose a cost on our judicial system , they impose a cost on our government and our military .
Think about it , you 'd have to pull witnesses in from abroad .
You have the cost of potentially releasing classified information .
All of this process does have a cost on our system , it 's not free .
Yeah , freedom is n't free , you jerk .
So the only argument that the guy who pretty much invented the idea of inherent supreme executive power enshrined in the Constitution could come up with to strip unlawful combatants of habeas corpus protections , not just non-citizens Mr. Inskeep but ANYONE so named by the Department of Defense , is that it'd be just such a burden to get a plane ticket for a witness to come over from Afghanistan , and think about the special meals requirements for that witness if they 're a vegetarian , and you probably have to put them up in a hotel , and who 's going to set THAT up , who could get on hotels .com to get a decent rate , and ... yes , it 's just too much money to , you know , DO THE BUSINESS OF GOVERNMENT .
This from a lawyer for the Administration that wanted to spend $ 20 million on a party celebrating " victory " in Iraq and Afghanistan .
This is the most dishonest , craven , contentless , most insulting argument I 've heard yet for removing Magna Carta - era protections for suspects .
" It 's just too much money . "
Is this guy still allowed to teach at colleges ?
Boulder – Jonathan Baldino might be off the “ nice ” list .
Police say Baldino used homemade bar codes to buy electronic gadgets at prices far below any legitimate discount .
The 19 - year - old is facing three counts of being naughty – one of them a Class 5 felony .
Baldino was detained by Target security Wednesday after he purchased a $ 150 iPod with a bar - code label of $ 4.99 .
Baldino , a freshman electrical - engineering student at the University of Colorado , told police that he made phony bar codes from real bar codes taken from inexpensive merchandise , then glued those bar codes on to big - ticket items at Target , according to the police report .
Baldino ’s alleged holiday caper actually worked – once .
On Nov. 16 , he downloaded a program called “ Barcode Magic ” in his dorm room and made a bar code for a CD player that cost $ 24.99 , police said .
Then he went shopping – sticking his homemade bar code on a system for using iPods valued at $ 249.99 , police said .
But Baldino ’s alleged scam was thwarted Wednesday when he returned to Target and was recognized by the store ’s security specialist , according to police .
The specialist watched Baldino check out , discovering that Baldino paid for headphones worth $ 4.99 , while he was walking out with an iPod worth $ 149.99 .
Busted , Baldino begged for a little yuletide forgiveness .
“ I will NEVER EVER DO THIS EVER AGAIN and I am once more terribly sorry , ” Baldino wrote in a statement for police .
“ Please let me go for I am terribly sorry !!!
I ’m only a kid !
Help me out .
I just want to go home .
I did this not knowing of the serious penalty that lies behind it .
Please !
Please !
Please ! ”
Police , however , did not acquiesce .
He faces a felony count of forgery and two misdemeanor counts of theft .
“ Price switching has been around forever , but this is certainly an advanced form , ” police spokeswoman Julie Brooks said .
“ We ’re seeing a lot more computer involvement in crimes that used to be almost juvenile in nature . ”
Baldino ’s bar - code bargains pale in comparison with other national cases .
In November , a Reno , Nev. , man was arrested for stealing more than $ 200,000 worth of Legos in a bar - code scam .
Baldino is accused of stealing $ 370 from Target .
Baldino told police he got the idea from a friend in California , where Baldino is from .
“ Once Baldino got here at college , he did n’t have any money to buy things , ” officer Don Schuler wrote in the report .
“ He remembered his friend ’s idea and did a Google search for ‘ Barcode Magic . ” ‘
According to its website , Barcode Magic allows users to “ generate bar codes for home , hobby and retail with our easy to use bar - code software .
Simply select a bar - code style and font , enter desired text and numbers , and a bar code is automatically created . ”
Baldino signed up for the 15 - day trial software , according to police .
He went to Target to get the bar - code numbers for inexpensive items , then typed the bar - code number into the software on his computer to make his own bar - code sticker .
Baldino told police that he did n’t have an accomplice at Target .
“ He looked for female checkers that he thought did not know enough about electronic items to catch the switch , ” Schuler wrote in his report .
When police went to Baldino ’s Sterns West dorm to get his computer , a detective noticed the box for Baldino ’s printer .
“ The code on the box has been covered with a code sticker I recognized as the one the Target employees confiscated that Baldino had self - printed , ” Schuler wrote .
Baldino could not be reached for comment Thursday .
In a follow - up statement to police , he wrote : “ I am extremely sad now , and I just want to go to bed , ” he wrote .
“ Please let me sleep in my own bed tonight . ”

I am the first in line to enjoy a good Lord of the Rings analogy .
But there is something distinctly off in Sen.
Rick Santorum ’s effort to recast the Iraq War in Tolkienian terms :
Embattled U.S. Sen .
Rick Santorum said America has avoided a second terrorist attack for five years because the “ Eye of Mordor ” has been drawn to Iraq instead .
Santorum used the analogy from one of his favorite books , J.R.R.
Tolkien ’s 1950s fantasy classic “ Lord of the Rings , ” to put an increasingly unpopular war in Iraq into terms any school kid could easily understand .
“ As the hobbits are going up Mount Doom , the Eye of Mordor is being drawn somewhere else , ” Santorum said , describing the tool the evil Lord Sauron used in search of the magical ring that would consolidate his power over Middle - earth .
“ It ’s being drawn to Iraq and it ’s not being drawn to the U.S. , ” Santorum continued .
“ You know what ?
I want to keep it on Iraq .
I do n’t want the Eye to come back here to the United States . ”
The trouble here is not that Santorum is daring to compare a bloody real - life tragedy to a fantasy novel — pace my colleague Tim Grieve , who brought this bizarre tirade to my attention , or the spokesman for Santorum ’s opponent , who complains , “ You have to really question the judgment of a U.S. senator who compares the war in Iraq to a fantasy book . ”
That does n’t bother me .
Myths and fictions offer us powerful ways of seeing and talking about the real world .
Popular politicians — like Ronald Reagan , who borrowed his “ Evil Empire ” imagery from George Lucas — understand this .
No , the problem is that Santorum ’s analogy makes no sense .
I think the senator means to offer a Middle Earth version of the GOP ’s “ We ’re fighting them over there so we do n’t have to fight them here , ” but he ’s messed it up badly .
( Warning : Tolkienian geekery ahead ! )
First of all , in Tolkien ’s saga , the good guys are outgunned and outmanned by the Dark Lord , whereas in our world , the U.S. is a “ hyperpower ” whose military , in 2001 - 2 , seemed to bestride the world .
Second , in Tolkien , the good guys sent Frodo with the Ring into the depths of Mordor as a sort of last - ditch , bet - everything gamble ; then they sent an army to the gates of Mordor as a diversion — to keep the Eye occupied and distract it from the hobbits headed for Mount Doom .
Santorum says the war in Iraq was meant to keep the Eye distracted .
But what kind of diversionary maneuver keeps more than a hundred thousand troops fighting and dying for years ?
And what are we distracting our enemy from ?
Who are our hobbits ?
What secret plan is underway to break the power of Al - Qaeda once and for all ?
None , of course , because this is where the analogy dissolves into air :
In Middle Earth , the Dark Lord ’s forces are centralized and his minions are incapable of operating independently ; in our world , our enemy is organized as a headless guerrilla network .
There is no “ Eye ” to distract .
It ’s hard , in truth , to find any useful Middle Earth analogy to the Iraq War : the parallels break down across the board .
Still , you might think of Bush ’s invasion of Iraq as the equivalent of a beleaguered Gondor , attacked by the armies of Mordor across the River Anduin , sending its army off on an expedition to Far Harad , after its leaders issued proclamations that the White Council had incontrovertible evidence of the Haradrim ’s possession of Rings of Mass Destruction .
Something like that , anyway .
But as you can see it really does n’t work , even when you try harder than Santorum .

The Free and Open Productivity Suite
“ A GOOD newspaper , I suppose , is a nation talking to itself , ” mused Arthur Miller in 1961 .
A decade later , two reporters from the Washington Post wrote a series of articles that brought down President Nixon and the status of print journalism soared .
At their best , newspapers hold governments and companies to account .
They usually set the news agenda for the rest of the media .
But in the rich world newspapers are now an endangered species .
The business of selling words to readers and selling readers to advertisers , which has sustained their role in society , is falling apart ( see article ) .
Of all the “ old ” media , newspapers have the most to lose from the internet .
Circulation has been falling in America , western Europe , Latin America , Australia and New Zealand for decades ( elsewhere , sales are rising ) .
But in the past few years the web has hastened the decline .
In his book “ The Vanishing Newspaper ” , Philip Meyer calculates that the first quarter of 2043 will be the moment when newsprint dies in America as the last exhausted reader tosses aside the last crumpled edition .
That sort of extrapolation would have produced a harrumph from a Beaverbrook or a Hearst , but even the most cynical news baron could not dismiss the way that ever more young people are getting their news online .
Britons aged between 15 and 24 say they spend almost 30 % less time reading national newspapers once they start using the web .
Up to a podcast , Lord Copper ?
Advertising is following readers out of the door .
The rush is almost unseemly , largely because the internet is a seductive medium that supposedly matches buyers with sellers and proves to advertisers that their money is well spent .
Classified ads , in particular , are quickly shifting online .
Rupert Murdoch , the Beaverbrook of our age , once described them as the industry 's rivers of gold — but , as he said last year , “ Sometimes rivers dry up . ”
In Switzerland and the Netherlands newspapers have lost half their classified advertising to the internet .
Newspapers have not yet started to shut down in large numbers , but it is only a matter of time .
Over the next few decades half the rich world 's general papers may fold .
Jobs are already disappearing .
According to the Newspaper Association of America , the number of people employed in the industry fell by 18 % between 1990 and 2004 .
Tumbling shares of listed newspaper firms have prompted fury from investors .
In 2005 a group of shareholders in Knight Ridder , the owner of several big American dailies , got the firm to sell its papers and thus end a 114 - year history .
This year Morgan Stanley , an investment bank , attacked the New York Times Company , the most august journalistic institution of all , because its share price had fallen by nearly half in four years .
Having ignored reality for years , newspapers are at last doing something .
In order to cut costs , they are already spending less on journalism .
Many are also trying to attract younger readers by shifting the mix of their stories towards entertainment , lifestyle and subjects that may seem more relevant to people 's daily lives than international affairs and politics are .
They are trying to create new businesses on - and offline .
And they are investing in free daily papers , which do not use up any of their meagre editorial resources on uncovering political corruption or corporate fraud .
So far , this fit of activity looks unlikely to save many of them .
Even if it does , it bodes ill for the public role of the Fourth Estate .
Getting away with murder
In future , as newspapers fade and change , will politicians therefore burgle their opponents ' offices with impunity , and corporate villains whoop as they trample over their victims ?
Journalism schools and think - tanks , especially in America , are worried about the effect of a crumbling Fourth Estate .
Are today 's news organisations “ up to the task of sustaining the informed citizenry on which democracy depends ? ” asked a recent report about newspapers from the Carnegie Corporation of New York , a charitable research foundation .
Nobody should relish the demise of once - great titles .
But the decline of newspapers will not be as harmful to society as some fear .
Democracy , remember , has already survived the huge television - led decline in circulation since the 1950s .
It has survived as readers have shunned papers and papers have shunned what was in stuffier times thought of as serious news .
And it will surely survive the decline to come .
That is partly because a few titles that invest in the kind of investigative stories which often benefit society the most are in a good position to survive , as long as their owners do a competent job of adjusting to changing circumstances .
Publications like the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal should be able to put up the price of their journalism to compensate for advertising revenues lost to the internet — especially as they cater to a more global readership .
As with many industries , it is those in the middle — neither highbrow , nor entertainingly populist — that are likeliest to fall by the wayside .
The usefulness of the press goes much wider than investigating abuses or even spreading general news ; it lies in holding governments to account — trying them in the court of public opinion .
The internet has expanded this court .
Anyone looking for information has never been better equipped .
People no longer have to trust a handful of national papers or , worse , their local city paper .
News - aggregation sites such as Google News draw together sources from around the world .
The website of Britain 's Guardian now has nearly half as many readers in America as it does at home .
In addition , a new force of “ citizen ” journalists and bloggers is itching to hold politicians to account .
The web has opened the closed world of professional editors and reporters to anyone with a keyboard and an internet connection .
Several companies have been chastened by amateur postings — of flames erupting from Dell 's laptops or of cable - TV repairmen asleep on the sofa .
Each blogger is capable of bias and slander , but , taken as a group , bloggers offer the searcher after truth boundless material to chew over .
Of course , the internet panders to closed minds ; but so has much of the press .
For hard - news reporting — as opposed to comment — the results of net journalism have admittedly been limited .
Most bloggers operate from their armchairs , not the frontline , and citizen journalists tend to stick to local matters .
But it is still early days .
New online models will spring up as papers retreat .
One non-profit group , NewAssignment .
Net , plans to combine the work of amateurs and professionals to produce investigative stories on the internet .
Aptly , $ 10,000 of cash for the project has come from Craig Newmark , of Craigslist , a group of free classified - advertisement websites that has probably done more than anything to destroy newspapers ' income .
In future , argues Carnegie , some high - quality journalism will also be backed by non-profit organisations .
Already , a few respected news organisations sustain themselves that way — including the Guardian , the Christian Science Monitor and National Public Radio .
An elite group of serious newspapers available everywhere online , independent journalism backed by charities , thousands of fired - up bloggers and well - informed citizen journalists : there is every sign that Arthur Miller 's national conversation will be louder than ever .
WHEN Elvira Lindo , a Spanish writer , delivered the opening speech at the annual festival of the patron saint of Barcelona one autumn afternoon this year , she arrived under the protection of an armored car .
Men with black umbrellas , symbolizing mourning and death , blocked her entry into City Hall .
They shouted insults , tossing out words like “ fascism ” and “ genocide . ”
Was Lindo a kind of Spanish Salman Rushdie , writing something that inflamed passions to a fever pitch ?
No -- she planned to speak in Spanish , not the regional language of Catalan .
The last time anyone checked , Barcelona was still part of Spain .
As regional differences flourish in this country of 40 million , however , language has become a tool of identity but also of exclusion .

Like the Basque Country before it , and perhaps Andalusia after it , Catalonia -- one of Spain ’s 17 state - like autonomous regions -- is establishing a separate cultural identity .
The move is praised in some quarters as a long - overdue liberation from decades of repression , and attacked elsewhere as local nationalism run amok .
Critics warn ominously of a disintegration of the nation .
Spain , they moan , is fast becoming a Tower of Babel .
Loyalty to Madrid is weakened ; diversity has gone too far .
SOME ATMs in Spain offer a choice of six languages , four of which are the Spaniards ’ own .
It is not uncommon in places such as Barcelona , Catalonia ’s largest city , for a single conversation to take place in two languages .
And on occasion , as Lindo ’s ordeal demonstrated , intolerance is the order of the day .
Catalan officials have been known to refuse to speak Spanish in news conferences with Spanish - speaking journalists , or in parliament .
Big commercial companies here that do n’t toe a Catalan line risk boycotts .
Ten million people speak Catalan , a kind of French - sounding Spanish -- not just in Catalonia but also in a town on the Italian island of Sardinia , in pockets of southern France , in the Balearic Islands and in the Spanish city of Valencia .
( Do n’t tell the Valencianos that , however .
They think they have their own language , and have begun a quixotic campaign to get it recognized as such . )

In the Basque Country of northern Spain , Basques have an indisputably unique language .
But they have injected an ethnic component , where the most extreme nationalists argue racial superiority as part of their Basque identity .
Most experts will say that the dialect of Galicia , north of Portugal , is just a form of Portuguese .
And that “ Andalusian ” is heavily accented Spanish .
At a certain point , asserting a regional language and identity is a political maneuver , a play for power .
Spain ’s diverse regional identities were repressed for decades under the Franco dictatorship , then revived when democracy was introduced in 1976 .
Today , under the 2 - year - old Socialist government , regional autonomy and cultural expression flourish in abundance .
Here in Barcelona , the language of Catalan is thriving under a kind of affirmative action that thrills purists and rankles traditionalists .
At one end , Catalan extremists want a Catalan - only world ; at the other end are people who angrily predict the demise of Spanish .
For both , bilingualism is a dirty word :
One person ’s bilingualism is another person ’s loss of linguistic domination .
In between are many who favor bilingualism , but for different reasons and with different definitions .

Catalan is the official language in the region ’s primary schools , the language that is used in PTA meetings , public - address announcements and most classrooms .
Catalan “ immersion ” is obligatory starting in kindergarten .
Residential utility bills are in Catalan only .
Businesses can be fined if they do n’t have signs in Catalan , or if customers complain they were not attended in Catalan .
Proficiency in Catalan is required , and tested , for many government jobs .
ACCORDING to the Catalan Language Observatory , Catalan was born of 11th century vulgar Latin around the same time as Spanish and French , and enjoyed alternating periods of revival and prohibition .
Jo tambe soc barcelonina is Catalan for Yo tambien soy barcelonesa , which is Spanish for “ I am also from Barcelona . ”
Bona tarda is buenas tardes ( “ good afternoon ” ) .

“ Catalan has been starved for 40 years , ” said Jordi Porta , head of Omnium , an institute that promotes Catalan culture .
“ A certain militancy is required . ”
Porta grew up under Franco .
When he enrolled in elementary school , he gave his name : the very Catalan - sounding “ Jordi . ”
No , the school authorities told him , your name is Jorge .
As a child , Porta spoke Catalan at home , secretly , but he was in his teens before he learned to write it -- from a clandestine youth group formed as resistance to Franco .
Today , Omnium awards literary prizes for works in Catalan and offers Catalan classes for the large numbers of Moroccan , Senegalese and other immigrants who have arrived in Barcelona in recent years .
It fought a successful campaign to establish the “ cat ” Internet designation for Catalan organizations ( instead of the “ es ” used by Spanish entities ) .

At the Vila Olimpica school near Barcelona ’s seafront , teacher Lidia Jove leads a class not in Spanish or Catalan , but in English .
She takes a room full of 10 - year - olds on a halting discussion of food groups and fats and carbs as part of a nutrition class .
The experiment is to introduce a third language to young students .
The goal , Jove said , is multilingualism , but , she acknowledged , the fallback language is always Catalan .
If , for example , a student ’s parents speak Spanish only ( and there are many like that ) , Jove will speak to them in Spanish .
But she will insist on Catalan with the child .
In the playground , however , it ’s a mishmash .
It is quite common for one youngster to speak Spanish to a friend who answers in Catalan .
They understand each other .

“ Spanish is a big , beautiful , healthy language , ” Jove said .
“ Catalan is a small , beautiful endangered language .
If something is n’t done , in 50 years you wo n’t have any Catalan speakers . ”
By most estimates , a little over half of Barcelona ’s residents , including many people who have moved here from other parts of Spain , are exclusively Spanish - speakers , and a little under half are bilingual in Spanish and Catalan .
( The “ Spanish ” that Americans are familiar with is more accurately labeled “ Castilian . ” )
It is rare , according to Jove and others , to find someone who is monolingual in Catalan and does not understand Spanish .
Barcelona is a large , lively sophisticated city on the Mediterranean that caters to huge numbers of foreign visitors .
Spanish is readily spoken in most on - the - beaten - track places .
But step into a smaller , less - frequented bakery or bookstore , and as much as a customer might speak Spanish , the clerks will continue in Catalan .
The fear among some Spaniards is that regionalism will undermine national strength and unity .

Marita Rodriguez , a physics professor from a Barcelona suburb , founded an organization called En Castellano Tambien ( In Castilian , Too ) , which periodically protests the use ( overuse , she would argue ) of Catalan to what she maintains is the exclusion of Spanish .
Rodriguez sees a world where Spanish - speakers practically have to grovel to be served in Spanish , whether at the bank , the telephone company or other public offices .
By her calculation , businesses that have not provided Catalan services have been fined tens of thousands of euros .
“ This sob story of having to save Catalan does not justify such aggressive behavior , ” Rodriguez said .
“ They ’ve made it a kind of religion . ”
IN some ways , the place of language in society has been turned on its head .
Generations ago , Catalan was seen as a language of villagers and the elderly .
In the 1950s and ‘ 60s , Catalonia experienced an influx of Spanish - speaking workers from Andalusia and , later , Latin America .
With the use of Catalan being promoted and favored in the last decade , some now see Spanish as the more working - class language , and Catalan the domain of a politically motivated urban elite .

In an article that was translated and widely republished in Spanish newspapers , Catalan columnist Salvador Sostres was dismissive of the national language .
“ I only speak Spanish to my maid and to a few workers , ” Sostres wrote .
“ It is a language of the poor , of the illiterate and of people of low ability to speak a language that makes such a frightening sound just to pronounce the J . ”
Debate over language and regionalism is always intense , but never more so than during an election campaign like the one that ended Nov. 1 when the people of Catalonia voted for a new parliament .
The conservative nationalist Convergence and Union Party published all of its campaign materials in Catalan only .
Spokesman David Madi said the party believes in bilingualism , while emphasizing Catalan , “ our own language . ”
If anything , he said , the region needs more Catalan .
The party would like to see Catalonia as an all - but - fully independent state .
In a way , Madi said , the alarmists predicting the dissolution of Spain have a point .
Advertisement
“ The future is a New Spain with strong regions and cultural differences , ” Madi said .
“ Spain as a monolithic uniform Spanish state is finished . ”
By contrast , a new party ran in the elections , declaring itself fed up with language as a political tool .
The Citizens Party ran a bilingual campaign and one with an attention - grabbing twist :
The party ’s leader , a twentysomething lawyer named Albert Rivera , posed nude ( hands strategically placed ) for the group ’s main campaign posters .
The idea , Rivera said , was to shed labels and symbols of identity that divide people .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t like the term Balkanization , because it implies violence , but they are setting up dangerous linguistic barriers that pose a threat to Barcelona ’s pluralistic cosmopolitan character , ” Rivera said .
Of the six parties that earned enough votes to enter parliament , Madi ’s Convergence and Union took the lion ’s share .
Rivera ’s Citizens Party came in last .

When most people think about the Mozilla Firefox browser , they think of it as being open source and free .
The truth is , while Mozilla Firefox is open source , it is not entirely free , and it may not even be legally compatible with Debian GNU / Linux , one of the most popular community Linux distribution bases .
The issue at hand is whether Debian can use the Firefox name for the Mozilla Firefox packages it includes in its GNU / Linux distribution .
Though Debian and Debian - derived distributions such as the popular Ubuntu Linux currently include Mozilla Firefox , they do not typically include the actual Mozilla Firefox logo ( the stylized fox on the globe ) .
And therein lies the rub .
Debian adheres to a strict interpretation of what is Free Software and what is n't , as outlined in the Debian Free Software Guidelines .
The Firefox logo is trademarked , so Debian does n't consider it to be Free and will not include it as part of its distribution .
Mozilla claims that using the Firefox name without the official branding is a trademark violation .
Furthermore , Mozilla claims that if Debian runs any patches to the version of Firefox included with Debian distros , it has to run them by Mozilla first for approval .
What all this ultimately could mean is that the Firefox name is wiped from the face of Debian and its offshoots .
Debian developer Eric Dorland confirmed to internetnews.com that Debian will re-name Firefox and that the re-naming process could be completed as soon as next week .
The whole dispute stems from the Mozilla Corporation 's new - found determination to enforce trademarks .
In an e-mail sent to Debian developers , Mozilla staffer Mike Connor explained that the Mozilla Corporation has been handling patch approvals from distributions since the corporation 's inception in September of 2005 .
" The way this works ( and the way Red Hat and Novell have already gone through the process for 1.0 and 1.5 ) is that you have to submit patches that deviate from the source tarballs in order to continue to use the trademark , " Connor wrote .
" This is us attempting to tell you that what you are doing is not correct and needs to change .
" If you are going to use the Firefox name , you must also use the rest of the branding , " Connor continued .
" This is not something where you are free to pick what parts you want to use .
Either use the trademarked logos and name together or do n't . "
The timing of Mozilla 's trademark enforcement lust could n't have come at a worse time for Debian .
A new Debian distro release , code - named " Etch , " is due out by the end of the year , the first major release since Sarge in June 2005 .
Dorland actually asked Connor at one point in their e-mail discussion for a , " stay of execution " until after Etch is released .
Mozilla 's Connor had no sympathy for Dorland or Debian Etch and argued that the issue needs to be resolved before the release .
" I would think it makes much more sense to resolve this before you put another long - lived release into the wild , unless your aim is to delay compliance , " Connor wrote to Dorland .
Debian 's Dorland is standing his ground and will comply with Mozilla 's heavy handedness by re-naming the Mozilla Firefox packages so that Debian will no longer be considered to be infringing on Mozilla 's trademarks .
While using the Firefox name without the Firefox logo is not permissible , changing the name and calling Firefox something else is permissible .
It is unknown at this point what the new name for Debian 's Firefox package will be called .
" There are a few names floating around that I 'll probably choose from , " Dorland told internetnews.com .
" I 'm afraid some of them might be too close to ' Firefox ' to be comfortable if , for some reason , the Mozilla Corp. wished to come down even harder .
" I 'll pretty much have to pick something and start the renaming by next week if I 've any hope to get things ready for Etch . "
In Dorland 's view , the logo and the Mozilla approvals for Debian 's Firefox patches are fundamentally the same issue .
" They really both stem from the same issue , that they 're taking a very hard - line approach with their trademarks , " Dorland said .
" Now their lawyers may feel this is necessary -- and legally it may actually be the ' correct ' thing to do -- but it really seems to run counter to community expectations .
" But I suppose on a day - to - day basis having to seek approval for patches would make working on the package a lot less fun . "
Most prisons are notorious for the quality of their cuisine ( pretty poor ) and the behavior of their residents ( pretty violent ) .
They are therefore ideal locations to test a novel hypothesis : that violent aggression is largely a product of poor nutrition .
Toward that end , researchers are studying whether inmates become less violent when put on a diet rich in vitamins and in the fatty acids found in seafood .
Could a salmon steak and a side of spinach really help curb violence , not just in prison but everywhere ?
In 2001 , Dr. Joseph Hibbeln , a senior clinical investigator at the National Institutes of Health , published a study , provocatively titled " Seafood Consumption and Homicide Mortality , " that found a correlation between a higher intake of omega - 3 fatty acids ( most often obtained from fish ) and lower murder rates .
Of course , seeing a correlation between fatty acids and nonviolence does n't necessarily prove that fatty acids inhibit violence .
Bernard Gesch , a senior research scientist at Oxford University , set out to show that better nutrition does , in fact , decrease violence .
He enrolled 231 volunteers at a British prison in his study ; one - half received a placebo , while the other half received fatty acids and other supplements .
Over time , the antisocial behavior ( as measured by assaults and other violations ) of the inmates who had been given the supplements dropped by more than a third relative to their previous records .
The control group showed little change .
Gesch published his results in 2002 and plans to start a larger study later this year .
Similar trials are already under way in Holland and Norway .
What would it mean if we found a clear link between diet and violent behavior ?
To start with , it might challenge the notion that violence is a product of free will .
" But how do you exercise that free will without using your brain ? "
Gesch asks .
" And how , exactly , is the brain going to work properly without an adequate nutrient supply ? "
The belief that people choose to be violent may be irrelevant if the brain is n't firing on all cylinders .
This may especially be the case for impulsive acts of violence , which are less a choice than a failure to rein in one 's worst instincts .
It ranks among the most enduring mysteries of the cosmos .
Physicists call it the Fermi paradox after the Italian Nobel laureate Enrico Fermi , who , in 1950 , pointed out the glaring conflict between predictions that life was elsewhere in the universe - and the conspicuous lack of aliens who have come to visit .
Now a Danish researcher believes he may have solved the paradox .
Extra - terrestrials have yet to find us because they have n't had enough time to look .
Using a computer simulation of our own galaxy , the Milky Way , Rasmus Bjork , a physicist at the Niels Bohr institute in Copenhagen , proposed that a single civilisation might build eight intergalactic probes and launch them on missions to search for life .
Once on their way each probe would send out eight more mini-probes , which would head for the nearest stars and look for habitable planets .
Mr Bjork confined the probes to search only solar systems in what is called the " galactic habitable zone " of the Milky Way , where solar systems are close enough to the centre to have the right elements necessary to form rocky , life - sustaining planets , but are far enough out to avoid being struck by asteroids , seared by stars or frazzled by bursts of radiation .
He found that even if the alien ships could hurtle through space at a tenth of the speed of light , or 30,000 km a second , - Nasa 's current Cassini mission to Saturn is plodding along at 32 km a second - it would take 10bn years , roughly half the age of the universe , to explore just 4 % of the galaxy .
His study is reported in New Scientist today .
Like humans , alien civilisations could shorten the time to find extra-terrestrials by picking up television and radio broadcasts that might leak from colonised planets .
" Even then , unless they can develop an exotic form of transport that gets them across the galaxy in two weeks it 's still going to take millions of years to find us , " said Mr Bjork .
" There are so many stars in the galaxy that probably life could exist elsewhere , but will we ever get in contact with them ?
Not in our lifetime , " he added .
The methods raised students ’ test scores , and the schools began to attract the attention of the media and of philanthropists .
A “ 60 Minutes ” report on the schools in 1999 led to a $ 15 million grant from Doris and Donald Fisher , the founders of the Gap , and Feinberg and Levin began gradually to expand KIPP into a national network .
Two years ago , they received $ 8 million from the Gates Foundation to create up to eight KIPP high schools .
There are now 52 KIPP schools across the country , almost all middle schools , and together they are educating 12,000 children .
The network is run on a franchise model ; each school ’s principal has considerable autonomy , while quality control is exercised from the home office in San Francisco .
Feinberg is the superintendent of KIPP ’s eight schools in Houston , and Levin is the superintendent of the four New York City schools .
KIPP is part of a loose coalition with two other networks of charter schools based in and around New York City .
One is Achievement First , which grew out of the success of Amistad Academy , a charter school in New Haven that was founded in 1999 .
Achievement First now runs six schools in New Haven and Brooklyn .
The other network is Uncommon Schools , which was started by a founder of North Star Academy in Newark along with principals from three acclaimed charter schools in Massachusetts ; it now includes seven schools in Rochester , Newark and Brooklyn .
The connections among the three networks are mostly informal , based on the friendships that bind Levin to Norman Atkins , the former journalist who founded North Star , and to Dacia Toll , the Rhodes scholar and Yale Law graduate who started Amistad with Doug McCurry , a former teacher .
Toll and Atkins visited Levin at the Bronx KIPP Academy when they were setting up their original schools and studied the methods he was using ; they later sent their principals to the leadership academy that Levin and Feinberg opened in 2000 , and they have continued to model many of their practices on KIPP’s .
Now the schools are beginning to formalize their ties .
As they each expand their charters to include high schools , Levin , Toll and Atkins are working on a plan to bring students from all three networks together under one roof .
Students at both KIPP and Achievement First schools follow a system for classroom behavior invented by Levin and Feinberg called Slant , which instructs them to sit up , listen , ask questions , nod and track the speaker with their eyes .
When I visited KIPP Academy last month , I was standing with Levin at the front of a music class of about 60 students , listening to him talk , when he suddenly interrupted himself and pointed at me .
“ Do you notice what he ’s doing right now ? ” he asked the class .
They all called out at once , “ Nodding ! ”
Levin ’s contention is that Americans of a certain background learn these methods for taking in information early on and employ them instinctively .
KIPP students , he says , need to be taught the methods explicitly .
And so it is a little unnerving to stand at the front of a KIPP class ; every eye is on you .
When a student speaks , every head swivels to watch her .
To anyone raised in the principles of progressive education , the uniformity and discipline in KIPP classrooms can be off - putting .
But the kids I spoke to said they use the Slant method not because they fear they will be punished otherwise but because it works : it helps them to learn .
( They may also like the feeling of having their classmates ’ undivided attention when they ask or answer a question . )
When Levin asked the music class to demonstrate the opposite of Slanting — “ Give us the normal school look , ” he said — the students , in unison , all started goofing off , staring into space and slouching .
Middle - class Americans know intuitively that “ good behavior ” is mostly a game with established rules ; the KIPP students seemed to be experiencing the pleasure of being let in on a joke .
Still , Levin says that the innovations a visitor to a KIPP school might notice first — the Slanting and the walls festooned with slogans and mottos ( “ Team Always Beats Individual , ” “ All of Us Will Learn ” ) and the orderly rows of students walking in the hallways — are not the only things contributing to the schools ’ success .
Equally important , he says , are less visible practices : clear and coherent goals for each class ; teachers who work 15 to 16 hours a day ; careful lesson planning ; and a decade ’s worth of techniques , tricks , games and chants designed to help vast amounts of information penetrate poorly educated brains very quickly .
Toll and Levin are influenced by the writings of a psychology professor from the University of Pennsylvania named Martin Seligman , the author of a series of books about positive psychology .
Seligman , one of the first modern psychologists to study happiness , promotes a technique he calls learned optimism , and Toll and Levin consider it an essential part of the attitude they are trying to instill in their students .
Last year , a graduate student of Seligman ’s named Angela Duckworth published with Seligman a research paper that demonstrated a guiding principle of these charter schools : in many situations , attitude is just as important as ability .
Duckworth studied 164 eighth - grade students in Philadelphia , tracking each child ’s I.Q. as well as his or her score on a test that measured self - discipline and then correlating those two numbers with the student ’s G.P.A .
Surprisingly , she found that the self - discipline scores were a more accurate predictor of G.P.A. than the I.Q. scores by a factor of two .
Duckworth ’s paper connects with a new wave of research being done around the country showing that “ noncognitive ” abilities like self - control , adaptability , patience and openness — the kinds of qualities that middle - class parents pass on to their children every day , in all kinds of subtle and indirect ways — have a huge and measurable impact on a child ’s future success .
Levin considers Duckworth ’s work an indication of the practical side of the “ character ” education he and Toll and Atkins are engaged in : they want their students to be well behaved and hard - working and respectful because it ’s a good way to live but also because the evidence is clear that people who act that way get higher marks in school and better jobs after school .
To Toll , a solid character is a basic building block of her students ’ education .
“ I think we have to teach work ethic in the same way we have to teach adding fractions with unlike denominators , ” she told me .
“ But once children have got the work ethic and the commitment to others and to education down , it ’s actually pretty easy to teach them . ”

NEW YORK ( Fortune ) --
An enormous gap still separates the performance of Detroit automakers from their foreign competitors - and it is n't all their fault .
The stupefying $ 12.7 billion loss that Ford Motor Co. reported Thursday for 2006 comes one year after General Motors ' equally horrendous $ 10.6 billion loss for 2005 .
But for all the bad decisions these companies have made by not listening to their customers , they are n't entirely to blame .
Structural inequities between the U.S. and Japan - notably in labor costs and currency - account for a big chunk of Detroit 's problems .
The evidence can be seen in a report prepared by the Detroit consulting firm Harbour - Felax , first released back in October and updated for Fortune .
For anyone who makes a living from the domestic auto industry , it is depressing reading .
An enormous and persistent gap separates the home team from the import companies - large enough to question the continued survival of the U.S. companies .
In the case of Ford ( Charts ) , which recently hocked its corporate assets to help fund $ 17 billion in negative cash flow over the next 24 months , it raises questions whether the automaker can shrink the difference before its money runs out .
According to the latest calculations , the gap between Japanese and American carmakers ' profits average out to about $ 2900 per vehicle , and the home team does not have the advantage .
Cost issues
A big reason is the cost of labor .
As analyzed by Harbour - Felax , labor costs the Detroit Three substantially more per vehicle than it does the Japanese .
Health care is the biggest chunk .
GM ( Charts ) , for instance spends $ 1,635 per vehicle on health care for active and retired workers in the U.S. Toyota ( Charts ) pays nothing for retired workers - it has very few - and only $ 215 for active ones .
Other labor costs add to the bill .
Contract issues like work rules , line relief and holiday pay amount to $ 630 per vehicle - costs that the Japanese do n't have .
And paying UAW members for not working when plants are shut costs another $ 350 per vehicle .
Here 's one example of how knotty Detroit 's labor problem can be :
If an assembly plant with 3,000 workers has no dealer orders , it has two options .
One is to close the plant for a week and not build any cars .
Then the company still has to give the idled workers 95 percent of their take - home pay plus all benefits for not working .
So a one - week shutdown costs $ 7.7 million or $ 1,545 for each vehicle it did n't make .
If the company decides to go ahead and run the plant for a week without any dealer orders , it will have distressed merchandise on its hands .
Then it has to sell the vehicles to daily rental companies like Hertz or Avis at discounts of $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 per vehicle , which creates a flood of used cars in three to six months and damages resale value .
Or it can put the vehicles into storage and pay dealers up to $ 1,250 apiece to take them off its hands .
Chrysler experienced the vicissitudes of over - production last year when it built cars without dealer orders and was forced to store them in open - air lots all around Detroit while it frantically sought buyers .
It damaged relations with its dealers and was eventually forced to cut production anyway .
the exchange rate is another uncontrollable factor that plays into the hands of the import brands .
When the yen got cheaper in 2005 , Harbour - Felax figures it was worth $ 1,054 per vehicle to Japanese manufacturers
On the revenue side , it is easier to apportion blame .
The lack of pricing power by American producers , brought on by poor quality , unimaginative marketing and sales to rental fleets , cost them nearly $ 1,000 per car .
When everything is added up , the average Japanese automaker reports revenue of $ 24,289 per vehicle - $ 2,692 more than the average domestic manufacturer .
All in all , the report paints a bleak picture .
While Nissan ( Charts ) was making $ 1800 per vehicle during the first half of 2006 , and Toyota and Honda ( Charts ) racked up $ 1,400 apiece , nine - month results for Ford saw them losing $ 1,400 per vehicle - a number that will go up when the fourth quarter 's loss is tallied - while DaimlerChrysler ( Charts ) dropped $ 1100 and GM $ 333 .
But cut Ford and the others a little slack .
They have gotten themselves in a deep hole but they were n't the only ones doing the digging .

GM to delay earnings , restate past results
The Harmony project , started May 18 , 2005 , moved out of its incubation phase and into full - fledged project status at the end of October .
Moving out of incubation is a sign within the Apache Software Foundation that an open source project is organized and has a critical mass of contributors .
It 's expecting to produce its 1.0 implementation of Java Standard Edition in mid-2007 .
" If Apache Harmony did n't exist , I do n't think Sun would have been motivated to make Java open source , " says Mike Milinkovich , executive director of the Eclipse Foundation , an open source programmer 's workbench project that has attracted hundreds of Java tools .
Milinkovich said the Harmony project has shown strong progress over the 18 months .
" My original interest was to push Sun to do what it has done today .
The battle is won and I 'm happy , " wrote Stefano Mazzocchi in an e-mail .
He is an Apache Foundation open source developer who helped shepherd Harmony through its infancy .
Geir Magnusson , chairman of the project , said Harmony now has 20 open source committers who both produce code and review other contributors ' code .
There were 2,000 posts to the comment list on Harmony in September and 3,026 in October , he said .
The regular mailing list to testers and contributors to Harmony numbers 627 .
Such statistics are used as a measure of the interest in and activity around an open source project , he noted .
Without testors and submitters of patches — adjustments and corrections for how the open source codes runs with other code or in particular software environments — the project will fail to produce a robust end result .
The Harmony project was started when Java was still clearly Sun 's proprietary code .
" Java should be a first - class citizen on Linux , and it could n't be as closed source , " said Magnusson .
In addition to Sun , proprietary version of the Java Development Kit and Java Virtual Machine also come from IBM and BEA Systems , who base their Java product lines on them .
Apache programmers , who were early adopters of Java , became concerned that Java would never be able to stay in step with Linux without an open source community focused on a constantly updated implementation of Java Standard Edition , Magnusson says .
Sun officials cited much the same reason for finally making Java open source .
Said Rich Green , Sun 's executive VP of software : " Sun will be working closely with with distributors of the GNU / Linux operating system , who will soon be able to include the Java Development Kit as part of [ their distributions ] . "
In addition to Linux distributors , such as Red Hat and Novell 's Suse , Sun aimed its Java open source code at the needs of telecommunications device makers , who run Linux with Mobile and Embedded Java on their smart phones and other devices .
Milinkovich predicted that Sun 's move to offer Java under the GPL will result in " additional energy being poured into Harmony to ensure that it competes on a technical level with Sun 's Java . "
To read his blog on Sun announcement , go to http://milinkovich.blogspot.com/2006/11/congratulations-simon.html.
For it to be a recognized implementation of Java , it will have to pass
Sun 's formidable suite of thousands of tests that proves the new implementation is compatible with Java applications written for its predecessors .
The Apache Foundation is the caretaker of the Apache Web server , which dominates active Web sites , as well as the Java servlet engine , Tomcat , frequently used with Java applications .
It hosts a Java database project as well , called Apache DB .
Three years after the invasion of Iraq , it is believed that half the Christians in the country have fled , driven out by bomb attacks , assassinations and death threats .
So why have n't the coalition forces done more to protect them ?
Mark Lattimer reports
Three members of his family had already been murdered before Shamon Isaac decided to leave Baghdad .
First , his son - in - law Raid Khalil was shot dead in January 2005 as he fled gunmen who had tried to pull him and his father into a minibus .
Like many Christians , Khalil had received a death threat signed by the Islamic Army in Iraq .
He left behind a widow and a baby girl , who is now nearly two .
Four weeks after Khalil was killed , Isaac 's brother was stopped at a checkpoint by seven men in Iraqi army uniforms as he was on his way to collect passports to take his own family out of the country .
" People in the neighbourhood shouted to his daughter that her father had been assassinated , " Isaac said , " and she came out and found his body in the street . "
Then last August Isaac 's brother - in - law was shot dead in his shop by three gunmen .
Finally Isaac and his family had no choice .
When in January this year cars started to circle the family home in al - Dora with men shooting in the air , they escaped to another Baghdad neighbourhood , al - Jediya .
But major demonstrations were taking place throughout the Muslim world in response to the Danish cartoons and on January 29 bombs ripped through seven churches in Baghdad , Mosul and Kirkuk , killing 16 .
Then one day a man walked into the small shop that the family had just opened next to their new home , bought some cigarettes and walked out , but not before he had left a letter on the counter .
On opening it , they found it contained a single word : " Blood . "
The mechanisms of terror in the new Iraq have uprooted families from every community , including Sunni and Shia , Arab and Kurd .
But although Christians made up less than four per cent of the population - fewer than one million people - they formed the largest groups of new refugees arriving in Jordan 's capital Amman in the first quarter of 2006 , according to an unpublished report by the UN High Commission for Refugees ( UNHCR ) .
In Syria , which has a longer border with Iraq , 44 % of Iraqi asylum - seekers were recorded as Christian since UNHCR began registrations in December 2003 , with new registrations hitting a high early this year .
Fleeing killings , kidnappings and death threats , they come from Baghdad , from Basra in the zone of British control and , disproportionately , from Mosul in the north .
The Catholic bishop of Baghdad , Andreos Abouna , was quoted recently as saying that half of all Iraqi Christians have fled the country since the 2003 US - led invasion .
Yet their exodus has gone largely unreported , despite the fact that both George Bush and Tony Blair have spoken about how their own Christian beliefs have informed their policies in Iraq .
In one of his first speeches after 9/11 , the US president described the fight against terrorism as a " crusade " , a characterisation that he wisely dropped but which is habitually repeated by critics of US foreign policy , including al - Qaida and other insurgent groups in Iraq .
Many Christians have been accused of association with the multinational force , or of supporting the west .
Now Iraqi Christian leaders are bitter that the west has done so little to protect them .
When Isaac fled Baghdad with 11 of his family it was , naturally enough , to the ancient home of Iraqi Christianity that they came - to the plains of Nineveh .
I met them there three weeks later , huddled in a room in Bartallah , outside Mosul , part of the great fertile flatland on the banks of the Tigris where nearly every village has its church , and each church now has an armed guard .
The plains are among the longest continually habited places on earth .
It was to save Nineveh that the Biblical God delivered up Jonah from the belly of the whale , and the Assyrian Christians here still speak Syriac , a dialect of Aramaic , the language Jesus Christ spoke with his apostles .
But Nineveh 's unique place in Christian heritage counts for little today beside its strategic value in the geo-ethnic endgame of the Iraqi conflict .
Situated between Iraqi Kurdistan and the insurgent strongholds west of Mosul , the Nineveh plains are central to the security of both , and to the territorial ambitions of Kurds and Sunni Arabs alike .
Travelling in Iraq as part of a human rights mission coordinated by the charity Minority Rights Group International , in association with the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq ( Unami ) , I was told that no aid workers had been able to operate here since May 2004 , when four Americans from a Baptist charity were killed in an ambush on the Mosul - Erbil road .
In Mosul city , both the Ba'athists and the Islamist groups had deep bases of support that enabled them to control whole neighbourhoods and , periodically , the city 's police .
" They stopped a Christian woman from Mosul university , took her away and cut off her head , " the manager of a women 's welfare organisation told me , her face flushed with the imagining of it .
" They said that if anyone comes to college without hijab , they will be killed . "
" The poor security situation covers all communities in the city , " explained Dr Yousef Lalo , the assistant governor of Mosul .
" But as a minority , the Christians are particularly vulnerable .
They are also often more affluent than other communities , so people try to extract money from them . "
A former psychology lecturer , Lalo 's habitual companions are no longer students but the bodyguards that testify to his status as the only remaining Christian in the city 's senior administration .
" Many churches were bombed in 2004 and 2005 but the multinational force and the Iraqi national army did not find out who was responsible ; they did n't even do a proper investigation .
It got worse and few people turned up even for Christmas and Easter celebrations .
Now the Christians protect their own churches . "
Lalo could n't provide a number for how many Christians had left Mosul , but said that " thousands " had emigrated to Jordan , Syria and Turkey .
" Half the Christians in Mosul have left since 2003 and the rest are planning to leave if they can .
Many of my family have emigrated to Australia and Sweden and become refugees . "
But this softly spoken professor was staying to fight .
" This is my land , and the land of my father and grandfathers , and I will not leave .
I have also forbidden my three sons to emigrate . "
That morning , Lalo had his first meeting with the multinational force commander for Mosul and eastern Nineveh , Colonel Michael Shields .
Although " meeting " is perhaps not quite the right word for an encounter that began when four US soldiers in full battle dress came through the front door unannounced , the commander demanding : " Who 's the leader ?
Where 's the leader ? "
But once the Americans had put down their weapons and body armour , the exchange that followed was polite enough .
I knew Lalo was bitter that the US had supported the appointment of a Muslim mayor in a predominantly Christian area and Shields told me he was working hard to improve contacts with local officials .
He explained : " Nineveh province is an ethnically challenging area .
If the governor shows favouritism , that creates problems . "
Lalo ventured bluntly that Shields ' predecessor had been " bad for the Christians " .
" That , " the colonel said , " is water under the bridge . "
The Christians ' last hope in Iraq may just lie , according to Lalo , with Sarkis Aghajan , minister of finance in the Kurdistan regional government and , until last May , Kurdish deputy prime minister .
It is he who has been channelling money to Nineveh to pay for armed guards .
In his palatial residence in Ankawa , a Christian neighbourhood in Iraqi Kurdistan , he talked about his community as he sat between a picture of the crucifixion and the statue of an eagle .
" As Christians , " he said in Syriac , " we regard Nineveh as our region .
Throughout history our people have been obliged to leave and live elsewhere . "
This included those who had fled Saddam Hussein 's campaign to " Arabise " Kurdish and Christian areas in the north , when land was redistributed by force to Arab settlers .
But now , he explained , about 3,500 families had come from Mosul and Baghdad to settle in the Nineveh plains .
" More than 30 Christian villages have been restored .
But people will not return unless they feel their national rights are protected .
Before , people were kidnapped on a daily basis .
We increased the number of armed guards and now there are thousands .
We are not threatening any other party , but the Kurds look out for the Kurds , the Arabs for the Arabs , so we have to protect ourselves too . "
But Aghajan 's ambitions go further .
He is convinced that the only way to secure protection in the longer term is for an autonomous region , a safe haven , to be established covering Nineveh 's Christians , as well as smaller minority communities there such as the Yezidis and the Shabak .
" This special region would help us to maintain Christian history in that place .
In that way , there would be no way for Kurds or Arabs to intervene .
This would encourage the Christians living outside to come back , and it would be an example in the Middle East . "
Aghajan is also sure that such an autonomous region should be part of an enlarged Kurdistan , prompting some politicians from Nineveh to accuse him of serving a Kurdish agenda .
One , who fears the prospect of Kurdish control as much as a return by the Ba'athists , described him as " prime minister Barzani 's loyal Christian " .
But Aghajan insists that the Nineveh plains would " get a fairer share " from the Kurdistan administration than from the central government .
He praised Barzani 's leadership .
But he also knows that many Christians are already voting with their feet for the relative safety of Kurdistan .
Then he decribed how his people had been betrayed .
" It was easy for the Americans and the British to have supported us when the churches were bombed - it was a historic opportunity - but they did nothing .
If they had supported us financially , for example , we could have protected all the Christian families in Mosul . "
Asked if he thought the Americans might be afraid to be seen to support the Christians , because that might be perceived as partisan or anti-Muslim , he waved his arm impatiently .
" They did n't have to do it publicly - they could have done it through the Kurdistan Regional Government or through individuals .
Now the Christians in Mosul are being made to change their religion .
They are forced to pay money for jihad .
If you hear the stories of those people , you will understand the tragedy .
I am not talking about one of two families , or even a thousand , but about a nation .
" If our friends do n't help us now , their friendship will be worth nothing in future .
If it continues as it has , Baghdad and Mosul will be emptied of Christians . "
As he spoke , I recalled Bush 's words , over three years ago , from the decks of the USS Abraham Lincoln , announcing " the end of major combat operations " in Iraq .
The president is fond of using biblical quotations in his speeches and he ended this one with a stirring message from the prophet Isaiah : " To the captives , ' Come out ! ' and to those in darkness , ' Be free ! ' "
In May , Iraq 's first full - term government since the fall of Saddam Hussein was approved in Baghdad .
Wijdan Mikha'il , a town planner and member of the secular Iraqi National List , was appointed as the new minister of human rights - a hard job , she remarked to me ruefully , in a country where " the people hardly have any rights " .
Mikha'il is also a Christian , the only one in the government .
When she got the job , she moved her family , including her three young boys , from their spacious Baghdad house to live in a hotel behind the concrete blast walls of the Green Zone .
Over supper there one evening she talked to me about the sectarianism that has poisoned Iraqi society .
" I have always seen myself as an Iraqi first , and then a Christian .
Before , we all lived together , we never thought that someone was a Sunni and the other was a Shia , or a Christian , but now it is different . "
She has held discussions with the Iraqi Council of Minorities , a new umbrella group that is pushing for amendments to the constitution to improve human rights protection .
When I asked Mikha'il about how many Christians were leaving , she said : " The process started before the war but it has accelerated .
In the schools the children now say that a Christian is a kaffir , that he is different from the Muslims .
And that means he can be treated differently .
In 20 years there will be no more Christians in Iraq . "
As she talked , two men and two women , dressed mainly in black , walked into the hotel restaurant and sat down in a corner .
The minister lowered her voice : " They are Saddam 's witnesses . "
The trial of Saddam Hussein was in session that week , stumbling from one adjournment to the next , and Mikha'il listed some of the atrocities for which the former dictator should still be tried , including the genocidal Anfal campaign against the Kurds , in which many Christians were also killed .
So was it worse before , or now , from the point of view of the Christian community ?
She replied immediately : " It 's worse now .
Not just for my community - for all Iraqis .
Of course , what is happening now , Saddam partly created .
We have gone in one year to a situation we would have reached after 15 years if Saddam was still in power : the lack of security , the breakdown of society . . . "
Suddenly she laughed , for the first time that evening .
" So maybe it is better to get there in one year , so we can start the process of improvement . "
Would she herself still be here in 20 years ' time ?
This time she hesitated .
" I do n't think so .
I love Iraq .
I had so many opportunities to leave , but I always stayed .
But I do n't want my children to live here "
« Why " duh " ... is n't .

Screaming users considered good »
Be Provocative
When you want to get -- and especially keep -- someone 's attention , what 's your competition ?
What else could they choose to focus on at any given moment ?
The belief that we have 100 % conscious control over what we pay attention to is a myth .
The belief that users can and will choose to pay attention to our message / ad / docs / product / lesson , etc. is a mistake .
So what can we do to up the odds of getting and keeping attention ?
I just returned from two weekends of intense horse / human training , including the annual Parelli conference , and you 'll just have to suffer through several posts in which I map everything into some all - I - needed - to - know - I - learned - from - my - horse principle .
Starting with this post .
At the first clinic , master trainer David Lichman said of our horse - human relationships :
" The secret is to be more provocative and interesting than anything else in their environment . "
If we want our users ( members , guests , students , potential customers , kids , co-workers , etc. ) to pay attention , we have to be provocative .
We can moan all we want about how the responsible person should pay attention to what 's important rather than what 's compelling .
But it 's not about responsibility or maturity .
It 's not even about interest .
It 's about the brain .
Remember , the brain and the conscious mind do n't always see neuron - to - neuron .
The brain pays attention to survival of the species .
No matter what the mind wants !
If you want the mind 's attention , you can't ignore the brain .
In other words , you can't assume that users will pay attention to what you say even when they 're genuinely interested .
Unless , that is , you throw a bone to the brain as well .
Or trick it .
So this is n't about having to bribe people into paying attention by sexing things up with graphics , sound , or shock .
This is about helping the mind and the brain agree on what 's worth paying attention to .
And if you want it to be you , then you better be the most provocative and interesting thing in their environment .
With horses , there 's not as much competition .
There 's no HorseBox 360 or PonyMail .
No Horse 2.0 . No PonyMeme .
Yet it 's still a battle to be more compelling than the grass , the wind , a plastic bag , other horses ( especially ) , playing the whoever - moves - their - feet - first - loses game with me , etc .
And as smart and complex as my [ fabulous Icelandic ] horses are , they 're still way easier to interest than a human .
Being Provocative
Provocation is in the eye of the provoked , obviously , so there 's no clear formula .
But there 's plenty we can try , depending on the circumstances , including :
* Be Visual
Pictures are more important to the brain than words , and unless you 've already got their attention and are a good enough writer to paint pictures in their head , you 'll do better with visuals .
The more stimulating the better .
Even graphs and charts are a huge help ... it does n't have to be pictures of naked women ( although that would work , of course .
Just try to get past a rack of men's magazines ( without the " protective covers " ) without at least a glance .
Your brain can't help it , so let yourself off the hook ; )
* Be Different -- Break Patterns and Expectations
As long as we 're doing what everyone else is doing ( or what we have always done ) , the brain can relax and think , " Nothing new here ... whew ... what a relief , that means I can now go back to scanning for something that is " .
Ways to be different include doing the opposite of what you normally do , or doing something expected in a different domain , but which is wildly unique in yours .
* Be Daring
You know the story on this one -- being safe is often incompatible with being provocative .
* Change Things Regularly
This is about continually breaking your own patterns .
Consistently shaking things up whether it's look and feel of your website to the product itself .
( Obviously the definition of " regularly " and " things " varies dramatically depending on the type of product or service .
MySpace can change daily to the delight of its core audience , while a financial app better keep its UI stable for a much longer time and find something else to change regularly ( like the website , tutorial style , or online forums ) .
* Inspire Curiosity
Humans often find puzzles and even questions irresistible .
Just try to walk by a TV playing a quiz show and not think about the answer to the question you heard walking by .
How many times have you watched to the end of a movie you did n't particularly like , just because you had to find out how the story ends ?
Our legacy brains love curiosity because it usually means more learning .
( FYI - my horse finds orange traffic cones irresistible )
* Pose a Challenge
The level and nature of the challenge work only if they 're within boundaries that work for your audience , of course .
Ask me to solve a calculus problem and I 'll keep on walking .
Ask my co-author Bert , and he 'll find it impossible to do anything else but work on it .
* Be Controversial and Committed
Take a stand .
Mediocrity is not a formula for holding attention .
* Be Fun
Remember , brains love fun because fun=play , and play=practicing - to - survive .
( And as we 've said many times here , fun does not have to mean funny .
Chess can be fun but is n't funny .
Except when I play . )
* Be Stimulating .
Be Exciting .
Be Seductive
Keep in mind that seduction does not have to mean sexual .
A good storyteller can seduce me into sticking with the story .
A good teacher can seduce me into learning .
A good software app can seduce me into getting better and better .
* Help them have Hi-Res Experiences
This gets back to the notion of being - better - is - better .
The more your users know and can do , the higher resolution experience they have .
Whatever you can do to give them more expertise will help keep them interested in wanting to know and do more .
But they need to be up the skill curve a ways before this really kicks in , so we must do whatever we can to help get new users past the rough spots ( i.e. the " suck threshold " ) .
* ???
Your turn .
What are your ideas for how we ( or you ) can be more provocative ?
Who 's doing a good job ?
Who is not ?
( Note : I 'm currently in the middle of a difficult multi-country work trip in Europe , so I 'm having a tough time getting online .
I apologize for not responding to your comments here recently , but they 're HUGELY motivating for me , so ... thanks : )

To answer your question Kathy - too few people are being provocative , be that in business or in the creative world .
Those that are , get noticed .
So my prescription would be to say what you think ( as opposed to what you think people want to hear ) .
Even if they disagree , they will pay attention and one hopes engage with you ( but they 'll still be thinking of that jerk Bob ) .
Be emotional .
Posted by : John Dodds | Sep 13 , 2006 12:16:05 PM
P.S. It 's a bit old hat now , but Simon Cowell was a provocateur .
He said what he felt and initially people were outraged , but everyone paid attention and gradually those who had been affronted came round to realising that he was being honest and accurate which are the other two key ingredients to successful provocation .
Posted by : John Dodds | Sep 13 , 2006 12:22:14 PM
Timing is also key .
If your trying to accomplish a goal and not just " be provocative " you 'll need to be aware of the circumstances and have a clear measure of the situation in order to apply the right combination of provocative behaviour .
Being provocative at the wrong time or in the wrong way can work against you .
I know a few people that get attention , say what they want , and say it any time they want .
While they are certainly noticed , they are more likely thought of as that a ** hole Bob .
You 'll be remembered , but not the way most of us would want .
Posted by : Earl Moore | Sep 13 , 2006 12:39:27 PM
Well duh !
Be Passionate :)
In a world where people are too busy to care making the time to take the time can say more than words can .
Provocative could be felt to be aggressive , provoking the primal defensive reactions , not good .
What 's great is that to be provocative without being aggressive means taking the time to listen , to watch , to care ( ? ) and to find the habitual unthinking patterns then interrupt them in ways that enables us to notice things that did n't register on our radar .
" Hmm , that 's funny " - did n't somebody say that was the moment of insight ?
Posted by : ken | Sep 13 , 2006 1:09:28 PM
Really interesting post - except at the end .
" Hi - Res Experiences " .
Just sounds like the buzzword of the month ... Ten years ago I worked for a company whose mission statement included " providing a total quality experience " .
" ??? " .
When bloggers ask for comments , it 's like they are just seeking affirmation .
There would n't be a comment area if you did n't want readers to comment .
People are moved to read and comment because your posts are interesting and well thought out , not because you ask them to comment .
But the the rest of the post was very helpful .
Thanks ,

Very provacative article .
You got us to read to the end .
Nicely done .
I always liked the sequence Awareness - Attention - Action from The Attention Economy .
So true ... without this " provacativeness " everything else fades into the background .
There is a lot to learn from animal behaviorism that applies in business .
I 've always wanted to attend one of those Parelli Conferences ... glad to hear it was good .
And look forward to hearing more about it .

I also enjoy the Neuromarketing ( the cognitive science of " selling " ) Blog .
A recent post mirrors what Kathy says :
A little while later , though , I was reading an interesting article on the neuroscience of attention , i.e. , what “ paying attention ” means from a brain activity standpoint .
In daily life , people are presented with lots of inputs - people talking to them , broadcast media , things happening around them , etc. , and only a small portion of that is actively processed by the brain .
( We ’ll cover some of this work in another post . )
Clearly , attention is a key part of the marketer ’s task ; if the message is lost in the cacophony of background noise , the decision - making process will never come into play at all .

There 's something that you 've written about before that should go onto the list :
Peer group pressure
If you feel like you 're part of a group based around a particular " thing " , then that can be a strong motivating influence to keep current with that thing .
For example , there were reports of people playing the game Everquest for hours on end just so they could maintain their position ( success ) within that community .
While that 's a fairly extreme example , other products can generate a similar compulsion .
eg .
If you 're part of a clique based on Java ( or Ruby , or ) - wild horses ( no pun intended ) would n't be able to stop you from getting the latest and the greatest as soon as it's released for fear of not being able to keep up with the rest of the clique .
But then I guess that 's another of the primal motivators when you scratch the surface anyway . :-)

My addition :
Be genuine .

Posted by : Fel | Sep 13 , 2006 7:26:51 PM
Awesome post !
Well , I think , perhaps surprisingly , that once you are provocative you have to be provocative .
Capture user attention and then to hold on to it you have to keep on coming up with right stuff .
But here is what is really tricky - combining provocative things with consistency .
Not only you need to be consitently provocative , you need to be consistent .
And that is pretty hard .

Posted by : lb | Sep 14 , 2006 2:02:29 AM
Kathy ,
Having studied various expert provocateurs , and being one for a living , one of the points you mentioned here hints at what I think is the real skill in being provocative .
" Change things regularly - breaking your own patterns "
This pattern breaking behaviour is what trains you to observe , and then interrupt patterns _just_ enough to change , but not destroy them .
As humans we are comfortable with what is familiar , but we learn by what 's different .
If you are observant enough to notice the patterns , you can poke and prod at the _edges_ of the pattern and provoke , challenge and interest much more .
At the edges we can both be comfortable with the familiar , and at the same time learn by what 's different .
Posted by : Michael Vanderdonk | Sep 14 , 2006 2:05:26 AM
Have a missing element .
Counter - intuitive but true .
Gestalt theory says that as humans , we search to fill in gaps .
If you have a missing piece of information that 's not critical to the message / ad / docs / product / lesson , you can reall get someone 's attention .
Take a look at " Lost " , the TV show .
There 's a lot missing from what we know , and it 's spawned entire online communities who are trying to puzzle things out .
This is different from Pose a Challenge , and is closer to Inspire Curiosity .
" We 've shown you five ways to do this procedure , but there 's one more .
Can you figure it out based on the information in the previous section ? "

Hi Kathy ,
You got my attentention today at the European RailsConf !
Your presentation was really inspiring .
I did n't want to miss a word of it , you kept me totally engaged .
You used the tactics you mentioned in the blogposts to great effect : the whole room seemed enchanted by your presentation .
A nice practical demonstration of the theory you give in the post .
Thanks again for reigniting the passion in me to make a change in this world by showing how we can build software that brings / keeps people in a state flow and thereby makes more happy people :)

I like omni's comment : " Peer Group Pressure . "
BE OVER - THE - TOP .
Be the most welcoming , the most pseudo - fresh , the most crazy , the most fast - talking , the nicest , the most goofy person they 've ever met .
( I go for this with kids of my friends ) .
BE ENTHUSIASTIC .
Who does n't say this ?
That enthusiasm is they key top most of life 's success .
Many do : Samuel Smiles , Napoleon Hill , Jerry Valley the hypnotist .
BE GOOD - FEELINGS -ASSOCIATED-WITH-YOU :
Get music involved with you .
Get good food involved .
Get jokes involved .
Great Book Suggestions coming from you .
Great website recs .
Great personal recs .

Once again , Kathy , the parallel to education in your thinking about users jumps out .
Your list is a perfect one to guide a teacher who is trying to get a student to engage some knowledge .
Alas , the kids of our times are languishing in an environment mostly described by the opposites of your list .
I 've hit that a lick here :

As your educational teacher - reader you have also hit the nail on the head as to why One out of every 5 kids is not graduating .
In a world of adults that want engagement , I wonder why so many adults feel like that students should be forced to sit with pen and paper for 6 hours a day .
In a world of video , internet , cell phones , and every technological innovation we can dream of , we have the greatest educational engagement tools available to us in history .
Of course , we can never forget that the number one tool of engagement is a person ( or teacher ) who is excited ( Yes , passionate ) and energetic .
It is true for teachers and for life .
By helping kids find and do what they are passionate about , perhaps we can have more passionate adults and not mind - numbed robots who hate their jobs .
It is time for an educational revolution in this country as we reinvent education to be more exciting and engaging to students .
Right now , public education has tested the life out of itself .
I teach at a private school where we only test once a year but remain in the 90th percentile in every subject and every grade .
We are given the freedom to innovate in our classrooms .
If I had one wish for my public school counterparts whom I respect and admire , it would be for them to be allowed to truly engage in provocative teaching in their classroom .
I have one friend in the public system here who is only allowed to teach directly out of one workbook and is restricted from doing anything else .
We have great teachers everywhere , but a system that scripts the teaching out of teaching .
A bored teacher reading aloud from a script is rarely if ever going to be provacative .
And we wonder why people who come out of such a system have a difficult time being provocative themselves !
This a great post .
It is applicable to many fields including mine .

No question on the ways to be Provacative , but in traditional corporate culture it's hard to do most of these things without getting negative attention .
But I guess that 's what vanguards do :)
