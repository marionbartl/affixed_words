The animal was spotted as it passed the Houses of Parliament
The 16 - 18 ft ( 5 m ) northern bottle - nosed whale , which is usually found in deep sea waters , has been seen as far upstream as Chelsea .
A rescue boat has been sent to protect the whale and rescuers have been trying to keep it away from the river banks .
Specialist equipment , including inflatable tubes to re-direct the animal downstream , are being sent .
The whale has come within yards of the banks and has crashed into an empty boat causing slight bleeding .
The last thing we want to do is stress the animal out

Vets are remaining on standby and experts have said it does not appear to be ill , but are concerned it will get weaker and may become beached .
Tony Woodley , of the British Divers Marine Life Rescue , which will be handling the rescue , said the animal 's welfare was the main priority .
He said if attempts to re-direct the whale downstream failed , it might be necessary to put it down to prevent from suffering further .
' Breathing normally '
The RNLI say it is the first whale rescue on the Thames .
A spokesman said three whales were spotted east of the Thames Barrier on Thursday but only one managed to get upstream .
But at 0830 GMT on Friday , a man on a train called in to say he might have been hallucinating , but he had just seen a whale in the Thames .
Alison Shaw of the Marine and Freshwater Conservation Programme at London Zoo , said the northern bottle - nosed whale was usually found in groups of three to 10 .
She told the BBC News website : " This is extremely rare in British waters as they are normally found in deep waters in the North Atlantic .
The whale is thought to weigh about seven tonnes .

" It is about 16 - 18 ft long , so is relatively mature .
It is a very long way from home and we do n't know why it has ended up here . "
The whales usually weigh about seven tonnes , which will complicate any rescue attempt , experts said .
London Aquarium Curator Paul Hale told the BBC : " Getting that to do anything it does n't want to do is going to be extremely difficult .
" This is a very active swimming animal and it's not going to go anywhere it does n't want to go so we have to persuade it to swim back out . "
Liz Sandeman , a medic of the Marine Connection , a whale and dolphin protection charity , accompanied the RNLI to examine the animal .
She feared it might be in danger from other boats , or be frightened by the noise .
" The last thing we want to do is stress the animal out , " she said .
Over the years dolphins and seals have been spotted in the Thames .
Sperm whales have been seen in the Thames Estuary and porpoises have feasted on fish near Vauxhall Bridge , in central London .
Hyperoodon ampullatus Adult length : 7 - 10 m ( 23-33ft ) Weight : 5.8 - 7.5 tonnes Diet : Squid , fish Habitat : Deep offshore waters Range : Arctic and North Atlantic Status : Lower risk , conservation dependent , protected since 1977 Distinctive feature : Bulbous forehead

Downwardly Scalable Systems
David N. Welton

2004-11-14
A lot of thought has been dedicated to scalability in computer systems .
However , outside of the embedded systems arena , most of this effort has gone into making systems ever larger and faster .
I would like to take the opposite approach , and discuss the implications of programming languages that " scale down " .
I choose programming languages because it's a subject I take a great deal of interest in , but I believe that the basic ideas here are applicable to many complex systems that require human interaction .
Good systems should be able to scale down as well as up .
They should run on slower computers that do n't have as much memory or disk storage as the latest models .
Likewise , from the human point of view , downwardly scalable systems should also be small enough to learn and use without being an expert programmer .
It 's not always possible to have all of these things .
Engineering is often the art of balancing several compromises , after all , and at times , it 's necessary to add computing power in order to attain simplicity .
However , it is always a good idea to keep all these targets in mind , even if design dictates that one or the other of them may be less important .
Naturally , we can't forget the " scalability " part of the equation while focusing on " simple " .
It 's not that hard to make something small and easy to use .
The trick is that it's also got to be extensible , in order to grow .
The system should be easy to pick up , but it should also be easy to add to , and should also provide tools to modularize and otherwise compartmentalize the growing system in order to not end up with what is known in technical terms as a " godawful mess " .
And of course it should still be fun to work with for the more experienced programmer .
Another part of the balancing act is that often times " simple " equates to hidden complexity .
For example programming languages like Tcl or Python are " simpler " than C , but this is a result of the implementation hiding a lot of the complexity from the programmer .
In this case , scaling down from a human point of view conflicts with scaling down resource usage to some degree , in that these languages require a bigger runtime , and more processor power to accomplish similar tasks .
Why scale down ?
Systems that scale down are not just nice in theory , but have many benefits .
To start with , they have the potential to create more value .
By being accessible to people with less experience and talent , they allow more people to get more things done than a system requiring more advanced skills would .
The nicest tool in the world is of no use to you if cannot figure out how make use of it in the time you have .
You may object , saying that not everyone should be able to use every tool , and of course that 's true .
We do n't all expect to be able to fly airplanes , and yet they are still valuable to us .
The point is , however , that where two systems are capable of doing the same job equally well , the more accessible tool is more valuable in that more people are productive with it .
It 's especially important to realize that in some cases , this is more than just a matter of degree - there is actually a cutoff point , meaning that some people will be able to do no work with a tool that is too difficult .
So to these people , the complex , hard to use option is simply not an option at all !
Of course , having more users is n't necessarily a benefit in and of itself , but if you have a reasonably good user community , it often is [ 1 ] .
Disruptive Technologies
In some ways , systems that scale down may be winners in the long term even if they do n't scale up as well as others .
Consider the definition of " disruptive technology " :
A disruptive technology is a new technological innovation , product , or service that eventually overturns the existing dominant technology in the market , despite the fact that the disruptive technology is both radically different than the leading technology and that it often initially performs worse than the leading technology according to existing measures of performance . [ 2 ]
In short : when the programming technology that scales down is " good enough " , it may open up a field of programming to people who previously were not able to accomplish anything at all - and give many more people the chance to write " good enough " code much faster .
Perhaps experienced programmers are grumbling about " the right tool for the job " , and complaining about putting sharp tools in the hands of novices .
To a degree , they 're right .
It 's best to use hammers for nails , and saws to cut boards , and to know something about them before taking them to a board .
Computer systems , especially programming languages , are very complex tools though , and take a lot longer to learn for many people than learning to hit nails with a hammer .
What this means is that many people find it valuable to be able to do more things with the tools they know how to use .
Maybe the tool is n't perfect , but if it does a reasonable job of solving the problem at hand , it 's probably a net gain to be able to write the code in the first place .
For example , I once did some work for a client who was , at heart , a marketing guy who came up with a clever idea for a product .
He wrote the initial code that made it work , and ... frankly , it was pretty obvious that he was a marketing guy rather than a programmer .
But - and this is crucial - he was able to make it work with the scripting language he used .
If he'd had to use something like Java or C that was over his head , he might not have got his product to the point where he was making enough money to hire me to clean up his code .
Scaling down does n't necessarily equate to a disruptive technology , of course .
In many cases it 's easy to rejig things just a bit , or create a better , clearer interface without revolutionizing either your product or the market in which it resides .
Truly disruptive technologies often create new markets where none existed .
" Case Studies "
Let 's look at some real - world examples :
Dr. John Ousterhout , author of the Tcl programming language and the Tk GUI toolkit realized that scripting languages were a winning proposition early on , creating a revolutionary way to easily write graphical applications .
This made Tcl and Tk a big success , and they continue to be very widely used , long after complex , proprietary rivals such as Motif have fallen by the wayside .
Tcl has had some struggles with scaling up , but in general has n't managed too badly .
Perhaps
Tk is n't well suited to writing a huge , complex application like an office suite , however the speed of a scripting language is perfectly adequate for many GUI 's .
After all , the time it takes you to move the mouse and click is an eternity in computer cycles .
PHP is another example .
While PHP is not a particularly elegant system , and suffers from some flaws in its approach to simplicity ( it 's too tied to the web world , which has limited its uptake for other uses ) , it has done a phenomenal job of making dynamic web programming available to many people who would otherwise not be able to , or would have to spend much more time to make their code work .
" But what about all the bad PHP code out there ?! " .
Sure - it 's there , but consider that the people doing the ugly programming are almost certainly not trained programmers .
Perhaps they are doctors , businessmen , artists with deep knowledge of other fields .
PHP is therefore the tool that , through its approachability , makes it possible for them to do something that they otherwise could not do .
If they are successful in their endeavors , maybe they will attract " real " programmers who will help them out either because it's a successful business venture , or because it 's a popular open source idea .
In any case , they are better off with an ugly program they wrote to do the job than an elegant programming language that they can't make heads nor tails of .
Contrast these languages with Java .
Java is n't a bad language , particularly .
It 's easier than C in some ways , and certainly safer for the average programmer , who has to worry less about memory issues , walking off then end of arrays , and things of that ilk that in C , not only crash the system , but may create security risks .
Java is fairly resource intensive - it requires lots of disk space , memory .
Worse , it 's not something that is easy to pick up quickly for the ' average guy ' .
It has a verbose syntax that is unpleasant to use if you do n't know your tools well , or even if you just want to whip up something quickly .
The target for " downwardly scalable languages " that we 're talking about are the individuals who , due to their lack of experience , are more likely to have bad tools than a veteran programmer who can play emacs like a piano .
Java also makes it difficult to do easy things .
To even get started , you have to have some notions of object oriented programming , you have to split your code up into lots of little files that must be properly named , and you must have a few ideas about packages to even print something to the screen , with System.out.
println ( " hello world " ) ;
Of course , if you are writing thousands upon thousands of lines of code , some of these language features that initially seem like annoyances turn into advantages , and would be sensible rules to follow for any programming team wishing to keep their sanity .
While it 's fine to say " it just was n't meant for that " , perhaps Java could have been made easier for the casual user .
Java scales up to projects with multiple teams and many programmers better than other systems do .
So they have done something right , but have n't been able ( or willing ) to make the system downwardly scalable .
Ok , but how ?
Making systems that are easy to use is an art in and of itself , and high quality code does n't necessarily translate into something that automatically scales down .
Here are some ideas on how to make your product scale down .
Make it small , and make it easy to extend .
This way , you do n't have a lot of luggage to carry around , and yet you can extend the system to do more things later .
The C programming language is a pretty good example of this .
The Scheme language got the small part right , but until more recently has had trouble with the ' extend it easily ' bit .
Make it simple and coherent .
Do n't give it too many fancy rules .
Make it internally coherent in the way it 's used , so that people can make reasonable assumptions when they see a new extension or library .
They will see patterns in your system which will enhance their comprehension .
Tcl and Python show these qualities ( despite having grown some warts over time ) .
C++ and Perl tend toward the opposite pole : big and complex , with many rules to remember .
You can always choose to use a subset , but when you think about communicating functionality to other people , perhaps in terms of source code , it means that in the wider world , you can't stick to a simpler set of rules to keep in mind .
Make it do something " out of the box " .
It should be easy to get set up and doing productive things with the system .
Complex configurations with thousands of options are useless if it 's impossible to get a basic configuration working .
The Apache web server requires little configuration to make it serve web pages , so while it is in some ways complex ( configuring it from scratch might prove quite difficult , infact ) , it scales down by being useful right away .
Given several options , make the common one the default , and the others a possibility .
As programmers , we tend to think that we should give the user all kinds of clever options .
However , most people are going to use one of the options most of the time , so in reality , it 's often best to make that easy , and add a means of performing the less frequently used options when they are desired .
Tcl , when it gets things right , does a great job of this .
For instance , its socket command is very easy to use .
The default is to open a socket to a given hostname and port .
Then , if you need to configure things further , such as setting the character encoding , blocking or non-blocking , and so forth , Tcl provides a command to configure options .
So people who just want a socket get it very simply , with no clutter : set sk [ socket www.google.com 80 ]
Use simple , open protocols .
If you have to transmit data , or have configuration files , make them easy to understand , and simple to write - by hand or via other programs .
This lets people interact with your system in new and interesting ways , as well as keeping it accessible to the newcomer .
Always keep on eye on the future , when you may need to scale up , to large groups of programmers , for work that requires speed and the ability to work with large quantities of data .
Design the system so that scaling up is easy , or at least possible .
Conclusions
Naturally , it 's not always a good idea to scale down .
There are systems that really do need to be as fast as possible , or to deal with very complex problems , and trying to broaden the user base is a secondary consideration compared with these other goals .
However , in many cases these goals are not incompatible , and the simplicity and clarity involved in scaling down will make for a larger , more vibrant market for your product .

Did Civilization Emerge Thanks To A Change In The Weather ?
By Rusty Rockets
In Collapse : How Societies Choose To Fail or Succeed , Jared Diamond sets out to determine what causes a society to fail and eventually collapse .
The five factors that Diamond believes drive societal failure are : hostile neighbors , loss of trading partners , environmental damage , climatic change , and how societies respond to these potentially devastating environmental problems .
The general assumption is that civilizations evolve from benign environments that sustain what we may consider a natural state of being , but where poor resource management will lead to certain failure .
The point has been received well by many who believe Collapse to be an adequate exploration of societal failure .
And yet the subsequent arrival of another hypothesis has turned Diamond 's theory on its head by arguing that climate change does n't always spell the end for civilizations , but can actually drive the formation of complex and sophisticated societies .
Dr. Nick Brooks , a Senior Research Associate at Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research , had an interesting hypothesis lined up for his audience at the BA Festival of Science earlier this month .
Using evidence from archaeological digs and the palaeoclimatic record , Brooks claims that significant changes in social organization have coincided with abrupt climate change .
But Brooks is n't referring to yet another ancient civilization collapsing .
Rather , he suggests that the changes societies undergo can be adaptive responses to climate change .
In fact , Brooks argues that what we call civilization is in fact the by - product of these social adaptations to environmental change .
" There is widespread evidence that climatic and environmental stress played a major role in the emergence of early civilizations , and that aridification in particular acted as a trigger for increased social complexity associated with urbanization and state formation , " says Brooks .
It 's easy to assume that Diamond and Brooks ' arguments are at odds , but on a general level they actually dovetail , revealing the precarious situation that modern day societies find themselves in , and the decisions that they must eventually make .
The evidence that Brooks draws on relates to the formation of Egyptian , Mesopotamian , South Asian , Chinese and northern South American civilizations between 6,000 - 4,000 years ago .
During this period these regions experienced climate change due to variations in the Earth 's orbit , which led to a weakening of monsoon systems and more arid conditions .
The subsequent dwindling of resources resulted in nomadic peoples converging upon what resources remained , which in turn resulted in societal hierarchies able to manage large bodies of people .
It is plausible that the necessity to settle permanently in the Nile Valley , coupled with a likely increase in population due to immigration resulting from the desertification of the surrounding Saharan regions , stimulated both technological innovation and further social stratification .
" Current models of Egyptian state formation suggest that the northward expansion that led to unification followed a period in which competing proto - state entities coalesced in Upper Egypt in the late sixth millennium BP [ before present ] , " explains Brooks .
" It is tempting to interpret such a process within a context of both cooperation [ between the constituent elements of such entities ] and conflict [ between entities ] driven by the need for collective security in a time of instability and dwindling resources . "
Of course , this is n't to say that societies do n't collapse due to bad management and environmental pressures , as Diamond suggests , but then nobody 's saying that societies always overcome adversity or make the right ecological decisions .
Brooks concedes that societies can succumb to environmental pressures , and that societies facing similar climactic problems may employ different strategies with different outcomes .
" The purpose here is not to present a case for climatic determinism , " says Brooks , " rather to illustrate that climatic and environmental change of a kind usually associated [ correctly or incorrectly ] with the collapse of civilizations also appears to have played a significant role in the emergence of the very same civilizations . "
This take on civilization runs counter to long held beliefs that society as we now know it emerged from the single transition from the debilitating environment of the last ice - age to more favorable benign conditions .
" Civilization did not arise as the result of a benign environment which allowed humanity to indulge a preference for living in complex , urban , civilized societies , " says Brooks .
" On the contrary , what we tend to think of today as civilization was in large part an accidental by - product of unplanned adaptation to catastrophic climate change .
Civilization was a last resort - a means of organizing society and food production and distribution , in the face of deteriorating environmental conditions . "
It 's not hard to see how the necessity of this " temporary " measure that we call civilization is what led ( and still does ) many of the citizens to experience social inequalities , crime , exposure to disease , and harsh work conditions .
In short , the pay off for living in a secure environment meant that people had to work a lot harder , were exposed to more hardship , and were generally less healthy .
Brooks also adds that the hierarchical structures of power that have been a consequence of civilization mean that a few powerful people can exploit the situation , and therefore have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo .
But if civilization really is only a temporary fix put in place during the enormous climactic upheavals of past generations , then this attitude is not conducive to further adaptations if they are required .
So , on the one hand we have Diamond telling us that preventative measures must be put in place now , as the technological fixes used to advance society to date have contributed to the problems that we are currently experiencing .
Smarter farming practices , a reduction in fossil fuel emissions and the development of greener technologies should be invested in .
On the other hand , we have Brooks showing us how humans adapt to their environment after the fact .
But Brooks also notes that : " The nature of early civilizations varied considerably , and there was no single trajectory followed by societies as they adapted to increasing aridity . "
This means that the action we take now will have far reaching consequences for the future .
In this respect , both Diamond and Brooks are urging for us to look closely and learn from history .
Irrespective of whether future climate change is the result of human activity , both Brooks and Diamond agree that climate change will occur in the future as it has in the past .
And how we address these concerns seems to be the point in question .
It would be ironic if the very civilizations that emerged as a way to deal with climate change eventually rendered us static and unable to adapt .
The following conversation made it painfully clear that much of the hardware being pushed into the Gulf has no possible use against Iraq .
He assumes the mission he is being sent on is aimed at Iran .
He was not convinced a decision had been made to attack , but at the very least it was a show of force to let Iran know we meant business .
I also asked him how well carrier groups are at operating in a relatively confined space like the gulf .
He said they were not designed for such purposes but they had been praciticng a lot and were getting very good at dealing witht he lack of space .
Finally , he wanted to point out the amount of long term damage being done to the military due to the costs of the war in Iraq - specifically the cost of all the equipment and the damage to the personell structure .
To sum up our long and disturbing conversation :
The much if not all of our carrier capacity in the Gulf is pointed at Iran , this is what they are wargaming and what the officers are worried about .
The Persian Gulf is not a great place for carriers .
For all of our power and the capacity of our officers , any ship in the Gulf is very exposed to missile fire .
Even if not one solider had been killed or wounded in Iraq , the costs of the war in equipment , damage to recruitment efforts , readiness erosion , and morale would still take at least a decade to revoer from , likely longer .
As we well know many in the military are as concerned as we are .
The Thoughtful User Guide Oct 27 , 2006 iPod Etiquette
We have something important to discuss .
Are you listening ?
Oh , seriously , will you take out your earphones ?
Yes , both of them .
Welcome to the first installment of our Thoughtful User Guide .
In this series , Margaret Mason helps you tackle tech - etiquette dilemmas from gadget intrusion to social networking faux pas .
This week ’s article focuses how to use your mp3 player politely .
There was a time when iPod wearers gave one another pretentious nods of solidarity .
Once , users offered strangers a chance to “ jack in ” by handing over a single earbud for a few moments of music sampling .
Though it takes a special sort of person to miss the “ Want this ?
It was in my ear ” era , all of us have proven adept at finding new ways to annoy one another with mp3 players .
Here are some basic guidelines for enjoying your music without sacrificing your manners .
Consider earphones a social cue .
Wearing earphones is like hanging a “ do not disturb ” sign off your nose .
Like an engrossing novel , they help you avoid interactions with annoying strangers on airplanes or subways .
Unfortunately , they send the same go - away message at work .
That ’s useful if you wear them only when you ’re on deadline , but your iPod is more likely to irritate co-workers if you hide behind it eight hours a day .
Which brings us to the next point .
Take note of your surroundings .
It may be fine to use your iPod on the commute ( in a relatively anonymous public space ) , but it ’s more difficult to use it in the break room at work .
When you ’re likely to run into someone you know in a communal space , leave your iPod behind , or at least remove one earbud so you can hear someone greeting you ; then you can remove the other earbud .
If you do n’t feel like greeting people , consider addressing that with your therapist .
Respect no -Pod zones .
Mp3 players are unwelcome at weddings , funerals , and other gatherings , and also in classrooms or places of worship .
This holds true even if you ’re a sullen 13 - year - old with inattentive parents .
You should also avoid using mp3 players in restaurants ( because the waiter needs to interact with you ) , waiting rooms ( so you can hear the receptionist call your name ) , and group exercise classes ( so the instructor does n’t single you out for a mildly humiliating demonstration ) .
Be a professional .
If you work in the customer - service industry , iPods are out .
No one should have to feel like they ’re interrupting you to get service .
Of course , your boss may have already mentioned this .
i Pods also have no place in office meetings .
Even innocently setting your mp3 player on the table suggests that you ’d rather be doing something else .
This , though possibly true , will not help your cause during bonus time — and iPods are expensive , yo .
Remove your earbuds to interact .
Leaving your earphones on when someone is talking to you is like refusing to make eye contact .
It looks as though you are n’t listening .
Stop what you ’re doing , remove both earphones , and pay attention .
Removing only one earbud signals that you hope a conversation wo n’t last too long , or that a person is not important enough to warrant your full attention .
Therefore , reserve this gesture for amorous but unattractive strangers on the bus .
Keep the volume moderate .
No one else should be able to hear your music .
That constant buzz emanating from your headphones is only slightly less irritating than your tendency to hum “ Like a Virgin ” whenever Madonna comes on .
Speaking of which …
Do n’t get funky on us .
Yes , we know you like music .
We can see that it moves you .
This is because you ’re always moving — bopping your head , dancing , drumming , even singing along .
Please , stop it .
Otherwise , we ’re forced to feign interest in your childlike enthusiasm for a song we ca n’t even hear .
It ’s exhausting .
Establish your own musical tastes .
You ’re excited about your new iPod , but you have n’t bought a CD since James Taylor ’s Greatest Hits came out .
Asking if someone has a particular CD or song you can download is OK , but never assume that anyone will hand over their entire music collection .
Some people spend obsessive amounts of time assembling mood - appropriate playlists and unearthing obscure bands .
Asking these people for a carbon copy of their iPods is a close cousin to identity theft .
Instead , ask for a few recommendations or advice on where to look for music you might like .
Share the airspace .
Just because it ’s common for people to denigrate one another ’s musical tastes does n’t make it polite .
If you ’re sharing a speaker system , respect others ’ choices , and let everyone have a turn at the jack .
Yes , even the girl who played Maroon 5 for six hours the last time she got her turn .
Avoid downloading on shared networks .
There ’s a special circle of hell for people who use coffee shop networks to download music .
If you find yourself there , say hi to the folks who stream porn over their neighbors ’ open wi-fi .
That ’s it , you can put your earbuds back in now .
This is a good song .
IN SOME ways , Ram Bahadur Bomjan is a typical teenager : he loves his cricket , he sits with shoulders slumped , hair falling into his eyes , uninterested in the world .
In other ways , he is definitely not .
For the past nine months , the 15 - year - old has sat , meditating at the base of a peepal tree in Nepal 's Bara District , without food , water , sleep or the need to use the toilet .
If that was not remarkable enough , on January 19 , he spontaneously combusted , burning off the clothes he has worn for nine months but leaving no scars .
Lest there be doubters , his followers caught that combustion on video and plan to present the footage , seen by The Age , at a news conference in Kathmandu , soon .
The Buddha Boy , as he is known in Nepal , is a source of equal scepticism and reverence .
To the doubters , it is an elaborate scam , which has drawn thousands of pilgrims , domestic and international , to a dirt poor area of Nepal 's terrai region .

■ DEC/4 : ハードウェア ところで、さきほどの写真では机の右側のほうを わざと写さなかったんですが、 ここに何があるかと言うと…… こういうものがあります。 これ全部コンピュータです。 写真に映っていないものも含めて すべて合わせると 20 台くらいあります。 しかもこれ、普通のパソコンばっかりじゃありません。 中には Alpha とか SPARC とか POWER が混じってます。 具体的には、 5 つのアーキテクチ ャ x86 , AMD64 , Alpha , SPARC , POWER アーキテクチ ャ 5 つ 7 つの OS Linux , FreeBSD , NetBSD , Windows , Solaris , Tru64UNIX , AIX オペレーティングシステムが 7 つ。 組み合わせだと、 9 つのプラットフォー ム
Linux / x86 Linux / AMD64 Linux / Alpha FreeBSD / Alpha NetBSD / Alpha Tru64UNIX / Alpha Solaris / SPARC AIX / POWER Windows /x86 9 つのプラットフォームがあります。 ( 注釈： 実は、 Development Environment Conference なので、DEC つながりで AlphaStation 500 の実物を持ってくる予定だった。 しかし出発の 30 分前に挫折 ) 「 こんなに たくさんあって どうすんの？ 」 さて、マシンが 20 台くらいあるぜー、 と言うと、たいて い 「 こんなにたくさんあって何に使うんだ 」 と聞かれるんですけど、 主な役割は 愛でるため 愛でることです！ なでて、 紺匡体 萌え〜 紺匡体萌えー と叫ぶためにあるんです。 まあ、そんなわけで、 マシンたちは なでるためにあるんですが、 せっかくマシンがたくさんあるわけですから、 ついでに Ruby のテストも している ついでに Ruby のテストもしているわけです 。
■ DEC/4 : テーマ解説 ようやく今日のテーマにたどりつきました。 前提： マシン台数も プラットフォームも 多すぎる わたしの開発環境は アーキテクチャ も OS も多すぎます。 そのような状況だからこそ、 オレポータビリティ 今日のテーマである 「俺 - portability 」 の話になるのです。 この オレ ポータビリティ というのは、 俺 ( の ) portability ……の、ことです。 つまり、自分自身の portability のことです 。
「 ポータブルなプログラム」と言えば いろいろな環境において 動作するプログラムのことですね。
「 俺がポータブルである」というのは、 いろいろな環境でも同じように開発できる、
ということです。 どんな環境でも 同じように開発できる → オレポータビリティが高い！ 今日はオレポータビリティを高める 戦略について話そうと思います 。
■ DEC/5 : 戦略 ( 1 ) 必須ソフトウェアを限界まで削る オレポータビリティを高める戦略、その
1 は、 どうしてもこれでなきゃだめ、 ないと死んじゃう、 というソフトウェアを減らすことです。 なぜかと言えば、 どこでも使える ソフトウェアが そもそも少ない プラットフォームの種類が多い場合、 どこでも動くソフトウェアは限られます。 例えば IDE なんて絶望的です。 たくさんソフトウェアを 使うとインストールがめんどくさい しかも、たくさんインストールしないといけないと インストールだけでバカみたいに手間がかかります。 パッケージシステムがどこにでもあるわけでは ないですから。 実例を見てみます。 例えばこれはメインマシンのデスクトップです。 old type な人にありがちな、 味も素気もないデスクトップですね。 端末を 2 枚ひらいて、 右の端末でコード書いて、 左の端末でコマンドを打ちます。 このキャプチャに映ってる端末は rxvt なんですが、 別に rxvt でなければまずいわけではありません。 ちゃんと使えれば何でも使います。 ウィンドウマネージャは sawfish ですが、 これもやっぱりこだわってません。 単に Debian デフォルトだったから使ってるだけです。 だいたい何を使ってもそのうち慣れます。 画面は Linux ですが、別 に
Windows でもいいんです。 実際、このノートパソコンに は Windows XP が入ってます 。 Linux についても、 GNOME や KDE を使おうが使うまいがどっちでもいいんです。 どっちを使ってようと慣れれば大丈夫です。 で、端末やウィンドウマネージャは何でもいいとして、 必ずこれを使う、というものもあるわけです。 必ず使うのはこういうプログラムです。 必ず使うソフトウェア * Ruby * C コンパイラなど * zsh * CVS or Subversion * vi * 独自の開発ツール 順番に詳しく見ていきます。 使うプラグラ ム ( 1 ) Ruby 開発版 + 安定版ぜんぶ まず当然 Ruby 。 Ruby プログラムを書くの に
Ruby がないと話になりません。 わたしは Ruby は開発版の最新を使うことに しているので 、OS をインストールしたら まず CVS trunk HEAD を自分でコンパイルします。 さらに、安定版をねこそぎ入れます。 いまは 1.8 系列が安定版なので、 1.8.0 から 1.8.5 まで全部入れるわけです。 これは動作の検証用です。 ただ、たくさんあると各バージョンで 比較するのも面倒なので、 forall - rubyコマンド 横断テストの自動化 forall - ruby コマンドという自作コマンドを使います。 このコマンドは、システムにあるすべての ruby に 対して同じオプションをつけて実行するコマンドです。 例えば次のコマンドを実行すると、 ~ % forall - ruby -e 'p Object.superclass ' aamine@core ruby 1.8.2 ( 2004-12-25 ) [ i386- cygwin ] nil ruby 1.8.3 ( 2005-09 - 21 ) [ i386- cygwin ] nil ruby 1.8.4 ( 2005 -12-24 ) [ i386- cygwin ] nil ruby 1.8.5 ( 2006-08 - 25 ) [ i386- cygwin ] nil ruby 1.9.0 ( 2006-08 -23 ) [ i386- cygwin ]
BasicObject ああ Ruby 1.9 では Object の上に BasicObject てのが 追加されたんだなあとわかります。 使うも の ( 2 ) C コンパイラなど gcc , bison , flex , autoconf , make , ... 次に C コンパイラとか autoconf。 こいつら は Ruby をコンパイルするのに 必要なので否応なく入れます。 使うもの ( 3 ) zsh それから zsh です。実は zsh は インストールするのが結構大変なんですが、 もう bash では生きていけない身体に なってしまったので やむなく使います。 使うもの ( 4 ) vi それから vi。 UNIX 系の OS ならフツー入ってるので楽です 。
Windows でも Cygwin を入れればついてきますし。 また、これは vim とかではなく vi であるところも重要です。 わたしはシンタックスハイライティングだとか オートコンプリートだのは 一切使わないことにしているので、 素の vi で大丈夫です。 ちなみに、素の vi はマルチバッファではないので 複数ファイルが編集できません。 そこで、複数ファイルをいじるときは シェルのジョブ制御機能を使います。 複数ファイルを編集するときは シェルのジョブ制御を使 う
Ctrl -z でサスペンド、 fg コマンドで復帰 もはやジョブ制御なんて知らない人もいそうですが、 こういう機能もあるんです。 使うもの ( 5 ) バージョン管理システム ( CVS か Subversion ) それからバージョン管理システム。 種類はなんでもいいんですが、 わたしは CVS をメインに使ってます。 ※ 追記： id : naoya さんの発表によれば CVS を使っていいのは小学生までらしい。 使うもの ( 6 ) 独自の開発ツール * ReFe * rdefs その他、いくつか自作のツールがあります。
Ruby に特化していますが、 アイデア自体は他の言語でも変わらないでしょう。 具体的に見ますと、 ReFe Rubyのリファレンスマニュアルを 検索するツール まず ReFe というツールです。 これは Ruby のリファレンスマニュアルを検索するツールです。 例えば String クラスの each_with_index メソッドを調べたい！ というときには ~ % refe string each_with_index aamine@core String < Enumerable#each_with_index --- each_with_index {|item , index| ... } 要素とインデックスを両方与えるイテレータ。 self を返します。 と指定すればいいわけです。 ちなみに、この場合は each_with_index メソッド は
Enumerable モジュールから継承したメソッドなんですが、 そういうメソッドもちゃんと検索できます。 rdefsコマンド 定義されてるクラスとメソッドをリスト それから rdefs コマンド。 これは、ファイルに定義されてる クラスとかメソッドをリストするコマンドです。 例えばこの locale.rb というファイルに どんなメソッドが定義されてるかなーと思ったら、 ~ % rdefs locale.rb module BitChannel class Locale def Locale.declare_locale( key , loc ) def Locale.get ( key ) def Locale.key ?( key ) def Locale.keys def initialize def rc_table private : rc_table def [ ] ( key ) alias text [ ] def [ ] =( key , str ) def inspect と、いうふうに調べればいいわけです。 独自ツールのポイント * Ruby だけを使って書く * インストーラを付ける まずツールはポータビリティを考えて すべて pure Ruby で書きます。 例えば、なぜかツール を Python で書いちゃったりしたら また Python 入れなきゃいけませんから、 とうぜんここ は
Ruby を使うわけです。 それからインストーラを付けること。 マシンが 20 台あるってことは 、 OS のインストールも最低 20 回やるわけです。 それだけあると、ツールにもインストーラが ついていたほうが楽です 。
■ DEC/6 : 戦略 ( 2 ) カスタマイズしない オレポータビリティを高める戦略の 2 つめは、 ソフトウェアをカスタマイズしないことです。 なにしろマシンが 20 台からあるので、 いちいち カスタマイズ してられるか！ いちいちカスタマイズするのも面倒です。 じゃあ設定を共有するか、とか言い出すと、 今度はそっちのインフラ整備が面倒です。 ということで、ソフトウェアを細かく カスタマイズするのをあきらめます。 これも、本当にまったく カスタマイズしないわけではなくて 、
「 できるだけ」カスタマイズしないということです。
さすがにわたしも zsh はちょっといじりたいですし。 これを逆に言うと、 カスタマイズしなくても 使う気になるソフトだけ使う！ カスタマイズしなくても使う気になる ソフトウェアだけ使うということです 。
「 〜〜をインストールして設定すれば使える 」 なんてのは使えないのと同じだと思いましょう。 英語で言うと、
No configuration is good configuration .
No configuration is good configuration です。 設定しないで使えるのが一番いいってことですね。 さらに日本語で言い直すなら、 ノウハウを作らないのがノウハウ ノウハウを作らないのがノウハウです 。
■ DEC/7 : 戦略 ( 3 ) ホームディレクトリ構造の共通化 オレポータビリティを高める戦略の 3 つめは、 すべてのマシンでホームディレクトリの構造を統一することです。 これはまあ、あたりまえと言えばあたりまえでしょう。 各種設定を減らすためにも 共通化が重要 ホームディレクトリの構造が同じなら、 その構造を前提にしてツールが書けます。 そうすると設定が減って楽になると。 また英語で言うと、 Convention over configuration .
Convention over configuration 、ということです。 日本語で言うなら 「 慣習じゅーよー 」 。 具体的にどういう構造にするかはいろいろあると思いますが、 わたしは UNIX の / usr 以下と同じ構造にしています。 UNIX の / usr 以下を真似 bin , etc , lib , share , src , var ちなみに、src はもちろんソースコードですが、 ここには自分が作ったもの以外をまとめます。 で、 自分で作ったものは ~ / c に置く 自分で作ったものは すべて ~ / c に置きます。 ソースコードもツールも、すべてです 。
■ DEC/8 : 戦略 ( 4 ) バージョン管理 オレポータビリティを高める戦略その 4 は、 徹底的にバージョン管理システムを使うことです。 共有するため バージョン管理システムを使う目的は、 この場合、マシン間でファイルを共有することです。 ~/ c 以下は例外なく バージョン管理システムに入れる ~/c 以下、つまり自分で作ったものは すべてバージョン管理システムで管理します。
具体的には、 ソースコード プログラムのソースコードやドキュメント。 開発ツール さっき言ったような、独自の開発ツール。 大学のレポート それに大学のレポートもですね。 とにかく自分が作ったものはすべてここに入れて、 バージョン管理システムで管理します。 ちなみに C は working Copy の C から取りました 。
The MIT Media Laboratory expects to launch a prototype of its US $ 100 laptop in November , according to Nicholas Negroponte , the lab ’s chairman and co-founder .
The facility has been working with industry partners to develop a notebook computer for use by children in primary and secondary education around the world , particularly in developing countries .
The laptops should start appearing in volume in late 2006 .
“ In emerging nations , the issue is n’t connectivity , ” Negroponte said at the Emerging Technologies Conference on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ’s Cambridge campus Wednesday .
“ That ’s not solved , but lots of people are working on it in Wi-Fi , 3G , 4G , etc .
For education , the roadblock is laptops . ”
He and his colleagues believe that equipping all children in the world with their own laptop will greatly improve the level of education and help stimulate children to learn outside of school as well as in the classroom .
The lab expects to unveil a prototype of the $ 100 laptop at the World Summit on the Information Society ( WSIS ) on Nov. 17 , according to Negroponte .
The WSIS is due to be held in Tunis , Tunisia , from Nov. 16 to Nov. 18 .
He showed slides of the prototype at the MIT event .
The 500MHz laptop will run a “ skinny version ” of the open - source Linux operating system .
It will have a two - mode screen , so it can be viewed in color and then by pushing a button or activating software switch to a black - and - white display , which can be viewed in bright sunlight at four times normal resolution , according to Negroponte .
He estimates the display will cost around $ 35 .
The laptop can be powered either with an AC adapter or via a wind - up crank , which is stored in the housing of the laptop where the hinge is located .
The laptops will have a 10 to 1 crank rate , so that a child will crank the handle for one minute to get 10 minutes of power and use .
When closed , the hinge forms a handle and the AC cord can function as a carrying strap , according to Negroponte .
The laptops will be ruggedized and probably made of rubber , he said .
They will have four USB ( Universal Serial Bus ) ports , be Wi-Fi - and cell phone enabled and come with 1GB of memory .
Each laptop will act as a node in a mesh peer - to - peer ad hoc network , Negroponte said , meaning that if one laptop is directly accessing the Internet , when other machines power on , they can share that single online connection .
The lab will initially target Brazil , China , Egypt , South Africa and Thailand , according to Negroponte , as well as the U.S. state of Massachusetts , which has just committed to equipping every schoolchild with a laptop .
Negroponte hopes to start mass production of some 5 million to 15 million laptops for those markets towards the end of 2006 .
Come December 2007 , he estimated production of the laptops at between 100 million and 150 million , three times the number of annual shipments of commercial laptops .
Negroponte launched a nonprofit spin - off from the lab to spearhead the development of the notebook at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , in January .
The nonprofit is called One Laptop Per Child , or OLPC .
The lab and OLPC are working with a number of key partners including Advanced Micro Devices Inc. , Google Inc. , News Corp. and Red Hat Inc. on developing the laptop , according to Negroponte .
“ I ’ve told the governments that our price will float and go down over time , ” Negroponte said .
“ $ 100 is still too expensive . ”
Each government will need to pay for one million laptops in advance to ensure the lab and its partners can achieve the necessary scale to persuade companies to mass produce the machines , he added .
He did n’t provide any further details on how exactly the vast number of machines will be produced and shipped to their final destinations .
The laptop can be used in a variety of ways as a computer , an electronic book , a television and a writing or drawing tablet , according to Negroponte .
One issue the lab is particularly sensitive to is the grey market for computers , Negroponte said .
“ It ’s a big deal for us whether laptops vanish in customs or are stolen , ” he said .
“ We want to have a machine that ’s so distinctive it ’d be like stealing a post office truck . ”
The lab is even thinking of having each child ’s name engraved on each laptop as an additional theft deterrent , he added .
Another obstacle is the online access schoolchildren in repressive regimes will gain .
“ I do tell governments we ’re selling you a Trojan horse , ” Negroponte said , adding it ’s really up to the children as to what they access from the Internet .
The huge issue he sees with the technology is how education curricula around the globe will change in response to the introduction of the laptops and Web access .
“ It ’s something that will take decades to sort out properly , ” he said .
As to children accessing pornography , the lab is working on how best to block harmful online content , he said .
However , Negroponte asks people not to blame the medium .
“ Pornography uses the printed page , but [ Johannes ]
Gutenberg [ the inventor of the printing press ] is n’t getting much flak , ” he quipped .
MIT Media Lab has been involved in a number of initiatives to provide schoolchildren with laptops in the past , in Senegal and in Costa Rica and Negroponte has his own projects in Cambodia , but this is the first global push for the lab with a mobile computer developed from scratch .

Handwritten Real - World Cryptogram
I get e-mail , occasionally weird e-mail .
Every once in a while I get an e-mail like this :
I know this is going to sound like a plot from a movie .
It is n’t .
A very good friend of mine Linda Rayburn and her son Michael Berry were brutally murdered by her husband … the son ’s stepfather .
They were murdered on February 3rd , 2004 .
He then hung himself in the basement of their house .
He left behind a number of disturbing items .
However , the most intriguing is a cryptogram handwritten on paper utilizing letters , numbers and symbols from a computer keyboard .
Linda ’s daughter Jenn was the one who found the bodies .
Jenn is a very good friend of mine and I told her I would do everything within my power to see if this cryptogram is truly a cryptogram with valuable information or if it is a wild goose chase to keep us occupied and wondering forever what it means .
I have no idea if any of this is true , but here ’s a news blip from 2004 :
Feb .
2 : Linda Rayburn , 44 , and Michael Berry , 23 , of Saugus , both killed at home .
According to police , Rayburn ’s husband , David Rayburn , killed his wife and stepson with a hammer .
Their bodies were found in adjacent bedrooms .
David Rayburn left a suicide note , went to the basement , and hanged himself .
And here is the cryptogram :
The rectangle drawn over the top two lines was not done by the murderer .
It was done by a family member afterwards .
Assuming this is all real , it ’s a real - world puzzle with no solution .
No one knows what the message is , or even if there is a message .
If anyone figures it out , please let me know .

I 've witnessed for years former ESPN commentator like Chris Myers call home runs to right field " a Rush Limbaugh shot , right and fair . "
I 've seen in studio college football analysts gush over Ann Coulter .
I 've listened to ESPN constantly hype individuals who are well known figures in the Religious Right .
I 've heard a basketball commentator call Jerry Falwell a good man during a basketball game .
I have no problem with these political views being uttered during a political broadcast .
I do have a problem with hearing it during a sports show from the host .
( They did hire Rush Limbaugh for goodness sakes ! )
When John Kerry was shown on screen at a Red Sox game in 2004 , ESPN played a tape of boos .
It was NOT the crowd reaction .
I knew the tape was fake by that quick click that transitions from live to pre-recorded .
ESPN has done this stunt of playing fake cheers and fake boos time and time again .
Last night , during Monday Night Football , ESPN did it again .
I heard that same click .
It started with right winger Mike Tirico announcing George Bush Sr. to the crowd .
Instantaneously you could hear an echo of cheers and not a single boo from the audio .
But if you listen carefully to the audio , that audio was not live .
ESPN shut off the sound of the Superdome crowd for a few seconds and played this audio of fake cheers .
About ten seconds later ESPN had to shut their fake tape off and go to the NFL official on the field for the coin toss .
That 's when you could hear the REAL crowd noise .
The audio on the field was a couple of hundred feet away so ESPN was probably thinking that crowd noise could not be picked up .
ESPN was wrong .
.
As George Bush Sr. was flipping the coin , you could hear a chorus of boos so loud that ESPN had its proverbial hand caught in the cookie jar .
And remember , this was ten seconds after the announcements so imagine what the initial boos sounded like .
New Orleans residents know better than anyone else how Bush 43 responded to Katrina and they know better than anyone else about Barbara Bush 's comments about poor people and how sleeping in the Astrodome was " working out quite well for them . "
ESPN needs to be called on the carpet for these shenanigans .
Googles Erfolg als Suchmaschinenbetreiber hat den Firmennamen in den vergangenen acht Jahren so populär werden lassen , dass er im allgemeinen Sprachgebrauch längst als Synonym für " Suchen im Internet " verwendet wird .
So findet sich das Verb googeln ( für die Nutzung von Google zur Internet - Suche ) mittlerweile auch im Duden ebenso wie in englischsprachigen Wörterbüchern – etwa dem Oxford English Dictionary oder dem amerikanischen Merriam - Webster 's Collegiate Dictionary .
Den Google - Offiziellen ist dies jedoch ein Dorn im Auge , denn anders als der Firmenname lässt sich ein Verb " googeln " nicht markenrechtlich schützen .
Wie die [ i]
Washington Post [ /i ] und die britische Tageszeitung Independent berichten , haben die Anwälte des Suchmaschinenbetreibers daher zahlreiche Medien schriftlich zur " korrekten " Verwendung des Begriffs aufgefordert , damit Google nicht etwa in Gefahr gerät , die Rechte an der Marke " Google " zu verlieren .
Die passenden Beispiele , wie der Ausdruck richtig zu verwenden sei , liefern die Juristen auch gleich mit .
Zulässig sei : " Er sucht bei Google nach seinem Namen , um in den Resultaten zu prüfen , ob er gelistet wird " .
Unterbinden möchte Google hingegen Formulierungen wie : " Er googelt sich selbst " .
Google drängt nun auch darauf , den Begriff nur in Verbindung mit einer Suche mittels der eigenen Maschine zu verwenden , und nicht allgemein für die Suche im Internet .
Bei der Duden - Redaktion konnte der Konzern seinen Einfluss offensichtlich geltend machen .
In der aktuellen 24 .
Auflage wird das Verb googeln explizit als " mit Google im Internet suchen " erläutert .
In der vorangehenden Auflage war die Beschreibung noch deutlich allgemeiner als " Suchen im Internet " gehalten – lediglich mit einem Verweis auf Google . ( map )

PEP 249 -- Python Database API Specification v2.0
PEP : 249 Title : Python Database API Specification v2.0 Author : mal at lemburg.com ( Marc - André Lemburg ) Discussions - To : db-sig at python.org Status : Final Type : Informational Created : Post - History : Replaces : 248
Introduction
This API has been defined to encourage similarity between the Python modules that are used to access databases .
By doing this , we hope to achieve a consistency leading to more easily understood modules , code that is generally more portable across databases , and a broader reach of database connectivity from Python .
Comments and questions about this specification may be directed to the SIG for Database Interfacing with Python .
For more information on database interfacing with Python and available packages see the Database Topic Guide .
This document describes the Python Database API Specification 2.0 and a set of common optional extensions .
The previous version 1.0 version is still available as reference , in PEP 248 .
Package writers are encouraged to use this version of the specification as basis for new interfaces .
Module Interface Constructors
Access to the database is made available through connection objects .
The module must provide the following constructor for these : connect ( parameters ... )
Constructor for creating a connection to the database .
Returns a Connection Object .
It takes a number of parameters which are database dependent .
Globals
These module globals must be defined : apilevel String constant stating the supported DB API level .
Currently only the strings " 1.0 " and " 2.0 " are allowed .
If not given , a DB - API 1.0 level interface should be assumed .
threadsafety
Integer constant stating the level of thread safety the interface supports .
Possible values are : threadsafety Meaning 0
Threads may not share the module .
1
Threads may share the module , but not connections .
2
Threads may share the module and connections .
3
Threads may share the module , connections and cursors .
Sharing in the above context means that two threads may use a resource without wrapping it using a mutex semaphore to implement resource locking .
Note that you cannot always make external resources thread safe by managing access using a mutex : the resource may rely on global variables or other external sources that are beyond your control .
paramstyle String constant stating the type of parameter marker formatting expected by the interface .
Possible values are : paramstyle Meaning qmark Question mark style , e.g. ... WHERE name= ?
numeric Numeric , positional style , e.g. ... WHERE name= : 1 named Named style , e.g. ... WHERE name= : name format ANSI C printf format codes , e.g. ... WHERE name= %s pyformat Python extended format codes , e.g. ... WHERE name= % ( name ) s Exceptions
The module should make all error information available through these exceptions or subclasses thereof : Warning Exception raised for important warnings like data truncations while inserting , etc .
It must be a subclass of the Python StandardError ( defined in the module exceptions ) .
Error Exception that is the base class of all other error exceptions .
You can use this to catch all errors with one single except statement .
Warnings are not considered errors and thus should not use this class as base .
It must be a subclass of the Python StandardError ( defined in the module exceptions ) .
InterfaceError Exception raised for errors that are related to the database interface rather than the database itself .
It must be a subclass of Error.
DatabaseError Exception raised for errors that are related to the database .
It must be a subclass of Error .
DataError Exception raised for errors that are due to problems with the processed data like division by zero , numeric value out of range , etc .
It must be a subclass of DatabaseError .
OperationalError
Exception raised for errors that are related to the database 's operation and not necessarily under the control of the programmer , e.g. an unexpected disconnect occurs , the data source name is not found , a transaction could not be processed , a memory allocation error occurred during processing , etc .
It must be a subclass of DatabaseError .
IntegrityError Exception raised when the relational integrity of the database is affected , e.g. a foreign key check fails .
It must be a subclass of DatabaseError .
InternalError Exception raised when the database encounters an internal error , e.g. the cursor is not valid anymore , the transaction is out of sync , etc .
It must be a subclass of DatabaseError .
ProgrammingError
Exception raised for programming errors , e.g. table not found or already exists , syntax error in the SQL statement , wrong number of parameters specified , etc .
It must be a subclass of DatabaseError .
NotSupportedError
Exception raised in case a method or database API was used which is not supported by the database , e.g. requesting a .rollback ( ) on a connection that does not support transaction or has transactions turned off .
It must be a subclass of DatabaseError .
This is the exception inheritance layout : StandardError |__Warning |__Error |__InterfaceError |__DatabaseError |__DataError |__OperationalError |__IntegrityError |__InternalError |__ProgrammingError |__NotSupportedError
Note
The values of these exceptions are not defined .
They should give the user a fairly good idea of what went wrong , though .
Connection Objects Connection objects should respond to the following methods .
Connection methods .close ( )
Close the connection now ( rather than whenever .__del__ ( ) is called ) .
The connection will be unusable from this point forward ; an Error ( or subclass ) exception will be raised if any operation is attempted with the connection .
The same applies to all cursor objects trying to use the connection .
Note that closing a connection without committing the changes first will cause an implicit rollback to be performed .
. commit ( ) Commit any pending transaction to the database .
Note that if the database supports an auto - commit feature , this must be initially off .
An interface method may be provided to turn it back on .
Database modules that do not support transactions should implement this method with void functionality .
.rollback ( )
This method is optional since not all databases provide transaction support .
In case a database does provide transactions this method causes the database to roll back to the start of any pending transaction .
Closing a connection without committing the changes first will cause an implicit rollback to be performed .
. cursor ( ) Return a new Cursor Object using the connection .
If the database does not provide a direct cursor concept , the module will have to emulate cursors using other means to the extent needed by this specification .
Cursor Objects
These objects represent a database cursor , which is used to manage the context of a fetch operation .
Cursors created from the same connection are not isolated , i.e. , any changes done to the database by a cursor are immediately visible by the other cursors .
Cursors created from different connections can or can not be isolated , depending on how the transaction support is implemented ( see also the connection 's .rollback ( ) and .commit ( ) methods ) .
Cursor Objects should respond to the following methods and attributes .
Cursor attributes .
description
This read - only attribute is a sequence of 7 - item sequences .
Each of these sequences contains information describing one result column : name
type_code
display_size
internal_size
precision
scale
null_ok
The first two items ( name and type_code ) are mandatory , the other five are optional and are set to None if no meaningful values can be provided .
This attribute will be None for operations that do not return rows or if the cursor has not had an operation invoked via the .execute * ( ) method yet .
The type_code can be interpreted by comparing it to the Type Objects specified in the section below .
.rowcount
This read - only attribute specifies the number of rows that the last . execute * ( ) produced ( for DQL statements like SELECT ) or affected ( for DML statements like UPDATE or INSERT ) .
The attribute is - 1 in case no .execute *( ) has been performed on the cursor or the rowcount of the last operation is cannot be determined by the interface .
Note Future versions of the DB API specification could redefine the latter case to have the object return None instead of - 1 .
Cursor methods .callproc ( procname [ , parameters ] )
( This method is optional since not all databases provide stored procedures . )
Call a stored database procedure with the given name .
The sequence of parameters must contain one entry for each argument that the procedure expects .
The result of the call is returned as modified copy of the input sequence .
Input parameters are left untouched , output and input / output parameters replaced with possibly new values .
The procedure may also provide a result set as output .
This must then be made available through the standard . fetch * ( ) methods .
. close ( )
Close the cursor now ( rather than whenever __del__ is called ) .
The cursor will be unusable from this point forward ; an Error ( or subclass ) exception will be raised if any operation is attempted with the cursor .
. execute ( operation [ , parameters ] )
Prepare and execute a database operation ( query or command ) .
Parameters may be provided as sequence or mapping and will be bound to variables in the operation .
Variables are specified in a database - specific notation ( see the module 's paramstyle attribute for details ) .
A reference to the operation will be retained by the cursor .
If the same operation object is passed in again , then the cursor can optimize its behavior .
This is most effective for algorithms where the same operation is used , but different parameters are bound to it ( many times ) .
For maximum efficiency when reusing an operation , it is best to use the .setinputsizes ( ) method to specify the parameter types and sizes ahead of time .
It is legal for a parameter to not match the predefined information ; the implementation should compensate , possibly with a loss of efficiency .
The parameters may also be specified as list of tuples to e.g. insert multiple rows in a single operation , but this kind of usage is deprecated : . executemany ( ) should be used instead .
Return values are not defined .
. executemany ( operation , seq_of_parameters )
Prepare a database operation ( query or command ) and then execute it against all parameter sequences or mappings found in the sequence seq_of_parameters .
Modules are free to implement this method using multiple calls to the .execute ( ) method or by using array operations to have the database process the sequence as a whole in one call .
Use of this method for an operation which produces one or more result sets constitutes undefined behavior , and the implementation is permitted ( but not required ) to raise an exception when it detects that a result set has been created by an invocation of the operation .
The same comments as for .execute ( ) also apply accordingly to this method .
Return values are not defined .
. fetchone ( )
Fetch the next row of a query result set , returning a single sequence , or None when no more data is available .
An Error ( or subclass ) exception is raised if the previous call to .execute *( ) did not produce any result set or no call was issued yet .
. fetchmany ([size=cursor.arraysize ] )
Fetch the next set of rows of a query result , returning a sequence of sequences ( e.g. a list of tuples ) .
An empty sequence is returned when no more rows are available .
The number of rows to fetch per call is specified by the parameter .
If it is not given , the cursor 's arraysize determines the number of rows to be fetched .
The method should try to fetch as many rows as indicated by the size parameter .
If this is not possible due to the specified number of rows not being available , fewer rows may be returned .
An Error ( or subclass ) exception is raised if the previous call to .execute *( ) did not produce any result set or no call was issued yet .
Note there are performance considerations involved with the size parameter .
For optimal performance , it is usually best to use the .arraysize attribute .
If the size parameter is used , then it is best for it to retain the same value from one . fetchmany ( ) call to the next .
. fetchall ( )
Fetch all ( remaining ) rows of a query result , returning them as a sequence of sequences ( e.g. a list of tuples ) .
Note that the cursor 's arraysize attribute can affect the performance of this operation .
An Error ( or subclass ) exception is raised if the previous call to .execute *( ) did not produce any result set or no call was issued yet .
. nextset ( ) ( This method is optional since not all databases support multiple result sets . )
This method will make the cursor skip to the next available set , discarding any remaining rows from the current set .
If there are no more sets , the method returns None .
Otherwise , it returns a true value and subsequent calls to the . fetch *( ) methods will return rows from the next result set .
An Error ( or subclass ) exception is raised if the previous call to .execute *( ) did not produce any result set or no call was issued yet .
. arraysize
This read / write attribute specifies the number of rows to fetch at a time with . fetchmany ( ) .
It defaults to 1 meaning to fetch a single row at a time .
Implementations must observe this value with respect to the . fetchmany ( ) method , but are free to interact with the database a single row at a time .
It may also be used in the implementation of . executemany ( ) .
. setinputsizes ( sizes )
This can be used before a call to .execute *( ) to predefine memory areas for the operation 's parameters .
sizes is specified as a sequence — one item for each input parameter .
The item should be a Type Object that corresponds to the input that will be used , or it should be an integer specifying the maximum length of a string parameter .
If the item is None , then no predefined memory area will be reserved for that column ( this is useful to avoid predefined areas for large inputs ) .
This method would be used before the .execute *( ) method is invoked .
Implementations are free to have this method do nothing and users are free to not use it .
. setoutputsize ( size [ , column ] )
Set a column buffer size for fetches of large columns ( e.g. LONG s , BLOB s , etc. ) .
The column is specified as an index into the result sequence .
Not specifying the column will set the default size for all large columns in the cursor .
This method would be used before the .execute *( ) method is invoked .
Implementations are free to have this method do nothing and users are free to not use it .
Type Objects and Constructors Many databases need to have the input in a particular format for binding to an operation 's input parameters .
For example , if an input is destined for a DATE column , then it must be bound to the database in a particular string format .
Similar problems exist for " Row ID " columns or large binary items ( e.g. blobs or RAW columns ) .
This presents problems for Python since the parameters to the .execute *( ) method are untyped .
When the database module sees a Python string object , it does n't know if it should be bound as a simple CHAR column , as a raw BINARY item , or as a DATE .
To overcome this problem , a module must provide the constructors defined below to create objects that can hold special values .
When passed to the cursor methods , the module can then detect the proper type of the input parameter and bind it accordingly .
A Cursor Object 's description attribute returns information about each of the result columns of a query .
The type_code must compare equal to one of Type Objects defined below .
Type Objects may be equal to more than one type code ( e.g. DATETIME could be equal to the type codes for date , time and timestamp columns ; see the Implementation Hints below for details ) .
The module exports the following constructors and singletons : Time ( hour , minute , second )
This function constructs an object holding a time value .
TimeFromTicks ( ticks )
This function constructs an object holding a time value from the given ticks value ( number of seconds since the epoch ; see the documentation of the standard Python time module for details ) .
Binary ( string )
This function constructs an object capable of holding a binary ( long ) string value .
STRING type
This type object is used to describe columns in a database that are string - based ( e.g. CHAR ) .
BINARY type
This type object is used to describe ( long ) binary columns in a database ( e.g. LONG , RAW , BLOB s ) .
NUMBER type
This type object is used to describe numeric columns in a database .
ROWID type
This type object is used to describe the " Row ID " column in a database .
SQL NULL values are represented by the Python None singleton on input and output .
Note Usage of Unix ticks for database interfacing can cause troubles because of the limited date range they cover .
Implementation Hints for Module Authors Date / time objects can be implemented as Python datetime module objects ( available since Python 2.3 , with a C API since 2.4 ) or using the mxDateTime package ( available for all Python versions since 1.5.2 ) .
They both provide all necessary constructors and methods at Python and C level .
Here is a sample implementation of the Unix ticks based constructors for date / time delegating work to the generic constructors : import time def DateFromTicks ( ticks ) : return Date(*time.localtime ( ticks ) [ :3 ] ) def TimeFromTicks ( ticks ) : return Time(*time.localtime ( ticks ) [ 3:6 ] ) def TimestampFromTicks ( ticks ) : return Timestamp(*time.localtime ( ticks ) [ : 6 ] )
The preferred object type for Binary objects are the buffer types available in standard Python starting with version 1.5.2 .
Please see the Python documentation for details .
For information about the C interface have a look at Include / bufferobject.h and Objects / bufferobject.c in the Python source distribution .
This Python class allows implementing the above type objects even though the description type code field yields multiple values for on type object : class DBAPITypeObject : def __init__ ( self , * values ) : self.values = values def __cmp__( self , other ) : if other in self .
values : return 0 if other < self.values : return 1 else : return - 1
The resulting type object compares equal to all values passed to the constructor .
Here is a snippet of Python code that implements the exception hierarchy defined above : import exceptions class Error( exceptions . StandardError ) : pass class Warning ( exceptions.StandardError ) : pass class InterfaceError( Error ) : pass class DatabaseError( Error ) : pass class InternalError( DatabaseError ) : pass class OperationalError( DatabaseError ) : pass class ProgrammingError( DatabaseError ) : pass class IntegrityError( DatabaseError ) : pass class DataError( DatabaseError ) : pass class NotSupportedError( DatabaseError ) : pass
In C you can use the PyErr_NewException ( fullname , base , NULL ) API to create the exception objects .
Optional DB API Extensions During the lifetime of DB API 2.0 , module authors have often extended their implementations beyond what is required by this DB API specification .
To enhance compatibility and to provide a clean upgrade path to possible future versions of the specification , this section defines a set of common extensions to the core DB API 2.0 specification .
As with all DB API optional features , the database module authors are free to not implement these additional attributes and methods ( using them will then result in an AttributeError ) or to raise a NotSupported Error in case the availability can only be checked at run-time .
It has been proposed to make usage of these extensions optionally visible to the programmer by issuing Python warnings through the Python warning framework .
To make this feature useful , the warning messages must be standardized in order to be able to mask them .
These standard messages are referred to below as Warning Message .
Cursor.rownumber
This read - only attribute should provide the current 0 - based index of the cursor in the result set or None if the index cannot be determined .
The index can be seen as index of the cursor in a sequence ( the result set ) .
The next fetch operation will fetch the row indexed by .rownumber in that sequence .
Warning Message : " DB - API extension cursor.rownumber used " Connection .
Error , Connection .
ProgrammingError , etc .
All exception classes defined by the DB API standard should be exposed on the Connection objects as attributes ( in addition to being available at module scope ) .
These attributes simplify error handling in multi-connection environments .
Warning Message : " DB - API extension connection .< exception > used " Cursor.connection
This read - only attribute return a reference to the Connection object on which the cursor was created .
The attribute simplifies writing polymorph code in multi-connection environments .
Warning Message : " DB - API extension cursor.connection used " Cursor.scroll( value [ , mode= ' relative ' ])
Scroll the cursor in the result set to a new position according to mode .
If mode is relative ( default ) , value is taken as offset to the current position in the result set , if set to absolute , value states an absolute target position .
An IndexError should be raised in case a scroll operation would leave the result set .
In this case , the cursor position is left undefined ( ideal would be to not move the cursor at all ) .
Note
This method should use native scrollable cursors , if available , or revert to an emulation for forward - only scrollable cursors .
The method may raise NotSupported Error to signal that a specific operation is not supported by the database ( e.g. backward scrolling ) .
Warning Message : " DB - API extension cursor.scroll( ) used " Cursor.messages
This is a Python list object to which the interface appends tuples ( exception class , exception value ) for all messages which the interfaces receives from the underlying database for this cursor .
The list is cleared by all standard cursor methods calls ( prior to executing the call ) except for the . fetch * ( ) calls automatically to avoid excessive memory usage and can also be cleared by executing del cursor.
messages [ :] .
All error and warning messages generated by the database are placed into this list , so checking the list allows the user to verify correct operation of the method calls .
The aim of this attribute is to eliminate the need for a Warning exception which often causes problems ( some warnings really only have informational character ) .
Warning Message : " DB - API extension cursor.messages used " Connection .
messages
Same as Cursor.messages except that the messages in the list are connection oriented .
The list is cleared automatically by all standard connection methods calls ( prior to executing the call ) to avoid excessive memory usage and can also be cleared by executing del connection .
messages [ :] .
Warning Message : " DB - API extension connection.messages used " Cursor.next ( )
Return the next row from the currently executing SQL statement using the same semantics as . fetchone ( ) .
A StopIteration exception is raised when the result set is exhausted for Python versions 2.2 and later .
Previous versions do n't have the StopIteration exception and so the method should raise an IndexError instead .
Warning Message : " DB - API extension cursor.next ( ) used " Cursor.__iter__ ()
Return self to make cursors compatible to the iteration protocol .
Warning Message : " DB - API extension cursor.__iter__( ) used " Cursor.lastrowid
This read - only attribute provides the rowid of the last modified row ( most databases return a rowid only when a single INSERT operation is performed ) .
If the operation does not set a rowid or if the database does not support rowids , this attribute should be set to None .
The semantics of . lastrowid are undefined in case the last executed statement modified more than one row , e.g. when using INSERT with .executemany ( ) .
Warning Message : " DB - API extension cursor.lastrowid used "
Optional Error Handling Extensions
The core DB API specification only introduces a set of exceptions which can be raised to report errors to the user .
In some cases , exceptions may be too disruptive for the flow of a program or even render execution impossible .
For these cases and in order to simplify error handling when dealing with databases , database module authors may choose to implement user definable error handlers .
This section describes a standard way of defining these error handlers .
Connection.errorhandler , Cursor.errorhandler
Read / write attribute which references an error handler to call in case an error condition is met .
The handler must be a Python callable taking the following arguments : errorhandler ( connection , cursor , errorclass , errorvalue ) where connection is a reference to the connection on which the cursor operates , cursor a reference to the cursor ( or None in case the error does not apply to a cursor ) , errorclass is an error class which to instantiate using errorvalue as construction argument .
The standard error handler should add the error information to the appropriate . messages attribute ( Connection.messages or Cursor.messages ) and raise the exception defined by the given errorclass and errorvalue parameters .
If no .errorhandler is set ( the attribute is None ) , the standard error handling scheme as outlined above , should be applied .
Warning Message : " DB - API extension .errorhandler used " Cursors should inherit the .errorhandler setting from their connection objects at cursor creation time .
Optional Two - Phase Commit Extensions
Many databases have support for two - phase commit ( TPC ) which allows managing transactions across multiple database connections and other resources .
If a database backend provides support for two - phase commit and the database module author wishes to expose this support , the following API should be implemented .
NotSupported Error should be raised , if the database backend support for two - phase commit can only be checked at run-time .
TPC Transaction IDs
As many databases follow the XA specification , transaction IDs are formed from three components : a format ID
a global transaction ID
a branch qualifier
For a particular global transaction , the first two components should be the same for all resources .
Each resource in the global transaction should be assigned a different branch qualifier .
The various components must satisfy the following criteria : format ID : a non-negative 32 - bit integer .
global transaction ID and branch qualifier : byte strings no longer than 64 characters .
Transaction IDs are created with the .xid( ) Connection method : .xid( format_id , global_transaction_id , branch_qualifier )
Returns a transaction ID object suitable for passing to the .tpc_ * ( ) methods of this connection .
If the database connection does not support TPC , a NotSupported Error is raised .
The type of the object returned by .xid( ) is not defined , but it must provide sequence behaviour , allowing access to the three components .
A conforming database module could choose to represent transaction IDs with tuples rather than a custom object .
TPC Connection Methods .tpc_begin(xid )
Begins a TPC transaction with the given transaction ID xid .
This method should be called outside of a transaction ( i.e. nothing may have executed since the last .commit ( ) or .rollback ( ) ) .
Furthermore , it is an error to call .commit ( ) or .rollback ( ) within the TPC transaction .
A ProgrammingError is raised , if the application calls .commit ( ) or .rollback ( ) during an active TPC transaction .
If the database connection does not support TPC , a NotSupported Error is raised .
.tpc_prepare ( )
Performs the first phase of a transaction started with .tpc_begin( ) .
A ProgrammingError should be raised if this method outside of a TPC transaction .
After calling .tpc_prepare( ) , no statements can be executed until .tpc_commit( ) or .tpc_rollback ( ) have been called .
.tpc_commit ( [ xid ])
When called with no arguments , .tpc_commit( ) commits a TPC transaction previously prepared with .tpc_prepare ( ) .
If .tpc_commit( ) is called prior to .tpc_prepare ( ) , a single phase commit is performed .
A transaction manager may choose to do this if only a single resource is participating in the global transaction .
When called with a transaction ID xid , the database commits the given transaction .
If an invalid transaction ID is provided , a Programming Error will be raised .
This form should be called outside of a transaction , and is intended for use in recovery .
On return , the TPC transaction is ended .
.tpc_rollback ( [ xid ])
When called with no arguments , .tpc_rollback ( ) rolls back a TPC transaction .
It may be called before or after .tpc_prepare ( ) .
When called with a transaction ID xid , it rolls back the given transaction .
If an invalid transaction ID is provided , a Programming Error is raised .
This form should be called outside of a transaction , and is intended for use in recovery .
On return , the TPC transaction is ended .
.tpc_recover ( )
Returns a list of pending transaction IDs suitable for use with .tpc_commit( xid ) or .tpc_rollback ( xid ) .
If the database does not support transaction recovery , it may return an empty list or raise NotSupportedError .
Frequently Asked Questions
The database SIG often sees reoccurring questions about the DB API specification .
This section covers some of the issues people sometimes have with the specification .
Question : How can I construct a dictionary out of the tuples returned by . fetch * ( ) :
Answer :
There are several existing tools available which provide helpers for this task .
Most of them use the approach of using the column names defined in the cursor attribute . description as basis for the keys in the row dictionary .
Note that the reason for not extending the DB API specification to also support dictionary return values for the . fetch *( ) methods is that this approach has several drawbacks :
Some databases do n't support case - sensitive column names or auto - convert them to all lowercase or all uppercase characters .
Columns in the result set which are generated by the query ( e.g. using SQL functions ) do n't map to table column names and databases usually generate names for these columns in a very database specific way .
As a result , accessing the columns through dictionary keys varies between databases and makes writing portable code impossible .
Major Changes from Version 1.0 to Version 2.0 The Python Database API 2.0 introduces a few major changes compared to the 1.0 version .
Because some of these changes will cause existing DB API 1.0 based scripts to break , the major version number was adjusted to reflect this change .
These are the most important changes from 1.0 to 2.0 :
The need for a separate dbi module was dropped and the functionality merged into the module interface itself .
New constructors and Type Objects were added for date / time values , the RAW Type Object was renamed to BINARY .
The resulting set should cover all basic data types commonly found in modern SQL databases .
Type Object was renamed to .
The resulting set should cover all basic data types commonly found in modern SQL databases .
New constants ( apilevel , threadsafety , paramstyle ) and methods ( .executemany ( ) , .nextset ( ) ) were added to provide better database bindings .
The semantics of .callproc ( ) needed to call stored procedures are now clearly defined .
The definition of the .execute ( ) return value changed .
Previously , the return value was based on the SQL statement type ( which was hard to implement right ) — it is undefined now ; use the more flexible .rowcount attribute instead .
Modules are free to return the old style return values , but these are no longer mandated by the specification and should be considered database interface dependent .
Class based exceptions were incorporated into the specification .
Module implementors are free to extend the exception layout defined in this specification by subclassing the defined exception classes .
Post - publishing additions to the DB API 2.0 specification : Additional optional DB API extensions to the set of core functionality were specified .
Open Issues
Although the version 2.0 specification clarifies a lot of questions that were left open in the 1.0 version , there are still some remaining issues which should be addressed in future versions : Define a useful return value for .nextset ( ) for the case where a new result set is available .
Integrate the decimal module Decimal object for use as loss - less monetary and decimal interchange format .

A vulnerability in many hotel television infrared systems can allow a hacker to obtain guests ' names and their room numbers from the billing system .
It can also let someone read the e-mail of guests who use web mail through the TV , putting business travelers at risk of corporate espionage .
And it can allow an intruder to add or delete charges on a hotel guest 's bill or watch pornographic films and other premium content on their hotel TV without paying for it .
Adam Laurie , technical director of the London security and networking firm The Bunker showed Wired News how he conducted such attacks at hotels around the world before he was to speak about the vulnerability Saturday at the DefCon hacker conference in Las Vegas .
Laurie is known as Major Malfunction in the hacker community .
He also revealed how infrared used for garage door openers and car - door locks could be hacked , using simple brute force programming techniques to decipher the code that opens the doors .
" No one thinks about the security risks of infrared because they think it 's used for minor things like garage doors and TV remotes , " Laurie said .
" But infrared uses really simple codes , and they do n't put any kind of authentication ( in it ) … .
If the system was designed properly , I should n't be able to do what I can do . "
Ifrared is used in vending machines , scrolling LED public display signs , air conditioning systems , hotel minibars , robotic toys and home automation systems that control lighting and air conditioning from a console .
But hotel TV systems are the most serious target from a privacy standpoint because they are connected to databases that contain information about guests .
Laurie said the vulnerability lies with how hotels have implemented the backend of infrared systems , placing control of the system at the user end , where the TV is located , rather than at the server end with administrators .
Laurie found that the backend systems in many hotels around the world do n't have password protection or other authentication schemes to prevent unauthorized users from gaining access to them through the TV .
And they fail to use encryption to protect data as it's transferred and stored .
The only hardware an intruder needs is a laptop running Linux , an infrared transmitter and a USB TV tuner .
Laurie said the attack can also be performed using the infrared port built into many laptops .
Plugging the TV into the tuner , which is the size of a laptop power pack , and the tuner into his laptop , Laurie is able to use his laptop to pick up content through hotel TVs that the backend system is broadcasting but not currently displaying on the TV .
" It 's the same as tuning your TV to multiple channels , " Laurie said .
" ( When you 're looking at one channel ) the signal ( for other channels ) is always there , but you 're only currently looking at one part of the spectrum . "
You do n't see what 's broadcasting on the other channels until you tune into them .
Laurie first discovered the vulnerability when he was " mucking about with hotel TVs to get the porn channel without paying for it . "
He was able to bypass TV billing menus by using his laptop to tune in to the premium content being broadcast from backend systems .
He did n't have to pay for the content , because the systems did n't know he was watching it .
Additionally , he could use hidden codes that transmitted from the remote - control device to the TV through infrared to control functions in the system .
But finding those codes and determining what function each controlled was n't easy .
It could take hours to decipher the more than 16,000 possible codes a TV remote uses .
But Laurie automated the process by using a program he wrote that analyzed and mapped all the possible codes in 35 minutes to see which ones were relevant for the system he was trying to crack .
Laurie does n't plan to release the program .
Then he wrote a script that spit out codes to a TV to see what happened .
Within an hour and a half , he had a list of codes that controlled things such as billing for the minibar and the room - cleaning status reports – a menu maids use to report when they 've finished cleaning a room .
Laurie could alter the reports with little effort .
In some hotels , the front desk can lock and unlock the minibar remotely , or maids can do it using a remote and an infrared receiver on the front of the bar .
Laurie found he could do it , too .
One day at a Holiday Inn , he accidentally locked the minibar while he was trying to find the commands that controlled it .
" Unfortunately , I did it before I got that beer out ! " he said , pointing to a slide showing a can of suds taunting him through the minibar 's glass door .
" That was motivation to find the other half of that code ( to open it ) . "
He found he could also change filtering on the TV to block certain content or unblock other content .
But one of the most serious vulnerabilities he found was in the billing system .
Hotel guests can use their TV to check their account balance .
The bill is tied to the room number , which in turn has a unique address that 's assigned to the TV .
Laurie could view the bills of other guests and see their room numbers simply by going to a menu that displayed the address of the TV in his room and changing a number in the address to make the TV think it was in a different room .
" If I change that address – it was A161 and I 've now changed it to A162 – I 'm now looking at the bill of the guy next door , " he said .
If he wanted to know the names and room numbers of all the guests in a hotel , he could automate the process by writing a simple script to call up sequential TV addresses , then set a video camera on a tripod in front of the TV to capture the bills as they came up .
" That tells me who 's in there , who 's sharing ( the room ) with who and what they 've been doing , " he said .
This sort of hack would be useful to any number of people , including paparazzi stalking celebrities and private detectives hired by spouses .
" Why would they connect ( the TV ) to a billing system ? "
Laurie asked .
" Because they do n't think .
As far as the hotel is concerned , you 're the only person who can see ( your bill ) .
But they 're sending you confidential data over the air through a broadcast system .
It 's the equivalent of running an open wireless access point .
If I tune my TV to your channel , then I get to see what you 're doing . "
Laurie could view certain activities of other guests by tuning to other channels or by scanning through all possible channels in the system .
That 's because when a guest purchases premium content or TV internet access , the hotel system assigns a channel to the guest 's room through which to deliver the service .
All Laurie had to do was surf the channels .
He produced a slide of his TV screen showing another hotel guest sifting through business proposals in his e-mail .
" He 's happily typing away in his room thinking he 's privately viewing his e-mail , " Laurie said .
" But I could be anywhere else in the building watching what 's going on ( from ) the TV .
If I was a business rival staying in the same hotel at a conference , I could do a little corporate espionage .
I see the ( bid ) proposal he 's putting in and I could go in and put one in that 's 10 bucks cheaper . "
He could also distract the guest with a call while he 's still logged into his account , and take over his desktop while he 's not looking .
" I'm now controlling the account that he 's logged into , " he said .
" I 'm just being him for the moment . "
Laurie has been testing infrared systems for two years and said every time he breaks into a new system he finds a new feature – something he did n't initially think he could do through the remote , which he can now do .
" There 's ( still ) a whole bunch of data ( in these systems ) that I do n't know what it means , but I know where the manufacturers ' programming manuals are , so I can go and download them and figure it out , " he said .
Many hotels use the same systems .
Laurie said he 's seen only three or four different backend systems and only two front - end systems for the most part – TVs made either by Phillips or Loewe .
This means he does n't have to repeat the research at each hotel .
Laurie can also use the television as a backdoor to the network .
Surfing through channels with his laptop one day , he suddenly found himself viewing the desktop of a backend computer .
He discovered that he could control the cursor on the desktop to maneuver through the master control panel .
He could also click icons on the desktop and launch applications .
With all of these vulnerabilities , it might seem possible to upload malicious code into a backend system through the infrared as well .
Laurie has n't tried it yet .
" It 's on the to - do list , " he said .

More on risk
My article on risk was one of the more popular articles so far ; it went to the top of Reddit , and was widely commented on .
It was n't the best article I 've written .
I confused a bunch of important things .
But now I find I have more to say on the topic , so I 'm back to screw up again .
One big problem with the Reddit posting is that the guy who posted it there titled the post on risk , or why poor people might not be stupid to play the lottery .
So a lot of the Reddit comments complained that I had failed to prove that poor people must not be stupid to play the lottery , or that I was wrong on that point .
They argued that the dollar cost of a lottery ticket is more valuable to a poor person than to a rich one , and so on .
But I did n't say anything about poor people .
People read this into the article based on the title someone else had attached to it , and they could n't get rid of this association even after I pointed out that the article had nothing to say about poor people .
Something I do a lot , in this blog , and in life , is point out fallacious arguments .
You get some argument that X is true , because of P and Q and therefore R , and then I 'll come along point out that P is false and Q is irrelevant , and anyway they do n't imply R , and even if they did , you can't conclude X from R , because if you could , then you could also conclude Y and Z which are obviously false .
For example , in a recent article I addressed the argument that :
You can double your workforce participation from 27 % to 51 % of the population , as Singapore did ; you can't double it again .
The argument being that you can't double a participation of 51 % because you can't possibly have 102 % workforce participation .
( Peter Norvig pointed out that he made the same argument in a different context back in 1999 . )
But the argument here fails , for reasons I wo n't go into again .
This does n't mean that I believe that Singapore 's workforce participation will double again .
Just because I point out that an argument for X is fallacious does n't mean that I believe X is false .
The " risk " article was one of those .
I wanted to refute one specific argument , which is that ( a ) the expected return on a lottery ticket is negative , so therefore ( b ) it 's stupid to buy lottery tickets .
My counter - argument was to point out that ( a ) the expected return on fire insurance is negative , but that you can't conclude that therefore ( b ) it 's stupid to buy fire insurance .
It might be stupid to buy lottery tickets , but if it is , it 's not because the expected return is negative .
Or at least it 's not only because the expected return is negative .
There must be more to it than that .
I really like that pattern of argument , and I use it a lot : A can't imply B , because if it did , then it would also imply B ' , and B ' is false , or at least B ' is a belief held only by dumbasses .
None of this addresses the question of whether or not I think it 's stupid to buy lottery tickets .
I have not weighed in on that matter .
My only argument is that the argument from expected value is insufficient to prove the point .
People have a lot of trouble with second - order arguments like this , though .
If I argue " that argument against B is no good , " they are likely to hear it as an argument in favor of B. Several of the Reddit people made this mistake .
The converse mistake is to interpret " that argument against B is no good , because it can be converted into an argument against B' " as an argument against B ' !
Some of the Reddit people made this mistake too , and disdainfully explained to me why buying fire insurance is not stupid .
Another problem with the article was that it followed my usual pattern of meandering digression .
Although the main point of the article was to refute the argument from expected value , I threw in a bunch of marginally related stuff that I thought was fun and interesting : the stuff about estimating the value one ascribes to one 's own life ; the stuff about the surprisingly high chance of being killed by a meteor strike .
Email correspondents and Reddit commenters mistook both of these for arguments about the lottery , and tried to refute them as such .
Well , I have nobody to blame but myself for that .
If you present a muddled , miscellaneous article , you can't complain when other people are confused by it .
If I were going to do the article again , one thing I 'd try to fix is the discussion of utility .
I think my biggest screwup was to confuse two things that are not the same .
One is the utility , which decreases for larger amounts of money ; your second million dollars has less value than your first million .
But another issue , which I did n't separate in my mind , was the administration cost of money .
There must be a jargon term for this , but I do n't know what it is .
Economists like to pretend that money is perfectly fungible , and this is a reasonable simplifying assumption in most cases .
But it 's easy to prove that money is n't perfectly fungible .
Imagine you 've just won a prize .
You can have one thousand dollars paid in hundred - dollar bills , or you can have a thousand and one dollars , paid in pennies .
Anyone who really believes that money is perfectly fungible will take the pennies , even though they weigh six hundred pounds , because that way they get the one - dollar bonus .
Money has a physical manifestation , even when it 's just numerals written in a ledger somewhere , and managing the physical manifestation of money has an associated cost .
The cost of managing a penny is a significant fraction of the value of the penny , to the point that many people throw away pennies or dump them in jars just to avoid the cost of dealing with them .
In some circumstances , like the lottery ticket purchase , the non-fungibility of money is important .
Blowing one dollar on a lottery that pays a thousand dollars is not the same as blowing a thousand dollars on a lottery that pays a million dollars , and it's not the same as blowing your whole paycheck on a big stack of lottery tickets .
Partly it 's the risk issue , and partly it's this other issue , that I do n't know the name of , that a single dollar is worth less than one one - thousandth of a thousand dollars , because the cost to administer and manage it is proportionately higher .
I did n't make this clear in the original article because it was n't clear in my mind .
Oh well , I 'm not yet a perfect sage .
One last point that has come up is that a couple of people have written to me to say that they would not take the Russian roulette bet for any amount of money at any odds .
( Here 's a blog post to that effect , for example . )
One person even suggested that I only assumed he would take the bet at some odds because I 'm an American , and I can't conceive of anyone refusing a big pot of money .
Well , maybe that 's true , but I do n't think that 's why I assumed that everyone would take the bet for some amount of money .
I assumed it because that is what I have observed people to do .
I now know there are people who say that they would not play Russian roulette at any odds for any payoff .
And I think those people are fooling themselves .
If you think you 're one of those people , I have this question for you :
Do you own a bicycle helmet ?
And if you do , did you buy the very top - of - the - line helmet ?
Or did you buy a mid-price model that might offer less protection ?
What , just to save money ?
I offered you a million dollars at million - to - one odds .
Do you think that fifty dollars you saved on your bicycle helmet is paying you off for less risk than my million - to - one Russian roulette bet ?
Well , maybe you do n't own a bicycle , so you think you have no need of a helmet .
But if the people who wrote to me were as risk - averse as some of them said they were , the lack of a bicycle would n't stop them from wearing helmets all the time anyway — another reason I think they are fooling themselves .
I 've met some of these people , and they do n't go around in helmets and padded armor all the time .
Or maybe you do own the very safest helmet money can buy , since you have only one head , after all .
But I bet you can find some other example ?
Have you ever flown in a plane ?
Did you refuse to fly anywhere not served by Qantas , like Raymond in Rain Man , because every other airline has had a crash ?
If you had a choice to pay double to fly with Qantas , would you take it ?
Or would you take the cheap flight and ignore the risk ?
One comment that replies to the blog I cited above really hits the nail on the head , I think .
It says : " you do n't get paid a million dollars to get in your car and drive somewhere , but what are the chances you 'll be killed in an auto accident ? "
My Russian roulette game is a much better deal than driving your car .
I 'm going to end this article , as I did the last one , with an amusing anecdote about risk .
My great - uncle Robert E. Machol was for a time the chief scientist of the Federal Aviation Administration .
The regulations for infant travel were ( and still are ) that an infant may make an air trip on its parent 's lap ; parents do not need to buy a separate ticket and a seat for the infant .
In one air disaster , an infant that was being held on its parent 's lap was thrown loose , hurtled to the end of the corridor , and died .
The FAA was considering changing the rules for infants to require that they purchase a separate ticket , entitling them to their own seat , into which would be installed an FAA - approved safety car seat .
Infants in their own restraint seats would be much safer than those held on their parents ' laps .
Dr. Machol argued against this rule change , on the following grounds :
If parents are required to buy separate tickets for their infants , air travel will be more expensive for them .
As a result , some families will opt to take car trips instead of plane trips .
Car trips are much more dangerous than plane trips ; the fatalities per passenger per mile are something like twenty times higher .
More babies can be expected to be killed in the resulting auto crashes than can be expected to be saved by the restraint seat requirement .
As before , this is not intended as an argument for or against anything in particular , except perhaps that the idea of risk is complex and hard to understand .
Probably people will try to interpret it as an argument about the fungibility of money , or whatever the next Reddit person decides to put in the article title .
You'd think I would have learned my lesson by now , but , as I said , I 'm not yet a perfect sage .

筆者は今夏、ミネソタ州ミネアポリスで開催されたAgile 2006カンファレンスに参加し、これを大いに楽しんだ。そこで筆者がソフトウェア開発を教えるときのアプローチについてRon Jefferies氏と話をしていたところ、Agile ToolkitのBob Payne氏がこの話題をポッドキャストにしないかと聞いてきた［注1］。筆者が講義をするときのアプローチ［注2］については、1年前のこのコラムで説明しているため、ここでは詳しい説明は省略させていただく。その代わりに、ポッドキャストを録音しているときに遭遇した問題を中心に解説したい。プログラマー全員に共通する、クリーンで保守のしやすいコードを書く能力の欠如だ。
どうしてこのような話題が頭に浮かんだのだろうか？
われわれがポッドキャストを録音する作業を聞いていた人の1人から、大学を出たばかりのいまの連中はなぜ優れたコード（つまり、信頼性が高く、きれいにフォーマットされ、エレガントなコード）を書くことができないのか、という簡単な質問が出た。彼は、「学生には、実世界ではうまくないコードを書くと不利益を受けることが分からないのか？
学生がコードやソリューションに対するエレガンスの必要性を理解できないのは、大学教授たちの指導のどこが間違っているのか？」と疑問を投げ掛けた。
本稿では、これらの問題と粗悪なコードがもたらす結果をいくつか考察し、考えられるソリューションをいくつか提案する。
◆ そもそも 「 クリーン」なコードとは何か？
クリーンなコードとは、美しさのように、見る人によっていろいろな意味で異なる。経験豊かなプログラマーがプログラムのソースコードを見れば、それが読みやすいかどうか分かる。彼らはさらに、コードが効率的かどうか、十分に構造化されているかどうか、そして簡潔性の面でエレガントかどうかについても素早く意見を出せる。これらの特性はどれも定義が難しいが、クリーンかそうでないかは、ソフトウェア開発者にコードを見せれば大抵は一致した意見が得られる。
クリーンなコードに寄与する要素は多い。そのいくつかは普遍的で、ソフトウェア開発時のあらゆるタイプのプログラミング言語や問題領域に当てはまる。また、クリーンなコードの特性の中には、特定のプログラミング言語に依存するものもある。
ここで、同じ処理を行う2つの短いコードを見てみたい。これは、テニスのセットカウントを数えるコードだ［注3］。いずれにも、勝ったゲームの数を計算するメソッドと、そのスコアを知らせるメッセージを返すメソッドがある。どちらも入力はすべて正しいと仮定しており、不正入力に対するチェックは行っていない。これらは、設計と構築を同時に進める手法で書かれており、クラスの正しい使い方はクライアント次第となっている。これらはいずれも同じユニットテストに合格している。では、以下の2つのリストを見てみたい。リスト1とリスト2のどちらの方が「クリーン」だろうか？
リスト1は、同じ処理を繰り返すようなコードで初心者プログラマーがよく使う幼稚なスタイルで書かれている。必ずしも複雑ではないが、筆者には散らかっていて効率が悪く見える。リスト2の方が複雑な条件になっているが、Javaを理解していれば、かなり読みやすい。唯一疑問を抱くかもしれないとしたら、最後の「else if」の中にある条件の最初の部分だけだ。このクローズに来るということは、どちらかのプレーヤーが勝ったことを意味する。
いずれのインプリメンテーションも間違ってはいない。実際、これらはどちらも非常に小さく、つまらない例にすぎないので、これらのリストでコードがいかにクリーンか論ずるのはあまり有益ではない。ただ、何をもってインプリメンテーションがクリーンなのかについて読者の興味を深めることはできるだろう。
クリーンなコードについて扱った記事、Webサイト、書籍は多数存在する。何をもってコードをクリーンとするかについては、誰にでも一家言ある。講義や研究の目的でコードを見る機会が増えているが、筆者がこのうちのいくつかを見たところ、そこには原則があるように思える。それらについては、本稿の後半に示す。
◆ 汚いコードができるわけ
筆者は、汚い、もしくは粗雑なコードができるのには以下の3つの理由があると考える。
時間のプレッシャー 学習不足 熱意
では、これらを1つずつ見ていこう。
・時間のプレッシャ ー
ソフトウェアプロジェクトは遅れるものだ。ウォーターフォールプロセスを使うと反復型アプローチよりさらに遅れるが、大半のプロジェクトは採用するライフサイクルモデルに関係なくある程度は遅れる。反復と増加を繰り返すライフサイクルにおいては、遅れがスケジュール的なものではなく、機能的なものに起因する場合もある。
プロジェクトが遅れ始めると、開発者とチーム全体が近道をしようとする傾向になる。これが人間性だ。「ワニに丸のみにされようとしているときに、自分が沼に入った目的を思い出そうとしても難しい」というではないか。プレッシャーが掛かると、何かをあきらめることになり、目の前のこと以外は見逃しがちになる。先の例の場合は、取りあえずワニに向かっていくことになる。筆者は、プロセスも典型的に無視されてしまうものの1つであることに気付いた。プロセスは、具体的な行動を取るか、特定の成果物を生み出す必要があるが、これらを回避できるのならそうするだろう。追い込み作業が一息ついてから作業を再開しようと考えるし、そうするつもりでいても、そうなることはめったにない。
必要に応じて捨てられるということに関しては、クリーンなコードにもプロセスと同じことがいえる。われわれは、意味のある「netPay」などの変数名を使う代わりに、短くて、貴重な時間の節約にもなる「np」などを使ってしまう。有意義なコメントも、アルゴリズムの説明も付加しなくなる。期限が迫り、コードを何としても動くようにしなくてはならなくなる。
期限に合わせてコードを書くこのようなアプローチはあまりに近視眼的で、後から自分たちが苦労させられることになる。
・学習不 足
高校、大学、あるいは何らかの方法でプログラムを学習したとしても、クリーンなコードを書く方法について本当に学んだ経験はおそらくないだろう。これは、教育機関に時間的制約があることも要因の1つだ。ある一定の時間に教えられることには限界があり、プロジェクトの期限が迫るとプロセスが排除されてしまうのと同じように、クリーンなコードに寄与することの多いコーディングスタイルや読みやすさなどの内容は教育課程から省略されてしまう。
各種教育機関におけるプログラミングの講義概要を見ると、講義の名称や目標にプログラミングスタイルが含まれるものもいくつかある。しかしよく見ると、目標に向けて最後までやる講師はまれであるように思える。課題や成績評価基準にも、クリアで読みやすく、うまく書かれたコードに対する評価を加味した内容がない。営利目的でプログラミングを教えるコースは学校よりさらに悪い。こちらはさらに講義時間が短いのが普通で、会社に戻ってから学んだばかりの言語に関してのみは生産性を高められるよう、必要最低限の知識を教えることしか考えられていない。
・熱意
大学のコンピュータサイエンスの教科課程の大半は、各種言語のプログラミング入門になっていない。それよりむしろ、学生は各種言語の十分な基礎教育を受けているものと仮定され、OSやネットワークの課程にコーディングスタイルや読みやすさに関する内容が含まれることはほとんどない。学生は、問題を解くことで評価されるだけだ。スタイルが考慮されることはない。
誤解しないでいただきたいのだが、コンピュータ科学者はエレガントなコードを高く評価する。筆者としては、ソフトウェアエンジニアリングの教授はコードのクリーンさに特に注意を払ってくれるものだと思いたい。しかし、この評価の対象が必ずしもコードの読みやすさや保守性であることもない。われわれは、コードの読みやすさや構造よりエレガントなアルゴリズムや技術のエレガンスを評価することも多い。
コードをきれいにではなく適切に書くことに価値を感じているのは大学だけではない。これは実社会でも起こることであり、残念ながらプログラミングコンテストでも見受けられる。ACM
International Collegiate Programming Contest世界大会決勝の採点方法からの引用をご覧いただきたい。
「 チームは解いた問題の数で順位が決められる。上位12チームのうち回答数が同じチームは、まず所要時間の少ない順番、そして必要であれば最後の有効処理が実行されたときのタイムで最終順位を決める」［注4］
そう、そこにはクリーンなコードを評価する規定が全くないのだ。筆者は、コードのエレガンスと読みやすさを「判定」することが簡単な作業でなく、どちらかといえば主観的な作業であることは認識している。また、エレガントなコードを書けば回答を早く取得する確率も高まるといくら主張しても、筆者はこれを立証する調査を1つも知らない。ここで筆者がいいたいのは、重要なプログラミングの現場では、クリーンなコードが全く考慮されないことが多過ぎるということだ。
◆ コードの改良
世間が汚いコードであふれている理由は十分に分かったが、では、われわれはそれに対して何ができるのだろうか？
筆者はここで、以下の3つが可能だと提案したい。
クリーンなコードを書くことを自分のプロセスに取り入れる
クリーンなコードの書き方を教える クリーンなコードを評価する
では、ここで1つ1つ説明したい。
クリーンなコードを書くことを自分のプロセスに取り入れる。
Agileコミュニティーにおいては、コードをクリーンしておくことは原則の1つだと高く評価している。その1つが以下だ。
優れた技術とデザインに常に留意することがアジリティを強化する［注5］。
この原則は、eXtreme Programming（XP）の連続リファクタリングなどの手法の中で明示されている。XPのチームに参加するプログラマーは、常に時間をかけ、コードを可能な限りクリーンかつエレガントなものにすることが期待されている。近道は許されることではなく、評価されることも報われることもない。もちろん、これは期限が迫ってもチームが実際にXPの手法に従っていると仮定した場合だ。しかし、時間に追われることによって、組織が再びワニとの対決を余儀なくされる文化に戻らないとの保証は一切ない。
もしあなたが、リファクタリングや優れたコメントの作成を自分の個人プロセスに組み入れれば、ほかの方法ではコードが書けなくなっていくだろう。見積もりが正確かつ妥当なものになるよう、コードをクリーンにし、コメントを挿入するための時間を考慮することになる［注6］。
・クリーンなコードの書き方を教える
コードを書く作業はほかのどのような作業とも同じだ。練習、批判、そして練習の繰り返しが必要だ。Richard Gabriel氏は自著 『Writers ' Workshops & the Work of Making Things : Patterns , Poetry ……（作家のためのワークショップと物作り：パターン、詩……）』［注7］の中で、散文、詩、そしてソフトウェアコードを書くときの多くの類似点を解説している。これらのさまざまな書き方を芸術として扱い、協調テクニックを重点的に学ぶことは学校では難しいが、教師がソフトウェアのコーディング学を芸術の域にまで高めることのできる手段なら、おそらくどのようなものにも価値があるだろう。
［注7］2002 年 、Pearson Education刊 、ISBN 020172183X 。
うまく書けるようになるためには、うまく読めなくてはならない。書き方に堪能になりたいときは、まずは特定の言語で利用される標準と成句の両方の読み方を理解する必要がある。コードの読み書きも同じだ。その言語と、それのうまい使い方を学ぶ必要がある。そして、優れたコードを書けるようになりたいなら、コードをうまく読めるようになる必要がある。学生に対し、コードを読んでよく考え、その品質やエレガンスについて議論しろという時間が不足しているのだ。筆者が一緒に働く光栄にあずかれた最も優秀なソフトウェア開発者の1人は、膨大な量のコードを読む。彼は、さまざまなプロジェクトのコードを読み、どうすればそれを改良できるか考えることで、うまくプログラミングするための方法を学んでいるのだ。
一部の学校（その数はあまりに少ないが）では、「ソフトウェアスタジオ」のような名前の付いた課程やゼミを用意している。これらの課程では、学生がアーチストや作家のように集まり、作品を見せ合う。彼らはどんな意見でも出し合い、建設的な批判の仕方や受け方を学ぶ。大体の場合、優秀な学生には業界でよく見られる大きなエゴがあり、このような課程は彼らの多くにとって困難なものになるが、それは素晴らしい学習体験になるだろう。
われわれは、今年 のWPI から「コーディング道場」を開催している。コーディング道場は、筆者が今夏の「 Agile 2006」カンファレンスで知ったものだ［注8］。毎週集まってシンプルなコーディングに挑戦している。コードをグループで書くことも多い。筆者が先に示したリスト2のコードは、先日の集まりで作成したものだ。われわれの道場で唯一問題になるのは、時間があまりに短いことだ。しかし、この道場は、クリーンなコーディングテクニックについて考え、それを自分の中に取り入れるのに最適な方法だ。道場はどこでも開くことができる。会社の昼休みのイベントとしても素晴らしい。
大学の課程で出る課題の大半は短いもので、前述のようにコードのエレガンスや読みやすさはあまり重視されていない。しかし教育者としては、学生が利用できるコードベースを増やす方法を探す必要がある。例えば、学生に既存のコードベースの維持管理を行わせ、これを拡張することも考えられる。そうすれば、彼らもうまく書かれていないコードの苦痛を味わい、それが後々生産性に与える影響を感じられるようになるだろう。筆者の学生は2005年にこのようなことを経験した。2006年になってから、筆者がプロジェクトにおけるコードの品質向上の必要性を認識した次第だ。
その結果は劇的なものだった。筆者がソフトウェアエンジニアリングを教えている学生に対し、オブジェクト指向分析や設計を教えている学生の書いたベースコードを提供したところ、1週間もたたないうちにこれを効果的に使い出したのだ。2005年の時点では見られなかったことだ。筆者が毎週課題を出すOOADプロジェクトの成績は、そのjavadocコメントとコードのスタイルで採点した。
・クリーンなコードを評価する
もしあなたがマネージャならば、部下に自分の価値を理解させる必要がある。コードの品質とエレガンスがあなたにとって重要であることを、部下である開発者が確実に理解するよう努めるのだ。期限が迫ってきたらチームをかばい、（いずれにせよテキトーなことが多い）予定日を守るためだけに粗悪なコードを出荷するよりも、スコープ管理のために戦うのだ。
優れたコードには何らかの方法で報いたい。報いることは難しいことではない。あなたが何を重んじるのかを部下たちが認識するまでにさほど時間はかからないし、彼らは底力を発揮して、これらの価値に見合った成果を上げるだろう。大規模企業の活動はこのような価値を支持しないが、コードの保守性が将来的な作業に役立つため、長期的には部下たちができる作業は増えていくだろう。
本稿がきっかけとなり、クリーンなコードを評価することを考えていただけるようになれば幸いだ。筆者は、これがきっかけでクリーンなコードを評価する手段について考えるようになった。今後の記事では評価基準について解説していきたい。

Starting off on the right foot is just as important as it ever was .
However , with Agile Work , this takes on a significantly different meaning than it does in other methods as the emphasis of what is “ right ” is also significantly different .
This is a short guide on how to successfully launch a team using Agile Work .
0 . Do what you need to in your organization to get a project and its budget approved .
This usually involves some sort of business case , project charter and approval process .
This may sound obvious , but the organizational support that this provides is essential .
1. Management must have a basic understanding of the method and in particular the roles : Queue Master , Process Facilitator and Team .
This can be accomplished in a number of ways : reading , attending a workshop , or bringing a coach in to do a brief presentation .
By “ management ” is meant at least the person sponsoring the launch of an agile team .
2. Individual people must be identified to fill the Queue Master and Process Facilitator roles .
At first , these people should be assigned to these roles full - time and relieved of their previous duties .
Ideally , the people filling these roles are volunteers from a pre-selected group of appropriate candidates .
3 . The Queue Master and Process Facilitator must both get some initial training .
For this , the following books are recommended for both roles : Agile Estimating and Planning ( Robert C. Martin Series ) , User Stories Applied : For Agile Software Development ( Addison - Wesley Signature Series ) , and Agile Project Management with Scrum ( Microsoft Professional ) .
Unfortunately , all of these books are software - specific and if you need to apply Agile Work in a non -software environment , there will be some effort in translating the concepts and practices .
You may need more specific training depending on the criticality of your pilot project .
4 . Form up the team .
Getting this right is not easy : the team needs to remain relatively small ( 5 people is about right ) , but at the same time include people with all the skills necessary to deliver the whole project .
You need people who are good at the various technical skills needed , the people skills needed , the problem - solving and analysis skills needed , and the administrative skills .
All these people need to be part of the team right from the start .
Again , for emphasis : do not start the project before all these people and their skills are dedicated to the team and they have been relieved of their previous duties .
Forming the team includes logistical concerns such as where the team will sit , making sure they have the right equipment for their work , etc .
5 . If you are trying agile for the first time , do n’t consider using a distributed team or off - shore resources .
Nor telecommuters .
This type of stuff is better left for once your organization has more experience with agile methods .
6. Provide initial training to your team .
Include the Queue Master and Process Facilitator in this training ( they are considered part of the team ) .
Also include any significant stakeholders in the results of the project .
Give them , at a minimum , a one - day introduction to agile .
7 . The Queue Master creates an initial Work Queue .
The rest of the team should participate in this process .
The creation of this Work Queue must be timeboxed .
I advise that it should only be given 1 or 2 percent of the overall project time .
Decide before you start on how long will be given to this .
The end result of this is a Work Queue that has some number of work items defined , understood by the team , valued , costed , and prioritized .
The Work Queue does not have to be “ finished ” .
It is more important to hold to the timebox than to get the Work Queue “ right ” .
Remember that the Work Queue will continue to be refined as the team progresses in its work .
Do not under any circumstances create the initial Work Queue in the absence of the team !
8 . Run a brief project workshop .
In this workshop , the team answers basic questions about the nature of the project run with agile methods such as :
– what is the length of our iterations ?
– what are the team ’s core hours ( when do all the team members commit to working together as opposed to working on administrivia ) ?
– what other teams / groups do we need to work with ?
– are we missing any critical skills ( now that we have seen the initial Work Queue ) ?
– what are the priorities of the project ( quality , scope , time , budget , experimentation , etc. ) ?
9. OPTIONAL ITEMS :
– Consider doing a workshop on corporate culture and agile methods to help the team understand some of the challenges it will face and where it can find support
– Consider doing some initial team building exercises .
Particularly if people on the team have n’t worked together previously , this can help the team to get over some initial hurdles .
– Consider getting junior members of the team some additional training on the techniques , technologies or tools used in the team ’s work .
This can be arranged so that it is done simultaneously with some of the team ’s early iterations .
– Consider engaging a coach or mentor for your Process Facilitator .
This coach can be someone inside the organization who has extensive experience with agile methods or an external consultant who comes for a limited time to help your Process Facilitator .
None of these optional items should unduly delay the start of the first iteration .
10 . Start your first iteration .
There should be little or no delay or waiting between the creation of the team and the start of the first iteration .
At this point the Process Facilitator is responsible for the process , the Queue Master is responsible for the value delivered , and the Team is responsible for delivering results .
Washington – Forget the minimum wage .
Or outsourcing jobs overseas .
The labor issue most on the minds of members of Congress on Tuesday was their own :
They will have to work five days a week starting in January .
The horror .
Rep. Steny Hoyer , the Maryland Democrat who will become
House majority leader and is writing the schedule for the next Congress , said members should expect longer hours than the brief week to which they have grown accustomed .
“ I have bad news for you , ” Hoyer told reporters .
“ Those trips you had planned in January , forget ’em .
We will be working almost every day in January , starting with the fourth . ”
The reporters groaned .
“ I know , it ’s awful , is n’t it ? ” Hoyer empathized .
For lawmakers , it is awful , compared with what they have come to expect .
For much of this election year , the legislative week started late Tuesday and ended by Thursday afternoon – and that was during the relatively few weeks the House was n’t in recess .
Next year , House members will be expected in the Capitol for votes each week by 4:30 p.m. MST on Monday and will finish their business about noon MST on Friday , Hoyer said .
With the new calendar , the Democrats are trying to project a businesslike image when they take control of Congress in January .
House and Senate Democratic leaders have announced an ambitious agenda for their first 100 hours and say they are adamant about scoring legislative victories they can trumpet in the 2008 campaigns .
Hoyer and other Democratic leaders say they are trying to repair the image of Congress , which was so anemic this year it could not meet a basic duty : to approve spending bills that fund government .
By the time the gavel comes down on the 109th Congress on Friday , members will have worked a total of 103 days .
That ’s seven days fewer than the infamous “ Do- Nothing Congress ” of 1948 .
Hoyer said members can bid farewell to extended holidays , such as the six relaxing days around Memorial Day , when most Americans get a single day off .
He did n’t mention the month - long August recess , the two - week April recess or the weeks off in February , March and July .
For lawmakers within a reasonable commute of Washington , longer weeks are not a burden – although they probably will cut into members ’ fundraising and campaigning activities , but for members from Alaska and Hawaii , the West Coast or rural states , the new schedule will mean less time at home and more stress .
Sorting Algorithms
The animations on this page illustrate a number of different sequential and parallel sorting algorithms .
The relative execution times of the animations give a very rough idea of the relative speeds of the algorithms .
Each algorithm is finished when its colored lines disappear .
Speed and Efficiency Analysis .
Bubble Sort is a sequential algorithm , with an average case time of O( n 2 ) .
. Quick
Sort is a sequential algorithm , with an average case time of O( n log n ) .
. Odd-Even Transposition
Sort is a parallel algorithm , with an worst case time of O ( n ) , running on n processors .
Its absolute speed up is O ( log n ) , so its efficiency is O ( ( log n ) /n ) .
, running on processors .
Its absolute speed up is , so its efficiency is .
Shear Sort is a parallel algorithm , with an worst case time of O ( n 1/ 2 log n ) , running on n processors .
Its absolute speed up is O ( n 1/2 ) , so its efficiency is O ( 1/n1/2 ) .
Bubble Sort Quick Sort O - E Tran .
Sort Shear Sort
Java Implementation Notes
All the implementations are subclasses of the class SortAlgorithm , which uses the class SortItem .
Both of these classes were designed and implemented by James Gosling , who also implemented Bubble Sort and Quick Sort .
My implementation of Shear Sort requires a minor modification to SortAlgorithm and SortItem .
Fonts on Linux have had a chequered history .
Mostly , they 've been bad .
Once , there was an excuse for this : GNOME and KDE were unable to render anti-aliased text , and there was a paucity of decent free TrueType fonts .
Now , with Xft , Freetype and Bitstream Vera fonts things are different .
Unfortunately , it 's hard to find Linux distributions that have gone the extra mile to make the fonts look good by default .
Let 's take a brief look through default fonts in various operating systems .
Mac OS
X offers a great default , which looks good on all modern machines .
No user configuration required .
Windows default is blocky , as there 's no anti-aliasing to speak of , but the hinting on the fonts is excellent and they 're crisp .
If you dig a bit and find the crazily hidden Display properties - Appearance - Effects dialog , you can turn on ClearType .
Windows ClearType offers a pleasing level of font smoothing .
Now , let 's look at the GNOME default , taken from a screenshot on the GNOME 2.12 start page .
This is pretty much how default GNOME looks on any machine .
In particular , it 's the default look you get when you install Ubuntu .
This corresponds to a setting of full hinting in the font preferences , with the font Bitstream Vera Sans .
The quality of the type , however , is poor .
It has a spidery and ungainly quality to it .
In and of itself , Vera is not an ugly font .
There 's some combination of the font 's hinting and the Freetype hinting engine that conspires to make things ugly .
On my desktop I 've tried to work around this by altering the font settings somewhat .
The effect is n't perfect , but a lot better to look at .
The font is Bitstream Vera Sans as before .
To get this , I had to switch off any hinting then slowly play with the DPI setting until I get letterforms that rendered neatly .
Alas , this brings problems of its own .
For a start , not all popular GNOME applications respect this setting .
Firefox often gets its own idea about such matters as screen DPI , and OpenOffice.org2 completely ignores my hinting preferences and gives me nasty looking menu bars .
Murray Cumming 's recent GNOME for bad eyesight blog post also gets into many of these issues .
For most users without time or inclination to hunt this down the choice is either to live with the ugliness , or opt for an operating system that gets it right .
( Lest I seem churlish here , I should celebrate the amazing work done with internationalization on the Linux desktop , which continues to bring computing access to many in the world for whom choice is a luxury . )
There is one Linux distribution that makes a reasonable job of good - looking fonts .
The Fedora Core 4 distribution ships with a different default font and out of the box settings giving reasonably attractive letterforms .
Courtesy of OSDIR , here are GNOME and KDE screenshots .
However , I 'm pretty sure it does n't solve the rest of the font integration issues .
I 'm no typography expert , but I find that good - looking fonts enable me to work more effectively .
And on the advocacy side , I want my Linux desktop to look as good or better than the OS X and Windows alternatives .
Lots of great effort was made getting us to the point of anti-aliased rendering and the licensing of the Bitstream Vera Fonts .
Having got this far , it seems a shame not to hunt down the remaining irritations in font handling .

I love stories .
by , Panic co-founder
Is it just me ?
I mean , do you ever wonder about the stories behind everyday products ?
What names were Procter & Gamble considering before they finally picked " Swiffer " ?
( Springle ? Sweepolio ?
Dirtrocker ? )
What flavors of Pop - Tarts never made it out of the lab , and did any involve lychee , the devil 's fruit ?
What magical prototype Apple products will never be seen , forever relegated to some giant , Wonka - esque industrial design factory that might exist only in my imagination ?
( " Oompa , loompa , diggity - dack : come take a peek at this dodecahedron - Mac ! " ) .
And honestly , what in God 's name is a " Graffle " ?
OK , sure , it might just be me .
But as it turns out , even something as seemingly mundane as a Mac app can have a few marginally interesting , if not truly nerdy , stories of its own .
When we created Audion , our Mac-only , multipurpose MP3 application , Steven Frank and I had one goal : we wanted to listen to our music CDs on our computers while we worked , and we wanted to it be stylish .
We had no indication that MP3s would one day turn the music industry upside down and have it running for cover .
We certainly had no idea that something like the iPod would pop up and literally change Apple as a company .
And even though we were n't really responsible for any revolutions per se — rather , we rode on the revolution - train with many others — everything that happened to Audion just fell into place , magically and unexpectedly , like so many beautiful moments in life .
But now , after many years of work , we 've made the difficult decision to " retire " Audion from active development .
( Hey , wait !
Do n't worry !
We 're not going out of business , nobody has left , and everyone here at Panic is hard at work on exciting new projects as well as updating our existing projects .
Anyway . )
Suffice it to say , this retirement decision was n't easy .
In trying to work up the nerve to make the decision , I kept thinking back to high - school yearbooks .
Remember that last day of school , when the yearbooks arrived , and you 'd invariably end up spilling your guts to your secret crush ( es ) via hastily worded , heart - dumping notes tucked into the corner of the back page ?
That last day of school really seemed to feel like your last day on earth , your last chance to tell the story that 's been percolating for so long , damn the consequences .
( Of course , two weeks later you 'd run into your crush at Hot Dog On A Stick and be completely embarrassed — man , why did n't I just write " Have A Nice Summer " and draw a giraffe on a pogo stick — but it felt good to get it off your chest . )
Consider this Audion 's last day of high school .
He 'll still be off chilling at college , now completely free ( of charge ) , probably growing a goatee , but he wo n't be running around like the crazy wildman he once was , in a state of — um — active development .
And with that , my metaphor has strained to the bursting point .
In short , we did n't want Audion , flashy crazy Audion , to go with a whimper .
We felt it was time to celebrate this one application — this one tiny tale in a world of millions — that 's done so much for us , and whose customers and fans have helped us become what we are today , to whom we owe so much .
It 's time to inscribe in the great Mac App Yearbook .
It 's time to tell Audion 's story .
The birth of Audion
So , it goes something like this .
Steve and I had just finished and released Transmit ( then it was called Transit ) , our first official Mac application ( well , technically our second , the first being the unreleased Verso ) .
And , to be totally honest , we had absolutely no idea what we were going to do next .
The great thing about not having any ideas is that you do n't have any ideas .
So , while down in San Francisco for Macworld Expo in 1999 , truly enjoying an inspiration - generating show floor , we had a brainstorm that went something like this : the Apple Menu sucks eggs .
For those of you fortunate enough to have jumped on the Macintosh Train just as it pulled out of OS X station ( woo - woooo ! ) , the Apple Menu — this is in Mac OS 7/8/9 days — was filled to the brim with a variety of tools and applications , almost all crusty ( with the exception of Jens Alfke 's venerable Stickies ) : a weird calculator , a very black and white notepad , etc .
It also contained a very indispensable app called the AppleCD Audio Player , which let you listen to CD 's on your Mac .
Looking at the Apple Menu we were struck with the realization that , although we used these tools pretty much every day , they were all pretty poorly designed .
" Wait , that gives me an idea ! " one of us said , inspirational bulb popping .
" Let 's go to Wendy 's and pick up some chili ! "
Later , chili in hand , the true idea came forward : " Let 's single - handedly refurbish the Apple Menu — we 'll write a series of cool little apps that each do one thing and do it well !
And let 's call it the ' PanicPack ' , make it cute , and bundle all the apps together for one reasonable price !
It 'll be cool ! " PanicPack = Audion 1.0
Returning to Portland from San Francisco , we immediately got to work .
At this time , mind you , Steven Frank and I both lived and worked out of a 2 - bedroom apartment in Northwest Portland ; the living room was our office , the kitchen our high - tech call center , and the bathroom our , well , bathroom .
It was small , it was fun , and it was Panic .
Within days , the PanicPack design document was written ( .pdf , 115 k , boring ) — interestingly , I do n't think we 've written a design document since — and I , as always , immediately started working on isometric cube - based logos .
The first program we started to work on was this replacement for the AppleCD Audio Player — a cool , nice looking CD player , we figured , with a few more interesting functions , done up in Panic style .
The name " Audion " simply popped into my head during a shower — I wish there was a better and less naked story for that — and it stuck .
Audion was off and running .
Then , one day , during development , it struck us :
Hey , what if this thing could also play MP3s ?
The Mac at this point only really had one MP3 player : MacAMP .
It was very nice and efficient , but , with the exception of the name , not very " Mac " — it even shared the same skins with WinAMP .
We felt in our gut we could take a good crack at this — we might never top MacAMP , but we could do our best .
We suddenly wanted desperately , more than anything else , to be the first truly Mac - like solution for playing MP3s , and , well , we got to work .
Sometimes it was easy going , and sometimes it was significantly less than .
During development , we hit one rather groundbreaking breakthrough : alpha channels .
In other words , the ability for Audion faces to have custom levels of transparency and just look generally amazing .
It had never been done before , and we were very excited to make it happen — so were our users .
To give a little bit of history , long before Mac OS X and Quartz were released , it was generally thought to be completely impossible ( or at least really hard ) in any computer operating system to have a window with a functioning alpha channel .
In other words , while you could easily create a non-square window with transparent parts ( such as a hole cut out from the middle of it ) , it was impossible to have , say , a soft drop - shadow cast off a window — a shadow that gradually blended with the desktop underneath it via different levels of transparency .
It was the not - so - secret dream of interface designers such as myself — particular skin / face designers — to have alpha channeled windows .
Suffice it to say , I pestered Steve about this idea constantly .
" There 's got to be some way ! " I 'd say .
" Doubtful ! " he 'd counter .
I kept this up until one day a breakthrough hit us :
We could fake it !
Suddenly , with this one addition Audion had catapulted in our minds from " average music player " to " something pretty special " .
I began work on SmoothFace , the bundled Audion face which , although it was n't very beautiful , had a drop shadow perfect for demonstrating the new alpha system .
By the time Audion was complete , one thing became painfully clear — Audion had grown larger than the PanicPack itself .
Even though I had worked on a few mockups for ImageFinder , another PanicPack component , we gave up on that fairly quickly .
Audion was now a very full - featured application , very far from our original " cheap and cheerful " blueprint .
If we 'd really wanted to make four apps of this caliber to be a part of a good - value pack , we'd be announcing the release of the PanicPack .. well , right about now .
The PanicPack silently snuck away into history , and Audion 1.0 was finally released on the 16th of August , 1999 .
The Rivalry
If I can back our magical web time machine up a little bit , something unexpected happened while Audion was already well underway .
Steve went down to Apple 's Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose for the first time !
No , that was n't the unexpected part .
But there , between the donuts and the juggling and beards , before one of the sessions began , was some kind of MP3 app displayed on the giant classroom projector — strange visuals swirling to music , for all to see .
The speaker at that particular session mentioned off - handedly that we were looking at an upcoming MP3 player , to be published by the now - defunct Casady & Greene , known for Captain Bumper .
From that moment forward , we had seen the face of our future enemy : SoundJam .
Dun dun dun !
Created by Bill Kincaid and well - known Mac dev Jeff Robbin , SoundJam was released mere weeks before Audion , even though we had both been in simultaneous development for months , unawares .
The feeling of being beat to market by days is an interesting one — imagine being punched in the face by a drunk kangaroo then finding five dollars while lying on the floor , a simultaneously crushing but ultimately inspiring experience .
" That should have been us , " we lamented , " but at least we have some cool stuff they do n't ! "
To be honest , SoundJam turned out to be one of the best things that happened to us — but , believe me , we would n't have said this at the time !
We were quickly determined to ( gently ) beat SoundJam in every possible way , and to make the best product possible .
In some cases , this was easy — design wise , we had the strength of our amazing Faces team and our dedication to clean interface design — but in other ways , not so easy — they already had MP3 encoding , which would require a great deal of our time for us to put together for Audion 2 .
We also felt like every time we added new and innovative features , those exact same features showed up in SoundJam 's next version — but I bet they would say the same thing about us !
In short , having a competitor meant we both pushed ourselves , and the customers truly won .
Here 's but one quick and classic example from the " rivalry files " .
As we mentioned before , Audion had alpha channeled " faces " — and , as a result , became fortunate enough to attract an incredible group of talented artists , eager to push the limits of what Audion could do .
At the same time , the default skins that came with SoundJam were a frequent source of internal Panic chortles , due to our opinions about their , well , less than beautiful appearance , from Azurite to WonderJelly .
It must have eventually became clear to them that they were n't getting anywhere — so we were stunned and surprised to wake up one day and find a new version of SoundJam that suddenly supported Audion faces !
After going through the full 10 stage cycle of anger and acceptance , we soon came to realize that their faces support was fundamentally flawed — the alpha channels themselves , the true jewel in our interface - encrusted crown , were missing !
SoundJam displayed our faces flat and shadowless , with chunks of important bits missing .
So , the fires in our bellies now fully flamed , we created a special pop-up page on our website alerting the now - Face - downloading SoundJam users that , basically , they should be using Audion .
Respek .
Months passed with us hearing nothing from the competition , when eventually SoundJam was updated ... this time with our unique alpha channel system completely implemented in SoundJam as well !
Our Faces now looked and worked fine ... and in the bad program !
Yow .
( Not only that , but , in all honestly , their alpha code was even better than ours ! )
Steve quickly scrambled to improve our technique , and he made it smoother and less jittery , slightly bettering theirs .
But we both had alpha channels , and we both displayed Audion faces .
The Faces War of 2001 had reached a stalemate , but not without some casualties .
And by casualties , I mean , er , overall improvements to both products .
( It was not until much later , when talking to Jeff on the Macworld show floor , that he expressed some pain over our " if you 're using SoundJam " web page .
" In fact , that page , " he admitted , " was the only reason we copied your alpha channel stuff ! " )
There 's lots more probably - only - funny - to - us stuff : the infamous April Fools joke on the face creators , the enigmatic " Is Harpsichord Music " encoding checkbox , and , well , their marketing .
Yow .
Everything was good natured , for the most part , and kept things interesting .
I can only imagine their inside jokes about us ...
At the end of the day ( and only in hindsight ) having SoundJam around was nothing less than fantastic and inspiring for us .
While it was definitely a little stomach - wrenching at times , Jeff , Bill , David , and the other SoundJam guys were sharp coders who pushed Steve and I even further to create even better things : truly , everybody won .
Big In Japan
Here 's a little side story that you might not have known about Audion : it was a huge success in Japan .
Really !
At one point in November , 1999 , Audion sold more copies in Japan than any other software title — Mac or PC !
In fact , overall , Audion sold better in Japan than it did in the USA .
How could something so magical come to pass ?
Credit the smart minds at act2 , a Japanese software distributor .
When we were developing Transmit , Matt Arney , then their American representative , asked us if we were working on anything interesting .
Yes , in fact , we were — an MP3 player .
Matt saw the potential value in the emerging MP3 audio market , and wanted us to bring it over to Japan .
Seeing that Audion was , at the time , missing MP3 encoding functionality , he contacted our friends at Proteron , who made the popular N2MP3 encoding app , to create a bundle .
The team at act2 ( Matt , Kohno , Hasegawa , Marumoto , and of course act2's CEO , Kato - san ) then worked quite hard to put together an awesome final product .
Thus , a new package was born : MacMP3 !
Why call it MacMP3 ?
As I was told , it 's largely believed that American products will sell better in Japan if re-branded to seem a bit more like original domestic Japanese products .
The top Mac products had traditionally been unique , Japan - only products not found elsewhere .
This logic might explain why a deeply - American , but functionally superior product like the Xbox can fail so unbelievably spectacularly in Japan — well , that and the fact that the Xbox is larger than the entire island of Hokkaido .
act2 put together an public marketing campaign for MacMP3 — it was truly awesome seeing advertisements all over — and soon it began appearing in the retail channel , since online distribution is only now taking hold in Japan .
It made its debut at Macworld Expo Japan ( a show I dearly miss ! ) , had its own manga - based manual , and even the " companion girls " seemed to like it !
( Well , I guess they 're paid to . )
We had an incredibly fun time working with act2 and making MacMP3 happen .
It was one of Audion 's more worldly adventures !
Signal From The Mother Ship
I could n't help myself .
I 'd always heard that Steve Jobs , founder and CEO of Apple , actually reads his e-mail .
When you 're a tiny independent Mac software developer , that 's about as tempting a proposal as , say , a young surgeon being able to directly e-mail Surgeon General C. Everett Koop .
Okay , so he's not the surgeon general anymore , but my point is that when you 're down in the trenches — writing software for a platform you pretty much completely worship — well , it 's pretty hard to resist e-mailing God if you know He checks his e-mail .
So e-mail I did .
When Audion 1.0 came out on August 16th , 1999 , I wrote an e-mail to Mr. Jobs a few days later .
It was very quick , cordial , and to the point ( my own bursting e-mail box has taught me to be succinct ) .
It pitched Audion in a few short sentences , and encouraged him to download it .
That was it .
I received no response , but I did n't expect one .
I liked to imagine he'd read it and downloaded and tried Audion , sharing it with his co-workers and family and barber , but I figured it was more likely my message just printed directly into his office trashcan .
Then , an interesting thing happened .
On September 3rd , a few weeks after my e-mail , I got an e-mail from Charles Wiltgen , then the QuickTime Technology Manager at Apple Worldwide Developer Relations .
" I 'd like to talk Audion future directions , " he said .
Well , that 's interesting , we thought .
We talked briefly on the phone , and he seemed interested in setting up a meeting with us to talk about everything Audion .
We did n't know why or how , but we were definitely excited .
Before the meeting took place , though , something else interesting happened ...
The AOL Adventure
Our frantic work on Audion had continued unabated since the release of 1.0 .
1.0.1 was released a few weeks after 1.0 , then , of course , came 1.2 in November .
Finally , on February 22nd , 2000 , we updated Audion to version 1.5 .
This version was a huge one for us with many firsts — it added the much - requested hierarchical playlists , automatic playlist organization based on ID3 tags , the hilarious and surprisingly effective Karaoke mode , the Alarm Clock , a perennial dorm room favorite , and much more .
In short , we had yet again passed the competition — for a few seconds , anyway — and we were feeling good about where Audion was , while simultaneously feeling restless about where Audion was going .
The competition continued to drive us , maybe a little bit too much .
We felt we needed something more to , you know , " win " .
We could n't shake the feeling that we were locked in an infinite cycle — simultaneously incredibly fun and tedious — of always releasing competing updates with SoundJam , always scrapping for the hearts and minds of our fellow Mac users , until somebody takes things up to the next level , and dominates strategically , like some kind of super - nerdy software development board game .
Basically , we wanted to be the hippo that eats the most marbles ( without breaking ) .
We wanted to give our customers and fans everything , to be the best .
Yeah , we were getting a little manic .
And then , out of the blue , AOL came calling .
Let me explain .
As the story apparently goes , this dude named Justin Frankel was but a lad — 19 years old — when he and his friend Tom Pepper created a little program called WINAMP .
It played MP3s , involved llamas , and pretty much kickstarted the entire MP3 revolution , without which Audion never would have existed , much to Justin 's credit .
One day , after much success , AOL , who probably smelled the potential riches of a music revolution from a great distance ( over the acrid smell of their 15,000 CD - ROM production plants in Bangalore ( which , coincidentally , are staffed by minotaurs ) ) , swooped in and snapped up Justin and Tom , as well as an internet radio company called Spinner .
Thus , Spinner / Nullsoft became " An AOL Company " , moved to a quite nice warehouse in San Francisco , and Justin Frankel found himself with — at least a nice slice of — $ 86 .
Million .
Dollars .
Justin , dear readers , had ridden the Late 90's Magic Monorail of Money , and theoretically came out a winner .
Soon after , as I understand it , Nullsoft found themselves with a new leader and guiding light : Rob Lord .
Rob had previously created IUMA , the first big online independent music archive , sometime around the appearance of pteranodons in Internet time .
Eventually , Rob Lord came to us somewhat out of the blue with a proposition : Nullsoft already dominated on Windows with WINAMP .
But they did n't have a Mac solution , and they all loved Macs , and they wanted to own the Mac MP3 market as well .
Could we help ?
Great question .
We got to thinking pretty quick .
On one hand , we 'd have to work for AOL .
Now ,
If I were to free - associate " perfect partner for a small independent software company " , you 'd immediately think AOL , would n't you ?
Right .
And we certainly could n't stay in Portland , which would be difficult .
Would we want to give up Panic , this thing we 've built up with our own four hands , to become something else ?
On the other hand , there would be giant money hats .
And while that would undoubtedly be nice , you 'll have to believe me when I say that potential riches genuinely paled in comparison to the true , tempting , mouth - watering , chop - licking potential from such a partnership : if AOL bought Audion , we would make Audion totally free , even with encoding , and if Audion was free , we 'd win !
Everyone would use our program !
Nobody would use anything else !
Nothing can compete with free !
Not even foreshadowing !
The emails were flowing fast and furious .
" Certainly one way to bury SoundJam would be to have the power of AOL / Time Warner / etc. behind us .
But is it the best way ?
I would say : ONLY if we can remain ' Panic ' , not become [ something else ] . "
- E-mail from me to Steven Frank , 4/4/2000
" If you need help knowing what to produce , we have people here who will help you put it all together .
The more we can wrap our minds around your business , the faster the golden check can be signed . "
- Email from Rob Lord , 4/4/2000 Mmmm ... golden check .
Panic : an AOL company .
Panic / Nullsoft ?
Probably just Nullsoft .
How much ?
Get our balance sheets in order .. consult the lawyer .
Fly to San Francisco .
Get lunch at TGI Friday 's with Tom Pepper and Justin Frankel .
Talk about our predictions for the upcoming Macworld Expo .
Pester Steven Blumenfeld , Spinner 's CTO , for some action .
He 's talking to Fred about it .
Try to put a price on Panic .
Man , who the hell knows what we 're worth .
It 's just us two , and it 's honestly probably not worth much .
But hey , Audion will be free !
We 'll be able to pay those blasted Fraunhofer MP3 encoding patent licensing fees !
This could rock !
Ultimately , it did n't .
The deal fizzled quicker than a Pop - Rock in Little Mikey 's mouth .
Reality set in for us , and a lack of motion on the AOL side made us realize something important : this probably was n't meant to be .
We eventually gave up .
Why ?
Two reasons : First , our guts told us that our hobbies and our creative freedoms would be severely hampered if owned by AOL — that there would be no way Panic could remain Panic , as much as we'd want it to .
In hindsight , this was perhaps our most accurate judgment call — in late 2003 Justin Frankel left Nullsoft , his very own company , after having a number of his projects , such as Gnutella , terminated by AOL without warning .
( AOL , of course , has to answer to the TimeWarners of the world , corporate partners who might not appreciate , say , an unstoppable peer - to - peer file sharing network . )
Gnutella needed to be made , and we 're very glad Justin made it , but AOL was n't so much .
Tom Pepper , the other great half of early Nullsoft , also recently departed .
The lesson ?
It seems you can either be free to do anything you want , to create anything you dream of without answering to anyone , or you can be rich .
You 're not likely to be both .
Second , during the peak of excitement over our potential deal , Rob Lord — the man who shepherded the idea in the first place — left Nullsoft .
( He went to muse .net , which was acquired by Yahoo ! , and is now working on Popcast . )
What happens when your cheerleader quits on you ?
You get a much less responsive crowd , that 's what .
Or you get dropped .
Something like that .
From that moment forward , it seemed like the AOL management side grew unnervingly quiet .
Did we make the right decision ?
I truly think we 're better off , and then some .
We 're still around , we 've grown a lot , we 're quite happy , we have freedoms , and although we may not be rich — at all — at least we did n't have to quit our own company , right ?
I always believe that things happen for a reason , and if they had happened towards AOL town , I probably would n't even be allowed to write this .
( Because I 'd be on a beach , in a Ferrari , drinking lear jets .
Crap . )
Steve Gedikian , the last of the remaining original Nullsofties to stay on board , summed the situation up nicely — his first - hand knowledge makes for required reading for anyone on the brink of a sellout .
( Steve has since left Nullsoft as well — interestingly and perhaps ironically , he 's now on the iTunes team . )
My only regret ?
I 'm sad that Audion never got that chance to be free back then — to really dominate , and be in the hands of every Mac user , even if they could n't afford it .
Crossed Apples
There 's an interesting coda to the AOL story , though .
During the midst of the heated negotiations , Apple popped up again .
This time they were finally ready to meet with us , sometime in June 2000 , regarding " the future direction of Audion " .
We were also eager to hear what they had to say .
After seeing the latest and greatest build of Mac OS X at Macworld New York , we spotted the first clue that Apple was becoming more serious about MP3 playback by creating the bare - bones but quite nice - looking Music Player .
This made us all the more curious about why they wanted to talk to us .
The meeting fully booked with Apple , I contacted the AOL executives — whom we were still deep in negotiations with — so they could be involved .
It only seemed fair ; they came to us first , and maybe this Apple meeting would make them want to snatch us up all the quicker .
Except , their schedules were booked .
They could n't make it — at all .
Those crazy business people , I tell you !
All those Palm Pilots and not a pixel of free time on the calendaring screen .
Thus , I had to cancel the meeting with Apple .
AOL could n't make it , I said .
Maybe we can reschedule ?
The meeting with Apple never took place .
Hmm ..
I wonder what it was all about ?
Audion 2.0
While all of these extra-codal affairs were taking place , Steve and I continued to work hard on the next major release of Audion , distractions be damned .
This time , we were determined to correct Audion 's missing pieces , and also invent some great ideas of our own .
With fast , fully - licensed MP3 encoding ( finally ! ) , toolbars , RIO / Nomad device support , CD burning , linked playlists , a waveform - based MP3 editor , DJ crossfading , cover art , popularity ratings and song play counts , face hue shifting , and more , this release was literally bursting at the seams with awesome !
Besides , if it was n't for Audion 2 and the new " Speed " effect plugin , we never would have heard the mind - shattering , ear - haunting experience of what the Chipmunks really sounded like .
On December 18th , 2000 , we finally released Audion 2 .
It 's hard to express what a tremendous hit it was for us — downloads and registrations were record in number , building rapidly with each month .
People seemed to really love it .
In all honesty , we 'd never experienced anything like it .
The Big E - Mail
Backing up ever - so - slightly again , while Audion 2 was nearing release , I began to hear some curious rumbles .
( No jokes . )
My various friends in the Mac software industry told me that something was going on with SoundJam , that it may be slowly disappearing from stores .
In a moment of hilarious amateur - hour corporate espionage , I called the Casady & Greene offices to ask if " buying SoundJam right now was , you know , a good idea " , or something equally bumbling .
Interestingly , I detected a distinctive wobble of concern in the kind support person 's response that , you know , uh , it 'll be supported in the future , if nothing else .
Suffice it to say , we were more than a little curious .
Weirder still , all rumors pointed back to Apple .
Desperate for information , I sent a quick e-mail to Phil Schiller , Apple Senior Vice President of Worldwide Product Marketing , since he had at some point become a registered user of Audion , much to our excitement !
He had also been one of the people interested in meeting with us back in June .
Besides ,
Phil always struck us as very cool , quite sharp , and really in - tune with third party development .
However , true to his training , Phil declined to divulge any information about what might be brewing over in Cupertino .
Understanding ( but anxious ) , I agreed to wait and see what happened .
I also mentioned to Phil in passing that the AOL deal was no more .
Then , as soon as Audion 2 was released , I took part in my own , personal " E - Mail Steve " ritual , sending him a brief missive on Audion 2 and encouraging him to check it out .
Again , I imagined the printer feeding directly into the shredder , but it still felt good .
Then , a few days later — on Christmas eve , no less — it hit .
The S - bomb .

Subject : RE : Audion 2 : have you had a chance to see it yet ?
Cabel , I hear that your deal with AOL fell through .
Any interest in throwing in with us at Apple ?
Best , Steve Whoah .
That 's Steve .. as in .. Jobs .
Steve Jobs .
Steven .
P. Jobs .
The guy .. who did the thing .. with the Apples and ... in my INBOX ..
Wozniak .. whoah .
And he wants to know if WE are interested in throwing in with THEM ?
The guy who we basically owe our entire professional existence to , who basically created the very platform we want to hug , the computers we want to crush into little pure plump pieces of joy ?
As the kids say , upon seeing some awesome frags and / or gibs : OMFG .
I jumped up from my chair and literally yelled at Steven ( Frank ) , who was , of course , sleeping .
( Not that Steve was sleeping on the job ; rather , it was a weekend .
And on the weekends Steve tends to sleep in until right around the time the apocalypse hits . )
I pounded on his bedroom door for a few minutes , freaking the hell out .
He groggily arose and , equally stunned , sat down to try to parse the stomach - crunching bundle of ASCII sitting on my screen .
It may sound a bit overdramatic , but for two guys making shareware , this was a big , big thing .
At first we thought it might have been a cruel joke .
Then we noticed it was sent from someone using NeXT Mailer !
( This was before Mac OS X was complete , and we figured Steve did n't particularly love Mac OS 9 . )
" Well , it 's definitely real , " we agreed , trying to be calm .
" But what does it mean ? " I cautiously wrote Jobs back , and we set up a tentative meeting time — sometime during Macworld Expo 2001 , in a few weeks .
We were thrilled to say the least .
So much so , we had almost forgotten about the fact that the answer to our SoundJam mystery was about to unfold , right before our eyes , in one week .
Say Hello to iTunes
" Well .
Huh .
Wow . "
That 's pretty much the distilled , non-profane version of our reaction to seeing iTunes .
Steven , myself , and my friend Alexis Croft sat close together during the Macworld Expo in January , 2001 , truly on tenterhooks — we had heard the rumors , and we were almost afraid at what was about to unfold .
When it was time to show iTunes , I sunk a little bit lower in my chair .
When the interface was shown , I quickly studied every pixel .
When Steve Jobs made it seem a bit like they invented visualizers —
" We thought , would n't it be cool if you could SEE your MUSIC ?
Well , we did just that " — we chuckled a little bit .
And as each feature was revealed , we looked at each other , trying to fully grasp what we were up against .
On one hand , it was far , far simpler than Audion — no MP3 editing , no faces , no playcount , no rating , no hierarchical playlists .
But on the other hand , it 's really not that bad — that interface is awfully smart — and , oh crap , it 's free .
Of course it had to be free .
iTunes was , of course , and I 'll say this now , brilliant .
It single - handedly taught us an entirely new philosophy on software design .
Do you really need that Preference that 1 % of your users will use ?
Can you find a better way to design that interface than having each function in a separate window ?
Can you clean this up , even if it means it 's a little less flexible ?
iTunes blazed the trail for clean , efficient software design for a broad audience , a design philosophy we practice actively today .
It was a way to take a complicated digital music collection , and make it easy .
Sure , it was limited , but man was it easy .
We put on a brave face about the free .
" It 'll be just like Starbucks ! " , we figured .
" All those little coffee shops , they benefit from the fact that Starbucks has made coffee more popular , introduced fancy Ethiopian Yirgacheffe to Joe Black .
Similarly , iTunes will just make MP3 music more popular , and when a person outgrows the basic interface of iTunes , they 'll come to us , buy Audion , and we 'll reap the benefits ! "
Well , except it was n't really true .
It would be true — in fact , we still think there 's a lot to be said for that , and a market for that " pro iTunes " program — except for the fact that , you know , Starbucks coffee is n't completely free .
That makes things a bit trickier .
But , first things first .
Now that iTunes is out , why the heck did Apple want to meet ?
Show Floor Flurry
The first time I talked with Steve Jobs was rather intense .
Not necessarily because I was nervous , or he was angry , or anything like that , but because we talked in the middle of the Macworld Expo show floor , surrounded by a throng of lookers - on , being laser - beamed suspiciously by PR people .
Mere hours after iTunes was introduced to the world , with our official meeting at Apple campus only days away , Steven Frank and I were browsing the show floor .
" Hey , look , there 's Jobs , " Steve said while pointing to a large , amoeba - like blob of shuffling black t- shirts .
" Oh , man .. I gotta talk to him , " I declared .
I have no idea why — it was like I was being pushed an unseen force .
Mind you , I 'm a person that loves to talk to people , but even I do n't generally go rushing into things like , you know , trying to talk to the CEO of Apple in the middle of madness .
But , talk I did , making my way into the show - floor throng and anxiously saying hello .
We talked briefly and , looking back , it was rather fun .
" Hi Steve , it 's Cabel , from Panic . "
" Oh , hey Cabel !
Nice to meet you .
So tell me , what 'd you think of iTunes ? "
" Well , I think it looks great !
You guys have done a great job with it .
But , you know , I still feel we 'll do all - right with Audion . "
" Oh , really ?
That 's interesting , because honestly ?
I do n't think you guys have a chance . "
Ah ha !
Some of that famous Jobs magic I 'd heard about !
Fortunately , it came across more like a teasing jab than a cruel stab — to be honest , I rather enjoyed his honesty , it got me in a weird sort of " I 'm ready to step to that , girlfriend ! " mood .
" Well , Steve , I really think it 'll still find an audience , " I replied .
" We 've got a lot of higher - end features that you guys probably wo n't ever add . "
" Yeah ?
Like what ? "
" Well , umm . . "
I was a bit stumped .
" You can keep a count of how many times you 've played a song , or you can even rate your songs by popularity ... " " ... why the hell would anybody want to do that ? "
" Well , maybe you want to sort your playlist by your favorite songs ... " " ... you 've got to understand , this is just 1.0 , of course .
You can only imagine where we 'll be by the time we release 2.0 ! "
( He was , of course , right .
We never could have imagined , for example , the iTunes Music Store ... )
" Yeah , I 'm sure you guys will do great things , " I encouraged .
" Anyway , I do n't mean to take up your time here , I just wanted to say hello . "
" Sure thing .
Good talking to you , I look forward to our meeting later this week ! "
Phew .
The next version of iTunes did n't come out for nearly a year and , ironically , included both playcounts and song popularity ratings !
But , now I was truly ready for our meeting — I 'd survived , no , I 'd actually enjoyed talking to Steve , and I could n't wait to find out what he had in mind .
The Short But Intense Meeting
A few days later , after a round of furious scheduling and re-scheduling with an Apple administrative assistant , Steve Frank and I found ourselves on the MetroLink train , destined for 1 Infinite Loop , Cupertino .
I do n't remember too much about the day ; we stopped at a Thai restaurant for lunch that seemed to be filled with only engineers , I ate some spicy curry that I wish I had n't , we killed time by wandering around and visiting the live auction site of a dead - dotcom ( Aeron chairs by the buckets ! ) , and we eventually walked over to Apple Campus , and sat down in the lobby — probably nervous , probably also excited .
We were called into the meeting , and one of the first people who greeted us was Jeffrey Robbin — our old arch - nemesis !
Yipes !
Up until this point there had been no actual public confirmation that iTunes was , in fact , SoundJam reborn , so it was a bit of a case - closer to see him there .
It was also very nice to see him in a situation where , at last , the competition was over .
( Of course , now it 's public knowledge that SoundJam became iTunes . )
Phil started the meeting with an interesting bit of info : " You guys remember the last time we tried to meet with you ?
It was actually because we wanted you guys to make iTunes , " explained Phil .
Oh .
So that 's what that never - happened early meeting was going to be about .
Since we never met up because we were tangled with AOL , Apple turned to their next choice , SoundJam , and the rest was , well , history .
Another one of those amazing " life junctions " you 'll always wonder about — what if we had made iTunes ?
Would we be happy ?
Would we be having as much fun ?
Would we be , er , rich ?
Anyway , a few moments later , Steve Jobs himself entered the giant Apple boardroom , threw his feet up on the table , and got to the meat of the matter .
To be honest , my memory is a bit compressed here , as the whole experience was nothing less than surreal and difficult to process .
To find ourselves — just two nerdy guys who make Mac shareware — sitting on Apple Campus , in a meeting with all of these brilliant bigwigs , pretty much caused our heads to continually and rapidly explode , humbled to say the least .
Jobs wanted to know how big we were , and how long we 've been doing this .
He wanted to know a few more things that I can't even really remember .
I remember he asked , " Do you have any other ideas for apps you want to work on ? "
I replied , genuinely , " Well , we 've got an idea for a digital photo management program ... " and he replied with a simple , " Yeah .
Do n't do that one . "
Everyone in the room laughed but I had no idea why — remember , my head was still exploding — so Steven Frank had to explain to me that he meant , basically , it was already being made and , of course , it would be called iPhoto .
Oh .
I get it now .
We also seem to remember Jobs painted us a vibrant ( but genuinely honest ) picture of how he viewed Audion fairing against iTunes : " It 's like you guys are a little push - cart going down the railroad tracks , and we 're a giant steam engine about to run you down . "
Jeff Robbin then asked us a funny question that had obviously been percolating for a while : " Does Audion do any kind of special filtering ? "
You see , since the beginning of time , press reviews in magazines , websites , etc. , had consistently said that Audion simply sounds " better " than SoundJam , without question .
It was n't until that declaration showed up in a very respectable , high - end British Hi-Fi magazine that people started to take it even more seriously .
Audion was always noted for being " richer " or " sweeter " , and we were tremendously proud of our incredible results in this regard .
The only problem was : we did n't do anything .
We have no idea why people heard Audion as sounding better .
We certainly did n't add any special filtering or " sound better " code .
Our MP3 decoding process was about as ordinary as you could get .
On paper , logically , there should have been absolutely no reason why Audion would sound any better or worse than SoundJam .
We put Jeff 's mind at final , restful ease by blowing the big secret that , no , we also had no idea where that was coming from , but we definitely were n't about to argue .
Who knows , maybe we did write some " sound better " code in a drunken haze — we 're afraid to check !
Anyway , when it came time to conclude the point of the meeting , Jobs summed everything up in a very persuasive and powerful way : " We want you guys to work with us .
You guys have shown us that you can do a lot with a little .
You guys kick ass .
Your software totally kicks ass .
Cabel , your marketing kicks ass .
We think you do incredible work and we'd love to have you join us . "
Wow. * brain explode * .
And that was , pretty much , that — Jobs left the room , having spent with us a very memorable 15 minutes , and we finished discussions with the rest of the team .
Humorously , we still had no idea why they wanted us to join up — somehow I managed to forget asking this relatively important question during the meeting .
Decision
So , this is the point in the story where I 'm supposed to tell you that we agonized for months ; that we'd been given an opportunity to join the very team that inspires us , to be a part of the machine that makes the machines we love , and that we were so tempted and confused at what to do that we did n't sleep , became alcoholics , rolled around on the ground , etc .
Weirdly , though , it did n't work out that way .
In fact , I 'd say that almost 5 minutes after the meeting Steve and I knew in our hearts that it was n't time — that we did n't want to join Apple ( yet ) .
We maybe went through the motions of " deciding " on the flight back home , but I think we knew the truth .
And the truth went something like this : " This is our only chance to do Panic .
We do n't have kids , we 're not married , we do n't have huge obligations .
We did n't invest our life savings into it , just a few hundred dollars .
We do n't even have life savings .
We probably wo n't get this opportunity again in our lifetime — the full chance to take a complete risk , to experiment , quit our day jobs , start a business that certainly may fail , put our hearts into the soul of it , and try to make it fly — making the best possible Macintosh software we can without the threat of mortgages or the cost of braces or kids wondering why we 're never home .
And while there may be a time in our life where we crave some stability , or there may be a time in our life when things do n't work out with Panic and we return to be a player in a larger , awesome team like Apple , that time is certainly not now .
Panic 's time is . "
( For best effect , play The Star Spangled Banner while reading that paragraph . )
In seriousness , the offer at Apple was flattering , amazing , and mind - blowing .
Having Steve Jobs personally praise our work was a tremendous boost to our confidence as a company , and cause for exploding heads .
And really , maybe that time will come when we do want to work for a stable outfit like Apple .
But if we were ever going to Panic , now was the time .
So that 's what we 've done ever since .
And , you know what ?
We could n't be happier .
Audion 3 , meet iPod
Returning to Portland in February , 2001 , our meeting with Apple ( and the launch of iTunes ) caused us to unintentionally cross a major commitment line : we were going to do this Panic thing for real .
It was time to move out of the apartment .
It was time to hire some employees .
It was time to get bigger — slowly and carefully , mind you — and see what we could do .
We hired a couple new employees , and Wade — our fifth , after Ian and Dave — immediately got to work on Audion 3 , as well as a few new projects .
Wade and his ( identical twin ) brother Will had previously made an awesome freeware Audion Control Strip module on their own .
( Later , they also wrote an Audion Dockling for Mac OS X ) .
We really liked both of these Audion accessories , and figured Wade would be the right man for the Audion 3 job .
He moved to Portland and began to crank out additional code in no time flat .
Then , 10 months after our fateful meeting with Jobs in October , 2001 , the iPod hit the streets .
Suddenly Apple 's investment into the music scene became much clearer .
And even if the Internet crowd did n't see it — heck , even we had a hard time seeing it —
Apple certainly knew where they were headed .
( We 'll always wonder : did Apple want us to be a part of the iPod team ?
Is that what the big meeting was about ?
We 'll never know ... )
Quickly , we realized we had to add iPod support to Audion .
Unfortunately , that was n't looking very easy — the iPod storage database was complex and undocumented .
Dave , who had been working hard on a since - shelved Panic product code - named " Ripcord " ( that I still want ! ) , took a few weeks out of his development schedule to look at the problem .
Fortunately , being the master of unlocking , Dave managed to completely clean - room reverse - engineer the iPod 's database storage format , allowing us to add iPod support to Audion 3 in a jiffy .
But we always felt a little uncomfortable about it — it worked , but for how much longer ?
What if Apple changes the format ?
We wo n't know , and we 'll always have to stay on top and reverse - engineer the changes ... it made us a little nervous about the future of Audion , to say the least .
Regardless , Audion 3 came out on July 14th , 2002 , and in addition to iPod support , it also added mp3PRO encoding and playback , broadcasting , recording , a batch encoder , a sleep timer , and more .
It was a solid update — and the iPod support was quite welcomed — but it quickly became clear that , even despite adding new features and actually advertising , Audion faced trouble .
Whither Audion 4
With Audion 3 out in the wild , we faced a bit of a dilemma .
Without question , sales were down since the release of iTunes .
Plus , to be honest , we were a bit burnt out , and ready to work on something new .
Finally , the greater question remained : how many people are going to choose Audion in the future ?
Why would you choose Audion over iTunes ?
While we continued to sort out this question , we began work on bits and pieces of Audion 4 .
We started , of course , with some interface mockups , the goal being to bring the best of iTunes in with the best of Audion .
Wade and I also cooked up an entirely new format for Audion faces , one that was much more modern and efficient and easier to work with .
Making faces was now as easy as dropping simple individual graphics into a bundle ( folder ) instead of editing a super - crusty , Mac OS 9 - esque resource fork .
We also added the ability for Audion faces to have slide - out drawers that could contain additional controls , like live sliders for quickly skipping through tracks .
We even got as far as writing a test app to develop faces under this new system ( download it : .zip , 655k ) .
At the same time , design geniuses like Jake Rodkin started dreaming up new ideas ( and funny ideas ) to take advantage of the new Face format .
Paul Johnson , uber interface designer and tireless Audion cheerleader to whom we owe very much , began to work on many potential designs for a new SmoothFace that would ship with Audion 4 .
All the while , Steve and I spent a lot of time thinking " strategically " : how can we do this ?
We quickly realized that Audion , the player / encoder as we know it , ca n't cost money .
So , we brainstormed : what if we made Audion free ( so 2000 ! ) , and then created some supporting apps — a dedicated streaming / recorder , maybe a full - featured sound editor — that cost money ?
The free thing will get the user in our sandbox , and the rest of the apps will bring in the bacon !
This idea seemed great until we realized now that we'd be writing three full applications instead of just one — on top of our already crowded slate of products and updates .
It just was n't possible .
We continued to search for the right answer .
Maybe it 's time , we thought , to do something we 've never done with an app before ...
Retirement So , Audion , the application , is officially retired .
Now , when most software companies retire applications , they do it in the easiest way possible : they completely remove it from the market , pull all the downloads links , notify their customers , and move on with their lives .
We can't help but feel in our gut that , even if that 's what you 're supposed to do , it 's a harsh and , ultimately , drastic way to handle it .
We 've really been searching our brains , trying to find the best way to handle this , so that we can move on , but still express our appreciation to everyone who supported us .
Thus , the good news : we 're making Audion completely free !
That 's right — cash is no longer necessary to use what 's still an incredibly full - featured MP3 player / encoder .
Yes , we 'll continue to make it available for download !
And we 'll provide help to customers who have purchased for as long as we reasonably can .
The less - than - good news : Audion is no longer under active development .
There wo n't be any updates in the future , as Audion is now retired — sitting comfortably under a sun shade somewhere , sipping a delectable mint julep , and complaining about the lack of senior discounts at the local Arby 's .
What about people who bought Audion ?
For sure , we 're most nervous about this group — they supported us and helped Panic become Panic , and we absolutely do n't want to make anybody unhappy .
At the same time , the Audion they bought will continue to function just fine .
But we 've decided to send out a special offer via e-mail to people who bought Audion , much to our accountant 's chagrin .
With any luck , the ( admittedly small ) gesture will let our supporters know that we , truly , appreciate them .
So , I 'm sure you 're asking yourself : why retire it ?
While the simple answer is " iTunes " , there 's a bit more to it than that .
Reason # 1 : Technically Keeping Up With iTunes Is Increasingly Difficult
When the iPod came out , we spent a great deal of time reverse engineering the storage format so we could support it within Audion .
However , that leaves us in the vulnerable position of having to play catch - up — what if Apple changes the format to be vastly different , or more secure , in a future iPod ?
We 'd constantly be playing the reverse engineering game , and it can only get harder .
For Audion to be a worthy replacement for iTunes , we also need to add support for streaming to the Airport Express .
But streams to the Airport Express are encrypted using a cryptographic key that we do n't have access to — only Apple does .
While we could , obviously , start a low - level " hacking " effort to fix this , the key would likely only change , leaving us in the difficult position of being literally unable to support Airport Express within Audion .
Even more important is the massive issue of M4P files — the very AAC audio files you purchase from the iTunes Music Store .
M4P files are encrypted using a proprietary Apple system , so we simply can't open the files and decode them like we do with MP3 files .
And while Quicktime does give third party apps limited M4P playback support ( QuickTime does the decoding and playback itself ) , there 's no public method that allows apps like Audion to get access to the raw audio stream .
Unfortunately , Audion needs the raw audio stream — the entire playback engine is built around it , and things like effects plug - ins can't work without having a raw audio to work with .
Again , we could try to hack around it , and remove the protection from M4P files , but we'd be playing a constant game of cat and mouse .
Thus , if you buy a song from the iTunes Music Store , you can't play it in Audion — not now , and probably not in the future .
In short , there are good features in iTunes that , unlike the good old days , we physically can't add to Audion , for ( reasonable ) Apple security reasons .
Why would anyone use Audion when iTunes can do so much more out - of - the - box ?
Reason # 2 : Flagging Sales Audion had its day in the sun .
Audion 2 was a huge hit ( as far as shareware goes ) both in America and in Japan .
But , when you find yourself competing against something free , and you 're unable to make your product free , you face a monumental challenge , particularly if your core audience consists of casual users for whom the right answer is not necessarily " more features " .
Reason # 3 : iTunes is , you know , actually pretty awesome
The most important point , we think .
It is n't just that iTunes is free .
It 's also damned impressive , and getting better by the day .
Sure , it 's inflexible , and it could do more .
But Apple has done things with iTunes that we would have never , ever been able to do with Audion — things we could n't even have imagined .
The Music Store is nothing short of amazing .
The iPod has changed music .
( And Party Shuffle was really clever , I thought . )
You see , Audion is not just going up against a free product that 's mediocre , leaving a lot of room for potential switchers ( think Internet Explorer on Windows and the emergence of Firefox ) , but Audion is instead competing with a product that , you know , we actually use ourselves .
When you double click the competition in the morning , that 's a pretty good sign that it 's time to hang up your hat !
Consider these three points and hopefully you can understand our decision was relatively clear cut : we can take our Audion energy and channel it into other software that will fully allows us to kick ass again , on a level playing field !
Now , before we move on , there 's one thing I must make clear : we 're not whining or complaining !
Really .
Do n't feel bad for us !
We do n't feel like our business was unfairly crushed by the man even if , in some ways , it kind of was .
This business is rough , and all about rolling with the punches .
If it was n't Apple who made iTunes , it would have been someone else — we just needed to adapt , and focus our energy elsewhere .
Also , let 's be honest : if we could have , we would have done the crushing ourselves !
We 're also very lucky in that Apple offered us an number of incredible opportunities — from giving us the chance to be the guys who made iTunes to lord knows what else — and we 're eternally grateful , even if we chose the independent road over the Apple one .
In other words , they did n't leave us high and dry .
Finally , there 's the most important fact of all : our company is , thanks to the kind and wonderful support of Macintosh users worldwide , still hanging in there !
( Thank God for Transmit ! )
Now , if Apple releases iFTP , then you can feel bad for us .
Conclusion
by Miguel de Icaza
Thanks to everyone that sent their comments and questions , there are a few questions that I would like to answer that have been a common theme .
These are my personal opinions , and do not represent in any way Novell 's official position ( its at the end of every page on my blog , but I figured its worth pointing out up front ) .
Q : Which Patents Does Mono Infringe ?
I do not know of any patents which Mono infringes .
Although Novell provides most of the work to develop Mono , Mono is still a community project with many constituents and collaborators from companies , universities , governments and individuals , and as such we will continue to work and operate as a community project .
This means that we will continue to follow the rules that we have set for ourselves when it comes to patents :
The Mono strategy for dealing with these technologies is as follows : ( 1 ) work around the patent by using a different implementation technique that retains the API , but changes the mechanism ; if that is not possible , we would ( 2 ) remove the pieces of code that were covered by those patents , and also ( 3 ) find prior art that would render the patent useless .
This is what we would have done before the agreement , and that is what we will continue to do .
Not providing a patented capability would weaken the interoperability , but it would still provide the free software / open source software community with good development tools , which is the primary reason for developing Mono .
There is more information on the web site on the above link .
We will continue to develop Mono under the same restrictions that we had before the agreement .
Q : Is it now possible to integrate code that uses Microsoft patents today ?
Although it is possible , we will not integrate such code , as Mono is a community project .
And we will also continue to keep the Microsoft and Mono stacks separated , as there is no need to add dependencies between them and also makes it easy to split out all the non-ECMA components of Mono out .
Why did you guys work this deal with Microsoft ?
Although I did not take part of the actual negotiations , and was only told about this deal less than a week before the announcement , I had been calling for a long time for a collaboration between Microsoft and Open Source and Microsoft and Novell .
There are numerous interviews that touch on this topic and most recently my interview in Microsoft's Port25
In the past I had called for this same kind of cooperation with other companies .
In 1999 , we started talking to Sun and HP regarding GNOME ;
In particular in 2000 we had a meeting with Marco Boerries at Sun to discuss the desktop , and their adoption of GNOME as their new desktop .
At that time we discussed the plans to have a combined desktop made up of components of StarOffice and GNOME ( at that meeting , I conceded that I would no longer work on Gnumeric , and instead we would improve OpenOffice ; Sun conceded that Evolution would be their default mailer instead of the StarOffice one ) .
Have you not learned from history ?
Microsoft has damaged all of their partners in the past !
I have gotten a few emails along those lines and folks asking for comment , and a lot of hate mail ( more than usual ) .
I find it hard to reply to this comment , because this is really going to come down to personal opinions and personal biases .
In my personal opinion , I think that we have to give it the benefit of the doubt , try to turn the hand that has been dealt into the best possible outcome for everyone .
Or as Benjamin Zander would say , I will give them an A , and work from there .
Similar deals have been done in the past , in 1997 Microsoft signed a similar deal with Apple , and Apple used that agreement and the incoming monies to turn the company around .
Sun signed a similar agreement with Microsoft in 2004 , which at the time I realized enabled Sun to ship Mono on Solaris ( which we already supported at that time ) .
Now , I can not say that the crowd applauded Apple and Sun at the time , and both of them ship a lot of GPL code , not the Linux kernel , but a lot of GPL code , and the sky has yet to fall on our heads .
Back in April of 2004 , I wrote about that deal :
I am counting the minutes for Sun to ship our Mono implementation for Solaris .
Maybe we can still make it to the Solaris 10 release .
Just picture the benefits , out of the box free C# compiler on Solaris SPARC and Solaris Intel .
Out of the box ASP .
NET and ADO.NET on SPARC , and the Gtk# bindings for writing applications for the Java Desktop System .
Not to mention that they get the industry 's most sexy JIT compiler for free .
I am walking with an extra cell phone battery in case McNealy or Schwartz decide to call me up over the weekend to discuss potential agreements ( if I do n't pick up , please leave a message , the wonders of ATT wireless ) .
Am afraid to report that neither Scott nor Jonathan emailed me or left a voice mail at the time .
I think it would have been grand for Sun , but maybe Java emotions were too strong inside the company for this to be even considered .
Could a better deal been struck for the Open Source community ?
Possibly .
But I do not know what the latitude was inside the deal .
What I can personally say is that considering that Microsoft is 100 times larger than Novell ( market cap wise alone ) it was probably difficult .
Getting rid of patents completely would probably have to involve a few giants .
Microsoft has a 282B market cap , so maybe a combination of IBM ( 138B ) , Google ( 143B ) , Oracle ( 92B ) and even Sun ( 18B ) would have to come together and enter a gigantic patent love - fest to make a better deal for everyone happen ( By comparison Novell is at 2.2B ) .
And this is why I find it surprising that Sun's Simon Phipps had forgotten that Sun entered a similar agreement a few years ago , and had this to say about the Microsoft / Novell deal :
It 's a remarkable reversal of opportunity , all the more remarkable that the Novell participants smiled the whole way through what had clearly become a Microsoft event .
They went in seeking a huge payout , and emerged with the payout , yes - but also with a commitment to pay it back in royalties on open source software they sell .
A larger opportunity could probably happen with a setup like the one I described previously .
But whether this could actually be done , is left as an exercise to the reader ( or alternative approaches that would completely eradicate software patents from the map ) .
Let me point out that McNeily seemed to be all smiles at the equivalent event a few years ago ; Nothing bad about that , but Simon probably should notice that Sun is eight times larger than Novell , and if anything , his company is 8.18 in a better position that Novell is to take advantage of these opportunities .
It seems that Larry Summers , a timid man mysteriously president of Harvard , has suggested that men might be better than women at mathematics .
He has been beset by the fanged mouselets of academe , and is now busily cringing like a puppy who has wet the rug .
We must not mention what the correct do not want to hear .
Yet maybe we should .
Let us reflect on differences between the sexes :
Men are taller , heavier , stronger , more durable , and more enduring .
They have higher erythrocyte counts , greater cardiac volume , build muscle faster with exercise , and are more strongly constructed .
All of this is perfectly well known scientifically , having been studied to death by exercise physiologists .
It tracks with daily observation , with athletic records , with attempts by the military to train women as soldiers ( they are much weaker and have many more injuries in training ) .
It is why you do n’t see women in the NFL , why the sexes have separate athletic teams .
On the other hand , women live longer .
Intellectually the differences are more complex , but equally well known among people who study such things .
Men are distinctly better in mean mathematical - logical - spatial reasoning , and either very slightly ahead or very slightly behind in mean verbal ability .
Crucial here is what in mathematics is called a distribution . 
In comparing two groups , the mean — average — tells only part of the story .
To see this , consider an imaginary group of fifty women , all having an IQ of exactly 100 .
Their average IQ is 100 .
Now consider a group of fifty men , half of whom have IQs of zero , and half of whom have IQs of 200 .
The average IQ also is 100 — but you would expect very different performance .
The way the human distribution works is that as you move toward the extremes of intelligence , both high and low , men increasingly predominate .
Again , this is well known .
At the highest and lowest ranges of intelligence , you find almost entirely men .
The effect is stark in math , less so but inescapable in verbal ability .
It shows up on every known test of mental capacity .
It is why there are almost no female Nobelists in the mathematical sciences , and no world champions in chess .
It is the glass ceiling .
It is also much of why the prisons are full of men : the stupid tend to end up as criminals , and there are many more truly stupid men than truly stupid women .
All of this is well known and heavily documented .
Psychologically the differences between the sexes are fuzzy and less easily quantified .
On the other hand , they are obvious .
Women are more emotional than men , less aggressive , more interested in people and less interested in abstractions and machinery .
This , plus the difference in mathematical ability , explains the paucity of women in engineering and physics , and their high numbers in professions that involve caring for or dealing with people .
They are neither particularly good at physics , nor very interested .
Why then would you expect to find them there ?
The aggressiveness of men explains why they find war fascinating , quickly look for military solutions , love to study weaponry , glorify martial exploits , and have through all history fought war after war after war .
It is biological .
It is how men are .
A great deal of human behavior is biologically determined — or , if you prefer , the consequence of human nature .
A combination of stupidity and aggressiveness is conducive to violent crime .
What characteristically do you find in prisons ?
Stupid , aggressive men .
Why are bar fights always between men ?
Why does a man going into a tough town get challenges from men and not women ?
Why do the challenges diminish when the interloper is too old to be a sexual competitor ?
It is difficult to imagine that Larry Summers , president of Harvard , is n’t aware of all of this .
In fact , it is difficult to imagine that anyone is n’t at least vaguely aware of it .
The intelligence of men at the high end , plus their assertiveness and their interest in machines and in building things , is responsible for most of civilization .
The male desire to fight , as innate as a dog ’s desire to pee on hydrants , is a most hideously destructive phenomenon .
The question for civilization is how to harness the horsepower of men for useful purposes without letting them engage in their preferred sports : butchery , burning , the sacking of cities , and armed robbery .
This is tricky because testosterone has no moral component .
Men are happy spending long hours designing a robotic surgical suite to save lives , or working together in groups to send men to the moon .
They are equally happy designing a new and better tank , or in bombing cities .
Building the Parthenon and burning Hamburg enchant them equally .
How to encourage the one while discouraging the other ?
Men can be civilized at the local or neighborhood level .
Well - bred and preferably educated males , whether in Switzerland , Fukuoka , or the white suburbs of Washington , go to work , invent things , try to better the world , and only very occasionally kill each other .
Boys , if raised to be gentlemen , usually will be .
Of course this only works if women are ladies .
It comes down to a society ’s instilling , and insisting on , high standards of behavior .
Dueling should be discouraged .
At the global level , things are more difficult .
The male readiness to think in terms of abstractions makes the world a chess game .
Combativeness easily trumps morality .
It is men , not women , who fantasize about nuking China .
Given that almost all countries raise armies and train them to fight , it is to be expected that they will want to .
The unprincipled tend to rise to power .
I suppose the best hope is that countries will become sufficiently integrated with each other , as Western Europe seems to have done , that fighting just does n’t seem attractive .
Probably a long shot .
Meanwhile we might all be happier if women stopped trying to be what they are n’t , and men tried to stop being what they are , if you get my drift .
And is not a woman who tries to help a wounded puppy , whether she be a barmaid or astrophysicist , obviously a higher form of life than Agamemnon , Timurlane , Napoleon , the Bushlet , Hitler , Patton , or Pol Pot ?
If not , why not ?

Americans will hear more of this ahead of the election .
They also will hear Mr. Bush say that he finally has the power to bring to justice a handful of men behind the 9/11 attacks .
The truth is that Mr. Bush could have done that long ago , but chose to detain them illegally at hidden C.I.A. camps to extract information .
He sent them to Guantánamo only to stampede Congress into passing the new law .
The 60 or so men at Guantánamo who are now facing tribunals  out of about 450 inmates  also could have been tried years ago if Mr. Bush had not rebuffed efforts by Congress to create suitable courts .
He imposed a system of kangaroo courts that was more about expanding his power than about combating terrorism .
While the Republicans pretend that this bill will make America safer , let ’s be clear about its real dangers .
It sets up a separate system of justice for any foreigner whom Mr. Bush chooses to designate as an “ illegal enemy combatant . ”
It raises insurmountable obstacles for prisoners to challenge their detentions .
It does not require the government to release prisoners who are not being charged , or a prisoner who is exonerated by the tribunals .
The law does not apply to American citizens , but it does apply to other legal United States residents .
And it chips away at the foundations of the judicial system in ways that all Americans should find threatening .
It further damages the nation ’s reputation and , by repudiating key protections of the Geneva Conventions , it needlessly increases the danger to any American soldier captured in battle .
In the short run , voters should see through the fog created by the Republican campaign machine .
It will be up to the courts to repair the harm this law has done to the Constitution .
Once again I found myself in trouble at the Los Angeles International Airport , and once again it was ( arguably ) my own damn fault .
Last Thursday
I flew Southwest to Providence , Rhode Island to testify in court on behalf of my dad , who was in the midst of a textbook “ frivolous lawsuit ” .
I detest being late in general , and even more so when it comes to flying .
I am the guy that gets to the airport at least two hours in advance .
My adventure began almost as soon as I got out of my friend ‘s car .
It is not even remotely illegal to wear sunglasses in an airport .
I was told by the Southwest skycaps at the curbside check - in that my flight was canceled .
“ What ?!
Why ?! ” I exclaimed .
I was told by the first skycap that it was because of inclement weather in Rhode Island .
He directed me to his superior , who told me that it was because of a mechanical problem with the plane .
( Much later in the day I would be told that the flight was canceled because there simply were n’t enough people wanting to fly from LA to Providence that day to justify sending an entire plane on the route . )
She took my luggage and got me on the next flight , due to leave for Phoenix in three hours .
Quite a bummer .
Now instead of what I guessed would be an hour and a half of wandering the terminal I would be faced with two and a half hours of airport life .
If you add to that the fact that I usually manage to grab about three hours of sleep the nights before I fly — the better to go unconscious as soon as the plane is in the air — you can understand why I ’d be grumpy .
I humped my golf clubs and suitcase to the TSA ‘s first line of defense : The X - Ray Machine That Could Scan an Elephant .
The boys manning this monstrosity were kind and quick .
They did forget to tell me that they had finished bombarding my bags with radiation , so I had to stand there and wait for about ten minutes until they remembered I was there .
But I can forgive that .
There was nobody else in the area waiting to have bags scanned , so they may have just thought I was pleasantly fascinated by staring at them .
( According to their website the slogan of the TSA is “ Vigilant , Effective , Efficient ” .
I almost thought it was supposed to be a joke .
Those are maybe the three words in the English language that I would least associate with the TSA . )
This is where the fun begins .
When I got to the airport it was 11 o’clock in the morning .
I was wearing sunglasses .
It is pretty damn sunny in LA most mornings at 11 o’clock .
My rapt attention to the bag - scanning process and my overall grumpiness caused me to forget that I was wearing my sunglasses inside the airport .
As far as I know , however , this is not even remotely illegal .
It may not be chic or cool , but there are probably more people in LA that wear their sunglasses indoors than any other city on the planet , so it was n’t exactly outrageous for me to not remove them .
Unencumbered by my luggage , I sauntered towards the monolithic stairs leading to the “ real ” security line .
This part annoys me .
You have a flight of stairs .
At the top of this flight of stairs there is a security officer who confirms that the security officer at the bottom of the stairs has confirmed that you have a photo ID ( link 1 , link 2 ) and a boarding pass .
It is physically impossible to get to the top of these stairs without having first been at the bottom of these stairs .
There is nobody magically jumping into the middle of the stairs that could have avoided the security officer at the bottom of the stairs .
I am forced to assume that the redundancy is in place because the top - of - the - stairs security officers have decided that the bottom - of - the - stairs security staff is untrustworthy or vice versa .
And do I really need to get into a rant about how each and every one of the 9/11 hijackers had a valid photo ID and boarding pass ?
Unless both the top - of - the - stairs and the bottom - of - the - stairs security officers have photographic memories and have memorized the names of all potential terrorists I ca n’t imagine what the point is of being so fanatical about the whole double confirmation of boarding passes , because all they do it look at your ID and boarding pass .
There were actually four security officers at the bottom of the stairs .
“ Real ” security officers are probably insulted that we use the term to refer to TSA employees , and I sympathize with them .
On staff this day were four Latino women — girls , really , not one of them was older than 20 or taller than 5 ’ 2 ″ — who barely spoke English .
Now , understand , that even when I am in a bad mood I am still one of the most cheerful men you ’re ever likely to meet .
That goes triple if you work in a terribly unsatisfying job like checking boarding passes and identification when you just know that bitch at the top of the stairs is going to double - check your work every time .
I have worked in crap jobs and I always try to be pleasant .
“ Good morning , ” I smiled at Alisha , handing her my California driver ’s license and printed - from - the - internet - but - ridiculously - easily - forged ( link 1 , link 2 , link 3 , link 4 , link 5 , link 6 , link 7 ) Southwest boarding pass .
She smiled at me , checked that the name on my license matched the name on my boarding pass , and used a yellow hi-liter to mark the boarding pass with what looked exactly like a one - inch line .
( Do I need to tell you that they sell yellow hi-liters in just about every single store in America ? )
As she handed “ my papers ” back to me , she paused .
She looked me in the eyes .
She smiled .
And then she said , “ I ca n’t see your eyes . ”
I raised my hand to my face to remove my sunglasses and stopped .
She was n’t smiling because she was nice .
She was smiling because she was suffering from False Authority Syndrome !
The poor child .
In the most disarming , rational , peaceful , and kind voice at my command , I said , “ You do n’t need to see my eyes . ”
“ You have to remove your sunglasses , sir . ”
“ No , actually , I do n’t . ”
“ I ca n’t let you past here with your sunglasses on . ”
“ Yes , you can . ”
At this point she became obviously frustrated and confused .
She looked at me as if I was a freshly - shaved Osama bin Laden in a sports coat and khakis .
She became stern .
“ Take them off , please . ”
“ There ’s no law that says I ca n’t wear my sunglasses in the airport .
ma’am ”
“ Yes , there is .
It ’s a rule . ”
“ It ’s not a rule . ”
“ It is .
I ca n’t let you pass . ”
“ Yes , you can . ”
She took my boarding pass and used her yellow hi-liter to turn the line into an X .
An X of shame and potential threat .
She called to the top - of - the - stairs officer , “ Threat alert ! ”
No , I ’m not kidding .
Then she let me go up the stairs .
At this point I expected to get into an argument with the top - of - the - stairs woman .
I did n’t care .
I had two hours to kill and I was n’t in the mood to be pushed around by the TSA .
But surprisingly LeVonda did nothing even remotely antagonistic .
In fact she let me get into the extra short special security line !
This was a bonus !
Instead of standing in the “ general ” line with the hundreds of non-sunglasses wearing rubes , I got to get into the fast lane !
The fast lane was occupied by a mother and her three children , a very , very tall black man , and a guy that looked like the most average , generic businessman possible .
I did n’t feel like any of them could in any way be as much of a threat as I was , but I guess you ca n’t judge a book by its cover .
We merrily zipped through the metal detector and had our carry - on bags x-rayed .
The carry - on bag x-ray is my favorite part of flying and has been since long before 9/11 .
I have n’t gotten on an airplane without a pocket knife since I was a Boy Scout .
If my plane goes down , dammit , I will not be stranded on a desert island without any way of cracking into a coconut !
Ever since 9/11 I ’ve carried at least two , and sometimes three , back - up pocket knives .
I ’ve flown about thirty times since then , and only one time was one of my knives confiscated .
For this flight I had two , and they both went undetected .
But now a wrinkle !
I was n’t allowed to get my bags .
A tremendously grumpy guy grabbed my bag , my laptop , my jacket , and my shoes and gave me the double - ultra shakedown .
He went through every pocket of my briefcase .
He went through my jacket .
He looked in my shoes .
( He did not , I should note , ask me to remove my sunglasses . )
He never smiled .
He was a serious TSA .
There was a uniformed LAPD officer standing nearby as well , but he looked like he just enjoyed standing there and flexing and was n’t very interested in all of the potential threats to national security that were being given the what - for by the TSA .
The TSA double - security checker was not about to let me get past him .
He knew I was a bad guy .
I had a water bottle .
I was n’t hiding it or anything , I just honestly forgot that liquids are dangerous nowadays .
He held it in front of my face like it was a Nazi membership card that he ’d found in my blazer .
“ You know you ca n’t have this , right ? ”
I almost — almost — said something snarky about how it was cool that he did n’t care about my Swiss Army knife or my Leatherman tool .
Instead my reply was , “ Oh , yeah , right .
Sorry about that . ”
I reached for the water bottle , saying , “ I ’ll just chug that now . ”
You would have thought I pulled an UZI out of my ass at this point .
He literally jumped backwards and told me , “ Do n’t come any closer ! ”
I laughed .
I did .
I could n’t help it .
It was absurd .
I looked at the LAPD officer and said , “ Is he serious ? ”
The policeman looked at me as if he was very sorry and trying to not laugh himself .
He walked a little bit closer towards us but said nothing .
“ Dude .
It ’s water .
I ’ll drink it right now . ”
“ I ca n’t let you do that .
You have to throw it away . ”
“ What ?
Why ?
I ’m going to drink it .
I ’ll drink the whole thing .
Right now .
Right in front of you . ”
“ You ca n’t do that . ”
“ Why not ? ”
“ It ’s against the law . ”
“ What law ? ”
“ You ca n’t drink in the security area at the airport . ”
Now this is where I got mad .
“ There is no law that says I ca n’t drink water in the security area of the airport ! ” I looked at the cop , “ Is there ? ”
The cop said , “ I have no jurisdiction where you are .
You ’re not on LA property . ”
This seemed pretty silly to me .
What the hell was he doing there if he was n’t allowed to do anything ?
But whatever .
He was a cool cop and I did n’t have any beef with him .
I looked back at the TSA guy and said , “ Show me the law . ”
He stared bolts of fire into my skull and said , “ I do n’t have to show it to you .
It ’s the law . ”
“ Uh . ”
Yes , I really did say , “ Uh . ”
“ There ’s no law , man , ” I said .
He said — and I swear I am not making any of this up —
“ It ’s an SSI and I am not required to show it to you . ”
“ What is an SSI ?
Are you kidding ?
This is America .
You ca n’t enforce a law without showing it to me .
I never voted on any law about drinking water in the security area of the airport .
There is no such law . ”
I really , really wanted to ask him if SSI stood for Super Secret Information , but I forgot .
“ I ca n’t let you drink this water . ”
“ Fine .
Throw it away .
I do n’t care .
It ’s an unopened bottle of water that I am willing to drink right in front of you .
But whatever . ”
“ I ca n’t throw it away .
You have to throw it away . ”
I picked up my bags and walked away .
For quite some time I noticed that the person who I assumed to be the top TSA guy was following me around Brookstone .
I had a tail !
I had a pretty good time making him think I was trying to “ lose him ” for a little while .
Then my girlfriend called and I forgot about him and he was gone .
Good times .
( The jury returned a unanimous decision in my dad ’s favor , by the way . )
November 2 , 2006 Update :
I have gotten quite a few angry responses to this post recently .
I ’d like to note a few things about this experience :
The Southwest terminal was surprisingly slow that day .
My actions did not cause any trouble for anyone other than the TSA .
I hate long lines at the airport just as much as you do .
If at any point I felt like I was going to be creating a bottleneck I was prepared to just “ drop it ” .
If you read what I wrote carefully you ’ll understand that I was shuffled to a separate queue .
Matching my face to the image on my driver ’s license accomplishes nothing .
Please note that I said that I was told that my flight from LAX to PVD was canceled because there were n’t enough people for the flight .
I do n’t claim to know anything about airline routes .
that my flight from LAX to PVD was canceled because there were n’t enough people for the flight .
I do n’t claim to know anything about airline routes .
Several comments have noted that there are no direct LAX - PVD flights on Southwest .
My original flight was , in fact , supposed to include a stop in Phoenix .
I apologize if I was not clear on that point in my post .

Secondary Addiction : Ann Coulter on Evolution
Part I
By James Downard
Posted June 29 , 2006
Conservative pundit Ann Coulter 's latest opus , Godless : The Church of Liberalism , has sparked considerable media fuss over her acidic characterization of activist 9/11 widows : " I 've never seen people enjoying their husbands ' deaths so much . "
To which she added pusillanimous ad hominem masquerading for wit : " And by the way , how do we know their husbands were n't planning to divorce these harpies ? "
Coulter ( 2006 , 103 , 112 )
All this is grist for debate on literary civility , of course , but Coulter 's tome landed in my crosshairs on account of the third of her book ( the last 4 of 11 chapters ) devoted to assailing the Liberal 's Creation Myth , Darwinian evolutionary theory .
Her sashay into matters scientific delightfully illustrates a common theme in sloppy thinking .
Coulter is a secondary citation addict .
Like a scholarly lemming , she compulsively reads inaccurate antievolutionary sources and accepts them on account of their reinforcement of what she wants to be true .
It never once occurs to her that she might find it prudent to check on the reliability of those sources before accompanying them off the cliff , either by investigating critical takes on those sources , or by actually inspecting the original technical literature directly .
This starts naturally enough with the commonest activity of antievolutionists : fielding the " usual suspects " of authority quotes mined over the years by critics more concerned with succulent text strings than evaluating far more recalcitrant data .
Thus Coulter ( 2006 , 201 ) invoked the late paleontologist Colin Patterson , who stuck his foot in his mouth on several occasions by criticizing how evolutionary theory was applied to taxonomy issues without noticing the creationist in the audience taking notes or even recording it .
Coulter 's particular rehash was obtained secondarily from a February 2001 Tom Bethell American Spectator piece ( p. 10 actually , though Coutler 's endnote did n't specify pages ) .
She did not explain any context -- such as that Bethell was replying to a conservative correspondent appalled at the magazine 's publishing of the antievolutionary Wells ( 2000 ) .
Bethell ( 1999 , 20 ) had previously fielded the quote , by the way , so was merely trotting out a favored authority quote .
Of course , to have learned that Patterson did not harbor the level of doubt about evolution that his out of place quotes seemed to suggest would have required additional research ( such as has been done at the Talk Origins Archive ) .
But such follow - ups are not Coulter 's forte .
Having vacuumed the conclusions of Michael Behe 's Darwin's Black Box , Coulter ( 2006 , 205 ) revealed : " Although clearly annoyed with him , many evolutionists were forced to concede Behe 's point .
Evolutionary biologist Tom Cavalier - Smith , at the University of British Columbia , said , ' For none of the cases mentioned by Behe is there yet a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the probable steps in the evolution of the observed complexity . ' "
Cavalier - Smith was speaking as a rigorous scientist , of course .
As it happens , science lacks " a comprehensive and detailed explanation " for many things .
For instance , exactly how lightning is generated in a storm cloud .
See for instance De Blij ( 1994 , 62 ) : " For reasons that scientists still do not completely understand , storm clouds separate charges into positive and negative clusters . "
But does this therefore mean that we know nothing about the natural generation of lightning -- or evolution of those " complex systems "
Behe wrote about ?
This is where knowing the provenance of the quote matters .
Coulter had no endnote for it , so we do n't know if she latched onto it secondarily .
For her sake , let 's hope she did , because if she had obtained it from the original source , then she is guilty of monumental misrepresentation .
Re Behe ( 1996 , 68 , 179 , 279n , 285n ) , what Cavalier - Smith ( 1997 ) had written after that one sentence Coulter elected to quote constituted a devastating litany of Behe 's limitations as a reliable redactor of current scientific technicalities :
For none of the cases mentioned by Behe is there yet a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the probable steps in the evolution of the observed complexity .
The problems have indeed been sorely neglected , though Behe repeatedly exaggerates that neglect with such hyperboles as " an eerie and complete silence . "
But when criticizing existing evolutionary explanations , Behe uses intellectually dishonest double standards .
He dismisses my first treatment of the origin of cilia [ citing a 1978 paper ] as non-quantitative and therefore " utterly useless " , and ignores my later work on the topic [ citing 1997 & 1992 works ] .
But it does not worry him that his empty , religious notion of " intelligent design " is equally non-quantitative ; worse still , lacking even qualitative detail of what did the designing , and how the hypothetical design was executed , it explains nothing .
He states that " if a theory claims to be able to explain some phenomenon but does not even generate an attempt at an explanation it should be banished " and " without details , discussion is doomed to be unscientific and fruitless . "
If he had applied these strictures to his panacea of " intelligent design " we would have been spared this worthless book .
Behe 's attack on Russell Doolittle 's discussion of gene duplication and divergence in the origin of blood clotting involves an almost willful misunderstanding , and his numerical criticisms are as fallacious as others debunked by Ford Doolittle .
Behe , ignorant of much of the literature , claims that no scientist has ever discussed the origin of vesicle targeting ( actually discussed in Ref. 3 , not cited by Behe , though the most detailed one on the origin of eukaryotic biochemical properties ) or protein translocation ( see Refs 6 and 7 ) , the most detailed discussion of the origin of the most - basic complex cellular biochemical properties , which he deceitfully ignored despite citing the volume containing it as " evidence " that no paper has ever been published on the subject ! )
Maybe he did not want his readers to find the papers ( Refs 3 and 7 ) that most clearly show how one can explain ( in outline at least -- obviously they are not the final answer ) the origins of complex biochemical and cellular structures in logical steps using mutation , selection and detailed phylogenetic arguments .
His ignorant assumption that the origin of a protoSRP would have killed the cell is refuted by the absence of the translation arrest domain in the eubacterial signal recognition particle ( SRP ) RNA [ citing a 1989 paper ] , which provides a simpler ancestor to the more complex archaebacterial / eukaryotic particle .
The problem he raises [ p. 112 ] for the origin of secreted eukaryotic glycoproteins is spurious , because the sugar must have been added to the protein on the non-cystolic side of the membrane in the common ancestor of eukaryotes and archaebacteria , even before the ER ( endoplasmic reticulum ) evolved , since it is added thus at the archaebacterial cell surface , as any good biochemist should have known , even without reading my discussion of the origin of the ER ( Ref. 3 ) .
Behe is unaware of the extensive comparative evidence , for example , the existence of fully motile diatom cilia lacking the central pair microtubules , that cilia ( the most complex cell organelles of all ) are not , in fact , irreducibly complex by his definition .
He does not mention the evidence that the protein tubulin , the major constituent of ciliary microtubules , evolved from the bacterial cell - division protein ftsZ ( Ref. 9 ) , or that other motility organelles much simpler than cilia , for example , protozoan axostyles , evolved from bundles of microtubules by acquiring the capacity to bend , which he implies is impossible .
Of course , there is no mention of protozoa , in which cilia arose ; probably ( like many biochemists ) , the author knows next to nothing about them .
Though he criticizes me in particular , and evolutionary biology in general , for " fuzzy word pictures " , I suspect that the last thing Behe wants is a scientific explanation for the origin of cilia .
If he really has a genuine interest in molecular evolution , why has he never published on the subject himself in scientific journals ?
Behe states " the reason that ' interrupted genes ' exist at all is still a mystery " , but cites none of the hundreds of papers on their evolution , blissfully unaware of the " selfish " transposon theory [ citing Cavalier - Smith 's 1991 paper ] of their origin , now widely accepted even by former sceptics [ citing a 1994 book ] .
He seems ignorant of the general concept of " selfish " genetic parasites [ again citing the 1994 & 1991 sources just referenced ] , inherent in a darwinian view of life but alien to the anthropocentric , design - oriented , engineering view of life so widespread among biochemists , pervading even the cartoons in Trends in Biochemical Sciences .
Are these various omissions merely through ignorance or by deliberate intent because , as a Catholic , Behe prefers the illusion of an intelligent biochemist creator to mutations and the blind gropings of macromolecules ?
One might pose that question to Christian Coulter also .
( Incidentally , though Behe mentioned Cavalier - Smith 's article in a July 31 , 2000 " Response to Critics " at the Discovery Institute website , Behe did not discuss any of Cavalier - Smith 's specific points . )
Behe 's unfamiliarity with relevant technical issues has continued , playing a role in the 2005 Dover , PA antievolution issue , as Judge Jones was notably unimpressed with Behe 's vacuity apropos a stack of science papers presented to him by the opposing legal team during cross-examination .
One of her next nuggets concerned the evolution of the eye -- or rather what she imagines this to involve , courtesy of some more secondary sources .
Citing Berlinski ( 2003 ) , Coulter ( 2006 , 207-208 ) piled up a chain of secondary redaction :
Even if they start with light - sensitive cells , Darwin 's apostles still can't get to an eye .
There have long been bald assertions by Darwiniacs of the existence of a computer simulation of the evolution of the eye .
The webpage of the National Science Teachers Association baldly states , " Computer simulations of natural selection are common , such as the computer simulation of the evolution of the eye as described in [ Richard ] Dawkins . "
In his book River Out of Eden , Dawkins blathers on and on about " computer models of evolving eyes . "
But the computer simulation turned out to have as much basis in reality as the idea that domestic violence increases on Super Bowl Sunday .
David Berlinski got to the bottom of the famed computer simulation , tracking down the scientists alleged to have performed this wondrous feat , and discovered -- as described in a tour de force article in Commentary magazine -- it did n't exist .
In The Politically Incorrect Guide to Science , Tom Bethell quotes Berlinksi's summary of the evidence :
This notion that there is somewhere a computer model of the evolutionary development of the eye is an urban myth .
Such a model does not exist .
There is no such model anywhere in any laboratory .
No one has the faintest idea how to make one .
The whole story was fabricated out of thin air by Richard Dawkins .
The senior author if the study on which Dawkins based his claim -- Dan E. Nilsson -- has explicitly rejected the idea that his laboratory has ever produced a computer simulation of the eye 's development .
In other words , River Out of Eden is the Darwiniacs ' version of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion .
Readers of Talk Reason will be familiar with the background of this story , and can only smile at how diligently Coulter has reported what other people claimed about Nilsson 's work without actually bothering to check out the actual paper .
As noted in my discussion of David Berlinski's escapades in " A Tale of Two Citations , " the fact missed by the Coulter / Bethell / Berlinski daisy chain was that Nilsson & Pelger ( 1994 ) contained an entirely valid mathematical analysis of eye evolution basing each stage of the process on biologically known intermediaries .
The upshot of their study was to show how surprisingly few 1 % incremental wiggles ( less than 2000 iterations ) could nudge an active patch of cells into a focusing eye .
True , a " computer " was n't involved in these calculations , so let 's all slap Richie Dawkins for being a bad student .
But the study still existed , and when I burrowed back to the source ( in a way Coulter / Bethell failed to ) I confirmed with Nilsson that Berlinski had never even bothered to request the original data summary , let alone establish that there was anything biologically unjustifiable about it .
Hence Berlinski ( 2001 ) -- where he had initially fielded his claims , only repeated more stridently in Berlinksi ( 2003 ) Coulter drew on -- could not have in principle evaluated its correctness .
Hence Bethell could have had no means by which he could have confirmed that Berlinski was right in his criticism .
Hence Coulter could n't have had a clue about how reliable Berlinski's " tour de force " piece had been in the first place .
As it happens , Coulter has a skilled affinity for making snap ( and wrong ) judgments about papers she had n't read .
Coulter ( 2006 , 209-210 ) offered this :
On April 7 , 2006 -- more than two years after Sharon Begley informed Wall Street Journal readers that the irreducible complexity argument had been solved eons ago and she was frankly bored with the subject -- the New York Times ran a front - page article declaring that researchers had finally produced a " counterargument to doubters of evolution who question how a progression of small changes could produce the intricate mechanisms found in living cells . "
This was under the headline : " Study , in a First , Explains Evolution 's Molecular Advance . "
At least we finally had a clear admission that the irreducible complexity argument had not been answered before this .
But look at the allegedly " complex " mechanism that scientists asserted -- not proved , asserted -- might have arisen by natural selection : a two - part molecular mechanism , the hormone and its receptor .
Two parts !
Even a mousetrap --
Behe 's simplest example of a complex mechanism -- has three parts .
And , of course , they still had n't shown that the hormone - receptor pair could be produced by natural selection , only that this simple two - part mechanism might be produced by natural selection .
That 's front page news for the state religion .
Coulter clearly has no clue that , while Behe had not done so in Darwin 's Black Box ( the book she was familiar with ) , the avatar of ID had subsequently expanded his definition of irreducible complexity to include single receptor systems such as the one examined by Bridgham et al. ( 2006 ) .
Hence the Science paper was directly relevant to Behe 's IC claims .
Once again , readers of Talk Reason will recall Ian Musgrave 's recent analysis here of the paper and how Michael Behe reacted to it by " moving the goalposts " and denying he had proposed protein binding sites as being IC .
Meanwhile , what had Bridgham 's team done ?
Merely " asserted " something ?
Looking at the existing variations among vertebrates in how the receptor systems operated , they had employed their supposedly pathetic evolutionary presumptions to figure out what a precursor molecule should have been and then retroengineered it !
They then proceeded to test this new molecule and thus proved ( not " asserted " ) that the precursor did exactly what it should have .
They then went on to determine the two mutations ( each involving single amino acid replacements ) that slid the system into the form currently known in higher vertebrates .
Some " assertion " !
As it happens , such retroengineering is a skill performed by pesky Darwinists with increasing frequency , such as Jermann et al. ( 1995 ) on ruminant pancreatic ribonucleases , or Sharp ( 1997 ) re Messier & Stewart ( 1997 ) on digestive lysozymes found in colobine monkeys .
Incidentally , thus far this knack has eluded the empirical embrace of Intelligent Design .
Having shown off her acute familiarity with the details of technical papers , Coulter plowed ahead with potshots on medical issues .
Coulter ( 2006 , 213-214 ) offered this :
As I understand the concept behind survival of the fittest , the appendix does n't do much for the theory of evolution either .
How does a survival - of - the - fittest regime evolve an organ that kills the host organism ?
Why has n't evolution evolved the appendix away ?
( Another sign that your scientific theory is in trouble :
When your argument against an opposing theory also disproves your own . )
Coulter has hit the nail squarely here : going by her " understanding " of the matter is her problem .
She does not understand it .
Not surprisingly , Coulter 's glib rhetorical question is readily comprehended the moment you start paying attention to the available details .
Consider Nesse & Williams ( 1998 , 92 ) :
The path of natural selection can even lead to a potentially fatal cul - de- sac , as in the case of the appendix , that vestige of a cavity that our ancestors employed in digestion .
Because it no longer performs that function , and as it can kill when infected , the expectation might be that natural selection would have eliminated it .
The reality is more complex .
Appendicitis results when inflammation causes swelling , which compresses the artery supplying blood to the appendix .
Blood flow protects against bacterial growth , so any reduction aids infection , which creates more swelling .
If the blood supply is cut off completely , bacteria have free rein until the appendix bursts .
A slender appendix is especially susceptible to this chain of events , so appendicitis may , paradoxically , apply the selective pressure that maintains a large appendix .
Far from arguing that everything in the body is perfect , an evolutionary analysis reveals that we live with some very unfortunate legacies and that some vulnerabilities may even be actively maintained by the force of natural selection .
Such " scorched earth " approaches to our biology are turning out to be rather significant , most notably in the case of sickle cell anemia , where selection kept the dangerous gene for it in play because it peripherally slowed down the killing power of malaria .
Part II coming soon ...

Did Big Government 's Largesse Help the Locals ?
The Implications of WWII Spending for Local Economic Activity , 1939 - 1958
NBER Working Paper No. 12801
Issued in December 2006 , Revised in January 2008
NBER Program(s ) : Development of the American Economy , Public Economics , Economic Fluctuations and Growth
Studies of the development of local economies often point to large - scale World War II military spending as a source of long - term economic growth , even though the spending declined sharply after the demobilization .
We examine the longer term impact of the temporary war spending on county economies using a variety of measures of socioeconomic activity : including per capita retail sales , the extent of manufacturing , population growth , the share of women in the work force , housing values and ownership , and per capita savings over the period 1940 - 1950 .
We find that in the longer term counties receiving more war spending per capita during the war experienced extensive growth due to increases in population but not intensive growth , as the war spending had very small impacts on per capita measures of economic activity .

Just when we thought we 'd seen it all , ROLLERtoaster comes onto the scene and makes everybody look bad .
Sure , it 's just a concept for now , but do n't say we did n't warn you when this thing takes the world by storm and revolutionizes the entire toast industry forever .
Designed by Jaren Goh of Singapore , and winner of the 2006 Red Dot Award , the ROLLERtoaster is pretty self explanatory : stick bread in one side , and watched it get rolled into toast by the compact little unit .
We 're not so sure how well this is guarded from little probing fingers , or the exact mechanism for rolling the toast through , but do details like that really matter when faced with such exquisite design beauty ?
We did n't think so .
My Battle with MGM Over Wargames .
Com
For the past three months I 've been privately engaged in a time - consuming dispute with Nathan J. Hole , a lawyer representing MGM Studios who claims that Wargames .
Com , a domain that I 've owned since April 16 , 1998 , is the rightful property of the film company because it produced the 1983 movie WarGames and registered it as a trademark .
I received an e-mail this morning indicating that MGM has filed a legal complaint with the National Arbitration Forum to take the domain name away from me .
I registered the domain to sell military wargames like Axis & Allies and Battle of Britain and was able to realize these plans earlier this year .
I 've never run my own business , so figuring out sales taxes and licensing , finding suppliers , running a secure web server and setting up ecommerce software took around two years .
My store has nothing to do with the film WarGames or any other movie , but attempting to convince MGM there 's no infringement has been utterly fruitless .
I suspect this is because the film studio is filming a WarGames sequel for 2007 release .
Hole 's an intellectual property attorney who appears to be making a name for himself by going after domain name owners using the Uniform Domain - Name Dispute - Resolution Policy ( UDRP ) , an arbitration process that governs domain disputes .
All domain owners agree to be bound by the UDRP when they register or renew a domain name .
In my research on the UDRP , I found that Hole has been the complainant 's attorney on nine arbitration cases :
He 's won all nine , but in six of the cases the domain owner did n't file a response , which gives the complainant the domain names by default .
Most of them appear to be clear examples of cybersquatting , where a domain owner had no legitimate , non-infringing plans for the domain .
Fighting one of these arbitrations is expensive in both money and time , but I 'm operating my store legally and have a well - documented history of owning domains in good faith -- as you can confirm with the Vatican .
I 've spent at least 1,000 hours developing Wargames .
Com and have rejected dozens of offers over the years to sell the domain , including one for $ 30,000 .
My goal is to turn the business into something I can give my sons when they 're old enough to run it .
I 'll cover the legal battle here on Workbench .
With the help of my attorney Wade Duchene , I 'm learning how honest domain name owners can defend themselves from a grab like this , but you have to take steps to protect yourself before you hear from an attorney like Hole .
Once I received Hole 's first letter on Sept. 11 , the only actions that could end up saving my domain are the ones I took before that date .
Comments
Stick it to 'em .
If they really wanted the name they should have bought it before you .
I 'm having problems of my own with ' The Forum ' .
All I can say is it 's good that you have a lawyer , and good luck with this effort .
You 've probably seen this , but just in case :
bias in disputes
Sorry , one more time ( you need comment edits ) ...
If you search on the following terms , domain dispute naf bias , you can discover a lot about the bias in domain disputes .
Did you know that Google uses NAF for its disputes ?
Seems like a dumb fight for Hole to pick - once he loses this , he 's going to be mocked by bloggers from Burbank to Bombay .
Rogers :
MGM should have to pay for the privilege of getting the domain .
Are all trademarks protected to this degree ?
Perhaps I misunderstood your ending but I was expecting some detail of the steps one should take before a similar letter arrives .
Or is this a future post ?
I 'll be getting into that in future weblog posts .
There 's a lot of ground to cover .
I think you are well protected .
Beyond the fact that you are actually doing something on topic with the domain unrelated to the trademark .
Going a step further , Disney could ill afford the publicity .
Question .
Did they give you an offer or just threaten ?
YOu might also look into disputing the trademark since that term has been around a lot longer than the movie and is commonly used for other things .
As most trademark resources will tell you , a trademark is n't like a copyright ... it is n't given initially ; it is earned .
Ambiguous trademarks , or ones that are heavily associated with something else can be challenged .
This may be your case here .
Sorry , not Disney , it 's Sony and Comcast .
Did they give you an offer or just threaten ?
The first time I heard from MGM was the Sept. 11 letter telling me to give up my domain .
I can't further into specifics until they are spelled out in my attorney 's official response to the UDRP complaint .
A sleazy lawyer ( Hole ) wants to play you like Stephen Cohen did Gary Kremen .
Where are his offices , Tijuana ?
Get your war - game on .
Actually , MGM's back catalogue was reccently purchased by Fox , not Disney , Sony or Comcast .
Just how much power will the world allow Rupert Murdoch to accrue ?
He 's much better at money management than William Randolph Hearst .
" actually MGM 's back catalogue was recently purchased by Fox , not Disney , Sony or Comcast "
So Rupert " The unBearable " Murdoch has set out to crush the notoriously lefty leaning RCade by suing over the domain name " Wargames " .com ?
Legal threats sent in a letter delivered on September 11th , no less ?
By some ambulance chaser / corporate lapdog named Snidely A. Hole ?
Sorry , wots that ?
Nathan ?
Well , if you say so .
Jay ?
Maybe Later .
Just wanna finish this thought .
First off , this is a bald faced attempt to legally strongarm a lot of domain squatters of all stripes including those who run sites wif potentially embarrassing names likes " dellsucks " .com into complete and utter surrender , no payments , nada , squat , zilch , zippo .
" Compensation ?
Yer lucky we do n't sue yer ass now go away li'l boy ya bother me " is wot this is .
Secondly , " Wargames " as a term is as generic as say " Board Games " .
May as well try to copyright " Yer Fired " or sommat equally stupid .
Thirdly , " Axis and Allies " freakin ' RAWKS !
Spud has played out every possible outcome to that game a few times now .
It is a time - thief .
Battle of Britain ?
Also good .
Howsabout " Squad Leader " ?
That shit was trippy !
They 're playing a legalistic version of chicken here , btw .
If yer legal boys say yer solid ?
GFI !
Go Fer It .
Do n't let the bastards grind you down !
" Do you want to play a game ? "
In this life you choose yer battles wisely and you play to win .
Good luck .
Keep blogworld informed if ya can .
Be Well .
Good luck , man .
I hope you win .
I did n't know you were a war gamer .
I 'll have to check the site ... and recommend it to others .
S
Spud , my point exactly .
Wargames is a term that is used commonly outside of reference to the old movie .
There is good legal precedent to fight the trademark itself on this basis .
Trademarks have to be distinctive to the thing the represent .
Actually , Fox only has distribution rights to MGM 's home - video releases , not the catalog itself .
Be thankful that your last name is Cadenhead and not Nissan ( see nissan.com )
" a time - consuming dispute "
You should n't have written this -- it breaks the never - let - them - know - they 're - getting - to - you rule .
You probably should n't have posted about this at all , until it was resolved one way or the other .
We will wage jihad against the infidel attorney and his corporate running dogs !!!
Parallax akbar !!!
On your wargames.com site , you stretch the normally rectangular images of game covers into a square shape .
It looks really weird .
Everything is out of proportion .
Why do you do this ?
Milk this for all the publicity you can get for your store .
The whole thing makes no sense to me , clearly " war games " is a generic term and that movie was not even all that popular .
Should the pentagon pay MGM everytime they engage in " war games " ?
Ridiculous .
I do n't think they have a right to it at all , since what you are selling are wargames , surely they can take other domain names , like , wargames .
net or wargamesthemovie.com or whatever .
A college society we had going had a set of forums and as soon as it's term was up , and the owner was no longer in the college we could n't renew our site under the .net domain name , cause it was snapped up immediately because of the delay in tracking down the person who registered it years before , we did n't bitch about it and just swapped to .org
You may want to check out www.wipo.int
This whole thing is stupid , especially since MGM is not in the game business and thus , there is no trademark confusion .
I sincerely hope that you win arbitration .
Stephen : " You probably should n't have posted about this at all , until it was resolved one way or the other . "
No , no .
What other leverage does he have in this game than to bring the details out into the sunlight ?
That 's what makes it interesting , this " I 'll blog about it " factor that , when played right , can trump the old legal guard 's strategy of " I 'll scare you , little guy . "
Like the Maine blogger and his righteous fight with the tourism board 's agency .
A friend of mine went through something similar .
His experience may be of use to you : http://theos.com/dispute.html.
Good luck .
UDRP arbitration panel decisions are sometimes contrary to the rule of law .
Although it sounds like you are in the right and should win your dispute , there are risks .
If your attorney does not have direct experience with UDRP proceedings , I would highly recommend obtaining the services of one that does before submitting your response .
A top attorney practicing in this field is John Berryhill , at www.johnberryhill.com.
If your response has already been submitted , hopefully you will prevail .
If not , be sure to act quickly to file a court action before the domain name is taken from you .
Going to court is not cheap but the domain name is well worth defending , and the cause is worth fighting for .
It looks like Hole has a long track record against domain names that incorporate previously copyrighted names that do n't really have a secondary meaning .
That is , " dellsucks " could be the domain name of a person who really hates dells , gullies , meadows , and Leprichauns , but it 's much more likely that the domain name refers to Dell Computer .
As others have pointed out , wargames have been around for a helluva lot longer than the movie " Wargames " and there is no obvious association between the domain name and the movie .
When I see the word " wargame " I think of Panzer Blitz ( or perhaps the National Training Center ) , not Matthew Broderick .
I wonder if the fact that the movie came out so long before the advent of the Web will be a factor .
Also , it is interesting that you obtained the domain name back in 1998 , well after the advent of the popular Web .
One would think that if MGM were interested in using the Web to capitalize on the value of their Wargames property , they would have done so in 1995 , ' 96 , or ' 97 .
Best of luck to you , Rogers , and keep publicizing this .
They have the money , but you have the power of the pen .
Keep up the good fight !
MGM can't reasonably argue their trademark because :
A ) " War games " is a phrase in common usage , and therefore an indefensible trademark .
The military practices war games all the time .
Children play war games .
B ) They can't reasonably argue that a consumer is going to be confused between visiting an interactive web site storefront and watching a movie .
They are simply different activities .
The owner of a trademark for " Scott Paper Towels " does n't have a universal trademark for all things " Scott " .
( e.g. www.scottusa.com, www.scottflyrod.com, etc. )
Thus , " War Games : The Movies " does n't constitute a trademark on all things related to War Games .
B ) They simply have n't been rigorous in defending their trademark .
You could trademark anything , but the legal precedent has sided with those who have defended their trademarks from infringement .
It 's pretty obvious that MGM has not defended their trademark since your site 's inception in the late 90s .
Assuming that War Games :
The Movie was a trademark they cared about they should have complained about the infringement YEARS ago .
It 's also sadly obvious that this is just an underhanded means to cheat you of your source of income ( one that is n't trading on MGM's War Games : The Movie trademark ) .
Been through this time - consuming process myself once ...
DNJournal.com , which is the " official " voice of the domain industry , offers some great information / sources / contacts / resources you may find helpful .
You are in the right on this one ; and , handled & argued correctly , you will win .
Only problem then is that they 've got 30 days ( if I recall correctly ) to file a lawsuit to try to take it from you , which is going to get real expensive fast ...
Wish you the best .
MGM should find a more appropriate name like Wargames_themovie.com or Wargames_Movie.com .
Their movie is not a game .
trying to leverage you out of your name is lame .
and Dell trying to squash dellcomputerssuck.com is also lame .
dell should make computer that are so awesome that dellcomputerssuck.com has no traffick .
making sucky computers and harassing their already disgruntled ex-customers is no way to do business .
We 've had something similar in South Africa , but here it was n't as much a trademark infringement as it was a freedom of speech issue .
Since we 've only had it just over a decade , freedom of speech is still a higly valued right in South Africa .
Our main {monopoly} landline telecoms company sued a company for pointing out that they are not what they claim to be .
Company telkom.co.za sued website hellkom.co.za ( view both , this is not vague ) , but withdrew the lawsuit .
It 's thought that the withdrawal was based another lawsuit that was won by the small guy .
Rogers , do n't give up ... this is rightfully yours , and big companies should be held accountable .
Someone once said ... power tends to corrupt , absolute power corrupts absolutely .
Money makes the world go round ... but money comes from the small - fry ... if only we 'd learn to put out money where our mouth is ... I suggest we boycott the upcoming Wargames movie .
If you can get bloggers worldwide to not go watch it MGM might lose a bit of money .
Telkom Suit
Suit Dropped
Also google " laugh if off black lable "
All the best .
Do keep us informed .
There 's another factor here : this will NOT be good publicity for MGM .
A lot of the target market for the movie aspires to run a web site or a web business .
You 're clearly not a cybersquatter , you have a legit mark and you got there first .
I 'm not a lawyer but I do understand the law here and basically I do n't see how they have a case ; though the wrinkle about being an indefensible mark is also interesting -- only worsens their case though .
Unfortunately they do have enough to make it look like they have a case on paper and cost you a ton of money .
They 're beating up on you , because they have the cash and they can .
Big bully trying to make you give up your lunch money .
That simple .
The next time I see any press about the movie sequel , all I 'll remember is that this is a big company sticking it to an entrepreneur just because they can .
Sort of a Tom Cruise effect .
Congratulations for fighting back .
I have to disagee with Francois on the dellcomputerssuck domain as it it apparent that there was a predatory use by the registrant which satisfied the bad faith prong of udrp process and in effect sealed the finding of cyber - squatting .
The situation and circumstances here however are quite dissimilar to the cases mentioned and the tactics being employed here by the complainant should be of great concern not only to domainers but to anyone in favor of justice .
As the complainant in this case is apparently no stranger to the process and can apparently afford suitable representation they either know or ought to have known that their action is being brought in bad faith .
The udrp was initially set up to provide tm holders with a cost effective and efficient means of resolving the most blatant of abuses , not as a forum for the interpretation of the law .
The circumstances in this case illustrate anything but a blatant case of registrant abuse and as such the mere filing of the udrp appears to be an abuse of process .
My advise would be for your lawyer to seek a determination of reverse domain name hijacking which would not only compensate you for the time , energy and expense you will incurr in defending this frivolous and vexacious case but will also send a message to corporate bullies that tactics such as those employed in this instance will not be tolerated .
I worked for a major domain name registrar for almost 3 years and am very familiar with domain name disputes such as the one you 're having .
I recall one of the higher profile disputes in th 1990s between eToys and online toy ecommerce site and etoy , a european artistic site .
Even though etoys was formed after etoy they sued etoy for infringing on their trademark by having the domain name etoy.com .
Eventually etoys gave up their suit .
en.wikipedia.org
I do n't know the specific legal criteria for winning those types of disputes nor do I think it 's fair for domain squatters to unfairly sit on a domain and hold it for ransom , but it bugs me that major corporations feel entitled to every single permutation of their company and product names automatically .
Many people do n't realize it , but the domain speculation business in which people buy up domains that have current or future value is a billion dollar industry .
If you look at after market sites like afternic.com and buydomains.com and see some of the asking prices of domains run into the tens of thousands of dollars for a name that cost the original registrant a wholesale cost of $ 6.50 .
Good luck with your suit .
P.S. -
You probably know this one , but " Hearts of Iron " www.heartsofiron2.com is a great PC / MAC WWII strategy game .
MGM 's full of it .
Movie titles are n't trademarkable .
Yet that 's what they 're trying to do ; they registered their trademark as " entertainment services " in 2001 , claiming a first use of 1983 -- but that first use was the movie title .
to make it worse you KNOW the movie will suck and will have all sorts of pretty graphics over everything , making hacking look like a quick shake of the mouse .
Dear hollywood .
stop remaking good films that do n't need it and come up with an original idea for the 1st time in years .
you stick with it .
Are you sure his name is n't actually ' Nathan A. Hole ' ?
This kind of crap happened back in 99 when movie company 's were finally putting up websites for customers to go check out trailers .
MGM is just way too late in the game and is just realizing it now .
Soon enough anyone who sets up a domain will have to worry about some other big corporation taking over the naming rights because they the money to pay a lame " kiss ass " lawyer .
All movie company 's should be slotted into a Movie domain and then they can sub register under it .
Picking on somebody who plays strategy battles for a living does n't seem like a particularly smart move on MGMs behalf .
I 'm sure you 've got an approach , but a few ideas anyway :
- Whatever you do , do n't even flinch at any sum of money they offer you .
If they say that they 'll give you $ 2,000,000 for the domain and you look like accepting , they can argue that you only registered the domain for profit .
- I hate this corporate bullying and so do many others .
You may not have the personal time and financial resources to win this in the court system , but you can easily win the PR war .
Its now on slashdot , meaning a hell of a lot of people who would go and see this movie are now on your side .
Take the media offensive .
A lot of people are going to be behind you on this one .
Hey guy .
I took a cruise through your game site , wargames.com and you need to fix your biox covers .
The fact that you require the browser to scale the images down , * really * slows dont the speed of your site .
Pic either a height or width and then use your favorite image editor and shrink them appropriately .
Best of luck !
P.S. if for some obscure reason MGM wins , I think that there are a lot of people out there that will be quite irate and just might actualy frag the site .
will Matthew Broderick be in the movie ?
Keep up the good fight .
We 're behind you 100 % .
I 'm sick of giant corporations screwing the little guys in court .
I know you have prolly heard it all already , but I had to put my $ 0.02 in ...
There are a lot of generic terms out there that could be trademarked ... the problem as I see it is , you have to prove that the term is too generic to trademark ...
I am not even sure how they trademarked the term as the military has been using it since the 1950s to describe their " battle ready testing " scenarios , or " War Games " ...
It would be like someone trying to trademark the term " battle simulation " ...
I hope your lawyer is a good one .

Failure cases :
When losing your domain is quite an autoscore !

Give 'em Hell , Rogers !
We both know there 's a separate legal " reality " for rich corporations , but that does n't give them the moral authority to pinch what is rightfully yours .
Make them choke on it .

" A 1999 law made it illegal to buy a domain linked to a famous person or trademarked name with the intention of extorting money out of a trademark holder .
But that law does not prevent speculators from buying or selling addresses linked to famous names . "
I hope you win .
You have an excellent site and I will try to spread the word as much as possible .
as steve says above .
it aint good PR >
so it may sound stoopid but write to Rupert Murdoch direct .
It isnt that hard
He knows a good headline when he sees one , and he knows a bad one when
it is on the horizon .
Hole ... the name says it all .
Honestly , I hope that they should not have a case .
I know that way before the movie came out , the term was in common use for tabletop miniature games such as Napoleanics , as well as 25 mm Boer Wars , Battletech , and many others .
Including that old favorite , Nuclear War ( hey it is a card game , but we had to play something in the pizza place after the hobby shop closed down ) .
We were wargamers , and we played war games .
British vs. Zulu , Warsaw Pact vs. NATO etc ...
Of course I was also a Role - Playing Gamer too ...
My point is that this term Wargames is a common one used prior to 1982 to refer to the whole set of tabletop and board games that it seems you sell .
My point is that that term was in common use before that time for the products you sell ...
Good luck .
Ian
you 're being used to help publicize the new movie in the blogosphere .
tool .
Read up on trademark law , and counter - sue .
A trademark applies only in the very specific industry niche for which the trademark is filed .
Also , a trademark can not be filed and sit there unused ( trademark squatting is not allowed ) ; it must be actively used in order to retain the trademark , and in order to actively enforce trademark protection .
Tell them to * bleep * off and register wargames . tv or wargames .
movie instead , since not only is it better PR to not stomp on the little guy and steal his name because you want to release a new movie based on a decades - old idea with the little guy 's name , but using the .movie or .tv top level domain is in accordance with best practices and best for all involved .
Also : there is NO basis for confusion , dilution of brand , or anything else .
I do n't look at your site and say " Gee , is this that movie with Ally Sheedy and that kid who played Ferris Bueller ? "
If the law is followed , and if ICANN guidelines are followed , they have NO case whatsoever .
Did they ever come to you and simply say " hey we see you have this domain , how about 10 grand for it ? "
I know the attorney would not do that because then he is not making money filing legal papers , etc .
It would have saved the studio money in the long run to be nice , at least until you said " no I do n't wnat to sell " if you so decided .
Good luck with this battle , I know this does n't count for much at all , but here 's one more geek who wo n't pay a dime towards this movie , and wo n't ever forget how they tried to screw you .
I 'd like to think that one day corps like MGM would learn to apply a modicum of intelligent thought before unleashing the lawyer attack dogs , but that would be wishful thinking it seems .
Do n't make an offer to MGM to sell them the domain name , or even mention money to them .
I 've heard of such offers being falsely reported to the arbiter as extortion attempts , leading to the domain being taken away .
I wish there was a way we could donate to your legal fund .
I think it is ridiculous that a company like MGM and Sony uses the legal system to go after and sue people for music copyrights and filch unsquatted domains .
I think you have a right to the domain .
I wish everyone could help you defend it and keep wargames.com as board game related site .
Wargames should refer war games and boardgames and serve a much higher purpose over being some movie studios bitch .
Never Surrender !
you registered it in 98 , and squatted on it until this year , the same year they decided to make a movie .
web.archive.org*/www.wargames.com
i know you said this , im just playing devils advocate as it looks to me like you are just trying to play it off as a legitimate site .
An ass " Hole " who attacks an innocent person on Sept 11 .
I did n't think we welcomed that type here in America .
So , a productive , useful website which offers a continual stream of content may be replaced with a tiny fragment of a movie promotional campaign ... and then sit there idle once the movie 's flash has subsided .
Man , do I love the way money and corporations are destroying the web .
9 years to figure out how to sell military wargames like Axis & Allies and Battle of Britain online ????
i could understand if the domain they were after was someone just sitting on the domain , but you run a business off the thing they should have no right 's to it , besides its been 24 years since first movie .
I hope the judge plain straight and tell 's them if they want it , they better make ya an offer .
I hate lawyers .
Scum , the damn lot of them .
Well , I definitely think that a " War Games " retailer has just due to the name .
That said , I must confess that I am sorely disappointed in the site itself .
Not for the design , but 24 tabletop games ?
That 's it ?
Where is Axis & Allies ?
Squad Leader ?
Up Front and all the rest of the old Avalon Hill games .
What about Star Fleet Battles ... I believe that 's back in availability .
Classic Battletech . :|
Sure many if not most table top games are out of print .
But it 's still be nice to see a " limited OOP " section .
Get more table - top games ....
- Jason " The Saj "
PS - In truth , had I come to the site and seen a bunch of good ol ' tabletop games I 'd be in for the fight w'th ya .
Sorry , one more time ( you need comment edits ) ...
If you search on the following terms , domain dispute naf bias , you can discover a lot about the bias in domain disputes .
Did you know that Google uses NAF for its disputes ?
this page came up second for that in a google search .. hah
and there is a thing called PREVIEW COMMENT , which you are forced to do .
there is no excuse for you :)
or are you the person who opens an executable named THIS WILL ERASE YOUR HARD DISK .
EXE , and then blindly clicks OK when it pops up a window asking you for permission to erase your hard disk ?
Your strongest defense will be three fold :
1 . The domain is in active use , and you are not attempting to gain by causing confusion with the " Wargames " trademark .
2. Prove prior art on " Wargames . "
Specifically , prove that the term was in wide use before the movie came out .
Furthermore prove that the term was widely known before then , thus the trademark is n't a " unique " term .
A quick google search turned up instances of " wargames " being used as early as the mid 1960s .
If you can prove prior art , you may be able to at least be able to claim that they should not have been granted exclusive use to the term in the first place .
3 . You are not in competition with the owner of the wargames trademark as they make movies , and you are in retail .
Since the uses do not overlap , you thus can argue that you are not actually causing any material harm to the plantif's " enjoyment and utilization " of their trademark .
Good luck
Well , maybe some things to check :
- is " wargame " a common word ( present in an English dictionnary ) .
AFAIK , a common name can't be trademarked , resulting in Microsoft registering " MS Windows " and " Microsoft Windows " and not " Windows " .
- did you contact Groklaw ?
the EFF ?
I 'm not sure this could help ...
But commonsense tells that MGM should lose his suit .
When you look at the other web names reclaimed by that Lawyer , they were clearly bearing the " DELL " word which is * not* a common word or " alienware " ( by prepending www to the name which is clearly an attempt of cybersquatting ) ...
I 'm almost sure you 've seen it , but wikipedia has a wargaming page that points to several uses of the term " wargames " long before the movie .
In some cases , wargame was even printed on the box .
Wikipedia Wargaming
There is no reason you should n't win .
Good luck .
You very well deserve the right to overcome this ' small business man versus huge corporation ' dispute .
Thanks for not giving in and showing us all that we can indeed resist companies like them .
Go for it and good luck !
What is this ?
Are we nuts ?
There are thousands of films out there that use common words on title .
We can't use them ever because they are " protected " by a copyright paper ?
This means I can't have a website named Godfather even if it is a website talking about my nice godfather and how much I love him ?
Or even worse , no website called Aliens , Metropolis , or High Noon .
Just because someone made a movie with those words as titles !
Wargames is a term .
It is used widely to describe a specific type of games .
I realy do hope you win this case my friend , cause if you do n't then we all have to go under the will of the studios anytime they decide to use a title of a movie that uses common words somewhere .
It 's a case that will affect the whole web .
You better use this in your defence , make the judges understand that it's a matter of freedom of speech and not a simple copyright case .
Good luck with your legal battle and keep us updated on your progress .
Since you dont have any respect for copyright yourself , I hope that you loose and that you have to pay the legel expences for the other side .
You have used oscommerce ( http://www.oscommerce.com) to build your site .
An inexperienced user ( which you obviously are ) can set that up in under a day , so what you did the following 700 + days is beyond me ...
The copyright clearly states that you are * not* allowed to remove the copyright oscommerce text in the bottom of the page , which you did .
Just a comment on your wargames.com website : you should correct the aspect ratio for the games artworks .
The way it is now , with strictly " square " artworks , makes everything looks deformed , what in turn causes the site to be seen as unprofessional .
I do n't know if fixing those images will help you in your battle with MGM , but it 'll surely not harm it .
Also , you 'll probably see an increase in sales , since the more pleasant a site looks , more interested persons keep coming back .
to the guy complaining about OS Commerce 's tag .
The product is licensed under the General Public License , aka GPL .
They can REQUEST you keep the tag there , but the GPL is very specific that such modifications ARE permitted .
Some Open Source developers try to enforce unenforcable additional restrictions , but then they are violating the very license they are releasing their products under .
If they do n't like the GPL 's permissive nature as to changes like that , then they should choose a more restrictive license that better reflects that .
id like to donate to your legal fund .
you got a paypal account ?
post the details ...
The product is licensed under the General Public License , aka GPL .
They can REQUEST you keep the tag there , but the GPL is very specific that such modifications ARE permitted .
The makers of osCommerce require that you remove their logos and marks from the public facing portion of your store when you modify the software and templates .
My ecommerce software integrates extensively modified osCommerce code with additional database tables and a custom - programmed Java class library to bring data in from my suppliers and keep it up to date .
I 'm working on RSS feed support and some other stuff I need to contribute back to the project to fulfill the GPL , but it 's not ready for release , and it wo n't be finished until this legal hassle is resolved .
Just wondering about " Google " the movie ...
the main problem that wargames trademark was registered in 1983 ...
Not a problem at all .
War games have been played by military forces throughout history .
This " trademark " should never have been granted , and by pursuing this , they run the risk of losing it .
Look at Microsoft , and how they went after the company Lindows .
Microsoft essentially claimed that Windows users were too stupid to tell the difference between " Windows " and " Lindows . "
In court , it became apparent that the judge was going " revoke " the trademark on Windows as being an " everyday " word .
Microsoft settled with Lindows by paying THEM ( Lindows ) $ 20 m to change their name ( to Linspire ) , rather than risk losing the name " Windows . "
I see an awful lot of parallels , here .
I know you did not do it willingly , but thanks for actually fighting this .
Lawsuits like this are out of hand .
We need to stop all these corporate takeovers of the common people .
We make the internet what it is , a public forum for people to express ideas and in some cases make a buck .
Without us , the internet would just be a giant playground of advertising ( as it is getting closer to becoming thanks to Google text ads , pop-ups , and the like ) .
I would honestly look to either a :
boycott MGM and their movies ( War Games 2 especially )
or B :
Support their movies whole heartedly to show them they do not need to trample on people , but as fans , we will see good movies .
I have to lean toward option a right now .
We do not need MGM , they , and others , need us .
This reminds me of the Ford vs Jaguar case ( papers available here :www.eff.org)
I 'm sorry to hear they are trying to use lawyers to illegitimately steal your domain .
Just because they have an INTEREST in the domain name , does n't mean they have a RIGHT to it .
Hopefully the EFF can help you rally support for your battle .
Stick to your guns , Rogers , it wo n't be easy .
You actually appear to be a cyber - squatter yourself .
After checking the Wayback machine internet archive , you have had no website at wargames.com for the last eight years , even though you 've owned it for the last eight years .
It appears that you got notice from MGM and then put in your " 1,000 hours " of web development by using an open source shopping cart system ( possibly taking up one of the 1,000 hours to setup ) and then spending 999 hours finding images and descriptions of computer and board games related to warfare and loading them into the shopping cart .
I would hardly agree with you that that constitutes " development . "
If so , it significantly cheapens real web development .
This case appears to be a situation of a geek ( not derogatory , for I am one myself ) registering a domain name a long time ago because it had a special significance to him .
That significane being the movie of the same name .
You got a legalish notice from MGM , freaked out , and went into overdrive to concoct a legitimate appearing use for the name and are now pandering your " David and Goliath " situation to the internet community .
I hope MGM does take the name from you , just as you took it from the internet community and did nothing with it for so many years and now have a mediocre " store " in place .
When someone types in wargames.com , they are looking for the movie , not for a copy of " Rise of Nations " .
Let me ask you this , if I ordered a copy of one or more games , do you actually have them in stock ?
Are you even setup to take credit card payments ( other than Paypal ) ?
Now as much as I liked watching the original Wargames , I prefer playing
I have a credit card processor , sales and use tax permit and all the other stuff necessary to run an online business .
The main reason Wargames .
Com took two years to launch was because it's hard to get relationships with suppliers in a niche like tabletop and computer wargames .
I 'm still searching for somebody who can hook me up with Days of Wonder games like BattleLore and Memoir ' 44 , which are killer games created by a wargame designer here in Florida .
From The Browser Blog :
But wait !
The Browser is not an attorney , and does not play one on television .
But we noticed something curious about MGM 's trademark of the term .
Although the movie came out in 1983 , MGM did not bother applying for a trademark until 2001 - three years after Cadenhead got the domain .
If Cadenhead can prove he acted in good faith , that might be enough of a loophole to let him slay the MGM lion .
When someone types in wargames.com , they are looking for the movie , not for a copy of " Rise of Nations " .
I 'm curious who ' IP ' might be .
Is sockpuppets.com active ?
I 'm not a lawyer , but if they are requesting arbitration , that does n't sound like a legal fight .
It does n't involve any courts whatsoever .
Ca n't you countersue in court to get some sort of declaration that the domain is legally yours ?
It seems this would trump any results of private arbitration .
IP :
I 'm a computer and table - top gamer .
If * I * were to type in wargames.com , I 'd expect the sort of content already there .
Also , the domain name wargames.com was not " taken " from the internet community , it was purchased .
After he bought it , it was his to do with as he pleased for however long he owned it , including doing nothing .
Noone was wronged here , so stop trying to make a victim .
The word " wargames " has special significange to a lot of people like myself , and not because of a mediocre 80's movie - because it is a genre of game that we enjoy .
It seems most movie end in " ... themovie.com " , MGM should do exactly the same thing since war games is really a generic term .
Keep pushing - there 's little chance you 'll lose unless you give up !
When you talk to your laywer , ask if the phrase " Open , Notorious , Continuous , and Exclusive " might be of use in undermining their case and / or trademark .
Your lawyer should locate someone in the Pentagon who is willing to contribute as a friend of the court .
They would be good friends to have .
MGM may have a swamp full of lawyers , but the Pentagon has nuclear weapons !
Everyone keeps saying " wargames " is common .
I agree of course , and suggest that if push comes to shove , ask how they came up with the title of the movie .
The sequel is going to suck .
The premise even is n't all that original ( even the description of the characters are generic and unrealistic ... the hacker is handsome and has a cute girlfriend ?
That 's not reality ! ;) ) and the feel of " throw this together " is very strong .
WarGames was very culture - specific , but wowed people who did n't know computers back when you really had to know something about computers other than using the mouse to click the Start button like it is now .
It was a classic for a reason .
Sad to admit , I was actually going to try to write a sequel ( the right way , with respect to the original material ) before I found out about this abomination .
Sad that Hollywood is truly out of ideas .
Why do n't they just go after " wargamesmovie.com " like every other film out there nowadays that has a website ( which is virtually every one of them ) !?
( bs. )
Good luck !
do n't know if anybody has suggested it but i'd speak to the owner of nissan.com he had a 10 year long battle w/ the auto company over the rights to the domain and he won !
This Hole guy sounds like a ( ass ) Hole to me
Seems real simple to me : ( From a dictionary )
war game
noun Military .
a simulated military operation , carried out to test the validity of a war plan or operational concept : in its simplest form , two opposing teams of officers take part , and when necessary , military units of the required strength are employed .
[ Origin : 182030 ]
Term 's been around for a lot longer than their movie .
The two areas are different .
One refers to gaming stuff and one to a movie .
You cannot register a copyright or trademark for a name in an non-related field .
There are thousands of companies called Apex , and none of them are infringing .
Why ?
Bceause they are either in a limited geographical area or , more importantly in this case , in non-related fields of business .
So sure , nobody can make a movie called wargames without infringing on MGM 's trademarks .
But MGM came late and a valid business in a non-related field got there first and registered the domain .
Too bad !
MGM get thee back to thy ivory towers and sit on it .
And somebody for Godsakkes lose this money grabbing lawyer who gives humanity a bad name .
What a bunch of asshats .
They 're going to waste a ton of money on lawyers and fees .. all the while costing you more money .
When they could have just registered something like " wargamesmovie.com " ( which is being squatted by some dude in India ) .
But in this day and age the American business entrepeneur / consumer has no rights , if you have the money you can do anything .
From my experience and understanding the correct legal term for an internet domain is " fully qualifide domain name " .
If it was n't fully qualifided , how could you have registered it to begin with ?
Another thing that is perplexing legally , to me , is that I do n't understand how a fully qualifide domain name sould be considered any differently than the laws that cover fully qualifided names for vanity license plates for vehicles .
A judge would laugh someone out of court if they tried to take someones vanity license plate name from them !
Whats the difference ?
It 's fully qualifide vanity in my opinion .
There really is no trademark infringement going on , just a bunch of corporate welfare whining because they did n't act quick enough to register their vanity .
Too bad .
This country is sick .
I can't believe we my taxes went to pay for the opportunity to have such a ridiculous " electronic super - highway " .
It 's turned into the greatest corporate welfare give - away in the history of human industry .
You know it once was illegal to transact any commercial business on the internet .
When excatly did they change that law ?
The obvious answer :
Challenge them to a game of TIC - TAC - TOE , winner gets the domain !
Thanks for putting the story out .
And good luck with your fight , eh !
I know at least one movie I wo n't be seeing next year .
This is not an ad , nor am I associated with this firm , but Greenberg and Lieberman have lots of experience with domain names and large companies claiming trademark violation .
They 'll even talk with you about it some on the phone for free .
aplegal.com
Download the Domain Master podcast titled 92006 from www.webmasterradio.fm to hear an attorney from G&L discuss similar cases .
Good luck !
From what I 've read , trademark owners seem to prevail , even in cases of someone having a legitimate website running under a domain .
I 'd say your best bet is to fire up a boycott against the new movie ... maybe enough ruckus in the blogosphere may get them to change their minds .
But then again , it is a movie company , and from what I 've seen , they 're not too bright when it comes to public relations .
If they fuck you on this , I certainly wo n't be watching that film .
Yes , they 're filming a sequel and are sending out their goons to grab your site .
Apparently there will be a Wargames Follow - up called Something like Wargames : The Lost code or something .
Good luck with this one .
It 's another case of a huge company trying to steamroll the little guy because he has something they want .
The least they could do is offer to pay you a fair price for the domain and make you WANT to sell it .
I wish you luck , fight the good fight !
I feel for you bro !
We are in the same boat , you with MGM and me with Harrah 's over www.wsop.com.
Maybe we can join forces , exchange information , or whatever it takes to win !
I sent you an email as well .
I am not a Lawyer but as far as I know Trademarks are all tied to a domain .
If they registered " WarGames " then they had to register it with context , like , to movies , music for the sound track etc .
If you had a store that sold war games in the local mall their Trade Mark does n't apply to your domain ( unless that have trademarked WarGames in the retail domain as well ) .
Trademarks have to be filed for each domain in which you want protection , as I understand it .
Since as you put it 6 out of 9 people did n't even respond then their laywer knows he has a 67 % chance that you 're going to roll over without a fight .
I suggest that you have a lawer write a nasty letter back .
Talk to your lawyer about whether or not you should consider a counter suit to challenge their WarGames trademark on the basis that its simply 2 words combined or something to suggest that its bunk .
If you do that I suspect they 'll come to the table with an offer to settle with you and negotiation begins .
If they think you can potentially make a real threat to their trademark you 'll be in a better position to negotiate .
In my opinion , you could probably get them to pay you way more for the domain than you would probably ever make from your business or use of the domain .
I think you should get at least $ 5 million for the domain , IMHO !
David
Hi , I had the same with the domain deusto.com , that a publishing company in Spain , call Editorial Deusto , demanded from me , because they registered the mark 5 years after I registered the domain !!!!
You can read it in english here : wolfb.com
There are many posts about the case , but it was resolved at the end in Spanish , and I won .
If you want to contact me ( maybe I can help ) contact me at hombrelobo.com ( use the form on the right , please ) < >
Np ..
You are fine ...
Your site has been up an running for a long time .. I bought ny first game from you years ago ..
Rock on ..
dude your website is IMPOSSIBLE TO READ - omg -
As a part of the likely target demographic for this movie , I think someone in their legal department should have been able to work out the likely result of MGM rolling out a stupid , bullying lawsuit like this .
A strange game .
The only winning move is not to play .
As I understand it if they have not filed a trademark application for the name in your home country then they can have no claim on the name as they must be bound under the laws which govern the land you live in .
If however you live in America I wish all the very best to you and hope that things fall in your favour , I know how very corrupt the American legal system is in favour of the big corperations so I would recomend in that case you get a good lawyer - and do everything in your power to make as many people as possible aware of this case being brought against you .
If you do your PR work well then they will back off , as negative publicity is somthing that corperations do not want .
I had a similar threat from a gay pornstar whose stage name was kevin williams .
I told him to get lost because my name actually was kevin williams and not just a stage name .
he never contacted me again .
hey man , good luck - send e-mail to Colbert Report ( which he does not ) and if he has any balls he will make this story so embarrassing for mgm that they will apologize to you ... unbelievable these mgm assholes !!!
hope the movie ( if they make it ) will fail fail fail ...
Good luck !
Your site is operating in a different market , so trademark infringement should be irrelevant .
I guess it does n't stop lawyers bullying you so I hope you 'll get to keep it !
Dear Mr.Candenhead and friends ( please read please ) ,
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE !?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!
Look ...
I have nothing against Mr. Cadenhead PERSONALLY , but mgm deserves the domain name .
Mr. Cadenhead can switch to " .org " or " .net " ca n't he ?
MGM is a great company !
They ( and HBO ) make the greatest movies !
Mr.Cadenhead PLEASE GIVE MGM A CHANCE !!!!
You 've seen their movies !!!
People are saying that what they are making sucks !
GIVE THEM A BREAK !!!
READ THE ABOVE COMMENT
PLEASE READD IT !
READ THE COMMENT ABOUT READING THE COMMENT ADDRESED TO MR.CADENHEAD !
Why could n't MGM use the dot net ?
Is it so difficult for them to go after a domain that someone is n't already using that is n't just squatted on ?
Visitor , sounding like a paid industry plant does n't help their case or dissuade others from theirs .
Seriously , what does the " quality " of MGM 's movies have anything to do with this case ?
Oh right , nothing at all .
" GIVE THEM A BREAK " Who went after who here again ?
Why ca n't a company that has raked in millions upon millions selling shitty movies just give some random guy a " break " ?
Oh yeah , I remember , it 's because they 're a bunch of bloodsucking corporate hacks who will never be satisfied with having ONLY 3 different mansions and 5 different colors of the same car .
Gtfo .
To the moron that said give MGM a break .
If this lawyer and MGM had a frigging clue , they'd know that the domain names of movies are www.TitleOfMovieMovie.com ( like www.eragonmovie.com 20th century Fox ) or in MGM 's case they already do www.mgm.com as the official site .
Sony does the same thing ( www.sonypictures.com ) .
As a Web Design Company owner for the last decade ( dinosaur years in Internet time ) I 'd say MGM has to fire this Hole idiot .
He 's about to lose them a lot of money !
A first year law student could pokes massive holes ( pun intended ) in this one !
MGM should cut their loses ( that is , not registering Wargames.com before you did ) , and instead cut you a big check to place a banner on your site that links to their own hosted WarGames movie page .
You get to keep the domain , they get hits from your link , and everybody wins , right ?
Of course , they probably expected you to just lay down your arms at the sight of their mighty army of lawyers .
Because that 's how these big companies usually get their way , is n't it ?
Dont give up man , dont give up .
Too many big companies think they can push the little people round .
Dont give up .
If u start struggling for cash to fight with , u should set up one of those paypal donation type accounts .
If you 'd have had one now , I 'd have dropped $ 20 to you .
Not much , but if all the people commented did , it might help even a little with legal bills .
Supporters , go DIGG this story !

I hope that you win this case .
I came across this article looking for information regarding dealing with squatters .
While sites like BuyDomain.com really piss me off ( I am shocked by my own emotional response towards them ) because they effectively hold domains for ransom that they have no valid use for , which I feel stifles growth and great new potential websites .
But while I hate squatters , I in no way feel " big money " should be able to use the " legal " process to intimidate or bankrupt valid " small guys " .
Personally , I would love to see a major fine go against plaintiffs who lose a case ( making them think twice about a case where a valid user owns a domain [ or other court case ] ) .
Hold in there ... the big difference in your case and the ones you cite is that those really seem like sites intending to leverage the plaintiffs name with no " valid " use of their own .
You clearly have you OWN use .
Hi !
Wilserv Corporation ( www.wilserv.net), a company formed in 2002 wants my URL which I 've had since 2000 .
I 've been doing business as Wilserv Industries since abbout 1981 .
They complained to the World Intellectual Property Organization Arbitration and Mediation Center .
Now I 'm trying to understand the difference between that group and NAF .
Willi
Both groups can handle domain name disputes under the UDRP .
From my read of cases , WIPO 's more domain owner friendly and NAF 's the opposite .
Have you considered trademarking ' wargames ' yourself ?
There are 47 product categories of trademark , so it is possible for a single name to be legally trademarked by 47 different people ... which I am curious to see just how the arbitrators would sort out .
Trademarks are meant to prevent confusion among consumers about who manufactured which product , and protect a given business ' brand identity .
So long as you are not competing with a business in the same product category , you may market a good or service under the same name .
Unless MGM has trademarked all 47 product categories , you may be able to find one appropriate your own business that does not conflict with yours , in which case it would probably be first come , first serve .
Have you considered trademarking ' wargames ' yourself ?
I could n't get a registered trademark to sell wargames at Wargames .
Com .
My use would be dismissed as " merely descriptive , " just as MGM was rejected when it tried to register WARGAMES as a trademark for computer games ( in addition to movies ) .
I was the webmaster of Dellpromos.com when Nate Hole came .
I did n't own the domain but was using it with an agreement with the owner that I would share revenue .
I used the actual name , " Dellpromos.com " when I applied for an affiliate account with Dell .
It was accepted by them .
I acted as an affiliate for about 8 months before I got a cease and desist .
I had n't done anything without getting their permission but that did n't seem to affect them .
I shut down the site immediately and started a different site that did not infringe on the name , but even though they promised to give it affiliate status if I shut the other one down they lied the whole way through it .
I did n't cybersquat , I used the name with them being notified and approving me .
I only put up coupons and links to reviews for Dell products , no other company .
I wish I had owned the domain so I could have responded to their arbitration hearing but the owner did n't bother .
Do n't trust anything he ( Nate Hole ) says and good luck .
You know , Kelsi Grahmer ( sp ? ) was in a movie about war games involving submarines ... maybe MGM should sue him , too .
I mean , they say " wargames " atleast 3 times .
Also , I would like to know where the movie creators came up with the term .
I 'm sure if you did enough digging you 'd find that they stole the term from someone else , who should steal it back and give you free reign to run your non-infringing site .
Hi , y'all !
I am EXTREMELY pleased to report that WIPO decided in my favor .
See messages above dated January 21 , 2007 .
Mr. Cadenhead 's comment " WIPO 's more domain owner friendly and NAF's the opposite " provided me with some crucially needed moral support and proved to be prescient .
THANK YOU , sir !!!
Willi
OMG , it took you 2 years and 1000 hours to set up an OSCommerce site ?
OSC takes about 2 mins to install , an SSL cert takes an hour , payment gateway takes 2 days .
I really hope that you dont lose the domain , but if you didnt do anything with it for 7 years you might not have a leg to stand on .
We set up ecom sites all the time , 2 - 3 weeks max for a bespoke , custom , one off , technically advanced website .
I really really hope you can back up your " 2 years of work " claims , or your gonna lose the domain .
I 've seen it happen loads of times .
Congratulations on your victory !
I read the entire brief on the NAF website :
domains.nationalarbitrationforum.org
Could you please tell me what your final legals fees came to so I know what to expect when I get the letter ?
i love your war games and i loved to be in the war and i have my uncle that gose in the war his name is mat .
I hate to post this again , but no one answered back ,
Could you please tell us what your final legals fees came to so I know what to expect when I get the letter ?
I think it was around $ 4,000 , including legal fees , arbitration fees , and photocopy and mailing costs .
Hopefully you can turn this around and not only win , but counter them by having them pay your legal expenses and wasting your time .
Good luck .
Fight the good fight .
Are you sure it's N.J. Hole , and not A. Hole ?
FUCK PCK .. GSG ALL DAY EVERY DAY.I.E , RIVERSIDE COUNTY
I have to agree on pretty much every point .
This lawyer seems like a real nutcup too .
If the names been ' theirs ' since 83 then why havent they registered it long before 2008 .
Thats along time to wait to do something .
Also being acommon visitor of wargames.com
I have to say you honestly do have a unique purpose unrelated to the movies .
I wish you the best of luck in this case and can only believe the only chance they have against you is , twisting the laws to consort their needs .
Again , that lawyer is a schmuck , talk about doing whatever to make a buck .
ask them $ 10,000,000 for the name get a lawyer that will take 50 % of the winnings on contingency , If he wins but no fee if he does not .
This will play them at their own game
It will take them years of court cases
at least 10 years as each of your lawyers steps down ( at no cost to you )
the next get rich one will take his / her place !
tell lawyer before they
take on case that you will not settle for less than say $ 8 million .
you boys will either grown up & very rich or have the company & name by the time it is sorted out !
good luck ...
You should counter - sue MGM for making a movie bearing such simularity to the name of your website .
Furthermore , since it was such a crappy film , you should insist that they compensate you for tarnishing your website 's good name with their straight - to - video blunder .
I see wargames.com is still a gaming reference .
Yay !

Environment correspondent , BBC News website
Satellite instruments can distinguish " old " Arctic ice from " new "
The extent of " perennial " ice - thick ice which remains all year round - declined by 14 % , losing an area the size of Pakistan or Turkey .
The last few decades have seen summer ice shrink by about 0.7 % per year .
The drastic shrinkage may relate partly to unusual wind patterns found in 2005 , though rising temperatures in the Arctic could also be a factor .
The research is reported in the journal Geophysical Research Letters .
The change we see between 2004 and 2005 is enormous
Son Nghiem
September 2005 saw the lowest recorded area of ice cover since 1978 , when satellite records became available .
Perennial decay
This latest study , from scientists led by Son Nghiem of Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California , measures something slightly different from the extent of summer ice cover - the extent of " perennial " ice cover .
Perennial or " multi- year " ice is up to 3 m thick and survives through at least one summer .
It is different from " seasonal " ice , which is thinner and melts more easily , surviving for just one winter before succumbing to the summer sun .
See the Quikscat images from December 2004 and 2005
Enlarge Image
Using the scatterometer on Nasa 's Quikscat satellite , researchers scanned the Arctic for perennial and seasonal ice .
From October 2004 to March 2006 they plotted a steady decline .
When they compared figures for the 2004 and 2005 northern hemisphere winter solstices - 21 December - a huge change showed up .
" In previous years there is some variability , but it is much smaller and regional , " Dr Nghiem told the BBC News website .
" However the change we see between 2004 and 2005 is enormous . "
The area of perennial sea ice lost was about 730,000 sq km , with a huge loss in the East Arctic ( defined as north of Russia and Europe ) and a small gain in the West Arctic , north of the Americas and the Atlantic Ocean .
Stray winds
Continuous scatterometer data has been available only since 1999 , so for comparison researchers must use the records of summer ice extent - which is almost , but not exactly , the same thing as perennial ice extent .
Annual Arctic air temperatures relative to the 1961-1990 average
The key questions are what caused it , and whether it is an anomaly or the first sign of a major change of pace for Arctic melting .
Quikscat also monitors winds , and noted unusual patterns of wind in the East Arctic in 2005 which could be related , perhaps propelling old ice from east to west , though how that could explain such a drastic loss of perennial ice is not clear .
If the pace of Arctic melting is quickening , the implications for the future are not reassuring .
Ice reflects the Sun 's energy back into space ; open water absorbs it .
So a planet with less ice warms faster , potentially turning the projected impacts of global warming into reality sooner than anticipated .

We all know the problems that arise when we try to build multi-column layouts in which the columns are of equal height .
It has been well documented elsewhere , so I wo n’t go into the details here .
Article Continues Below
A project I recently worked on required an elastic layout with two columns of equal height , each with a different background color .
As usual , there was no way to tell which column would be taller .
I immediately thought of Dan Cederholm ’s Faux Columns , but I needed an elastic layout .
I also looked at the <!-- domain parked MAR2013 ; not commenting all of them out since that 's not part of the mission actually --> One True Layout <!-- --> , but this seemed buggy and required too much extra markup and too many hacks for my taste .
I even thought about using JavaScript to make sure the columns were of equal height , but that just felt wrong .
Out of desperation , I almost ( gasp ! ) used a table .
But no , there had to be a better way .
I just needed to think “ outside the box . ”
And what is outside the box ?
Borders .
If I could float my “ sidebar ” ( or “ rail ” ) div over the border of my “ content ” div , I could simulate equal - height columns no matter which one was the tallest .
If this sounds familiar , that ’s probably because a version of this method was introduced by Douglas Livingstone and extended by Holly
Bergevin and John Gallant at Position Is Everything .
While relying on the same core theory , the method presented here uses cleaner , less deeply nested markup , includes elastic and two - column layout variations , and generally benefits from having been developed in the post–One - True - Layout world .
Here is how it ’s done .
( Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
The HTML :#section2
< div id =" container " > < div id =" content " > This is < br /> some content </ div > < div id =" rail " >
This is the rail </ div > </div >
The CSS :#section3
# container{ background - color : #0 ff ; overflow : hidden ; width : 750 px ; } # content{ background - color : #0 ff ; width :600 px ; border - right : 150 px solid # f00 ; » /*
The width and color of the rail */ margin - right :- 150 px ; /* Hat tip to Ryan Brill */ float : left ; } #rail{ background - color : #f00 ; width : 150 px ; float : left ; }
I created a right border on the content div of the same width and color as the rail , then floated the rail div over it .
The margin - right :- 150 px on the content div allows the rail div to move into the newly vacated space .
If the content div is taller than the rail div , the border grows with it making it appear that the rail is growing .
I set the container ’s background color to match the content so if the rail div is the tallest , the container grows with it and it appears that the content column is growing .
It only takes a small change to the CSS to make the rail left - aligned , whether the content or the rail is taller .
See it in action or check out the elastic version ; try changing your font size and watch the layout change with it .
Three columns : three colors#section4
The three - column layout takes a slightly different approach : the borders are applied directly to the container div .
( I could have done this with the two - column layouts as well but I did n’t think of it at the time .
Line wraps marked » — Ed. )
The HTML :#section5
< div id =" container " > < div id =" center " >CENTER<br />COLUMN CENTER</div > < div id =" leftRail " >LEFT RAIL</div > < div id =" rightRail " > RIGHT RAIL</div > </div >
The CSS :#section6
# container{ background - color : #0 ff ; float : left ; width : 500 px ; border - left :150 px solid # 0f0 ; » /*
The width and color of the left rail */ border - right :200 px solid # f00 ; » /*
The width and color of the right rail */ } # leftRail{ float : left ; width : 150 px ; margin - left :- 150 px ; position : relative ; } #center{ float : left ; width : 500 px ; margin - right :- 500 px ; } #rightRail{ float : right ; width : 200 px ; margin - right :- 200 px ; position : relative ; }
Check it out .
The center column has a right margin of - 500 px .
This allows the left rail div to float all the way over it to the left edge of the center column .
Negative margins pull the sidebars into place .
There are a few ways to do this , but this one seems to work the best when we get to liquid layouts later on .
I ’ve floated the container div to honor the column heights instead of setting overflow : hidden .
This is because the sidebar div s are outside of the container div , floating over its borders , so they would be hidden using the overflow setting : IE does not hide them , but Firefox , correctly , does .
The columns do n’t need a background color .
Since the colors are set on the container div , which grows with the tallest column , the illusion of equal height is taken care of .
Liquid layouts #section7
After figuring out the fixed - width layouts , I decided to attempt liquid layouts using the same technique .
The sidebars would still need to be fixed - width since most browsers wo n’t respect a percentage - width border setting , but we can make the center column liquid .
The CSS :#section8
# container{ background - color : #0 ff ; overflow : hidden ; margin:0 100 px ; padding - right : 150 px ; /*
The width of the rail */ } * html # container { height:1 % ; /* So IE plays nice */ } # content{ background - color : #0 ff ; width : 100 % ; border - right : 150 px solid # f00 ; margin - right :- 150 px ; float : left ; } #rail{ background - color : #f00 ; width : 150 px ; float : left ; margin - right :- 150 px ; }
Take a look .
The markup is the same as the two - column , fixed - width version , with the exception of some additional content to show what happens when it wraps .
The CSS does n’t really change much either , but there are a few differences : the container two - column , fixed - width version no longer has a width , and I added height : 1 % so IE will respect overflow : hidden .
( I used the star HTML hack for this , but could have used conditional comments to include an IE specific style sheet . )
I also added a margin to create space on the sides ; this is optional .
The padding - right shrinks the space the content div will take up : since the content div now has a width of 100 % , if there was no padding on the container , the sidebar div would be outside of the container and hidden .
Finally , the content div ’s width switches from fixed width to 100 % , and margin - right : - 150 px is added to the sidebar div .
As with the two - column , fixed - width layout , the left - rail version requires only minor changes to the CSS .
I added a simple header and footer for grins , and you can view the source to see how it ’s done .
Three - column liquid layouts #section9
A three - column liquid layout with equal - height columns has been called many things : “ Holy Grail , ” “ One True Layout , ” “ pain in the @ $ $ ” …
The following technique is relatively painless , uses proper source order , does not require the use of an image , and seems to be bug - free .
The HTML :#section10
< div id =" container " > < div id =" center " > Center Column Content</div > < div id =" leftRail " > Left < br /> Sidebar</div > < div id =" rightRail " > Right Sidebar</div > </div >
The CSS :#section11
body { margin:0 100 px ; padding :0 200 px 0 150 px ; } # container{ background - color : #0 ff ; float : left ; width : 100 % ; border - left : 150 px solid # 0f0 ; border - right :200 px solid # f00 ; margin - left :- 150 px ; margin - right :- 200 px ; display : inline ; /* So IE plays nice */ } # leftRail{ float : left ; width : 150 px ; margin - left :- 150 px ; position : relative ; } #center{ float : left ; width : 100 % ; margin - right :- 100 % ; } #rightRail{ float : right ; width : 200 px ; margin - right :- 200 px ; position : relative ; }
The margin and padding go on the body this time .
The margin pushes the layout in from the edges of the screen , and the padding is the width of the sidebars .
The remaining area is the width that the container can grow to be : 100 % of the browser width minus margin and padding .
On the container div , I set borders and negative margins the same width as those borders .
This places the borders over the body padding , making everything fall into place .
Then we just can position the div s .
The next example illustrates a nested liquid two - column layout and a basic header and footer .
View source to see how easy it is to put the content into place and style it .
The nested two - column layout uses the border on the container technique .
This allowed me to add a 2 px left border to the content and a 2 px right border to the rail and overlap them , creating the full - height divider between .
This divider will grow with whichever column is tallest .
If you wanted to get carried away , you could eliminate the column div s and just position the pieces of content into place .
Because the sidebars are really the borders of the container div , they will still work .
If you really wanted to go crazy with it , you could eliminate the container entirely and put the borders right on the body , achieving a three - column liquid layout with columns of equal height and no container div s!
The only problem is that the background color of the center column cannot be a different color from the rest of the body — and eliminating the containers makes it much more difficult to position and style things … but it can be done .
I should note again that these techniques only work with fixed - width sidebars , as only Opera lets you set a border width using percentages .
Also , the rails cannot have an image for a background , but that may change with the border - image property in CSS3 .
So there you have it : multiple columns , equal column heights , fixed or liquid center column , clean markup , and CSS .
All it took was a little thinking outside the box .
Check it out .
Those gifts paid for a small staff and a gallery of random - motion machines , including a pendulum with a lighted crystal at the end ; a giant , wall - mounted pachinko - like machine with a cascade of bouncing balls ; and a variety of electronic boxes with digital number displays .
In one of PEAR ’s standard experiments , the study participant would sit in front of an electronic box the size of a toaster oven , which flashed a random series of numbers just above and just below 100 .
Staff members instructed the person to simply “ think high ” or “ think low ” and watch the display .
After thousands of repetitions  the equivalent of coin flips  the researchers looked for differences between the machine ’s output and random chance .
Analyzing data from such trials , the PEAR team concluded that people could alter the behavior of these machines very slightly , changing about 2 or 3 flips out of 10,000 .
If the human mind could alter the behavior of such a machine , Dr. Jahn argued , then thought could bring about changes in many other areas of life  helping to heal disease , for instance , in oneself and others .
This kind of talk fascinated the public and attracted the curiosity of dozens of students , at Princeton and elsewhere .
But it left most scientists cold .
A physics Ph.D. and an electrical engineer joined Dr. Jahn ’s project , but none of the university ’s 700 or so professors did .
Prominent research journals declined to accept papers from PEAR .
One editor famously told Dr. Jahn that he would consider a paper “ if you can telepathically communicate it to me . ”
Brenda Dunne , a developmental psychologist , has managed the laboratory since it opened and has been a co-author of many of its study papers .
“ We submitted our data for review to very good journals , ” Ms. Dunne said , “ but no one would review it .
We have been very open with our data .
But how do you get peer review when you do n’t have peers ? ”
Several expert panels examined PEAR ’s methods over the years , looking for irregularities , but did not find sufficient reasons to interrupt the work .
In the 1980s and 1990s , PEAR published more than 60 research reports , most appearing in the journal of the Society for Scientific Exploration , a group devoted to the study of topics outside the scientific mainstream .
Dr. Jahn and Ms. Dunne are officers in the society .
News of the Princeton group ’s experiments spread quickly worldwide , among people interested in paranormal phenomena , including telekinesis and what people call extrasensory perception .
Notable figures from Europe and Asia stopped by . .
Keith Jarrett , the jazz pianist , paid a visit .
For a time , the philanthropist Laurance Rockefeller visited regularly and donated money for research .
Allofmp3.com has more than 300,000 tracks
The lawsuit was filed in New York on behalf of Arista Records , Warner Bros , Capitol and UMG recordings .
They are suing Moscow - based Mediaservices , which runs Allofmp3.com and another music site , allTunes.com .
The record labels say the sites are selling songs without permission .
But Allofmp3.com argues it is paying royalties to a Russian licensing body .
The music industry says that the Russian licensing group does not have the authority to collect and distribute royalties .
Allofmp3.com sells albums for about $ 1 ( 60 p ) and charges only a few cents for songs .
By contrast , the world 's most popular music download service , iTunes , charges $ 10 ( £ 6 ) for an album .
' Massive infringement '
Allofmp3.com is already facing legal action from the British Phonographic Industry , on behalf of UK record labels .
" The defendant 's entire business ... amounts to nothing more than a massive infringement of plaintiffs ' exclusive rights under the Copyright Act and New York law , " according to papers filed as part of the US legal action .
Visa and MasterCard have stopped accepting credit card transactions for purchases made at Mediaservices ' sites .
Allofmp3.com says it pays royalties to a body called Roms , which granted the site its licence to operate .
Roms says the Russian constitution gives it the right to license music to allofmp3.com , even if it has not obtained permission from the copyright holders .
It also claims to collect royalty payments from the download site on behalf of record companies and artists .
" Allofm p3.com 's activity is quite legitimate , " said Roms general director Oleg Nezus .
" The opinion of foreign copyright owners is just that - their opinion , " he told BBC Russian.com .
But the BPI and the International Federation of the Phonographic Industries has said Roms has " no rights from the record companies whatsoever to license these pieces of music " .
The National Union of Teachers ( NUT ) said Judge Jonathan Finestein was " out of date " in his attitude .
The boy from Irlam , Greater Manchester , appeared at Salford Youth Court accused of racially abusing a fellow pupil .
But Judge Finestein adjourned the case , saying the boys would have got " a good clouting " in his day .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Nobody is more against racist abuse than me but these are boys in a playground ; this is nonsense
Judge Jonathan Finestein
Send us your comments
On adjourning the case until 20 April , he asked prosecutors to reconsider whether the case was in the public interest .
However Judith Elderkin , NUT National Executive member , said the judge should have taken the allegation of racism more seriously .
She added that she thought he was " out of date " with the way issues are dealt with in schools today .
The boy is accused of abusing an 11 - year - old pupil in a school playground between 1 July 2005 and 30 January 2006 .
He is accused of calling the pupil names including " Paki , nigger and Bin Laden " .
During the preliminary hearing the court was told the boys are now friends and play football with each other .
' Reverse decision '
But Judge Finestein said he thought the decision to prosecute the youngster was " crazy " and urged the Crown Prosecution Service to reconsider its decision .
The judge said when he was at school he was repeatedly called " fat " , but in those days the headmaster would have just given the children a " good clouting " and sent them on their way .
" Have we really got to the stage where we are prosecuting 10 - year - old boys because of political correctness ? " he said in court .
" Nobody is more against racist abuse than me but these are boys in a playground ; this is nonsense .
" I think somebody should consider reversing the decision to prosecute . "
A spokeswoman for Greater Manchester Police said the force took all crimes seriously and was totally opposed to any racism .
That Robin wrote well is something of which no reader of these pages will need any persuading .
That he made fine public speeches is something that has also been much and rightly recalled since his death .
But when I think about him now , I think of something else .
I think of his ability , whether over a meal table , in a corner of a bar or just sitting in his office , as a talker .
Robin was fun to listen to , fun to talk to and , above all , fun to talk with .
He possessed all the essential attributes of the good talker .
He savoured the language , and he enjoyed his own facility with it .
He drew on a wide range of literary and historical knowledge .
But he also had perhaps the most important quality of all in a talker .
Though his talk was not without the competitive aspect that is always part of the best conversation , he also possessed the enthusiasm to make talk a collaborative activity too .
He had the instinctive ability to listen to the other person and to respond , not just on his own terms , but on yours too .
I had been thinking about this ability as a talker ever since the announcement that his funeral was to take place in St Giles ' Cathedral .
For the thing I distinctly remember about the cathedral from my previous visit , long ago , is the brass relief memorial there by Augustus St Gaudens of the bed - ridden Robert Louis Stevenson , pen in hand .
Though this mention of Stevenson may appear a non sequitur , it is anything but .
For if ever the world produced a prince and paragon of talkers , it was Stevenson .
We know this from his friends .
Stevenson 's talk was almost incessant , they recalled .
As a student , he was already celebrated for his sparkling conversation .
Later , visitors remarked that when he was on form he talked and laughed all the time .
On the day of his death in Samoa in 1894 , his biographer Jenni Calder writes , Stevenson was " bright with talk " .
But the best evidence of Stevenson the talker comes from Stevenson the writer .
Stevenson 's essay Talk and Talkers , written in 1882 , is a piece that makes one glad to be alive .
When you read it , and though its author is a hundred years and more dead , it is as though a new friend , bursting with life and wit , has suddenly settled himself in a neighbouring armchair to delight you with a string of dazzling observations on the joys and rewards of good conversation .
To excel in talk , Stevenson says , is simply the best ambition we can have .
It is both a private and a public accomplishment .
Talk does not merely make us good company to our friends and family , he says , it also enables us to " bear our part in that great international congress , always sitting , where public wrongs are first declared , public errors first corrected , and the course of public opinion shaped , day by day , a little nearer to the right " .
Yet talk must not be dismissed as an inferior , preparatory stage of human communication before an idea reaches its supposedly higher , written form .
On the contrary , says Stevenson - and what an astonishing thing this is for a great writer to say - literature is but " the shadow of good talk " , an imitation that falls " far short of the original in life , freedom and effect " .
While talk is always fluid and tentative and involves giving and taking , written words are fixed and dogmatic , as well as constrained by form and tradition .
" In short , " argues Stevenson , " the first duty of a man is to speak ; that is his chief business in the world ; and talk , which is the harmonious speech of two or more , is by far the most accessible of our pleasures .
It costs nothing in money .
It is all profit .
It completes our education , founds and fosters our friendships , and can be enjoyed at any age and in almost any state of health . "
It is tempting for me to sit back and let Stevenson simply take over here , to piggy - back on his brilliance by summarising and quoting further large parts of this wonderful humanistic credo .
But I have other points I wish to make , and you will have to read for yourself how sensitively he grasps that conversation advances on the basis of trust and tact , that it not only tolerates but encourages a certain ostentation , digression and allusion - " the whole flotsam and jetsam of two minds forced in upon the matter in hand from every point of the compass " - and that the profit of talk is not in being proved neatly right or wrong , but from the exercise itself and the unpredictable enlightenment that comes from the congress of minds .
Few of us can hope to talk like a Stevenson .
Yet even to read his essay is to recognise that it is a guiding light .
We develop and are educated partly by direct experience and partly by focused study , but particularly also by talking to others and by learning with and from them .
Unless we talk , albeit mostly not with the fluency of a Stevenson or a Cook , we will never be truly educated - drawn out - or even , as the Victorians might have put it , improved .
And a precondition of such talk , as Stevenson says , is that we must be prepared to " lay ourselves open " , to be prepared to listen as well as to speak , to acknowledge that we do not know the answers before we pose the questions .
Bill Clinton used to see himself as a politician at the heart of what he called " the conversation " .
His was a conversation about many things - the role of government , the failure of world socialism , the persistence of inequality and much more - but at its heart was a recognition that wooden dogmatisms ( Stevenson 's phrase ) provided no solutions , and that neither he nor we knew the answers to the questions that the conversation continually posed .
Some of my best friends work on the Today programme .
Yet it seems to me that our public talk in this country is now being relentlessly drained of the elements that make such talk rewarding .
Politicians , indeed , are now trained specifically not to answer interviewers ' questions .
Instead they are told to remain focused on making the predetermined points in the party " line to take " .
Their interrogators are no better , seeking little more than to hector , embarrass and oversimplify .
The consensual creativity and freedom of true talkers , trusting and trusted , is wholly absent , almost wholly subordinated to egotism , adversarialism and melodrama .
Little or nothing now remains of the " great international congress , always sitting " of which Stevenson wrote so exhilaratingly and of which Robin Cook was one of the last exponents .
The art of talking , the thing that makes human beings what they are , has become a refuge for recusants .
Our public discourse has become unworthy of the name and will remain so unless and until we decide to change it .
Maybe it is time we talked about it .

Exceptions in C
This is a small page for my hack in plain C ( not C++ ) ---
Implementing Exceptions in C Programming language , written by Adomas Paltanavičius .
What I have to show is the tarballs and source .
There is also outdated low - level documentation ( PDF , 80 KB ) .
It was written few years ago as a school project , and might be inaccurate etc .
Newest version is 0.1.5 released on April 10th , 2005 .
Brief introduction
This hack implements fully - functional nested exceptions with these constructs :
try
except
on
throw
Also , it allows to define various datatypes for exception object ( default is int , can be anything from char * to struct foo * ) .
History
This idea came from I do not know where , yet it resulted into quite interesting hack .
Example program
The example program demonstrates nearly all capabilities of this hack .
It consists of two files : a header containing customizations to the core , and main source file .

Mikulski Urges Sec. Rice to Honor Slain Maryland Serviceman , Extradite Convicted Killer
“ We must make clear to Lebanon that it will not benefit from U.S. assistance and support as long as it harbors this brutal terrorist and murderer . ”
WASHINGTON , D.C. – Senator Barbara A. Mikulski ( D - Md. ) and Senator Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) today urged Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice to take immediate action and formally request that the Government of Lebanon arrest and extradite convicted killer Mohammed Ali Hamadi to the United States .
Hamadi was serving a life sentence in Germany for the 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and killing of U.S. Navy diver Robert Dean Stethem , 23 , of Waldorf , Md . He was paroled after 19 years in December 2005 , and is known to be hiding in Lebanon .
TWA flight 847 from Athens , Greece , to Rome was hijacked to Beirut , Lebanon , where hijackers beat , shot and killed Petty Officer Stethem and dumped his body on the tarmac .
He was the only casualty during the hijacking ordeal , in which 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days .
The text of the letter from Senator Mikulski is provided below :
January 10 , 2006
The Honorable Condoleeza Rice
Secretary of State
2201 C Street , NW
Washington , DC 20520
Dear Secretary Rice :
We are writing to urge you to formally request that the Government of Lebanon immediately arrest and extradite to the United States Mohammed Ali Hamadi , the cold - blooded murderer and terrorist who has sought refuge in Lebanon since being released from German custody last month .
As you know , Hamadi brutally murdered a United States Navy diver , Robert Dean Stethem .
Petty Officer Stethem was 23 years old and from Waldorf , MD .
He was killed solely because he was an American serviceman .
Hamadi and his fellow terrorists bound , gagged , beat unconscious , and then shot Petty Officer Stethem in the head when they hijacked a jetliner traveling to Rome in 1985 .
The terrorists dumped Petty Officer Stethem ’s dead body out of the plane onto the Beirut tarmac , proving the utter indifference for life that is the hallmark of such despicable people .
In 1989 , Hamadi was convicted of murder and sentenced by German authorities to a prison term that ended last month .
The German government ignored repeated requests by the United States to turn Hamadi over for prosecution and released him instead to his native Lebanon .
We ask that you exert the strongest possible diplomatic and political pressure on the Government of Lebanon to secure Hamadi ’s handover to U.S. custody .
The families of our servicemen always hear that “ a grateful nation never forgets . ”
We need to make sure these are more than just words .
The current administration has rightly taken a strong stand against those nations who provide safe haven for terrorists .
We must now make clear to Lebanon that it will not benefit from U.S. assistance and support as long as it harbors this brutal terrorist and murderer .
Petty Office Stethem was killed because he was a United States serviceman .
As United States Senators , we are grateful for his service and want to see justice done .
Thank you for your prompt , personal attention to this issue .
Sincerely ,
Barbara A. Mikulski
United States Senator
Jim DeMint
United States Senator
Babes in arms
Enlarge Image
Using a robot submersible , researchers saw the tiny squid Gonatus onyx carrying its eggs in a sac almost the same size as its body .
Writing in the journal Nature , they say this helps the baby squid to survive after they hatch .
But care comes at a price , as months of holding the eggs in its arms weakens the adult and may make it easy prey .
Squid generally place fertilised eggs on the ocean floor and leave the young to fend for themselves .
Deep diving
Gonatus onyx is one of the most common squid in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans .
It spends most of its life in shallow waters , but will dive to 2-3,000 m when spawning .
Now , a remotely operated submarine of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute ( MBARI ) in California has shown a far more spectacular behaviour .
Reporting their observations in the journal Nature , Brad Seibel and colleagues write : " We observed five squid , each holding an egg mass in its arms , at depths between 1,539 and 2,522m . "
Using tools on the submersible , the team was able to capture adults , eggs and hatchlings for analysis .
Gonatus onyx is only about 20 cm long and in comparison to its size , the egg sac is enormous , almost doubling the animal 's length .
The eggs are held between two thin membranes , open at both ends .
A trade - off
The researchers observed the mothers flushing water through their stock of 2,000 - 3,000 eggs , presumably to bring them aerated water .
The new brood
Enlarge Image
Brad Seibel , who is currently at the University of Rhode Island , believes this is the first time brooding behaviour has been documented in a squid , prompting the question : " Why do they do it ? "
As with all animals , reproduction is a trade - off between different issues surrounding survival and energy .
Laying eggs on the ocean floor is quick and costs little in terms of energy ; the penalty is a lowered chance of survival for the young .
Carrying the eggs around is far more expensive in energy terms , and does seem to affect the mothers severely .
Researchers found evidence that their muscles lose strength over time , perhaps meaning they are more vulnerable to predators .
However , it does increase the chances for their eggs to mature , develop and swim off to form a new generation .
I ’m sure there ’s a whole team of UI designers , programmers , and testers who worked very hard on the OFF button in Windows Vista , but seriously , is this the best you could come up with ?
Every time you want to leave your computer , you have to choose between nine , count them , nine options : two icons and seven menu items .
The two icons , I think , are shortcuts to menu items .
I ’m guessing the lock icon does the same thing as the lock menu item , but I ’m not sure which menu item the on / off icon corresponds to .
On many laptops , there are also four FN +
Key combinations to power off , hibernate , sleep , etc .
That brings us up to 13 choices , and , oh , yeah , there ’s an on - off button , 14 , and you can close the lid , 15 .
A total of fifteen different ways to shut down a laptop that you ’re expected to choose from .
The more choices you give people , the harder it is for them to choose , and the unhappier they ’ll feel .
See , for example , Barry Schwartz ’s book , The Paradox of Choice .
Let me quote from the Publishers Weekly review : “ Schwartz , drawing extensively on his own work in the social sciences , shows that a bewildering array of choices floods our exhausted brains , ultimately restricting instead of freeing us .
We normally assume in America that more options ( ‘ easy fit ’ or ‘ relaxed fit ’ ? ) will make us happier , but Schwartz shows the opposite is true , arguing that having all these choices actually goes so far as to erode our psychological well - being . ”
The fact that you have to choose between nine different ways of turning off your computer every time just on the start menu , not to mention the choice of hitting the physical on / off button or closing the laptop lid , produces just a little bit of unhappiness every time .
Can anything be done ?
It must be possible .
iPods do n’t even have an on / off switch .
Here are some ideas .
If you ’ve spoken to a non - geek recently , you may have noticed that they have no idea what the difference is between “ sleep ” and “ hibernate . ”
They could be trivially merged .
One option down .
Switch User and Lock can be combined by letting a second user log on when the system is locked .
That would probably save a lot of forced - logouts anyway .
Another option down .
Once you ’ve merged Switch User and Lock , do you really need Log Off ?
The only thing Log Off gets you is that it exits all running programs .
But so does powering off , so if you ’re really concerned about exiting all running programs , just power off and on again .
One more option gone .
Restart can be eliminated .
95 % of the time you need this it ’s because of an installation which prompted you to restart , anyway .
For the other cases , you can just turn the power off and then turn it on again .
Another option goes away .
Less choice , less pain .
Of course , you should eliminate the distinction between the icons and the menu .
That eliminates two more choices .
We are down to :
Sleep / Hibernate
Switch User / Lock
Shut Down
What if we combined Sleep , Hibernate , Switch User and Lock modes ?
When you go into this mode , the computer flips to the “ Switch User ” screen .
If nobody logs on for about 30 seconds , it sleeps .
A few minutes later , it hibernates .
In all cases , it ’s locked .
So now we ’ve got two options left :
(1) I am going away from my computer now
(2) I am going away from my computer now , but I ’d like the power to be really off
Why do you want the power off ?
If you ’re concerned about power usage , let the power management software worry about that .
It ’s smarter than you are .
If you ’re going to open the box and do n’t want to get shocked , well , just powering off the system does n’t really completely make it safe to open the box ; you have to unplug it anyway .
So , if Windows used RAM that was effectively nonvolatile , by swapping memory out to flash drives during idle time , effectively you would be able to remove power whenever you ’re in “ away ” mode without losing anything .
Those new hybrid hard drives can make this super fast .
So now we ’ve got exactly one log off button left .
Call it “ b’bye ” .
When you click b’bye , the screen is locked and any RAM that has n’t already been copied out to flash is written .
You can log back on , or anyone else can log on and get their own session , or you can unplug the whole computer .
Inevitably , you are going to think of a long list of intelligent , defensible reasons why each of these options is absolutely , positively essential .
Do n’t bother .
I know .
Each additional choice makes complete sense until you find yourself explaining to your uncle that he has to choose between 15 different ways to turn off a laptop .
This highlights a style of software design shared by Microsoft and the open source movement , in both cases driven by a desire for consensus and for “ Making Everybody Happy , ” but it ’s based on the misconceived notion that lots of choices make people happy , which we really need to rethink .
Sun damage can lead to deadly skin cancer
The bulk of the deaths are from skin cancers caused by excess exposure to the sun 's harmful rays , ultraviolet radiation , says WHO .
UVR also causes sunburn , triggers cold sores and ages the skin , according to its report , the first to outline the global health burden of sun exposure .
Simple measures , such as covering up when in the sun , could cut the deaths .
Death toll
Dr Maria Neira , Director for Public Health and the Environment at WHO , said : " We all need some sun , but too much sun can be dangerous - and even deadly .
" Fortunately , diseases from UV such as malignant melanomas , other skin cancers and cataracts are almost entirely preventable through simple protective measures . "
WAYS TO AVOID TOO MUCH SUN Limit time in the midday sun Wear protective clothing including hats and sunglasses Use sunscreen of sun protection factor 15 +
Avoid sunlamps and tanning parlours Source : World Health Organization
More than 1.5 million " disability - adjusted life years " or DALYS - a measure of the loss of full functioning due to disease and death - are lost every year due to sun exposure , WHO believes .
WHO and the World Tourism Organization of the United Nations are urging people to be extra-vigilant when out in the sun to protect themselves from UVR
Everyone is exposed to UVR from the sun .
Small amounts are beneficial to health , and play an essential role in the production of vitamin D by the skin .
However , overexposure to UVR is associated with a variety of serious and deadly health problems .
Harmful rays
UVR levels vary with the time of day and year .
Levels are highest when the sun is higher in the sky , typically between 10 am and 2 pm .
Latitude and altitude also alter exposure .
The closer to equatorial regions and the higher the altitude , the higher the UVR exposure .
Similarly , the ground you walk on can be important .
Grass , soil and water reflect less than 10 % of UVR , fresh snow reflects as much as 80 % , dry beach sand about 15 % and sea foam about 25 % .
UVR can neither be seen nor felt , therefore , UVR measurements , such as the global solar UV index , are necessary to determine precisely the extent of ground level UVR .
These add up all the solar UVR , taking account of its ability to cause skin damage .
The higher the UV index , the higher the risk of skin and eye damage .
When the UV Index predicts radiation levels of 3 ( moderate ) or above , sun safety practices should be taken , WHO recommends .
Laura - Jane Armstrong , cancer information officer at Cancer Research UK , said : " This report provides clear evidence of the dangers of over - exposure to the sun , highlighting the number of global deaths from skin cancer and other risks the sun can pose to our health .
" Our key message is not to burn .
To help protect yourself in the sun you should spend time in the shade during the middle of the day , cover up with a shirt and hat , and use factor 15 + sunscreen . "
Referring back to Sunday ’s post Hundreds of UFOs sighted over UK skies , you may recall I was interested to know what Lynne Featherstone had actually asked to prompt Derek Twigg ’s response .
Well after searching the Parliament website for an hour , I decided it would be a lot quicker and easier to just email the MPs and ask them what they said .
So far only Lynne Featherstone has replied , but she was kind enough to send me her original question and the full response from Mr Twigg .
Unidentified Flying Objects Lynne Featherstone :
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many reported unidentified flying object sightings his Department ( a ) received and ( b ) investigated in the last five years .
Derek Twigg : Since January 2001 the Ministry of Defence has received 714 reports of unidentified flying objects .
Reports are analysed solely to consider whether there is any reason to believe that UK airspace has been compromised by the reported activity .
Of the 714 reports received , only 12 were deemed to be worthy of further consideration , and none of these were considered to demonstrate any threat to the integrity of the UK Air Defence Region .
Overall it ’s not terribly exciting , but it got me thinking and I intend to ask more questions .
As I ’m wondering if Lynne Featherstone is a bit of a UFO buff ?
Does anybody know if any other MPs are interested in UFOs ?
UPDATE : there are now lots of sightings and reports on Cryptoworld .
One possible answer to all of this can be found here Lights , Lanterns and UFOs !

About six weeks ago , I was at the Newark Museum , working on a radio story , when my cell phone rang .
I could n't get to it in time , nor did I recognize the telephone number under " calls missed . "
It was loud and chaotic and I was busy .
But I called back anyway .
I 'm glad I did .
It was Brooke Allen , a neighbor of mine , and he was boiling with excitement about some project he was working on .
He started going on and on ( a thing Brooke does ) , and I said , " Look .
Make it short .
I have to get back to work . "
Well , the bottom line was Brooke thought this project was significant enough that he wanted to hire his own personal reporter to follow it .
And that personal reporter , as you may have guessed , turned out to be me .
Brooke 's project was hiring a computer programmer .
Brooke trades stocks , but he does it all quantitatively .
He uses math , computers and psychology to beat the market ; algorithms , not opinions .
Over Christmas , Brooke had a skiing accident , and while his foot was up , he wrote a computer game -- called the Behavioral Finance or BF Game -- to simulate stock market behavior .
He wanted to hire a young programmer to run this game for him , de -bug it , and get it out on the internet , so that he could learn even more about how people behave in markets .
But Brooke works in a somewhat arcane computer language called APL ( A Programming Language ) , which was taught in colleges back in the 70's and not much since , and there are n't too many people who know it .
So he decided that if there was n't a market in APL programmers , he 'd create one .
He put an ad in The New York Times , got 300 applicants , gave them a test by e-mail , narrowed the field to 38 , invited them in for pizza and to play the BF game and then gave them an unusual proposition : they could stick around , learn APL and maybe get a job with him .
His company had some raw space that was n't being used .
So Brooke gave the job candidates a can of paint , some cheap chairs and tables , and they built a classroom .
I spent much of the next four weeks behind a video camera recording the whole thing .
As I began telling my friends this story , it reminded them of the TV show " The Apprenctice . "
So I started watching it -- and recording it for Brooke , who could n't be bothered with such piffle .
What I was recording in Jersey City was , in its own way , a reality show .
But as the weeks progressed , the differences became clear .
While the conceit of the Trump show is that somebody has to get fired every week , the conceit of Brooke 's show was to keep everybody in .
When one of job candidates was about to withdraw from the project because the BF Game had crashed her computer , Brooke gave her a computer to replace it so that she would stay in .
In the end , when the class had finished , 12 people had stayed for the whole thing .
Brooke brought each of them in for an interview , one by one .
But instead of asking them which of their peers they 'd fire -- as Trump does -- he asked which of their peers they 'd hire .
One name came up in every interview .
And that was the person Brooke decided to hire .
Today , in New York City , he 's going to try to get jobs for the rest .
He 's introducing them to members of APL community , people who work in that computer language and might need smart young programmers .
Pete Donnelly , who runs Dyalog , a UK company that sells APL commercially , has even flown in .
Over the weekend , I forced Brooke to watch " The Apprenctice . "
On Monday , in one of the 196 e-mails I have received from Brooke since this process began , Brooke described his alternate vision :
Now if we could just get a TV game show , where instead of starting with a bunch of people every week and firing someone , we start with one person and they have to find a way of gainfully employing a new person each week .
Since each new person will have to do the same , if it grows by a power of 2 , we could end a 26 week series with 67 million people employed , rather than 25 people fired .
That 's how the guy thinks .
Here , by the way , is the press release for the event .
If you know any unemployed programmers , or business reporters looking for a good story , pass it on .

Researchers help define what makes a political conservative
– Politically conservative agendas may range from supporting the Vietnam War to upholding traditional moral and religious values to opposing welfare .
But are there consistent underlying motivations ?
Four researchers who culled through 50 years of research literature about the psychology of conservatism report that at the core of political conservatism is the resistance to change and a tolerance for inequality , and that some of the common psychological factors linked to political conservatism include :
Fear and aggression
Dogmatism and intolerance of ambiguity
Uncertainty avoidance
Need for cognitive closure
Terror management
" From our perspective , these psychological factors are capable of contributing to the adoption of conservative ideological contents , either independently or in combination , " the researchers wrote in an article , " Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition , " recently published in the American Psychological Association 's Psychological Bulletin .
Assistant Professor Jack Glaser of the University of California , Berkeley 's Goldman School of Public Policy and Visiting Professor Frank Sulloway of UC Berkeley joined lead author , Associate Professor John Jost of Stanford University 's Graduate School of Business , and Professor Arie Kruglanski of the University of Maryland at College Park , to analyze the literature on conservatism .
The psychologists sought patterns among 88 samples , involving 22,818 participants , taken from journal articles , books and conference papers .
The material originating from 12 countries included speeches and interviews given by politicians , opinions and verdicts rendered by judges , as well as experimental , field and survey studies .
Ten meta-analytic calculations performed on the material - which included various types of literature and approaches from different countries and groups - yielded consistent , common threads , Glaser said .
The avoidance of uncertainty , for example , as well as the striving for certainty , are particularly tied to one key dimension of conservative thought - the resistance to change or hanging onto the status quo , they said .
The terror management feature of conservatism can be seen in post - Sept. 11 America , where many people appear to shun and even punish outsiders and those who threaten the status of cherished world views , they wrote .
Concerns with fear and threat , likewise , can be linked to a second key dimension of conservatism - an endorsement of inequality , a view reflected in the Indian caste system , South African apartheid and the conservative , segregationist politics of the late Sen.
Strom Thurmond ( R - South S.C. ) .
Disparate conservatives share a resistance to change and acceptance of inequality , the authors said .
Hitler , Mussolini , and former President Ronald Reagan were individuals , but all were right - wing conservatives because they preached a return to an idealized past and condoned inequality in some form .
Talk host Rush Limbaugh can be described the same way , the authors commented in a published reply to the article .
This research marks the first synthesis of a vast amount of information about conservatism , and the result is an " elegant and unifying explanation " for political conservatism under the rubric of motivated social cognition , said Sulloway .
That entails the tendency of people 's attitudinal preferences on policy matters to be explained by individual needs based on personality , social interests or existential needs .
The researchers ' analytical methods allowed them to determine the effects for each class of factors and revealed " more pluralistic and nuanced understanding of the source of conservatism , " Sulloway said .
While most people resist change , Glaser said , liberals appear to have a higher tolerance for change than conservatives do .
As for conservatives ' penchant for accepting inequality , he said , one contemporary example is liberals ' general endorsement of extending rights and liberties to disadvantaged minorities such as gays and lesbians , compared to conservatives ' opposing position .
The researchers said that conservative ideologies , like virtually all belief systems , develop in part because they satisfy some psychological needs , but that " does not mean that conservatism is pathological or that conservative beliefs are necessarily false , irrational , or unprincipled . "
They also stressed that their findings are not judgmental .
" In many cases , including mass politics , ' liberal ' traits may be liabilities , and being intolerant of ambiguity , high on the need for closure , or low in cognitive complexity might be associated with such generally valued characteristics as personal commitment and unwavering loyalty , " the researchers wrote .
This intolerance of ambiguity can lead people to cling to the familiar , to arrive at premature conclusions , and to impose simplistic cliches and stereotypes , the researchers advised .
The latest debate about the possibility that the Bush administration ignored intelligence information that discounted reports of Iraq buying nuclear material from Africa may be linked to the conservative intolerance for ambiguity and or need for closure , said Glaser .
" For a variety of psychological reasons , then , right - wing populism may have more consistent appeal than left - wing populism , especially in times of potential crisis and instability , " he said .
Glaser acknowledged that the team 's exclusive assessment of the psychological motivations of political conservatism might be viewed as a partisan exercise .
However , he said , there is a host of information available about conservatism , but not about liberalism .
The researchers conceded cases of left - wing ideologues , such as Stalin , Khrushchev or Castro , who , once in power , steadfastly resisted change , allegedly in the name of egalitarianism .
Yet , they noted that some of these figures might be considered politically conservative in the context of the systems that they defended .
The researchers noted that Stalin , for example , was concerned about defending and preserving the existing Soviet system .
Although they concluded that conservatives are less " integratively complex " than others are , Glaser said , " it does n't mean that they 're simple - minded . "
Conservatives do n't feel the need to jump through complex , intellectual hoops in order to understand or justify some of their positions , he said .
" They are more comfortable seeing and stating things in black and white in ways that would make liberals squirm , " Glaser said .
He pointed as an example to a 2001 trip to Italy , where President George W. Bush was asked to explain himself .
The Republican president told assembled world leaders , " I know what I believe and I believe what I believe is right . "
And in 2002 , Bush told a British reporter , " Look , my job is n't to nuance . "

Best fit theoretical rotation curves superimposed on data ( dotted lines ) from galaxy “ NGC 4455 ” ( left ) and galaxy “ NGC 5023 ” ( right ) .
The solid line is the curve predicted by the new gravity model .
Also shown are the Newtonian curve ( short dashes ) and the Newtonian curve corrected for dark matter ( long dashes ) .
There are few scientific concepts as intriguing and mysterious as dark energy and dark matter , said to make up as much as 95 percent of all the energy and matter in the universe .
And even though scientists do n't know what either is and have little evidence to prove they exist , dark energy and dark matter are two of the biggest research problems in physics .
But what if they were conceived in error ?
This is what three Italian physicists have recently asked .
In a paper in the August 3 online edition of the Institute of Physics ' peer - reviewed Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics , they put forth the idea that scientists were forced to propose the existence of dark energy and dark matter because they were , and still are , working with incorrect gravitational theory .
The group suggests an alternative theory of gravity in which dark energy and dark matter are effects – illusions , in a sense – created by the curvature of spacetime ( the bending of space and time caused by extremely massive objects , like galaxies ) .
Their theory does not require the existence of dark energy and dark matter .
“ Our proposal implies that the ' correct ' theory of gravity may be one based solely on directly observed astronomical data , ” said lead author Salvatore Capozziello , a theoretical physicist at the University of Naples , to PhysOrg.com .
Dark energy and dark matter were originally conceived to explain , respectively , the accelerating expansion of the universe ( despite the tendency of gravity to push matter together ) and the discrepancy between the amount of matter scientists expect to observe in the universe but have not yet found .
Astronomers suggested the existence of dark matter when they noticed something odd about spiral galaxies : Stars at the middle and edge of a spiral galaxy rotate just as fast as stars near the very center .
But according to Newtonian mechanics ( the physics of bodies in motion ) , stars further away from the galactic center should rotate more slowly .
Scientists thus assumed that some sort of “ dark ” matter , not observable by emitted light , must be boosting the total gravity of the galaxy , giving the stars extra rotational speed .
“ We can show that no ' exotic ' ingredients have to be added to fill the gap between theory and observations , ” said Capozziello .
In their paper , he and his co-authors demonstrate this using data from 15 well - studied galaxies .
Among this data was each galaxy 's “ rotation curve , ” a graph that plots the rotational speed of the stars in the galaxy as a function of their distance from the galaxy 's center .
These curves were successfully fit to curves produced using the new theory .
Since these 15 galaxies are believed to be dominated by dark matter , fitting their rotation curves using this new gravity model is strong evidence to support an alternative theory of gravity .
Despite this , the notion that dark matter and dark energy are “ wrong ” is potentially very unpopular .
Capozziello and his colleagues are aware that a new theory of gravity impacts the dynamics of the universe as scientists now understand them .
“ Any extended theories of gravity must be tested on all the astrophysical scales , ranging from the Solar System to galaxies to galaxy clusters , and all of cosmology , ” said Capozziello .
“ Performing these tests is the cornerstone of our research program . ”

Motivating others : why " it 's good for you " does n't work
" What matters is what they do when the clicking stops . "
That was the central theme in the New Media Interaction Design courses I taught at UCLA Extension ( Entertainment Studies dept ) .
We all want to motivate our users ( customers , learners , kids , employees , members , etc. ) , but motivate them for what ?
What do we hope they 'll do when they stop clicking / listening / reading ?
More importantly , how do we make it happen ?
Question 1 : What do we want our users to do ?
And no , we do n't get to say , " know more . "
That 's not an action .
" Like us more " is not an action .
Even my favorite , " kick ass " is not an action .
How many people take a course in Design Patterns and then go right back to work and write the same clunky code , reinventing the flat tire ?
How many customers interact with a web app and then ... just leave ?
How many people say they care deeply about a cause , but do nothing beyond bumper - sticker activism ?
How many people listen to a lecture on the dangers of smoking , but keep smoking ?
There is nearly always an action ( or set of actions ) you 're hoping users will take , and most of you already know what that is .
But we also know that this sometimes involves a change in behavior , something that 's extremely hard to do .
So it 's really the next question that matters more :
Question 2 : How do we motivate them to do it ?
That 's where broccoli and optimism come in ( I promise I 'll get there in a moment ) .
We all know we can't simply slap motivation on another person .
All we can do is design an experience to help them motivate themselves .
If we get them to spend time on our web site , and they have a good experience , but then leave without doing anything -- and never come back -- does it really matter that they had a Good User Experience ?
Is a good experience an end in itself , or is it a means to something else ?
For much of what we design , what matters is what happens when the clicking stops ( or for many web apps , just before the clicking stops ) .
So , we really have two levels of motivation ... motivation to interact and motivation to do something as a result of that interaction .
Motivation to interact is something we 've talked about quite a bit here ... things like the flow state , levels / superpowers , spiral experience design , painting a compelling picture with clear steps to getting there , blah blah blah .
This post is about inspiring post - interaction action .
And it all comes back to broccoli .
And optimism .
The main points are :
1 ) Trying to motivate someone to action by telling them it's good for them does n't ... actually ... work .
There 's way too much statistical evidence ( not that any of us need more evidence than our own personal experience ) , that not only is " ... because it 's good for you " NOT motivating , even the extreme case of , " ... because you will DIE if you do n't ... " often fails !
Smoking , weight loss , lack of exercise , too much alcohol or drugs .
We all know what is and is n't " good for us , " yet too many of us still are n't motivated enough to DO something about it .
So we must ask ourselves :
" If people do n't are n't motivated to make changes even under the threat of death , what on earth will motivate them ? "
In a controversial but powerful article in Fast Company ( from May 2005 ) called " Change or Die " , there are some insights and examples .
You need to read the whole thing for the full context , but this quote gives a strong hint :
" The conventional wisdom says that crisis is a powerful motivator for change .
But severe heart disease is among the most serious of personal crises , and it does n't motivate -- at least not nearly enough .
Nor does giving people accurate analyses and factual information about their situations .
What works ?
Why , in general , is change so incredibly difficult for people ?
What is it about how our brains are wired that resists change so tenaciously ?
Why do we fight even what we know to be in our own vital interests ?
Kotter has hit on a crucial insight .
" Behavior change happens mostly by speaking to people 's feelings , " he says .
" This is true even in organizations that are very focused on analysis and quantitative measurement , even among people who think of themselves as smart in an MBA sense .
In highly successful change efforts , people find ways to help others see the problems or solutions in ways that influence emotions , not just thought . "
Unfortunately , that kind of emotional persuasion is n't taught in business schools , and it does n't come naturally to the technocrats who run things -- the engineers , scientists , lawyers , doctors , accountants , and managers who pride themselves on disciplined , analytical thinking .
There 's compelling science behind the psychology of change -- it draws on discoveries from emerging fields such as cognitive science , linguistics , and neuroscience -- but its insights and techniques often seem paradoxical or irrational . "
Or to put it another way , telling you to eat broccoli because it 's good for you does n't work because it does n't invoke the right feelings .
And even the threat of death does n't invoke the right feelings .
( Not that fear is n't a powerful motivator , but it 's not motivating in the ways we might think ... )
Which brings us back to , what does motivate ?
Optimism .
Hope .
In the Fast Company article , they talk about reframing / recasting the reasons why you should do something .
Rather than using " it 's good for you " or even the hard - to - believe - it - does n't - work " you 'll DIE if you DON'T , " some health - related programs have much more success by emphasizing pleasure .
From a doctor in the article : " joy is a more powerful motivator than fear . "
Yes , this whole " duh " post is to reinforce the cliche : focus on the positive .
( And if you 're wondering why an article on making health changes is in a business magazine , you 'll have to read the whole thing to see how they apply it to work behavior and culture as well , especially in the area of change . )
But what prompted me to dig out that old article was the most recent Fast Company article , Moving Pictures , about the Oscar - nominated entrepreneur Jeff Skoll , the man behind Participant Productions - -" the first film company to be founded on a mission of social impact through storytelling . "
Skoll is also the guy who made Al Gore 's new film , An Inconvenient Truth happen .
Skoll recognizes that simply " raising awareness " of issues is of little value unless people take action .
From the article :
" For each project , Participant execs with nonprofit backgrounds reach out to public - sector partners , from the ACLU to the Sierra Club , for their opinions .
If those partners do n't think they can build an effective action campaign around the film , it 's a no - go ...
" It ca n't be good - for - you spinach , or it 's not going to work . "
[ I used broccoli instead of spinach because that whole recent Killer Spinach thing in the US wrecked the metaphor ]
And here 's the optimism part :
" In the face of challenges ranging from global warming to threats to civil liberties , Skoll aims to inspire hope , then action .
" Time and time again , you see this outpouring from people once they 're made aware they can do something , " he says .
" That 's the principle that drives this company . "
And even if you 're not trying to get someone to take action for social change or to save their life -- something Meaningful with a capital " M " -- remember that meaningful with a lowercase " m " matters too .
If your software , book , or service helps me learn more , spend more time in flow , kick ass a bit more at work , or even just have fun playing a game ... you 're bringing a bit more joy into my day .
And THAT is meaningful to me .

Excellent article .
It blows me away at how relevant this is to the current on - goings in American politics .
How information / issues are wrapped up ( or not ) has had a lot to do with how folks have voted .
Great article .
Highly informative .

Helping users kick ass is great , but what about when what you are asking them to do is a selfless act ?
How is the user kicking ass when they change their lightbulbs to energy - efficient or even changing their diet to go vegan ?
I 'd love to mull this over with anyone who comes to the Take Back The Web conference .
Posted by : Chris Anderson | Sep 29 , 2006 6:25:04 PM
Chris : good question ... and one for the scientists , but the thing is , it 's probably very difficult to consider anything as 100 % selfless .
Helping others is inherently pleasurable to the brain , and for good reason -- we needed to work together to survive .
The question is how to emphasize ( and provide ) the good feelings ?
One of the reasons people get involved in causes is because they learn more about it , get better ( high resolution experience ) and gain recognition and community from doing it .
Where you find ( most ) people doing " selfless " acts , you find people forming communities and recognizing one another .
Not that this is the only reason , as I said ... even if nobody but YOU knows you " did good " for someone else , it triggers -- for most of us - - a pleasurable response .
The scientists have different , interesting views on this :
http://www.amazon.com/Generous-Man-Helping-Others-Sexiest/dp/1560257288
http://www.amazon.com/Altruism-Equation-Scientists-Origins-Goodness/dp/0691125902/sr=1-86/qid=1159577718/ref=sr_1_86/102-6951434-2843313?ie=UTF8&s=books
You 're right , though , it needs a lot more thought .
The point is , simply telling people what they SHOULD do ( eat better , stop smoking , use better coding practices , document ! , etc. ) has much less success than motivation through invoking a more positive emotional feeling around it ... " would n't it be cool if you could do ... "

Hey there .
Long time reader , first time commenter .
On a related note to this article , earlier this week I wrote an article about the relevance of feelings ( along with several other things ) to getting yourself to take action ; it 's not so much aimed at creating passionate users as creating a passionate self , but you might find it interesting anyway .
Taking a leaf from your running theme that " brains are interested in things related to sex " , I titled it " Seven Self - Help Secrets You Can Learn From S& M ... Sales and Marketing , that is ! " . ;-)

Kathy ,
Another insightful and thought - provoking entry , thank you .
I referred to the same article from FC in numerous conversations -- the examples are indeed powerful .
For self - motivated people like us it is particularly fascinating to try and figure out how to motivate others .
There are many considerations about leadership and inspiration that might help bridge the gap between knowing that something is good and actually doing it .
I have found that when force is applied , even when self - directed , an equal or stronger force is reflected back .
Posted by : Valeria Maltoni | Sep 30 , 2006 8:33:51 AM
This was kind of funny to read for me .
Since I make jewelry and other artwork , no one who buys from me could possibly be motivated by " you 'll DIE if you do n't " .
I 've always emphasized the fun and individuality angle with my pieces .
But when it comes to motivating my kids , all too often it ended up being " you 'll DIE if you do n't because I 'll see to it personally " :-)

A recent article might lend some support here .
It 's called " Strategy and the Smoker " ( http://davidmaister.com/articles/4/81/) and also makes the point that all of us can know what to do , how to do it and why we should ( broccoli ! ) and still not do it .
Life is not about understanding - it 's about detremnation and resolve .
We help others when we assist them with increasing their desire and determination to achieve .
The rest we can leave to them !

This was a great thing for me to read .
I teach people how to Brand themselves in an industry where Branding is done hardly at all .
After consulting people to do this , there is no doubt they get it , but I think most people do n't have the self image to do it .
So this was a very intersting read for me , gave me some insight .
Thanks .

Interesting article .
Brocolli is perhaps a better example of motivation than you think .
It turns out that we have genes ( from a family called TASS2R genes ) that make Brocolli more bitter to some people than others .
Broccoli tastes bitter to everyone , but to those with two particular TASS2R genes it tastes very bitter indeed .
So bitter that brocolli is inedible for these people .
Luckily there are other vegetables that are just as good for you as Broccolli and that do n't taste bitter for two TASS2R gene people .
The moral of the story :
There will always be some people who will need very different motivation to make the changes expected of them .
It 's not that they are bloody - minded or stubborn , or that they are just resisting out of human habit .
For some people , change really is very hard indeed .
These people need completely different motivation to the rest of us .
Our challenge is to find it .
I love brocolli by the way .

Using reverse psychology to persuade people to do good things :
" Energy Conservation : It 's BAD for you ! "
" Hot Sex and Preserving the Rainforests : they go together !
Save the rainforests , so you can have hot sex in them . "
" Buy a Green Car , piss off your gasoline - loving parents ! "
" Do n't slim down , it 's DIRTY ! "

great article , right on the nail head again .
( and excellent ' further - readings ' article ( Strategy and The Fat Smoker ) from David Maister too .
Anthony Robbins stated the power of " fear and pleasure " and how these can affect changes .
I believe in your article , you are stating that the power of pleasure ( to initiate change ) is greater than fear .
Anthony wrote it otherwise ;)

Great post .
I 'm always amazed by the " fire and brimstone " approach taken by all kinds of lifestyle critics because in most cases it has the opposite effect .
I would like to second Graham Hill 's notion about people having different motivational needs .
It 's easy to say anyone and everyone would be more motivated by some added joy in their lives ; however , there are a fair share of folks who are swayed by statistics and warnings .
A mixed message , or distinct targeted messages , with all these things ( joy , stats , etc. ) is often necessary to cover the gamut of personality types .
Posted by : Mike Lunt | Oct 1 , 2006 4:56:30 PM
I 'd like to stand up for the pessimists and give you one method of motivating that works every time and is entirely negative .
But it is a way of getting the crap stuff done .
What you need is to find something that an individual finds absolutely appalling ( eating brocolli for example or in my case making telephone calls ) .
Once you have that you can get an individual to do some really crap jobs , as long as one alternative is * less * appalling .
Would you like to eat some brocolli or clean the toilet with your tongue ?
Would you like to mow the lawn or make some cold calls ?
Try it .
You 'll be amazed how many crap jobs you can get done as long as you give yourself an alternative that is really , really unpleasant .
P.S. This trick works almost as well with toddlers as it does with adults .

Why do we want to motivate others by implanting our own motivation into them and trying to convinve them that they should want what we believe they should want ?
A strong motivation is a very simple stark powerful thing .
All the reasons for it are secondary .
Some are stepping stones across which the motivation was arrived at or recognized .
Others are rationalizations .
Put your finger on the button of any one of our strongest motivations , make a clear and easy path for us to fulfill it , and get ready to handle serious traffic .
I see the goal as learning what the user wants rather than teaching the user what they can get , even when the thing to be wanted and gotten is identical in both cases .

Posted by : Vera Bass | Oct 2 , 2006 8:38:26 AM
There was a training session I went to about workplace safety once .
One of the things that they were talking about was motivation and the bases behind learned behaviour .
It was described that there were two elements to learned behaviour .
Firstly , is the outcome of this activity good or bad .
Secondly , is the outcome of this activity immediate or deferred .
( this also incorporated the probability of the outcome )
Basically something that is bad is generally a poorer motivation for learned behaviour than something that is good - and something that is deferred is poorer than something that is immediate .
I suspect that the majority of cases where " do this or you 'll die " has failed to motivate have been where the outcome ( ie. death ) is deferred .
To maximise the motivation to do the right things in these cases the challenge is to convert a bad / deferred outcome into a good / immediate outcome .
And , of course , merely telling someone about an outcome ( whether good or bad ) is probably going to have a deferred effect - meaning that you 're starting from a difficult position .

I absolutely love this article and am planning to head over to my own blog to rattle on about it as soon as I comment here .
As a Shakespeare geek I often find myself fighting the battle of the broccoli -
Why do we have to read Macbeth ?
Because it 's good for you .
Bleh .
It 's obvious that the argument does n't work , just look at the number of kids that come out of a Shakespeare class ( or , realistically , calculus , organic chemistry , or any number of pick your least favorite courses ) thinking " Wow , that was great ! "
Sure , a certain percentage did n't have to be forced .
Some people actually like broccoli , too .
I once caught myself answering the " Why learn Shakespeare ? " question with the answer , " Because your life will be better . "
I really and truly believe that .
I feel that it 's been my experience .
But good heavens does it sound like a pretty hefty statement with no good way to back it up !
I love the ideas expressed here , and as soon as I hit the Post button I 'm going to be off brainstorming on how I can apply them to the " Why learn Shakespeare " question .
Just do n't tell my boss , since that 's not what I do for a living :) .

Posted by : Duane | Oct 3 , 2006 7:31:45 AM
Duane : I can not WAIT to see what you come up with on the " Why Learn Shakespeare " question : )
It 's obvious that you appreciate how it makes your life better ... the hard part is translating that into something others can understand ( and find motivating ) .
One possible tip I have for coming up with those answers is to just keep imagining someone asking you WHY or WHO CARES to whatever you say .
So you start with , " because it makes your life better " and someone says , " WHY ? " and you respond .
And whatever you say next , the person still says , " SO ? " or something like that .
Keep doing this until you get to something really interesting and specific , and you might have that compelling , intruiguing answer .
We have to go through this exercise for so many of the things in our book ...
" Write your code this way because it 's the way you should do it " does n't cut it ; )
omni : Interesting point about the " deferred " benefit .
I had n't been thinking about that much , but you 're right -- the instant reward is better than the deferred one .
We try to find * anything * that might be considered an intermediate motivator ( i.e .
" You are on your way ... you are making progress " ) or to at least keep reminding them that the Big Benefit is going to be there , and just think of how cool it will be when you 're there ...
Whenever possible , though , we try to find milestones / steps / levels along the way to getting to that ultimately - deferred benefit , and use them as motivators ( or at least reminders ) .
vera : " I see the goal as learning what the user wants rather than teaching the user what they can get , even when the thing to be wanted and gotten is identical in both cases . "
Very , very well said , and I think that 's a crucial distinction ( and the right one to make ) .
This quote is going in my Must Remember
This file .
Thanks .
Phillip : Thank - you for the pointer !
I really liked your post ( and now I 'm interested in your book , too ) .

I read this article from my rss reader , and after this article my reader showed up another article , what a coincidence !
A new study from the British Economic and Social Research Council and reported today in the Washington Post finds that fear and guilt are actually poor motivators when it comes to getting people to change unhealthy habits .

This topic is so relevant to mediators who struggle with why more people do n't choose mediation as a problem - solving tool .
While we do much to raise awareness through volunteer efforts , we 've neglected to persuade using emotion .
Mediation works because parties can regain peace of mind and a sense of control in their own lives .
It can reduce stress and return the joy of being acknowledged and understood to the lives of consumers .
I plan to share this gem with all the mediators who I coach and read my blog .
Thanks .

I totally agree with the fact that it requires emotions to change .
Without emotions , no motivation .
Period .
I do n't entirely agree , though , with the part about it having to be positive emotions , or optimism .
I believe that there are two kinds of people :
* the ones that are driven by the things they want to have or reach , so people that are thinking , feeling and going TOWARDS their goals
* people that are driven by the things / situations they do n't or no longer want .
These people are thinking , feeling and moving AWAY FROM things to reach their new situation .
So , I also believe that to motivate this first kind of people , it is very important to have them experience the positive feelings of reaching their goal , the joy and pleasure of doing what they want to do .
But the second kind of people need to feel the misery and pain ( negative feelings ) linked to the situation / thing they no longer want to get motivated .
You do n't motivate these people with the joy of the goal but with the pain of what they are leaving behind , IMHO .
So , emotions are really essential in changing people !
But what kind of emotions depends on the kind of person you 're dealing with , I believe .

Let 's begin with how important cholesterol is to the human body .
Cholesterol belongs to a group of fats referred to as Sterols .
Chemically it is not a fat , although Sterols are found in all fats and oils especially animal fat .
The chief sources are eggs , egg yolk , liver , kidney , brain , fish oil and oysters .
It is also found in a lesser degree in meat , whole milk , cream cheese and butter .
Cholesterol is commonly thought of as a poison and something to be avoided at all cost .
Nonsense !
This is a mistruth .
Let me explain .
Did you know that the majority of the dry weight of the brain is comprised of cholesterol ?
Did you have any idea that the sheath nerve endings from the top of your head to the bottom of your spine are wrapped in cholesterol ?
Did you know that cholesterol serves as a conductor for the transmission of all nerve ending throughout the body ?
Did you know that if you received even the slightest 1 / 4 inch cut , you would bleed to death if not for cholesterol ?
Johns Hopkins University studied children that were fed low cholesterol diets from birth .
The study concluded and confirmed that this was the reason they all suffered stunted brain growth .
Cholesterol manufactures every hormone in the human body , every one of them : progesterone , estrogen , testosterone , T1 , T3 by the thyroid , etc .
It 's a natural function of your body .
Your liver manufactures cholesterol all day long .
You could n't have sex without cholesterol .
It is the very important part of fluid in the body .
If you eat an egg or butter , your liver ceases to produce the same substance , cholesterol .
When you do n't eat eggs , butter , or cheese , your liver starts to manufacture cholesterol .
If you eat vegetables , it will start to manufacture cholesterol .
So you see that your body has a check and balance , it 's a very wonderful thing .
The medical profession does n't know much about it because it 's nutritionally based information and medical doctors are only given 30 hours of nutritional guidance during their entire medical education .
In fact , most Americans are even unaware that medical doctors know nothing about nutrition .
Fortunately some are now beginning to look at nutrition as more and more patients with chronic illnesses show no improvement under the care of pharmaceutical drugs .
Very few average Americans even know that most medical schools were created and are subsidized by large pharmaceutical companies .
In the late 1800 's drug companies literally bought out medical colleges , universities and hospitals .
They moved in and put an end to homeopathic and herbal medicine and created a massive drug empire .
Prior to that most colleges were homeopathic and herbal , that 's how we practiced natural medicine then .
Harper Grace Hospital and U of M were homeopathic hospitals in the late 1800's .
Sadly , this information has been kept from us .
Statin Drugs
In my opinion , there are only two reasons that man as a species lies :
Personal Gain .
To make money .
Drug companies desire to scare Americans using this controversial cholesterol hysteria because they want to sell you cholesterol - lowering drugs .
They are referred to as Statin Drugs .
It is documented that the use of Statin drugs lower the brain 's ability to function , hence lowering intellect levels .
Statin drugs destroy Vitamin E and prevent COQ10 from being absorbed by the body .
COQ10 and Vitamin E are essential for good and correct heart function .
The Shute Clinic , located in Canada , proved that point 70 years ago however , we dismissed this by commenting ,
" Those Canadians are crazy . "
So the madness spirals when the heart starts to fail .
Then you go to a heart doctor and he 'll put you on more medication .
The fact is that Statin drugs made 14 billion dollars in this country last year .
You wonder why the company you work for will no longer pay for your health insurance benefits .
Benefit premiums are on the rise , primarily due to the cost of an ever - increasing population and an ever - increasing amount of prescriptions .
Someone has to pay for the increase in prescription drug use , so once again you see , you pay !
Another part of the problem today is that medical doctors are not reading their own medical journals .
Go to the public library and look up the medical book " Tabers 16th edition " page 1909 .
This states that the true cause of arterial sclerosis and heart attacks is the ingestion of an excess amount of carbohydrates , which go into the liver .
The carbohydrates that we eat are no good for the liver , including cookies , donuts , pop , pretzels and candy bars .
When these types of foods go into the liver the liver then properly tries to convert them to good cholesterol , as that is its function .
The liver converts them to the only thing they can be converted to which are Triglycerides and Diglycerides .
These are poison !
Triglycerides and Diglycerides are an unnatural sticky form of fat that the liver then pushes into the arteries .
What happens when they go into the arteries ?
You get a rise in the bad cholesterol .
When you get the bad cholesterol too high you then have a heart attack .

This article aims to demystify the many , often confusing , aspects of cholesterol metabolism , while showing how to improve your cholesterol profile .
For eighty years now we 've been on oleomargarine , which is a form of polymer plastics and high in trans fatty acids , which are poison to our body .
In fact heating up margarine and bad oils is how BIC makes their pens .
The body just does not have the ability to process and use oils and margarines that are heated .
Once every sixty seconds someone in America has a heart attack and we wonder what is the reason for this ?
It is due to the ingestion of bad fats and carbohydrates .
A Nation Of Mis-Truths
Where did this theory that Cholesterol is a poison and causes heart disease start ?
Bear with me a moment .
John Wayne told the American public in his westerns that the Indians were savages that scalped people .
Wounded Knee told us that the U.S. Government created scalping because they offered buffalo hunters 10 dollars a piece for Indian scalps .
Columbus claims that he discovered America .
This is just an impossibility because Erik the Red sailed up the Hudson River 400 years earlier , and came in contact with an indigenous people who had populated the land for the previous 1400 years .
Not to mention that Columbus , who we celebrate yearly , enslaved the Native Americans to mine for gold and then lopped off their hands if he thought they were stealing it .
Of course genocide followed soon after .
The white man 's desire to run and own everything was the Native Americans ultimate demise and the demise of our entire health care system also .
It 's all about capital .
Our nation was founded on mistruths !
I welcome you to investigate any of this information .
I challenge you to research for yourself and find your own truths .
Do not rely on anyone 's opinion find out for yourselves .
Its sad that lies have become truths and truths have become lies in our history and in our lives .
Good Or Bad Cholesterol
In the late 1800 's a Russian researcher wanted to prove that Cholesterol was no good for you .
He promptly set out to prove it and did .
He took a group of rabbits and fed them what would be an equivalent of what a human would eat in a quart of butter or animal fat a day .
The experiment went on for 3 months and at that time he destroyed the animals and opened them up .
When he opened them up he found that the arteries were corroded .
There were lesions , arterial sclerosis , and the findings brought out the determination that cholesterol was not good for you .
Then societies viewpoint changed .
Cholesterol lowering drugs were invented , low - fat cheese , low - fat milk , and the thought evolved to throw the egg yolk away .
If God intended a yolkless egg he would have made one .
An egg white cannot be properly digested if not consumed without the egg yolk .
It becomes a sugar and not healthy for the body either .
If you look at any animal , in nature , you will find 4 to 5 % butter fat content in their milk .
This is also true of mother 's milk .
This is one of thee great benefits of breast - feeding .
Meanwhile , all the data was accepted as fact and truth .
Another researcher came along years later , and said this data is a lie !
" You can not take animal fats and protein and feed it to a herbivore . "
Rats , pigs , monkeys and humans are omnivores .
They can eat anything ; they can survive on anything and are completely capable of eating animal fats .
This researcher created his own test .
He fed rats the same amount of lard and butter as the previous test and did his test for a three - month period .
Then he opened up their arteries and do you know what he found ?
Close your eyes , what do you see ?
Exactly , nothing !
Because we as humans are perfectly capable of ingesting fats , metabolizing fats , and utilizing fats .

Dietary fat is not an enemy .
In fact , when adequate amounts of good fats ( unsaturated ) are consumed , it can improve one 's health and athletic performance .
Learn what these good fats are and how they keep the body function properly .
Fats yield twice as much energy than carbohydrates do .
If you eat a high fat diet in the morning it will sustain your energy straight through to lunch .
When this researcher took his new research to the powers that be , he was stunned .
Too much money is made off of the production of low fat products and cholesterol lowering drugs .
Lard Sandwiches :
As a side note , when my grandfather would go out to plow all day long , my grandmother would pack him lard sandwiches on whole wheat bread .
He was n't a nutritionist , so did n't know that what he was doing was a good thing .
However , he did live to be 98 years old and was slender and muscular his entire life .
What Is Lard ?
The white solid or semisolid rendered fat of a hog .
My Diet :
Today if you tell someone that you eat eggs they think you are going to die .
When I was weight training I ate between 4 and 5 eggs a day and all the men I worked with at General Motors felt sorry for me .
They were sure : I would die of a heart attack , while they consumed bagels , donuts , crackers , etc .
I am sorry to report that the majority of those men are no longer with us as they died form heart attacks .
FACT : When I was bodybuilding with the great Vince Gironda , I was on a six - week bulk - training course , where I was trying to gain size .
I was eating up to 35 eggs a day .
At the end of the 6 weeks I had my cholesterol levels checked and they had actually gone down 5 points .
I still eat 3 to 5 eggs every morning .
I 've done so for the last 30 years of my life .
I have an omelette with raw milk , cheese , mushrooms and onions .
Hippocrates states that the word protein means " most important . "
The three finest proteins for the human body are eggs , raw milk and liver .
I supplement with liver tablets from Argentina , every day along with the five eggs a day that I eat .
Mother Nature gives you about 200 to 250 edible foods in nature that we are capable of consuming .
When I was a child and grew up on a farm in Illinois , they lived predominantly on a high fat diet including sausage , fish , bacon , eggs , turkey , cheese , milk , cottage cheese and butter .
They put butter on everything .
My grandfather lived to be 98 and my grandmother 101 .
Indian Joe was a man that lived with my Grandparents and worked for food and shelter .
He consumed only meat products , never any fruits or vegetables and he lived to be 115 .
A Vicious Circle :
When somebody tells you that cholesterol is bad for you , they tell you that so that they can make money .
Then they can sell you prescription drugs , while you support companies like Coca - Cola that sell you pop , cookies , and donuts that increase your cholesterol .
It 's a big vicious circle and it is all to make the almighty buck .
We put our children on Ritalin and people take Prozac or Statin drugs .
Of course it all makes money and it is all affecting your health , negatively .
Some wise man once said about 2000 years ago , " The love of money is the root of all evil . "
Medical doctors and drug companies would n't lie to you , would they ?
Let 's remember that doctors only receive about 30 hours of nutritional education during their entire tenure as a medical student .
You do not need to be anti-government to realize that doctors prescribe you drugs because they mean to help , but instead because they are encouraged to by a drugs rep .
A drug rep comes to a doctors office , buys the office staff lunch , courts the doctor and then encourages the doctor to hand out free samples of the latest and greatest drug .
Then eventually write prescriptions of the drug .
I 'm sure you 've seen these people while waiting in a doctor 's office .
They come in toting large cases on rolling wheels and wait patiently in the waiting room for their opportunity to have a quick three - minute conversation with the doctor between appointments .
Let 's take Synthroid for example , commonly prescribed to those who have thyroid issues or have had their thyroid radiated or removed , this drug has never even been approved by the FDA !
How does this happen you ask ?
This is the reality of pharmaceutical drugs .
There is a natural cure or supplement for everything that ails you , you just need to find the courage to open your mind and seek out alternative health care and nutrition options .
Always seek an alternative health professional or homeopathic doctor by referral of someone you trust and have experienced positive results .
World Cultures
Now let 's discuss five cultures of the world .
The Primitive Eskimo :
There was a Scandinavian man named Steffason in the mid 1800's who decided to live with these Eskimos for 20 years and he wrote a book called " Not by bread alone . "
He was a scientist that for 20 years that ate fat , blubber , intestines , and liver the same diet as the Eskimos .
He came back at the age of 80 to the Presbyterian Medical Center in New York and was in perfect health .
The Rocky Mountain Men :
Ate what they killed , meat .
The American Plains Indian :
Lived off of the Buffalo .
The Indian was threatened with starvation as the white man killed off the buffalo because they were mainly meat eaters and buffalo was their primary food source .
The Maisi In Africa :
Meat eaters .
The Balari In South America :
Meat eaters .
All of these people have no history of heart disease , arthritis and no diabetes .
These people did not eat processed and refined foods .
We ought to hear the other side of the story because we 've only heard one side of the story .
Propaganda :
There was a man in Nazi Germany , his name was Joseph Goebbels , and he was a minister of propaganda .
He knew that if you control what people see , television , and movies , what they hear on the radio , and what they read in magazines and newspapers , that you can control people .
The churches in the middle Ages called it propagate , and that is where the word propaganda derived from .
The Oriental culture refers to it as brainwashing .
What do we call it today ?
We refer to it as marketing , TV , radio , newspapers , and magazines .
All of these sources say that cholesterol is evil and everyone believes it and we never hear the other side of the story , but again it makes trillions of dollars .
The five cultures in the world that are meat eaters are slim muscular people .
If you look at carbohydrate eaters , they will be fat fleshy people , like Americans .
The Processed American Diet
Americans subsist on more carbohydrates than any other country in the world .
We 've been advocated to eat polyunsaturated oils .
Polyunsaturated oils are of an incomplete chemical structure so they combine with other chemicals around them , including cancer cells .
The saturated fat molecule is already complete and thereby less susceptible to combinations with other compounds .
It had been demonstrated that heating of polyunsaturated oil , increased it 's toxicity by causing it to form polymers , these chemical compounds then are used to produce varnish , shellac and plastics , including the BIC pen your holding right now .
The processed food industry has made trillions of dollars for the last 80 years , selling us low fat food .
What are low fat foods high in ?
Carbohydrates .
It all comes back to excess sugars and starches .
As Hippocrates said ,
" Protein is most important ,
carbohydrates are secondary . "
Of course fruits , vegetables , and grains are wonderful for you , but you 've got to have protein first .
Most people who are Christian have no idea what the bible says .
In Deuteronomy it states ,
" You can not live by bread alone . "
In Acts 10 : 13 it says ,
" Peter kill and eat . "
He talked about the land of milk and honey , that we may eat birds of the sky , reptiles of the earth and creepy crawly things .
The best guidelines come from the bible .
I suggest you educate yourself on this also .
The bible says many other things , Ezekiel 47:12 says ,
" Use the fruit for food and the leaf for medicine . "
Controlling Cholesterol :
The proper approach to controlling one 's cholesterol is to stay away from all processed and refined foods .
Pancakes , cookies , pies , cakes , candies , pretzels , donuts , pizza , pop tarts , slurpees , sugar frosted flakes , bagels , pasta , spaghetti , beer , and fast food .
Increase your antioxidants , Vitamin E and Magnesium , which prevents the formation of arterial sites of cholesterol build up and lesions in the arteries .
( Make sure to get high quality Vitamin E from a health food store .
Make sure the label reads d-tocopherol .
Most E is actually the synthetic version ( dl - tocopherol ) which the body cannot use , so it is useless to take . )
Get plenty of good minerals in your body and Vitamin B complex .
Exercise to some degree , but the most important thing is diet , it is what you eat that counts .
Even the average bodybuilder has to know something about nutrition .
I am not referring to people who take steroids though .
Bodybuilding is 85%- 95 % nutrition and if a bodybuilder does n't accept that fact they will fail , so they have to know nutrition .
Leading Causes Of Death :
Years ago I was training a young teenage boy .
I had this young man on liver tablets , milk and egg protein , meat , and cheese etc .
His mother found out about it and she called me up and was outraged that I would feed her son such fat .
I tried to explain to her about good fats and bad fats and she would not hear me .
She had spoke with her family doctor , and he informed her that eating all that fat would cause her son to have a heart attack .
Then I found out that her son was on Ritalin .
Ritalin is a Class II addictive drug that cannot be distinguished by chemists from cocaine , Prozac , and Zoloft .
Channel 2 reported in November 2001 , that Ritalin could cause permanent brain damage .
The young man also had asthma and was on Prednisone .
If you look at the PDR ( Physician 's Desk Reference ) it states that Prednisone can cause diabetes and heart failure .
I was being accused of giving the boy things that could kill him ; all the while the medical doctor had him on drugs that could cause brain damage , diabetes , and congestive heart failure .
I spoke to the mother and made the statement , " That drugs in America kill 350,000 to 400,000 people every year . "
She got very angry with me and wanted to know where I got my tremendously outrageous data .
I said , " If you pull out the Journal of the American Medical Association , April 15 , 1998 , medical doctors admitted that prescription drugs of all kinds are the fourth leading cause of death in America .
Right behind Cancer , Diabetes , and Heart attacks . "
She did n't have much to say to me after that .
Protein Digestion :
All the protein companies that sell protein drinks say mix your protein powder with juice , zero fat milk , or water .
The simple fact is that you cannot digest protein without fat .
If you get rid of the yolk of an egg and , swallow only the white , the body cannot utilize it as protein ; it is converted into sugar and stored in the liver as glycogen .
Even the so - called experts do not investigate this , so they would n't know .
The reason the egg yolk is so good for you is because the yolk is the nucleus of all cells , and all life as we know it .
Without RNA / DNA and protein amino acids we could n't have life .
You also should not mix your protein with fruit juices of any kind as the enzymes necessary to digest protein will dominate and while the protein is being digested the fruit ferments .
This is not good for digestion and is the cause of gas .

There is an indisputable correlation between digestion , elimination , longevity and your health .
I 've put together the essential seven for the purpose of helping you understand the consequences and solutions to digestion and longevity .
Because we process and refine food we destroy the B complex .
Homocystine is a good amino acid , but without the B complex it becomes deadly to our body .
Dr. Harry Eidiner Jr. is the foremost nutritional biochemist in America .
He has eight degrees and is a brilliant person .
He has written medical journals and he has confirmed that you cannot digest protein without fat .
Always try to buy scratch eggs ( from the health food store ) or Amish eggs .
Commercial eggs , as you probably know , are just like all other food in our country they are injected with hormones and antibiotics , and we all know that 's not good for us .
Conclusion
I hope this article has helped you .
I hope you have a better understanding of why things are done in this country .
Why lies are told .
I hope that you go back to eating your eggs ; they are the most phenomenal food that you can eat .
They are only second to Mother 's milk in the quality of nutrition .

The New Atheists Researchers Crusade against American Fundamentalists
In the United States , atheists are becoming an ostracized minority .
But now evolutionary biologists are trying to turn the tables : According to their argument , religion is the source of evil .
Morals and selflessness are not God - given  they are the result of evolution .
In the Kitchen with Mother Linda
Think of sugar and you think of sugar cane or beets .
Extraction of sugar from sugar cane spurred the colonization of the New World .
Extraction of sugar from beets was developed during the time of Napoleon so that the French could have sugar in spite of the English trading blockade .
Nobody thinks of sugar when they see a field of corn .
Most of us would be surprised to learn that the larger percentage of sweeteners used in processed food comes from corn , not sugar cane or beets .
The process for making the sweetener high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) out of corn was developed in the 1970s .
Use of HFCS grew rapidly , from less than three million short tons in 1980 to almost 8 million short tons in 1995 .
During the late 1990s , use of sugar actually declined as it was eclipsed by HFCS .
Today Americans consume more HFCS than sugar .
High - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) is produced by processing corn starch to yield glucose , and then processing the glucose to produce a high percentage of fructose .
It all sounds rather simple –white cornstarch is turned into crystal clear syrup .
However , the process is actually very complicated .
Three different enzymes are needed to break down cornstarch , which is composed of chains of glucose molecules of almost infinite length , into the simple sugars glucose and fructose .
First , cornstarch is treated with alpha- amylase to produce shorter chains of sugars called polysaccharides .
Alpha-amylase is industrially produced by a bacterium , usually Bacillus sp .
It is purified and then shipped to HFCS manufacturers .
Next , an enzyme called glucoamylase breaks the sugar chains down even further to yield the simple sugar glucose .
Unlike alpha-amylase , glucoamylase is produced by Aspergillus , a fungus , in a fermentation vat where one would likely see little balls of Aspergillus floating on the top .
The third enzyme , glucose - isomerase , is very expensive .
It converts glucose to a mixture of about 42 percent fructose and 50 - 52 percent glucose with some other sugars mixed in .
While alpha-amylase and glucoamylase are added directly to the slurry , pricey glucose - isomerase is packed into columns and the sugar mixture is then passed over it .
Inexpensive alpha- amylase and glucoamylase are used only once , glucose - isomerase is reused until it loses most of its activity .
There are two more steps involved .
First is a liquid chromatography step that takes the mixture to 90 percent fructose .
Finally , this is back - blended with the original mixture to yield a final concentration of about 55 percent fructose –what the industry calls high fructose corn syrup .
HFCS has the exact same sweetness and taste as an equal amount of sucrose from cane or beet sugar but it is obviously much more complicated to make , involving vats of murky fermenting liquid , fungus and chemical tweaking , all of which take place in one of 16 chemical plants located in the Corn Belt .
Yet in spite of all the special enzymes required , HFCS is actually cheaper than sugar .
It is also very easy to transport–it ’s just piped into tanker trucks .
This translates into lower costs and higher profits for food producers .
The development of the HFCS process came at an opportune time for corn growers .
Refinements of the partial hydrogenation process had made it possible to get better shortenings and margarines out of soybeans than corn .
HFCS took up the slack as demand for corn oil margarine declined .
Lysine , an amino acid , can be produced from the corn residue after the glucose is removed .
This is the modus operandi of the food conglomerates –break down commodities into their basic components and then put them back together again as processed food .
Today HFCS is used to sweeten jams , condiments like ketchup , and soft drinks .
It is also a favorite ingredient in many so - called health foods .
Four companies control 85 percent of the $ 2.6 billion business –Archer Daniels Midland , Cargill , Staley Manufacturing Co. and CPC International .
In the mid-1990s , ADM was the object of an FBI probe into price fixing of three products –HFCS , citric acid and lysine–and consumers got a glimpse of the murky world of corporate manipulation .
There ’s a couple of other murky things that consumers should know about HFCS .
According to a food technology expert , two of the enzymes used , alpha - amylase and glucose - isomerase , are genetically modified to make them more stable .
Enzymes are actually very large proteins and through genetic modification specific amino acids in the enzymes are changed or replaced so the enzyme ’s “ backbone ” wo n’t break down or unfold .
This allows the industry to get the enzymes to higher temperatures before they become unstable .
Consumers trying to avoid genetically modified foods should avoid HFCS .
It is almost certainly made from genetically modified corn and then it is processed with genetically modified enzymes .
I ’ve seen some estimates claiming that virtually everything –almost 80 percent–of what we eat today has been genetically modified at some point .
Since the use of HFCS is so prevalent in processed foods , those figures may be right .
But there ’s another reason to avoid HFCS .
Consumers may think that because it contains fructose –which they associate with fruit , which is a natural food –that it is healthier than sugar .
A team of investigators at the USDA , led by Dr. Meira Field , has discovered that this just ai n’t so .
Sucrose is composed of glucose and fructose .
When sugar is given to rats in high amounts , the rats develop multiple health problems , especially when the rats were deficient in certain nutrients , such as copper .
The researchers wanted to know whether it was the fructose or the glucose moiety that was causing the problems .
So they repeated their studies with two groups of rats , one given high amounts of glucose and one given high amounts of fructose .
The glucose group was unaffected but the fructose group had disastrous results .
The male rats did not reach adulthood .
They had anemia , high cholesterol and heart hypertrophy –that means that their hearts enlarged until they exploded .
They also had delayed testicular development .
Dr. Field explains that fructose in combination with copper deficiency in the growing animal interferes with collagen production .
( Copper deficiency , by the way , is widespread in America . )
In a nutshell , the little bodies of the rats just fell apart .
The females were not so affected , but they were unable to produce live young .
“ The medical profession thinks fructose is better for diabetics than sugar , ” says Dr. Field , “ but every cell in the body can metabolize glucose .
However , all fructose must be metabolized in the liver .
The livers of the rats on the high fructose diet looked like the livers of alcoholics , plugged with fat and cirrhotic . ”
HFCS contains more fructose than sugar and this fructose is more immediately available because it is not bound up in sucrose .
Since the effects of fructose are most severe in the growing organism , we need to think carefully about what kind of sweeteners we give to our children .
Fruit juices should be strictly avoided –they are very high in fructose–but so should anything with HFCS .
Interestingly , although HFCS is used in many products aimed at children , it is not used in baby formula , even though it would probably save the manufactueres a few pennies for each can .
Do the formula makers know something they are n’t telling us ?
Pretty murky !

This is the third part of my Road to Ruby enlightenment .
It started with tutorials and first steps .
RedHanded
RedHanded is
Why ’s ( from Why ’s ( Poignant ) Guide to Ruby ) blog .
I do n’t really know why I did n’t check out his blog earlier when I read WPGtR but I did n’t .
But I think this was a good thing , because I already knew a little bit about Ruby when I stumbled over his blog .
This made reading his dazzling display of ruby magic more fun , like watching a stage magician with a slight chance of understanding and appreciating his tricks .
Go and check out bits and inspect .
My all time favorint post is Camping Microframework , the code is cryptic and I cannot say I understand it but the whole post is hilarious ( here is the real docu for Camping , a < 4 kb webframework ) .
Shades of Gray
In another post on this blog I asked for advanced articles on ruby and Pat pointed me to Shades of Gray .
I already knew the author James Edward Gray II as the organizer of the Ruby Quiz .
Shades of Gray contains exactly the kind of articles I was looking for all the time .
The only sad thing is that it contains only a handful of these articles .
His Higher Order Ruby posts provide Ruby translations of the example code from the book Higher Order Perl , his Ruby tutorials are among the best I ’ve ever read and his other posts are worth reading , too .
If you read only a single sentence about good ruby style , it should be this one from Code as a Data Type :
In my experience , you know you ’re doing Ruby right when you are dropping code and gaining functionality
This is true for almost any language , but in Ruby it is especially elegant to do .
I guess this is the reason why I like programming in Ruby , it gives you the ability to write very compact but still readable code .
I ’m getting pretty close to the present , but I hope I will find enough content for another post in this series so check again later …
BTW , if you have recommendations with other sites / articles / books on good ruby style , please let me know .

Characteristics of Top Reddit Submissions
By : Jeff Clark Date : Mon , 18 Sep 2006
Most of you have probably seen the website Reddit .
Basically , it allows people to submit links which are subsequently voted up or down by others .
Based on these votes , Reddit determines the most popular or most controversial links over different periods of time and allows people to browse this information in different ways on the website .
There are other features of the site as well but I want to focus on link popularity .
Are there some common characteristics of the top - ranked links on Reddit ?
I started this analysis by getting two sets of links from the site .
The top 100 links of all - time and , to use as a control , the links numbered 500 - 599 from the ' new - today ' list .
These two lists of links were both taken as of September 13th , 21:45 EST .
By choosing fairly low ranked links from the ' new - today ' list the second set should contain items that are average to low in popularity relative to all the links submitted .
I was hoping that by contrasting these two sets I might discover something interesting about top -rated links .
1. Images and Videos
Most of my analysis has been based on the text of the linked items .
Before I could proceed to do this I had to exclude all the linked items that are primarily non-textual in nature - in other words , videos and images .
This little graph shows how many links were ' not found ' or ' videos and images ' out of the 100 .
It clearly shows that there are many more photos and videos in the top rated links than in the control set .
The quantities measured in the next 3 analyses do n't depend on the absolute number of documents in the sets so all 65 of the top rated list and all 84 of the control list were used .
2. Number of Words / Link
After excluding the links mentioned above I gathered the text for each remaining link .
An automated tool was used to convert the HTML to text and then I manually removed any text related to website navigation , feedback or comments .
My goal was to analyze the primary content of the linked web page .
I wrote a simple tool to count the number of words for each link in both sets .
The average number of words / link was 882 for the control set and 3151 for the top rated links .
The top rated links have many more words per item than the control set .
3. Average Word Size
I also calculated the average word length in the two sets of documents .
The top rated links had an average word size of 3.77 characters / word and the control set average was slightly longer at 4.02 characters / word .
There does not appear to be a significant difference in the average size of words between the two sets .
4. Relative Word Frequency
Which words appeared much more often in the top rated links than they did in the control set ?
What about the reverse ?
The tables below show the top 30 words for each set that are relatively more frequent .
Only words that appeared in both sets are shown .
So , for example , the word ' programming ' which appears at # 10 in the ' Top Rated ' column shows that this word was present much more frequently in the ' Top Rated ' stories than in the control set .
This has also taken into account the fact that there were more words total in the ' Top Rated ' set - it 's a relative measure .
Number Top Rated Control Set 1 org* nick 2 permalink * prayer 3 html * patients 4 wake stages 5 sleep hypnosis 6 aug rep 7 alarm networks * 8 www* hezbollah 9 numbers * 5000 10 programming * asia 11 est marketplace 12 bed trend * 13 wikipedia* virginia 14 http * previously 15 tired webmasters * 16 url * haired 17 asked tokens 18 voting diabetes 19 reply patient 20 learning creators 21 flowers peru 22 reddit* sean 23 patterns * lebanon 24 buried beta* 25 hole damages 26 morning empire 27 plant fascist 28 loans genes 29 stupid perceived 30 confidential turkey
The words marked with an asterix ( * ) are what I call ' nerd words ' .
It 's a pretty subjective measure but is interesting nevertheless .
Note that there are 11 in the ' top rated ' set but only 4 in the control set .
It appears that top rated links have more terminology related to computing and technical subjects than those links in the control set .
5. Topic Breakdown
This analysis depends on there being an equivalent number of links in each set so only the top 64 were used .
I have taken the text for all the items in both sets and run them through my simple text categorizer .
The results are shown below in a Multi -Level Pie Chart .
See this previous entry for a description of this type of graphic .
The greener areas have a higher proportion of items from the ' top rated ' set .
This chart shows that the Technology topic , especially the engineering and software subtopics , has a higher proportion of articles from the top rated set .
Other 3rd level topics with high representation from ' top rated ' links are : Employment , Law , Interpersonal Relationships , Astronomy , Mathematics , Physics , and Music .
Those with low ( dark red ) proportions are : Investment , Finance , Services , Food , House , Medicine , History , Psychology , Animation , Television , and Computer Games .
This last one seems out of place since so many of the other associated topics are common in the top rated set .
It may be that with a larger sample this anomaly would disappear .
Or it may be that the text categorizer is n't working well in this domain - it is fairly simplistic after all .
Conclusion
It appears that the top rated items on Reddit are quantifiably different in several ways from those typically submitted to the site .
The apparent popularity of technology - related topics in the Reddit community is suggestive that it is still used primarily by early technology adopters .
Move over SATs .
Incredibly , for the high - powered and high - priced private national universities , the best predictor of academic excellence is rank in a popular sport .
Whether measured by graduation rate or prestigious scholarships – the result is the same .
What is this sport that mysteriously divines a university ’s stature so precisely ?
It ’s called Ultimate Frisbee , or more commonly just Ultimate .
It is the fastest growing college sport and is already played interscholastically at over 500 colleges and universities .
While wildly popular on campuses , relatively few in the wider world have even heard of it .
A study ( slated for release September 1 ) by Dr. Michael Norden shows that among all 86 private national universities , those ranking in the top half for Ultimate have a graduation rate of over 85 % , while those in the bottom half graduate just 60 % .
The difference in the totals of Rhodes scholars and Marshall scholars among their graduates during this decade is even more dramatic – 208 versus 15 .
( The odds of this happening by chance are truly infinitesimal ) .
Moreover , the top ten schools based on Ultimate ranking have a slightly higher mean graduation rate and more winners of top scholarships than schools chosen by - not only SATs , but any standard metric including : grades , faculty resources , and financial resources .
This correlation between Ultimate and academics has previously been obscured by the fact that there are no separate divisions in Ultimate , so that smaller private universities are historically ranked together with public institutions up to an order of magnitude larger .
The pattern emerges clearly when comparing , over an adequate time frame , institutions of similar size and demographics ( i.e. private national universities ) .
Study ranking is based simply on the total of Power Rating points over the past ten years ( assigned by the Ultimate Players Association ) for all of a school ’s open - division club teams .
Ultimate is a largely student - run club sport with minimal institutional support .
Why a game , requiring such all - around athleticism should so consistently be dominated by universities ( and presumably students ) with off - the - chart academic credentials , is truly a mystery .
The top seven schools for ultimate have a mean graduation rate of 95 % and nearly as many total Rhodes and Marshal scholars as all of the rest combined .
The names speak for themselves : Stanford , Brown , Harvard , Tufts , Dartmouth , Yale , and Princeton .
Dr. Norden is a Seattle psychiatrist and author of the book Beyond Prozac ( Harper Collin / 1995 ) .
Jeremy Norden collaborated in the study - he is a member of the world champion US National Juniors Ultimate team .

Over on Alternet , Terrence McNally has posted a very good interview with biologist and atheist Richard Dawkins , possibly the best I 've read since the publication of Dawkins ' " The God Delusion " and the ensuing furor .
Dawkins has come under fire from many quarters , notably Deepak Chopra ( whose livelihood may be on the line ) and R.J .
Eskow , a Huffington Post writer who seems well - intentioned but a little sloppy in his arguments , especially when he calls Dawkins and others " fundamentalist atheists . "
There have been a few vigorous dissents here on dkos as well , like this diary , which successfully demolished series of straw men created by the author .
And of course , no serious discussion of Dawkins and atheism could ignore the South Park episode devoted to just that subject .
Actually a serious discussion could ignore it effortlessly , but someone 's going to mention it , and I thought I 'd be first .
By and large , however , the Kos Kommunity seems to be much more open to the arguments of thoughtful atheists than other progressive fora scattered throughout the Internet .
That 's why I thought some of you would be interested in what Dawkins actually says on many of the more contentious issues raised , not just by his book , but by his life 's work .
Here are a few gems to get you hooked .
On the " anger " evinced by atheist apologists :
That 's a very curious misperception .
We get accused of being angry or of being intolerant , but , if you were to look at critiques of one political party by the other ... when Democrats criticize Republicans , or Republicans criticize Democrats , nobody ever says , " You 're being intolerant of Republicans , or angry . "
It 's just normal , robust argument .
People have gotten so used to the idea that religion must be immune to criticism that even a very mild and gentle criticism of religion comes across as angry and intolerant .
That 's yet another piece of consciousness raising that we 've got to undertake .
On why " live and let live " may not be the best approach to the religious faith of others :
Why not live and let live ?
Why not just say , " Oh , well , if people want to believe that , that 's fine . "
Of course , nobody 's stopping people believing whatever they like .
The problem is that there 's not that much tolerance coming the other way .
Things like the opposition to stem - cell research , to abortion , to contraception -- these are all religiously inspired prohibitions on what would otherwise be freedom of action , whether of scientists or individual human beings .
On Bush 's claim to a personal relationship with God :
Yes .
Your president is told by God to invade Iraq .
It 's a pity , by the way , that God did n't tell him there were no weapons of mass destruction .
( That one 's my favorite . )
On the essential role of religion in formulating morality :
That 's an appalling thing to say , is n't it ?
It suggests that the only reason we have morality -- the only reason we do n't kill and rape and steal -- is that we 're afraid of being found out by God .
We 're afraid that God is watching us , afraid of the great surveillance camera in the sky .
Now , that 's not a very noble reason for being good .
There 's much more , and it's all good , and it answers many of the arguments that have been hurled at Dawkins from every corner .
The conclusion of the interview is especially moving .
There is little doubt in my mind that it takes intellectual courage and discipline to openly proclaim atheism in this religiously compromised country .
What do you think of Dawkin 's proclamations ?
You do n't have to love the English language to disapprove of The Da Vinci Code .
A passing respect for your mother tongue is enough to make you wince when Dan Brown takes a chainsaw to the old girl and slices her into clichés and easy - to - assemble sentences .
Why millions of people have bought the literary equivalent of an Ikea flatpack is a riddle beyond Brown 's power to solve .
It is a page - turner , to be fair , with a mystery that pushes you past the arthritic dialogue of the stock characters .
But when readers turn to the final page with the reasonable expectation that the mystery of the Holy Grail will be explained , Brown refuses to oblige .
Like the mediocre reporter who can't get to the bottom of a story , he says words to the effect of ' perhaps we 'll never know the truth ' and leaves it there .
I 'm not spoiling the ending by telling you this .
The problem with The Da Vinci Code is that there is no ending to spoil .
If there has been a worse book published in the past 25 years , then Holy Blood , Holy Grail could well be it .
Its three authors present as plausible historical speculation their theory that Jesus did not die on the cross , but had a child with Mary Magdalene .
Like so many expats , they moved to France , and their descendants became Merovingian kings in the Dark Ages .
The heirs of Jesus survive to this day , feared by the Vatican and protected by an enigmatic institution , the Priory of Sion .
The authors did not withdraw the book when journalists found that their claims about the Priory of Sion came from documents forged on a cheap stencil by a French neofascist conman called Pierre Planchard , who said he was the rightful Merovingian king of France .
There was no need to .
Exposure of the hoax did not dent their sales , which now stand at around two million .
Nor has it harmed The Da Vinci Code , which repeats parts of the story .
Around five million British readers have bought one or both of these books .
That the authorities allow them to vote and serve on juries should terrify everyone who cares about the good government of our country .
How much of The Da Vinci Code is - ahem - ' borrowed ' from Holy Blood , Holy Grail is the subject of the plagiarism case at the High Court in London that enters what should be its final week tomorrow .
' Too bad they can't both lose , ' said Henry Kissinger about the Iran - Iraq War and I felt the same when I went to the court .
Apart from the feuding authors , no one else seemed to care about the result .
The court journalists were pleased that their reports were going round the world .
The lawyers were upholding the highest standards of the Bar as they declaimed ' the Grail has spawned legends , wars and quests ' and ' the bloodline of the Merovingians continues to this day ' without giggling once .
The only person who looked disconcerted was Mr Justice Smith , a plain - speaking judge from the Northern Circuit .
As he scratched his wig and snorted into his bushy black moustache , I wondered if he was trying to work out how his blameless legal career had led to him having to listen to such tosh .
One copyright expert I spoke to shared the general feeling that it did n't matter who won .
Mr Justice Smith 's verdict would present no wider threat to the business of producing fiction and non-fiction , he said , pointing to a near identical case in 1980 .
An author called Trevor Ravenscroft had ignored the Holy Grail for once and concentrated , instead , in The Spear of Destiny on the weapon used to pierce the crucified Christ 's side .
Ravenscroft said it had brought evil through the ages and inspired the Nazis .
He successfully sued James Herbert , a writer in the Dan Brown mould , for stealing his pseudo - history .
The sky did n't fall in and everyone from potboiling novelists to learned academics carried on as before .
Other lawyers are not so sure .
David Hooper , a specialist in intellectual property , said the case was something new .
The Holy Blood authors are not saying that Dan Brown had copied chunks of their work verbatim .
Instead , they are suing him for taking some of their ideas , researching them , playing with them and turning them into a novel .
If they win , Hooper believes a chill will go through cultural life as publishers face the next to impossible task of separating original thoughts from other people 's thoughts .
Restricting free use of ideas is the spirit of the age .
Firms have claimed copyright on plants and parts of the human genome because ideas are worth more than all other assets .
The World Trade Organisation recognised this when it made international acceptance of intellectual property rights one of the central aims of the drive to globalisation in the Nineties .
I hate to be the one who has to say it , but Dan Brown needs to win .
If he does n't , free thought may be stifled in the name of protecting ideas .
Furthermore
An African crisis Europe can't ignore
Because the Archbishop of Canterbury preferred twittering about gay vicars to speaking out on crimes against humanity in Sudan , we have had to look elsewhere for men and women with the moral strength to bear witness .
On Friday , the staff of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees stepped forward to fill the gap .
Unfortunately , they said they were planning to cut the number of refugee workers in Darfur by 44 per cent .
State - sponsored violence and counterattacks by Darfurian forces on aid convoys and civilians were making relief work impossible .
You cannot exaggerate the seriousness of the withdrawal .
The African Union 's peacekeeping force in Darfur is understrength , ill - equipped , badly led and wholly unable to do the job .
The Islamists in Khartoum are threatening to set al - Qaeda on the UN if it sends in its own troops .
Meanwhile , Sudan is aiding rebel forces in Chad and Chad is aiding rebel forces in the Sudan .
War between the two countries is a possibility .
We cannot bolt the gates of Fortress Europe and pretend the crisis has nothing to do with us .
We ought to have learned by now that the people smugglers will bring in asylum seekers and , with them , new racial tensions .
We should also know that the ability of Sudan 's rulers to get away with promoting terrorism could lead to Islamist attacks on the ' far enemy ' in Europe as well as targets in their backyard .
While we wait for the predictable consequences , this column will have a new feature :
What the Archbishop of Canterbury Wo n't Discuss .
Coming soon : ' The contribution of the Pope 's condom ban to the Aids pandemic ' .
I will run it to coincide with the archbishop 's visit to the Vatican .
Invasion of the story snatchers
The only sensible remark made about John Profumo 's sharing of Christine Keeler with a Soviet agent came from Lord Lambton , right , himself a victim of a later sex scandal .
It could only have mattered if the affair had been platonic .
Just so .
Nothing in the Soviet archives shows that Profumo had the urge to betray his country .
Other urges were on his mind .
At least in 1963 , the press felt the need to justify running a juicy story .
The Secretary of State for War meeting a Soviet naval attaché and a call girl at the pool of the proprietor of The Observer was more than enough .
It does n't work like that now .
The current owners of The Observer enforce the highest standards of poolside behaviour , while today 's newspapers do n't require an excuse for invading privacy .
They just invade .

The Peace of Illusions : American Grand Strategy From 1940 to the Present
Christopher Layne
Cornell University Press , 2006
290 pp .
Other than those who work in the White House , with no sense of shame , or act as court intellectuals , heaping praise upon the Bush administration , everyone recognizes that current U.S. foreign policy is a disaster .
There is the extraordinary hubris of attempting to manage the globe and the expensive foolishness of garrisoning dozens of states where no American interests are threatened .
Most spectacularly , there is Iraq .
Iraq alone has exacerbated the problem of terrorism , diverted resources and attention from dealing with Afghanistan and combating al - Qaeda and related groups , ruined America ’s standing in the world , and undercut the finest military on earth  thrusting it into the midst of the sort of war that is both straining its resources and threatening its soul .
So awful have been the consequences of George W. Bush strutting about the globe as if he were Winston Churchill reincarnated that he could be the last Soviet plant , an agent of influence created by a dying communist system to ensure that the American superpower ultimately collapses as well .
Many of the problems stemming from Bush ’s grand neoconservative crusade are practical , resulting from the sort of mistakes to be expected from a gaggle of arrogant incompetents .
Iraq , of course , is the most obvious example , but by no means the only one .
There is Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice futilely lecturing North Korea ’s Kim Jong - Il , ordering him not to test his missiles .
Her public hectoring guaranteed the launches .
There is the vice president insulting Russia even as his government is desperately seeking Moscow ’s aid in confronting both North Korea and Iran .
There are , sadly , many more examples .
Also fundamentally flawed , however , are the principles behind the Bush program .
At these the redoubtable Chris Layne takes aim .
Layne is a professor at Texas A&M University .
He has long been writing trenchant articles and studies attacking the imperialist temptation , and especially the idea that the end of the Cold War allows  no , mandates  that Washington manage the rest of the globe down to the most insignificant civil war and local disturbance .
The culmination of Layne ’s work is The Peace of Illusions , which focuses on matters of American grand strategy .
The book is a serious read , but a necessary one if you want to understand why current policy would still have been a disaster even if Bush & Company had n’t been guided by fantasies when attempting to implement their vision .
It is the imperialist vision itself that is flawed .
Layne ’s analysis is important for several reasons .
One is that it takes a long view .
As he explains :
“ This book is not a chronicle of the grand strategy of the Bush II administration or of the two administrations that preceded it .
Nevertheless , the real world events that have shaped U.S. grand strategy since the Bush II administration took office  9/11 , the war on terror , the March 2003 invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq , and mounting tensions with Iran and North Korea caused by those two states ’ nuclear ambitions  cast a long shadow .
One of my objectives in this book is to put these events into historical perspective and to show that they are part of a larger pattern that extends back to the early 1940s .
Here , I take issue with those who have argued that the Bush II administration ’s approach to U.S. grand strategy  its determination to maintain overwhelming U.S. geopolitical dominance and its muscular idealism  breaks sharply with the principles and assumptions that guided earlier U.S. policymakers .
Nothing could be farther from the truth .
Take the administration ’s resolve to use America ’s preponderant power to ensure that other states cannot entertain the ‘ hope of surpassing , or equaling , the power of the United States . ’
Here the administration simply reaffirmed the policy adopted by its two immediate predecessors . ”
As should be obvious , The Peace of Illusions is thoroughly substantive , a sharp contrast especially with so much of the junk pouring forth from alleged “ conservative thinkers . ”
And the work is historical , recognizing that what happened yesterday still matters today .
In contrast to , for instance , the Bush administration  which invaded Iraq expecting a cakewalk in which American soldiers would be covered in flowers and smothered in love 
Layne explores the relationship between current controversies , past events , current players , and past strategies .
In short , he works with reality rather than fantasy .
Layne begins by looking at models of realism and assessing past American grand strategies .
He argues that the best explanation for U.S. policy since the early 1940s is “ extraregional hegemony ” based on an “ Open Door ” perspective , that is , maintaining open international economic markets and spreading democracy and liberalism .
It should surprise no one that the outcome of World War II gave the U.S. the opportunity to aspire to world domination .
Layne observes : “ since the Cold War , U.S. policymakers repeatedly have stated their global hegemonic ambitions . ”
Yet acting on those ambitions obviously was constrained by the existence of a competing superpower , a balancing force that no longer exists .
Particularly fascinating is Layne ’s analysis of U.S. policy in World War II and the Cold War .
He suggests , with good support , that Washington hoped to dominate ( for positive ends , in its view ) global affairs even before it was obvious that the Soviet Union would be a serious rival .
Moreover , America ’s reach for hegemony , particularly its desire to include the western section of occupied Germany in its geopolitical orbit , may have been as important as Soviet hostility in generating the Cold War .
This obviously is a controversial argument , but Layne makes his point with ample historical evidence ( and , it should go without saying , no sympathy for Joseph Stalin or the Soviet Union ) .
Rather , he concludes , “ in World War II ’s aftermath Soviet behavior across the chessboard did not reflect the orthodox / neo - orthodox caricature ( shared by many U.S. decision makers following World War II ) of the Soviet Union as a predatory , aggressive , ideologically motivated state bent on attaining world domination . ”
There ’s much more in The Peace of Illusions to challenge the comfortable and convenient readings of history held by so many .
Layne ’s detailed discussion of American policy in Europe is of more than historical interest because so much about current American policy in Europe requires explanation .
Writes Layne : “ More than 15 years after the Cold War , NATO is still in business and U.S. troops are still in Europe ( albeit in much - reduced numbers from their peak Cold War levels ) .
This is something that needs explaining . ”
Yes , indeed .
Some leading realists believe that this continuing military commitment is an anomaly , destined to disappear over time .
Not Layne :
“ My answer is different .
No one should hold their breath in anticipation of a U.S. military pullback from Europe ( or from East Asia ) , because on the Continent the United States is  as it has been since the early 1940s  pursuing a grand strategy of extraregional hegemony , not an offshore balancing strategy .
The driving force behind U.S. European grand strategy has not been ‘ counterhegemony ’  blocking the bids of other would - be European hegemons  but the goal of imposing America ’s own hegemony on the Continent . ”
His argument is simultaneously obvious and profound .
Bush I and Bill Clinton , no less than Bush II , worked to preserve American preeminence and discourage European independence , despite the collapse of the Soviet Union and disappearance of the Warsaw Pact .
Washington has similarly sought to maintain Japanese and South Korean security dependence on America  even while pressing for increased military efforts and support for other U.S. interventions .
Unfortunately , these alliances are , as Layne terms them , “ transmission belts of war . ”
He warns : “ If the United States sticks with its current grand strategy and fails to stop the outbreak of great power war in Eurasia , it will be automatically swept up in the fighting  regardless either of its degree of interest in the conflict or the costs and risks of involvement . ”
The possibilities are numerous .
A Russian fight with one of its neighbors from the old Soviet Union .
War between the two Koreas .
A confrontation between China and Taiwan .
Naval skirmishing over disputed territorial claims in the South China Sea .
And so on .
The point is not to argue that such conflicts would not be human tragedies , best avoided for all concerned .
But none of them implicate important enough U.S. interests to warrant Washington bringing the tragedy home to America by intervening .
Moreover , Layne ably argues that current policy is unsustainable .
He writes : “ The historical record and balance - of - power theory suggest that the pursuit of hegemony is self - defeating . ”
No matter how benevolent American policymakers may be in fact as well as in propaganda , there is no evidence that other peoples desire to be ruled by Washington .
Iraq is the signal example , though Asian and European resistance to Washington ’s endless pronouncements on virtually every detail of international life also should cause today ’s would - be imperialists to pause .
Already , other potential great powers are arising , American dominance is stagnating if not waning , and even allies and friends are balking .
“ It doubtless is true that it will take some time for others ’ balancing efforts to realize their intended outcome , ” Layne acknowledges .
But the so - called unipolar moment likely will come to an end sooner than most people expect .
It ’s always easier to criticize a policy than to design an alternative , especially when the proponents have made such a botch of things .
Even if one granted that an American imperium was desirable in theory , who could seriously believe that today ’s policymakers , and even more so their intellectual groupies , could bring it off with even a semblance of competence ?
However , Layne has an alternative , the venerable strategy of “ offshore balancing . ”
It seeks not American domination , but the prevention of foreign domination .
Explains Layne , “ it posits that the only American strategic interest at stake in Eurasia is preventing the emergence of a Eurasian hegemon , and rejects the notion that Eurasian great power wars inevitably draw in the United States . ”
This stance , no less than a policy of empire , will not yield a perfect world .
But it would better maintain U.S. security at lower cost and risk .
A more limited , humble foreign policy also would provide a better environment for the preservation of a constitutional system devoted to individual liberty and limited government .
“ Hegemonic power has both a seductive , and corrupting , effect on those who wield it , ” writes Layne , an effect tragically evident in the shocking charges of human rights abuses by U.S. forces abroad and the steady expansion of national security restrictions by U.S. agencies at home .
Most of the intellectual fire against the Bush administration ’s foreign policy is being directed at its limited competence and poor judgment , and worthy targets these are .
But those interested in preserving the American republic need to look beyond the practical to principle , at American foreign policy in its very conception .
This Chris Layne does with great skill .
It is a modern cliché to term books a “ must - read , ” but The Peace of Illusions surely is a must - read for anyone who wants to understand and especially to change U.S. foreign policy .
Many of us have been long waiting for Chris to complete this book .
The Peace of Illusions has been well worth the wait .
Today , for many , computer networks are an indispensable infrastructure that interconnects people , places and organisations .
But increasingly they are beginning to creak as their complexity grows .
Biological systems through years of evolution can offer clues on how to cope , as a research project has demonstrated .
" Even a minor perturbation on a network can cause major problems , " says Dr Ozalp Babaoglu at the University of Bologna .
" Simply adding a computer or installing an operating system can suddenly mean that the printer stops working or you can't access your files . "
The problem is caused by complex systems , where a large number a simple elements interact .
And networking can be complex .
Millions of interconnected nodes create inherent complexity and a growing sophistication of interactions between devices means complexity exists even when the number of devices is modest .
Enter the BISON project funded under the European Commission 's Future and Emerging Technologies initiative .
BISON is inspired by Complex Adaptive Systems like ants , fireflies and even single cells .
" Complexity in computing is already a problem , and traditional methods are no longer adequate to address the problems , " says Babaoglu , BISON 's coordinator .
" And it 's going to get worse as the internet becomes increasingly complex .
Biological systems , on the other hand , are incredibly resilient and amazingly robust , so we 're taking inspiration from a system that we know works . "
BISON took a ' modular ' approach , using simple and predictable services as building blocks , or protocols , to develop more complex functions .
Using simple protocols the group validated its approach by developing a load - balancing protocol , which is very important to stop traffic from overwhelming a particular node .
With the proof of principle established , it 's hoped others will begin designing further tools .
" The load balancing protocol was inspired by negative chemotaxis , " says Babaoglu .
Chemotaxis is a process where single cells or multicellular organisms move towards a chemical stimulus .
Negative chemotaxis in the digital world prompts data to spontaneously disperse , effectively balancing the data load across the network .
BISON focused on adaptive routing and radio power management to tackle the fundamental challenge in ad hoc networks of a constantly changing network topology .
Not only are nodes moving but they are constantly entering and leaving the network .
What 's more , power is a crucial issue : use more power to boost the signal and the device runs out of energy .
Lower signal power and the network becomes disconnected .
It used Ant Colony Optimisation ( ACO ) , a computing scheme inspired by the way ants leave and follow paths to find the shortest route to food .
In the computing paradigm , tiny packets of data , called ants , are sent out to find the most efficient routing choice based on the twin needs of connectivity and power management .
Called AntHocNet , it is an attempt to create an ACO routing algorithm , which works efficiently in Mobile Ad hoc Networks , combining reactive path finding and repairing with proactive path maintenance and improvement .
The attempt looks successful .
BISON conducted a large series of simulations of its AntHocNet against an algorithm for routing data across Wireless Mesh Networks .
" We were successful in developing robust , adaptive protocols , " said Babaoglu .
" But we were surprised that their performance was so good .
We expected to lose performance , but our protocols are comparable to what 's available today . "
BISON also developed a synchronicity protocol inspired by fireflies .
Synchronicity is important to time the execution of certain functions in a network .
Fireflies very quickly synchronise their light emission , rather like clapping in an audience , and Babaoglu says it could become the basis for developing a heartbeat on the internet .
Most of BISON 's work is not yet ready for commercial deployment , though the AntHocNet is very close , but the team 's approach is very promising and has generated a lot of interest among researchers .

They report that with microcephalin , a new allele arose about 37,000 years ago , although it could have appeared as early as 60,000 or as late as 14,000 years ago .
About 70 percent of people in most European and East Asian populations carry this allele of the gene , but it is much rarer in most sub-Saharan Africans .
With the other gene , ASPM , a new allele emerged 14,100 to 500 years ago , the researchers favoring a midway date of 5,800 years .
The allele has attained a frequency of about 50 percent in populations of the Middle East and Europe , is less common in East Asia , and is found at low frequency in some sub-Saharan Africa peoples .
The Chicago team suggests that the new microcephalin allele may have arisen in Eurasia or as the first modern humans emigrated from Africa some 50,000 years ago .
They note that the ASPM allele emerged about the same time as the spread of agriculture in the Middle East 10,000 years ago and the emergence of the civilizations of the Middle East some 5,000 years ago , but say that any connection is not yet clear .
Dr. Lahn said there might be a fair number of genes that affect the size of the brain , each making a small difference yet one that can be acted on by natural selection .
" It 's likely that different populations would have a different makeup of these genes , so it may all come out in the wash , " he said .
In other words , East Asians and Africans probably have other brain - enhancing alleles , not yet discovered , that have spread to high frequency in their populations .
He said he expected that more such allele differences between populations would come to light , as have differences in patterns of genetic disease .
" I do think this kind of study is a harbinger for what might become a rather controversial issue in human population research , " Dr. Lahn said .
But he said his data and other such findings " do not necessarily lead to prejudice for or against any particular population . "
A greater degree of concern was expressed by Francis S. Collins , director of the National Human Genome Research Institute .
Dr. Collins said that even if the alleles were indeed under selection , it was still far from clear why they had risen to high frequency , and that " one should resist strongly the conclusion that it has to do with brain size , because the selection could be operating on any other not yet defined feature . "
He said he was worried about the way these papers will be interpreted .
Sarah Tishkoff , a geneticist at the University of Maryland and a co-author of both studies , said the statistical signature of selection on the two genes was " one of the strongest that I 've seen . "
But she , like Dr. Collins , said that " we do n't know what these alleles are doing " and that specific tests were required to show that they in fact influenced brain development or were selected for that reason .

Abstract :
This essay discusses the best current understanding of the relationship between mathematical and empirical knowledge .
It focuses on two questions :
Does mathematics have some sort of deep metaphysical connection with reality , and if not , why is it that mathematical abstractions seem so often to be so powerfully predictive in the real world ?
Mathematics is the model of a -priori knowledge in the Aristotelian tradition of rationalism .
Among the Greeks , geometry was regarded as the highest form of knowledge , a potent key to the metaphysical mysteries of the Universe .
This is a rather mystical belief , and the connection to mysticism and religion was made explicit in cults like the Pythagorean .
No culture since has semi- deified a man for discovering a geometrical theorem !
The Greek awe of mathematical knowledge is still with us ; it 's behind the traditional metaphor of mathematics as " Queen of the Sciences " .
It 's been reinforced by the spectacular successes of mathematical models in science , successes the Greeks ( lacking even simple algebra ) could never have foreseen .
Since Isaac Newton 's discovery of calculus and the inverse - square law of gravity in the late 1600s , phenomenal science and higher mathematics have been closely symbiotic -- so much so , that the existence of a predictive mathematical formalism has become the hallmark of a " hard science " .
For two centuries after Newton , phenomenal science aspired to the kind of rigor and purity that seemed to be embodied in mathematics .
The metaphysical situation seemed simple ; mathematics embodied perfect a - priori knowledge , those sciences able to most mathematicize themselves were the most successful at phenomenal prediction ; perfect knowledge would therefore consist of a mathematical formalism , arrived at by science and embracing all of reality , that would ground a-posteriori empirical understanding in a -priori rational logic .
It was in this spirit that Condorcet dared to imagine describing the entire universe as a mutually - solving set of partial differential equations .
The first cracks in this inspiring picture appeared in the latter half of the 19th century when Riemann and Lobachevsky independently proved that Euclid 's Axiom of Parallels could be replaced by alternatives which yielded consistent geometries .
Riemann 's geometry was modeled on a sphere , Lobachevsky 's on a hyperboloid of rotation .
The impact of this discovery has been obscured by later and greater upheavals , but at the time it broke on the intellectual world like a thunderbolt .
For the existence of mutually inconsistent axiom systems for geometry , any of which could be modeled in the phenomenal universe , called the whole relationship between mathematics and physical theory into question .
When there was only Euclid , there was only one possible geometry .
One could believe that the Euclidean axioms constituted a kind of perfect a - priori knowledge about geometry in the phenomenal world .
But suddenly we had three geometries , an embarrassment of metaphysical riches .
For how were we to choose between the axioms of plane , spherical , and hyperbolic geometry as a description of " real " geometry ?
Because all three are consistent , we could n't choose on any a - priori basis -- the choice had to become empirical , based on their predictive power for a given situation .
Of course , physical theorists had long been accustomed to choosing formalisms to fit a scientific problem .
But it had been widely , if unconsciously , assumed that the need to do so ad hoc was a function of human ignorance ; that , given good enough mathematics and logic , we could deduce the correct choice from first principles , producing a - priori descriptions of reality to be confirmed , as an afterthought , by empirical check .
But now , the Euclidean geometry that had been considered the model for axiomatic perfection in mathematics for over two thousand years , had been dethroned .
If one could not know something as fundamental as the geometry of space a - priori , what hope was there for a purely " rational " theory encompassing all of nature ?
Psychologically , Riemann / Lobachevsky struck at the very heart of the enterprise of mathematics as it was then conceived .
Furthermore , Riemann / Lobachevsky called the nature of mathematical intuition into question .
It had been easy to believe implicitly that mathematical intuition was a form of perception -- a glimpse of the Platonic noumena behind reality .
But with two other geometries jostling Euclid , nobody knew for sure what the noumena looked like any more !
Mathematicians responded to this dual problem with an increase in rigor , by trying to apply the axiomatic method throughout mathematics .
It was gradually realized that the belief in mathematical intuition as a kind of perception of a noumenal world had encouraged sloppiness ; proofs in the pre-axiomatic period often relied on shared intuitions about mathematical " reality " that could no longer be considered automatically valid .
The new thinking in mathematics led to a series of spectacular successes ; among these were Cantorian set theory , Frege 's axiomatization of number , and eventually Russell & Whitehead 's monumental synthesis in Principia Mathematica .
However , it also had a price .
The axiomatic method made the connection between mathematics and phenomenal reality narrower and narrower .
At the same time , discoveries like the Banach - Tarski Paradox suggested that mathematical axioms that seemed to be consistent with phenomenal experience could lead to dizzying contradictions with that experience .
The majority of mathematicians quickly became " Formalists " , holding that pure mathematics could not be philosophically considered more than a sort of elaborate game played with marks on paper ( this is the theory behind Robert Heinlein 's pithy characterization of mathematics as " a zero - content system " ) .
The old - fashioned " Platonist " belief in the noumenal reality of mathematical objects seemed headed for the dustbin , despite the fact that mathematicians continued to feel like Platonists during the process of mathematical discovery .
Philosophically , then , the axiomatic method lead most mathematicians to abandon previous beliefs in the metaphysical specialness of mathematics .
It also created today 's split between pure and applied mathematics .
Most of the great mathematicians of the early modern period -- Newton , Liebniz , Fourier , Gauss , and others -- were also phenomenal scientists ( i.e. " natural philosophers " ) .
The axiomatic method incubated the modern idea of the pure mathematician as super - esthete , unconcerned with the merely physical .
Ironically , Formalism gave pure mathematicians a bad case of Platonic attitude .
Applied mathematicians stopped being invited to tea and learned to hang out with physicists .
This brings us to the early 20th century .
For the beleaguered minority of Platonists , worse was yet to come .
Cantor , Frege , Russell and Whitehead showed that all of pure mathematics could be built on the single axiomatic foundation of set theory .
This suited the Formalists just fine ; mathematics coalesced , at least in principle , from a bunch of little disconnected games to one big game .
It also made the Platonist minority happy ; if there turned out to be one big , over - arching consistent structure behind all of mathematics , the metaphysical specialness of mathematics might yet be rescued .
Unfortunately , it turns out that there is more than one way to axiomatize set theory .
In particular , there are at least four major different combinations of assumptions about infinite sets that lead to mutually exclusive set theories ( the Axiom of Choice or its negation ; the Continuum Hypothesis or its negation ) .
It was Riemmann / Lobachevsky all over again , but on a much more fundamental level .
Riemannian and Lobachevskian geometry could be modeled finitely , in the world ; you could decide at least empirically which one fit .
Normally , you could regard all three as special cases of the geometry of geodesics on manifolds , thereby fitting them into the superstructure erected on set theory .
But the independent axioms in set theory do n't seem to lead to any results that can be modeled in the observable finite world .
And there 's no way to assert both the Continuum Hypothesis and its negation in one set theory .
How 's a poor Platonist to choose which system describes " real " mathematics ?
The victory of the Formalist position seemed complete .
In a negative way , though , a Platonist had the last laugh .
Kurt Godel threw a spanner in the Formalist program of axiomatization when he showed that any axiom system powerful enough to include the integers would have to be either inconsistent ( yielding contradictions ) or incomplete ( too weak to decide the truth or falsehood of some assertions in the system ) .
And that is more or less where things stand today .
Mathematicians know that any attempt to put forward mathematics as a - priori knowledge about the universe must fall afoul of numerous paradoxes and impossible choices about what axiom system describes " real " mathematics .
They 've been reduced to hoping that the standard axiomatizations are not inconsistent but incomplete , and wondering uneasily what contradictions or unprovable theorems are waiting discovery out there , lurking like landmines in the noosphere .
Meanwhile , on the empirical front , mathematics continued to be a spectacular success as a theory - building tool .
The great successes of 20th - century physics ( general relativity and quantum mechanics ) wandered so far from the realm of physical intuition that they could be understood only by meditating deeply on their mathematical formalisms , and following through to their logical conclusions , even when those conclusions seem wildly bizarre .
What irony .
Even as mathematical ' perception ' came to seem less and less reliable in pure mathematics , it became more and more indispensable in phenomenal science !
Against this background , Einstein 's famous quote wondering at the applicability of mathematics to phenomenal science poses an even thornier problem than at first appears .
The relationship between mathematical models and phenomenal prediction is complicated , not just in practice but in principle .
Much more complicated because , as we now know , there are mutually exclusive ways to axiomatize mathematics !
It can be diagrammed as follows ( thanks to Jesse Perry for supplying the original of this chart ) :
The key transactions for our purposes are C and D -- the translations between a predictive model and a mathematical formalism .
What mystified Einstein is how often D leads to new insights .
We begin to get some handle on the problem if we phrase it more precisely ; that is , " Why does a good choice of C so often yield new knowledge via D ? "
The simplest answer is to invert the question and treat it as a definition .
A " good choice of C " is one which leads to new predictions .
The choice of C is not one that can be made a - priori ; one has to choose , empirically , a mapping between real and mathematical objects , then evaluate that mapping by seeing if it predicts well .
For example , the positive integers are a good formalism for counting marbles .
We can confidently predict that if we put two marbles in a jar , and then put three marbles in a jar , and then empirically associate the set of two marbles with the mathematical entity 2 , and likewise associate the set of three marbles with the mathematical entity 3 , and then assume that physical aggregation is modeled by + , then the number of marbles in the jar will correspond to the mathematical entity 5 .
The above may seem to be a remarkable amount of pedantry to load on an obvious association , one we normally make without having to think about it .
But remember that small children have to learn to count ... and consider how the above would fail if we were putting into the jar , not marbles , but lumps of mud or volumes of gas !
One can argue that it only makes sense to marvel at the utility of mathematics if one assumes that C for any phenomenal system is an a -priori given .
But we 've seen that it is not .
A physicist who marvels at the applicability of mathematics has forgotten or ignored the complexity of C ; he is really being puzzled at the human ability to choose appropriate mathematical models empirically .
By reformulating the question this way , we 've slain half the dragon .
Human beings are clever , persistent apes who like to play with ideas .
If a mathematical formalism can be found to fit a phenomenal system , some human will eventually find it .
And the discovery will come to look " inevitable " because those who tried and failed will generally be forgotten .
But there is a deeper question behind this : why do good choices of mathematical model exist at all ?
That is , why is there any mathematical formalism for , say , quantum mechanics which is so productive that it actually predicts the discovery of observable new particles ?
The way to " answer " this question is by observing that it , too , properly serves as a kind of definition .
There are many phenomenal systems for which no such exact predictive formalism has been found , nor for which one seems likely .
Poets like to mumble about the human heart , but more mundane examples are available .
The weather , or the behavior of any economy larger than village size , for example -- systems so chaotically interdependent that exact prediction is effectively impossible ( not just in fact but in principle ) .
There are many things for which mathematical modeling leads at best to fuzzy , contingent , statistical results and never successfully predicts ' new entities ' at all .
In fact , such systems are the rule , not the exception .
So the proper answer to the question " Why is mathematics is so marvelously applicable to my science ? " is simply " Because that 's the kind of science you 've chosen to study ! "
You can only learn from a mistake after you admit you ’ve made it .
As soon as you start blaming other people ( or the universe itself ) you distance yourself from any possible lesson .
But if you courageously stand up and honestly say “ This is my mistake and I am responsible ” the possibilities for learning will move towards you .
Admission of a mistake , even if only privately to yourself , makes learning possible by moving the focus away from blame assignment and towards understanding .
Wise people admit their mistakes easily .
They know progress accelerates when they do .
This advice runs counter to the cultural assumptions we have about mistakes and failure , namely that they are shameful things .
We ’re taught in school , in our families , or at work to feel guilty about failure and to do whatever we can to avoid mistakes .
This sense of shame combined with the inevitability of setbacks when attempting difficult things explains why many people give up on their goals : they ’re not prepared for the mistakes and failures they ’ll face on their way to what they want .
What ’s missing in many people ’s beliefs about success is the fact that the more challenging the goal , the more frequent and difficult setbacks will be .
The larger your ambitions , the more dependent you will be on your ability to overcome and learn from your mistakes .
But for many reasons admitting mistakes is difficult .
An implied value in many cultures is that our work represents us : if you fail a test , then you are a failure .
If you make a mistake then you are a mistake ( You may never have felt this way , but many people do .
It explains the behavior of some of your high school or college friends ) .
Like eggs , steak and other tasty things we are given letter grades ( A , B , C , D and F ) organizing us for someone else ’s consumption : universities and employers evaluate young candidates on their grades , numbers based on scores from tests unforgiving to mistakes .
For anyone that never discovers a deeper self - identity , based not on lack of mistakes but on courage , compassionate intelligence , commitment and creativity , life is a scary place made safe only by never getting into trouble , never breaking rules and never taking the risks that their hearts tell them they need to take .
Learning from mistakes requires three things :
Putting yourself in situations where you can make interesting mistakes Having the self - confidence to admit to them Being courageous about making changes
This essay will cover all three .
First , we have to classify the different kinds of mistakes .
The four kinds of mistakes
One way to categorize mistakes is into these categories :
Stupid : Absurdly dumb things that just happen .
Stubbing your toe , dropping your pizza on your neighbor ’s fat cat or poking yourself in the eye with a banana .
: Absurdly dumb things that just happen .
Stubbing your toe , dropping your pizza on your neighbor ’s fat cat or poking yourself in the eye with a banana .
Simple : Mistakes that are avoidable but your sequence of decisions made inevitable .
Having the power go out in the middle of your party because you forgot to pay the rent , or running out of beer at said party because you did n’t anticipate the number of guests .
: Mistakes that are avoidable but your sequence of decisions made inevitable .
Having the power go out in the middle of your party because you forgot to pay the rent , or running out of beer at said party because you did n’t anticipate the number of guests .
Involved : Mistakes that are understood but require effort to prevent .
Regularly arriving late to work / friends , eating fast food for lunch every day , or going bankrupt at your start - up company because of your complete ignorance of basic accounting .
: Mistakes that are understood but require effort to prevent .
Regularly arriving late to work / friends , eating fast food for lunch every day , or going bankrupt at your start - up company because of your complete ignorance of basic accounting .
Complex : Mistakes that have complicated causes and no obvious way to avoid next time .
Examples include making tough decisions that have bad results , relationships that fail , or other unpleasant or unsatisfying outcomes to important things .
( I ’m sure you can come up with other categories : that ’s fantastic , please share them here .
But these are the ones you ’re stuck with for the rest of this essay ) .
I ’m leaving all philosophical questions about mistakes up to you .
One person ’s pleasure is another person ’s mistake : decide for yourself .
Maybe you enjoy stabbing your neighbor ’s cat with a banana , who knows .
We all do things we know are bad in the long term , but are oh so good in the short term .
So regardless of where you stand , I ’m working with you .
However , mistakes are defined in your personal philosophy this essay should help you learn from them .
Learning from mistakes that fall into the first two categories ( Stupid & Simple ) is easy , but shallow .
Once you recognize the problem and know the better way , you should be able to avoid similar mistakes .
Or in some cases you ’ll realize that no matter what you do once in a while you ’ll do stupid things ( e.g. even Einstein stubbed his toes ) .
But these kinds of mistakes are not interesting .
The lessons are n’t deep and it ’s unlikely they lead you to learn much about yourself or anything else .
For example compare these two mistakes
My use of dual part harmony for the 2nd trumpets in my orchestral composition for the homeless children ’s shelter benefit concert overpowered the intended narrative of the violins .
I got an Oreo stuck in my underwear .
The kind of mistakes you make defines you .
The more interesting the mistakes , the more interesting the life .
If your biggest mistakes are missing reruns of tv-shows or buying the wrong lottery ticket you ’re not challenging yourself enough to earn more interesting mistakes .
And since there is n’t much to learn from simple and stupid mistakes , most people try to minimize their frequency and how much time we spend recovering from them .
Their time is better spent learning from bigger mistakes .
But if we habitually or compulsively make stupid mistakes , then what we really have is an involved mistake .
Involved mistakes
The third pile of mistakes , Involved mistakes , requires significant changes to avoid .
These are mistakes we tend to make through either habit or nature .
But since change is so much harder than we admit , we often suffer through the same mistakes again and again instead of making the tough changes needed to avoid them .
Difficulty with change involves an earlier point made in this essay .
Some feel that to agree to change means there is something wrong with them .
“ If I ’m perfect , why would I need to change ? ”
Since they need to protect their idea of perfection , they refuse change ( Or possibly , even refuse to admit they did anything wrong ) .
But this is a trap : refusing to acknowledge mistakes , or tendencies to make similar kinds of mistakes , is a refusal to acknowledge reality .
If you ca n’t see the gaps , flaws , or weaknesses in your behavior you ’re forever trapped in the same behavior and limitations you ’ve always had , possibly since you were a child ( When someone tells you you ’re being a baby , they might be right ) .
Another challenge to change is that it may require renewing commitments you ’ve broken before , from the trivial “ Yes , I ’ll try to remember to take the trash out ” to the more serious “ I ’ll try to stop sleeping with all of your friends ” .
This happens in any environment : the workplace , friendships , romantic relationships or even commitments you ’ve made to yourself .
Renewing commitments can be tough since it requires not only admitting to the recent mistake , but acknowledging similar mistakes you ’ve made before .
The feelings of failure and guilt become so large that we do n’t have the courage to try again .
This is why success in learning from mistakes often requires involvement from other people , either for advice , training or simply to keep you honest .
A supportive friend ’s , mentor ’s or professional ’s perspective on your behavior will be more objective than your own and help you identify when you ’re hedging , breaking or denying the commitments you ’ve made .
In moments of weakness the only way to prevent a mistake is to enlist someone else .
“ Fred , I want to play my Gamecube today but I promised Sally I would n’t .
Can we hang out so you can make sure I do n’t do it today ? ”
Admitting you need help and asking for it often requires more courage than trying to do it on your own .
The biggest lesson to learn in involved mistakes is that you have to examine your own ability to change .
Some kinds of change will be easier for you than others and until you make mistakes and try to correct them you wo n’t know which they are .
How to handle complex mistakes
The most interesting kinds of mistake are the last group : Complex mistakes .
The more complicated the mistake you ’ve made , the more patient you need to be .
There ’s nothing worse than flailing around trying to fix something you do n’t understand : you ’ll always make things worse .
I remember as a kid when our beloved Atari 2600 game system started showing static on the screen during games .
The solution my brother and I came up with ?
Smack the machine as hard as we could ( A clear sign I had the intellect for management ) .
Amazingly this worked for a while , but after weeks of regular beatings the delicate electronics eventually gave out .
We were lazy , ignorant and impatient , and could n’t see that our solution would work against us .
Professional investigators , like journalists , police detectives and doctors , try to get as many perspectives on situations as possible before taking action ( Policemen use eyewitnesses , Doctors use exams and tests , scientific studies use large sample sizes ) .
They know that human perception , including their own , is highly fallible and biased by many factors .
The only way to obtain an objective understanding is to compare several different perspectives .
When trying to understand your own mistakes in complex situations you should work in the same way .
Start by finding someone else to talk to about what happened .
Even if no one was within 50 yards when you crashed your best friend ’s BMW into your neighbor ’s living room , talking to someone else gives you the benefit of their experience applied to your situation .
They may know of someone that ’s made a similar mistake or know a way to deal with the problem that you do n’t .
But most importantly , by describing what happened you are forced to break down the chronology and clearly define ( your recollection of ) the sequence of events .
They may ask you questions that surface important details you did n’t notice before .
There may have been more going on ( did the brakes fail ?
Did you swerve to avoid your neighbor ’s daughter ?
etc. ) than you , consumed by your emotions about your failure , realized .
If multiple people were involved ( say , your co-workers ) , you want to hear each person ’s account of what happened .
Each person will emphasize different aspects of the situation based on their skills , biases , and circumstances , getting you closer to a complete view of what took place .
If the situation was / is contentious you may need people to report their stories independently – police investigators never have eyewitness collaborate .
They want each point of view to be delivered unbiased by other eyewitnesses ( possibly erroneous ) recollections .
Later on they ’ll bring each account together and see what fits and what does n’t .
An illustrative example comes from the book Inviting disasters Inviting Disaster : Lessons from the edge of technology .
It tells the story of a floating dormitory for oil workers in the North Sea that rolled over during the night killing over 100 people .
The engineering experts quickly constructed different theories and complex explanations that focused on operational errors and management decisions .
All of these theories were wrong .
It was eventually discovered through careful analysis that weeks earlier a crack in a support structure had been painted over , instead of being reported and repaired .
This stupid , simple and small mistake caused the superstructure to fail , sinking the dormitory .
Without careful analysis the wrong conclusion would have been reached ( e.g. smacking the Atari ) and the wrong lesson would have been learned .
Until you work backwards for moments , hours or days before the actual mistake event , you probably wo n’t see all of the contributing factors and can’t learn all of the possible lessons .
The more complex the mistake , the further back you ’ll need to go and the more careful and open - minded you need to be in your own investigation .
You may even need to bring in an objective outsider to help sort things out .
You ’d never have a suspect in a crime lead the investigation , right ?
Then how can you completely trust yourself to investigate your own mistakes ?
Here some questions to ask to help your investigation :
What was the probable sequence of events ?
Were their multiple small mistakes that led to a larger one ?
Were there any erroneous assumptions made ?
Did we have the right goals ?
Were we trying to solve the right problem ?
Was it possible to have recognized bad assumptions earlier ?
Was there information we know now that would have been useful then ?
What would we do differently if in this exact situation again ?
How can we avoid getting into situations like this ?
( What was the kind of situation we wanted to be in ? )
Was this simply unavoidable given all of the circumstances ?
A failure is n’t a mistake if you were attempting the impossible .
Has enough time passed for us to know if this is a mistake or not ?
As you put together the sequence of events , you ’ll recognize that mistakes initially categorized as complex eventually break down into smaller mistakes .
The painted over crack was avoidable but happened anyway ( Stupid ) .
Was there a system in place for avoiding these mistakes ?
( Simple ) .
Were there unaddressed patterns of behavior that made that system fail ?
( Involved ) .
Once you ’ve broken a complex mistake down you can follow the previous advice on making changes .
Humor and Courage
No amount of analysis can replace your confidence in yourself .
When you ’ve made a mistake , especially a visible one that impacts other people , it ’s natural to question your ability to perform next time .
But you must get past your doubts .
The best you can do is study the past , practice for the situations you expect , and get back in the game .
Your studying of the past should help broaden your perspective .
You want to be aware of how many other smart , capable well - meaning people have made similar mistakes to the one you made , and went on to even bigger mistakes , I mean successes , in the future .
One way to know you ’ve reached a healthy place is your sense of humor .
It might take a few days , but eventually you ’ll see some comedy in what happened .
When friends tell stories of their mistakes it makes you laugh , right ?
Well , when you can laugh at your own mistakes you know you ’ve accepted it and no longer judge yourself on the basis of one single event .
Reaching this kind of perspective is very important in avoiding future mistakes .
Humor loosens up your psychology and prevents you from obsessing about the past .
It ’s easy to make new mistakes by spending too much energy protecting against the previous ones .
Remember the saying “ a man fears the tiger that bit him last , instead of the tiger that will bite him next ” .
So the most important lesson in all of mistake making is to trust that while mistakes are inevitable , if you can learn from the current one , you ’ll also be able to learn from future ones .
No matter what happens tomorrow you ’ll be able to get value from it , and apply it to the day after that .
Progress wo n’t be a straight line but if you keep learning you will have more successes than failures , and the mistakes you make along the way will help you get to where you want to go .
The learning from mistakes checklist
Accepting responsibility makes learning possible .
Do n’t equate making mistakes with being a mistake .
You ca n’t change mistakes , but you can choose how to respond to them .
Growth starts when you can see room for improvement .
Work to understand why it happened and what the factors were .
What information could have avoided the mistake ?
What small mistakes , in sequence , contributed to the bigger mistake ?
Are there alternatives you should have considered but did not ?
What kinds of changes are required to avoid making this mistake again ?
What kinds of change are difficult for you ?
How do you think your behavior should / would change in you were in a similar situation again ?
Work to understand the mistake until you can make fun of it ( or not want to kill others that make fun ) .
Do n’t overcompensate : the next situation wo n’t be the same as the last .

Nero is a well known CD / DVD burning application .
It allows users to create various CD / DVD formats fairly easily .
I 've noticed an annoyance in Nero almost instantly when I started using it :
It 's burning dialog has thebutton highlighted ( focused ) by default .
When a user clicks the Burn button in Nero , the dialog above opens and the burning process is started .
But Nero makes it far too easy for the user to cancel the process by mistake .
This is what one might call a , it invites user errors when it actually intents to create a clean one - task interface .
The burning process is Nero 's epicentre but it 's interface makes it too easy for users toslip on the floor and break something .
User interface design is often about making the right thing easy and the wrong thing hard .
Interfaces like Nero 's burning dialog are not too hard , but someone should go over them with a towel and wipe the water off the floor .

The earlier statement from Rome was the first indication that a suspect had gotten as far as Italy .
One unconfirmed report after the failed July 21 bombings said one would - be bomber had fled to Belgium or the Netherlands .
Another said the man had left England in the past two or three days and had been tracked through Paris and Milan by cellphone calls to a brother - in - law resident in Rome .
But the announcement from Rome seemed certain to raise questions about how a failed bomber had managed to slip out of Britain undetected , particularly since images showing all four suspects on closed - circuit television were made public just a day after the July 21 attacks .
In London today , daylight raids on streets in Kensal Green and Westbourne Park injected what has become familiar imagery in this city under siege since the first terror attack on July 7 - streets cordoned and residents fleeing homes as the police ring unremarkable homes and apartments in quiet streets .
People fled in underwear and dressing - gowns , clutching children , shoes and clothes , chased from their homes at late morning .
A separate police statement today said two women , not identified by name , were arrested under anti-terrorism laws at Liverpool Street mainline station .
The area around the station was sealed off after one of the women tried to run after refusing a police order to open a bag , witnesses said .
In west London , explosions , possibly from stun grenades , boomed across leafy streets as police moved in , and at least one suspect was seen on television being led away handcuffed and clad in a white head - to - toe coverall to prevent the loss of forensic evidence .
Police snipers using rifles with telescopic sights took up position overlooking the apartments where the arrests happened .
The raids were arranged at short notice , probably after informants responded to increasingly desperate police appeals for information leading them to the suspects .
Television showed police ordering one man , whom they addressed only as Mohammed , to undress and surrender .

Ergonomic Guidelines for arranging a Computer Workstation - 10 steps for users
Creating a good ergonomic working arrangement is important to protecting your health .
The following 10 steps are a brief summary of those things that most Ergonomists agree are important .
If you follow the 10 steps they should help you to improve your working arrangement .
You can also use the Computer Workstation Checklist to help to pinpoint any areas of concern and take a look at the ' Computer Workstation summary ' diagram ' for specific tips .
However , every situation is different , and if you can't seem to get your arrangement to feel right or you are confused about some of the following recommendations you should seek professional advice .
Also see my book - Ergonomic Workplace Design for Health , Wellness , and Productivity .
10 steps for a good ergonomic workstation arrangement
Work through the following 10 steps to help you decide on what will be a good ergonomic design for your situation :
How will the computer be used ?
who will be using the computer ? -
If the computer will only be used by one person then the arrangement can be optimized for that person 's size and shape , and features such as an adjustable height chair may be unnecessary .
If it 's going to be used by several people , you will need to create an arrangement that most closely satisfies the needs of the extremes , that is the smallest and tallest , thinnest and broadest persons , as well as those in between these extremes .
how long will people be using the computer ?
If it 's a few minutes a day then ergonomic issues may not be a high priority .
If it 's more than 1 hour per day it is advisable that you create an ergonomic arrangement .
If it 's more than 4 hours then you should immediately implement an ergonomic arrangement .
What kind of computer will be used ?
Desktops - most ergonomic guidelines for computer workstation arrangements assume that you will be using a desktop system where the computer screen is separate from the keyboard .
- most ergonomic guidelines for computer workstation arrangements assume that you will be using a where the computer screen is separate from the keyboard .
Laptop computers are growing in popularity and are great for short periods of computer work .
Guidelines for laptop use are more difficult because laptop design inherently is problematic - when the screen is at a comfortable height and distance the keyboard is n't and vice versa .
For sustained use you should consider purchasing either : an external monitor
an external keyboard , preferably with a negative - tilt keyboard tray
both , and
a docking station and then arranging your workspace to create a good workstation layout .
See " 5 tips for using a Laptop Computer " .
What furniture will you use ?
Make sure that the computer ( monitor , CPU system unit , keyboard , mouse ) are placed on a stable working surface ( nothing that wobbles ) with adequate room for proper arrangement .
If this work surface is going to be used for writing on paper as well as computer use a flat surface that is between 28 " - 30 " above the floor ( suitable for most adults ) .
You should consider attaching a keyboard / mouse tray system to your work surface .
Choose a system that is height adjustable , that allows you to tilt the keyboard down away from you slightly for better wrist posture ( negative tilt ) , and that allows you to use the mouse with your upper arms relaxed and as close to the body as possible and with your wrist in a comfortable and neutral position .
Thinking about a sit - stand workstation , see below .
Thinking about a height - adjustable split workstation , see below .
What chair will be used ?
Choose a comfortable chair for the user to sit in .
If only one person is using this the chair can even be at a fixed height providing that it is comfortable to sit on and has a good backrest that provides lumbar support .
If more than one person will be using the computer , consider buying and a chair with several ergonomic features .
Studies show that the best seated posture is a reclined posture of 100 - 110 degrees NOT the upright 90 degree posture that is often portrayed .
In the recommended posture the chair starts to work for the body and there are significant decreases in postural muscle activity and in intervertebral disc pressure in the lumbar spine .
Erect sitting is NOT relaxed , sustainable sitting , reclined sitting is .
Chair armrests -
Having armrests on a chair can be helpful to aid getting into and getting out of the chair .
Also , the armrests can be useful for the occasional resting of the arms ( e.g. when on the phone , sitting back relaxing ) .
However , it is not a good idea to permanently wrest the forearms on armrests while you are typing or mousing because this can compress the flexor muscles and some armrest can also compress the ulnar never at the elbow .
Ideally , it should be easy to get the armrests out of the way when you need to have free access to the keyboard and mouse .
These days most office chairs have armrests and many of them have adjustable height armrests , so look for a chair that is a comfortable fit to you and that has broader , flatter , padded armrests that you can easily move out of the way if needed is the best approach .
If you are able to occasionally rest your hands on the keyboard on a palm rest and if you have a comfortable chair that does not have any armrests then this is also quite acceptable .
What kind of work will the computer be used for ?
Try to anticipate what type of software will be used most often .
Word processing - arranging the best keyboard / mouse position is high priority .
- arranging the best keyboard / mouse position is high priority .
Surfing the net , graphic design - arranging the best mouse position is high priority .
- arranging the best mouse position is high priority .
Data entry - arranging the best numeric keypad / keyboard is a high priority .
- arranging the best numeric keypad / keyboard is a high priority .
Games - arranging the best keyboard / mouse / game pad is a high priority .
What can you see ?
Make sure that any paper documents that you are reading are placed as close to the computer monitor as possible and that these are at a similar angle - use a document holder where possible .
The computer monitor should be placed : directly in front of you and facing you , not angled to the left or right .
This helps to eliminate too much neck twisting .
Also , whatever the user is working with , encourage him / her to use the screen scroll bars to ensure that what is being viewed most is in the center of the monitor rather than at the top or bottom of the screen .

Also , whatever the user is working with , encourage him / her to use the screen scroll bars to ensure that what is being viewed most is in the center of the monitor rather than at the top or bottom of the screen .
center the monitor on the user so that the body and / or neck is n't twisted when looking at the screen .
However , if you are working with a large monitor and spend most of your time working with software like MSWord , which defaults to creating left aligned new pages , and you do n't want to have to drag these to more central locations , try aligning yourself to a point about 1 /3rd of the distance across the monitor from the left side .

put the monitor at a comfortable height that does n't make the user tilt their head up to see it or bend their neck down to see it .
When you are seated comfortably , a user 's eyes should be in line with a point on the screen about 2 - 3 " below the top of the monitor casing ( not the screen ) .
Sit back in your chair at an angle of around 100 - 110 degrees ( i.e. slight recline ) and hold your right arm out horizontally , your middle finger should almost touch the center of the screen .
From that starting position you can then make minor changes to screen height and angle to suit .
Research shows the center of the monitor should be about 17 - 18 degrees below horizontal for optimal viewing , and this is where it will be if you follow the simple arm extension / finger pointing tip .
You actually see more visual field below the horizon than above this ( look down a corridor and you 'll see more of the floor than the ceiling ) , so at this position the user should comfortably be able to see more of the screen .
If the monitor is too low , you will crane their neck forwards , if it 's too high you 'll tilt their head backwards and end up with neck / shoulder pain .

bifocals and progressive lens - even if you wear bifocals or progressive lens , if you sit back in your chair in a reclined posture ( with you back at around 110 degrees ) that is recommended for good low back health , rather than sitting erect at 90 degrees , and if you slightly tilt the monitor backwards and place this at a comfortable height you should be able to see the screen without tilting your head back or craning your neck forwards .
Postural problems with bifocals can occur if you sits erect or even hunched forwards .
The problem with low monitors is that they cause neck flexion and suffer more from glare .
Recent studies have shown that the best position for a computer monitor is for the center of the screen to be at around 17.5 degrees below eye level .
Try to align your eyes with the top of the viewing area of the screen , and this should put the center about right geometrically .

viewing distance - the monitor should be at a comfortable horizontal distance for viewing , which usually is around an arms length ( sit back in your chair and raise your arm and your fingers should touch the screen ) .
At this distance you should be able to see the viewing area of the monitor without making head movements .
If text looks too small then either use a larger font or magnify the screen image in the software rather than sitting closer to the monitor .

screen quality - use a good quality computer screen .
Make sure that the text characters on your screen look sharp , and that they are a comfortable size ( you can change the screen resolution to find a comfortable and clear character size ) .
If you can see the screen flickering out of the corner of your eye you should try increasing the refresh rate of your monitor ( with a PC you can change monitor resolution and refresh rates using the Monitor control panel in your Settings folder , with a Mac you can use the Monitor control panel ) .
You can also consider using a good quality glass anti-glare filter or an LCD display ( like a laptop screen ) .

eye checkup - there are natural changes in vision that occur in most people during their early 40's .
It 's a good idea to periodically have your eyes checked by a qualified professional .

If any screen adjustments feel uncomfortable then change them until the arrangement feels more comfortable or seek further professional help .
Use a document holder that can be comfortably seen : use an in - line document holder that sits between the keyboard / keyboard tray and screen and is aligned with your body midline so that all you have to do is look down to see the documents and raise your eyes to see the screen .
use a screen - mounted document holder and position this to the side of your screen that is your dominant eye use a freestanding document holder and position this next to the side of the screen and slightly angle it so that it follows a curve from the side of the screen .
that can be comfortably seen : Posture , posture posture !
Good posture is the basis of good workstation ergonomics .
Good posture is the best way to avoid a computer - related injury .
To ensure good user posture :
Watch the user 's posture !
Make sure that the user can reach the keyboard keys with their wrists as flat as possible ( not bent up or down ) and straight ( not bent left or right ) .
Make sure that the user 's elbow angle ( the angle between the inner surface of the upper arm and the forearm ) is at or greater than 90 degrees to avoid nerve compression at the elbow .
Make sure that the upper arm and elbow are as close to the body and as relaxed as possible for mouse use - avoid overreaching .
Also make sure that the wrist is as straight as possible when the mouse is being used .
Make sure the user sits back in the chair and has good back support .
Also check that the feet can be placed flat on the floor or on a footrest .
Make sure the head and neck are as straight as possible .
Make sure the posture feels relaxed for the user .
Keep it close !
Make sure that those things the user uses most frequently are placed closest to the user so that they can be conveniently and comfortably reached .
Make sure that the user is centered on the alphanumeric keyboard .
Most modern keyboards are asymmetrical in design ( the alphanumeric keyboard is to the left and a numeric keypad to the right ) .
If the outer edges of the keyboard are used as landmarks for centering the keyboard and monitor , the users hands will be deviated because the alphanumeric keys will be to the left of the user 's midline .
Move the keyboard so that the center of the alphanumeric keys ( the B key , is centered on the mid-line of the user ) .
make sure that the phone is also close to you if you frequently use it .
A good workstation ergonomic arrangement will allow any computer user to work in a neutral , relaxed , ideal typing posture that will minimize the risk of developing any injury .
An ideal keyboard arrangement is to place this on a height adjustable negative - tilt tray .
An ideal mouse arrangement is for this to be on a flat surface that 's 1 - 2 " above the keyboard and moveable over the numeric keypad .
If you want a surface at the level of the keyboard base then make sure that this can also be angled downwards slightly to help to keep your hands in wrist neutral while you are mousing , and keep your elbow is as close to the body as possible while you work .

Via Think Progress , we learn that Iranian weapons shipments moving around Iraq – and the prototypical subject of an alarmist dog-and - pony show over the weekend – are actually typical of weapons destined for SCIRI , a Bush - backed rival group to al - Sadr ’s Mehdi Army , according to a report from CNN ’s Michael Ware ( video available at Think Progress ) :
U.S. intelligence and military officials have stated that Iranian weapons shipments " are going to Shiite militias that include rogue elements of Moqtada al - Sadr ’s Mehdi army militia . "
But U.S. officials have not been as vocal about possible Iranian support for a separate Shiite militia , the Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution In Iraq ( SCIRI ) .
The Mehdi Army and SCIRI are rivals , and both have armed wings .
Yesterday , Kevin Drum speculated that Iran might be providing the SCIRI militia with weaponry .
Drum wrote , " In other words , if we had to guess where the bombs were going , we might guess that SCIRI ’s militia is getting a share of the action too . "
There ’s no need to guess any longer .
CNN ’s Michael Ware has confirmed that Iranians have been supplying weapons to SCIRI .
Keep in mind that SCIRI ’s head , Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , was lauded by Bush just a couple of short months ago as " one of the distinguished leaders of a free Iraq , " even though the Iranians captured in two raids on Christmas Eve , accused of attacking Iraqi security forces , were taken at al - Hakim ’s personal compound , according to the New York Times :
BAGHDAD , Dec. 24 — The American military is holding at least four Iranians in Iraq , including men the Bush administration called senior military officials , who were seized in a pair of raids late last week aimed at people suspected of conducting attacks on Iraqi security forces , according to senior Iraqi and American officials in Baghdad and Washington .
... one of the raids took place in the Baghdad compound of Abdul Aziz al - Hakim , one of Iraq ’s most powerful Shiite leaders , who traveled to Washington three weeks ago to meet President Bush .
The weapons , the allegations , the players , the CNN confirmation ... things get curiouser and curiouser as sabers continue to rattle .
This is what happens when you piss off a customer who happens to be an engineer . 🙂
AOL is moving away from its old dial - up service
Richard Parsons also said there were no plans for a tie - up with Microsoft 's search - engine technology .
News agency and newspaper reports said Google had been ready to share AOL with Time Warner and US cable firm Comcast .
Such a deal would have put Google 's search tools with Time Warner 's TV and film content in a portal .
Any such move would also have addressed criticism from investors of Time Warner 's strategy .
Rivals
Time Warner has recently come under fire from billionaire corporate raider Carl Icahn , who says its management is failing to serve shareholders .
Google 's search and advertising clout could help AOL 's transition
The plan could be boosted by Google 's success in attracting online adverts , as well as the huge reach of its search and other tools , combined with delivery to cable customers of both Comcast and Time Warner - the two biggest US cable firms .
Google and Comcast are not the only potential suitors , with software giant Microsoft also reported to be discussing potential tie- ups between AOL and its own content service , MSN .
You want to hire a new programmer and you have the perfect candidate in mind , your old college roommate , Guillaume Portes .
Unfortunately you ca n’t just go out and offer him the job .
That would get you in trouble with your corporate HR policies which require that you first create a job description , advertise the position , interview and rate candidates and choose the most qualified person .
So much paperwork !
But you really want Guillaume and only Guillaume .
So what can you do ?
The solution is simple .
Create a job description that is written specifically to your friend ’s background and skills .
The more specific and longer you make the job description , the fewer candidates will be eligible .
Ideally you would write a job description that no one else in the world could possibly match .
Do n’t describe the job requirements .
Describe the person you want .
That ’s the trick .
So you end up with something like this :
5 years experience with Java , J2EE and web development , PHP , XSLT
Fluency in French and Corsican
Experience with the Llama farming industry
Mole on left shoulder
Sister named Bridgette
Although this technique may be familiar , in practice it is usually not taken to this extreme .
Corporate policies , employment law and common sense usually prevent one from making entirely irrational hiring decisions or discriminating against other applicants for things unrelated to the legitimate requirements of the job .
But evidently in the realm of standards there are no practical limits to the application of this technique .
It is quite possible to write a standard that allows only a single implementation .
By focusing entirely on the capabilities of a single application and documenting it in infuriatingly useless detail , you can easily create a “ Standard of One ” .
Of course , this begs the question of what is essential and what is not .
This really needs to be determined by domain analysis , requirements gathering and consensus building .
Let ’s just say that anyone who says that a single existing implementation is all one needs to look at is missing the point .
The art of specification is to generalize and simplify .
Generalizing allows you to do more with less , meeting more needs with fewer constraints .
Let ’s take a simplified example .
You are writing a specification for a file format for a very simple drawing program , ShapeMaster 2007 .
It can draw circles and squares , and they can have solid or dashed lines .
That ’s all it does .
Let ’s consider two different ways of specifying a file format .
In the first case , we ’ll simply dump out what ShapeMaster does in the most literal way possible .
Since it allows only two possible shapes and only two possible line styles , and we ’re not considering any other use , the file format will look like this :
< document > < shape iscircle = " true " isdotted = " false " / > < shape iscircle= " false " isdotted =" true " / > </document >
Although this format is very specific and very accurate , it lacks generality , extensibility and flexibility .
Although it may be useful for ShapeMaster 2007 , it will hardly be useful for anyone else , unless they merely want to create data for ShapeMaster 2007 .
It is not a portable , cross-application , open format .
It is a narrowly - defined , single application format .
It may be in XML .
It may even be reviewed by a standards committee .
But it is by its nature , closed and inflexible .
How could this have been done in a way which works for ShapeMaster 2007 but also is more flexible , extensible and considerate of the needs of different applications ?
One possibility is to generalize and simplify :
< document > < shape type=" circle " lineStyle = " solid " /> < shape type= " square " lineStyle = " dotted " / > </document >
Rather than hard - code the specific behavior of ShapeMaster , generalize it .
Make the required specific behavior be a special case of something more general .
In this way we solve the requirements of ShapeMaster 2007 , but also accommodate the needs of other applications , such as OpenShape , ShapePerfect and others .
For example , it can easily accommodate additional shapes and line styles :
< document > < shape type=" circle " lineStyle = " solid " /> < shape type= " square " lineStyle = " dotted " /> < shape type=" triangle " lineStyle = " dashed " / > </document >
This is a running criticism I have of Microsoft ’s Office Open XML ( OOXML ) .
It has been narrowly crafted to accommodate a single vendor ’s applications .
Its extreme length ( over 6,000 pages ) stems from it having detailed every wart of MS Office in an inextensible , inflexible manner .
This is not a specification ; this is a DNA sequence .
The ShapeMaster example given above is very similar to how OOXML handles “ Art Page Borders ” in a tedious , inflexible way , where a more general solution would have been both more flexible , but also far easier to specify and implement .
I ’ve written on this in more detail elsewhere .
Here are some other examples of where the OOXML “ Standard ” has bloated its specification with features that no one but Microsoft will be able to interpret :
2.15.3.6 autoSpaceLikeWord95 ( Emulate Word 95 Full - Width Character Spacing )
This element specifies that applications shall emulate the behavior of a previously existing word processing application ( Microsoft Word 95 ) when determining the spacing between full - width East Asian characters in a document ’s content .
[ Guidance :
To faithfully replicate this behavior , applications must imitate the behavior of that application , which involves many possible behaviors and cannot be faithfully placed into narrative for this Office Open XML Standard .
If applications wish to match this behavior , they must utilize and duplicate the output of those applications .
It is recommended that applications not intentionally replicate this behavior as it was deprecated due to issues with its output , and is maintained only for compatibility with existing documents from that application .
end guidance ]
( This example and the following examples brought to my attention by this post from Ben at Genii . )
What should we make of that ?
Not only must an interoperable OOXML application support Word 12 ’s style of spacing , but it must also support a different way of doing it in Word 95 .
And by the way , Microsoft is not going to tell you how it was done in Word 95 , even though they are the only ones in a position to do so .
Similarly , we have :
2.15.3.26 footnoteLayoutLikeWW8 ( Emulate Word 6.x/95/97 Footnote Placement )
This element specifies that applications shall emulate the behavior of a previously existing word processing application ( Microsoft Word 6.x/95/97 ) when determining the placement of the contents of footnotes relative to the page on which the footnote reference occurs .
This emulation typically involves some and / or all of the footnote being inappropriately placed on the page following the footnote reference .
[ Guidance :
To faithfully replicate this behavior , applications must imitate the behavior of that application , which involves many possible behaviors and cannot be faithfully placed into narrative for this Office Open XML Standard .
If applications wish to match this behavior , they must utilize and duplicate the output of those applications .
It is recommended that applications not intentionally replicate this behavior as it was deprecated due to issues with its output , and is maintained only for compatibility with existing documents from that application .
end guidance ]
Again , in order to support OOXML fully , and provide support for all those legacy documents , we need to divine the behavior of exactly how Word 6.x “ inappropriately ” placed footnotes .
The “ Standard ” is no help in telling us how to do this .
In fact it recommends that we do n’t even try .
However , Microsoft continues to claim that the benefit of OOXML and the reason why it deserves ISO approval is that it is the only format that is 100 % backwards compatible with the billions of legacy documents .
But how can this be true if the specification merely enumerates compatibility attributes like this without defining them ?
Does the specification really specify what it claims to specify ?
The fact that this and other legacy features are dismissed in the specification as “ deprecated ” is no defense .
If a document contains this element , what is a consuming application to do ?
If you ignore it , the document will not be formatted correctly .
It is that simple .
Deprecated does n’t mean “ not important ” or “ ignorable ” .
It just means that new documents authored in Office 2007 will not have it .
But billions of legacy documents , when converted to OOXML format , may very well have them .
How well will a competing word processor do in the market if it cannot handle these legacy tags ?
So I ’d argue that these legacy tags are some of the most important ones in the specification .
But they remain undefined , and by this ruse Microsoft has arranged things so that their lock on legacy documents extends to even when those legacy documents are converted to OOXML .
We are ruled by the dead hand of the past .
Let ’s go back even further in time to Word 5.0 :
2.15.3.32 mwSmallCaps ( Emulate Word 5.x for the Macintosh Small Caps Formatting )
This element specifies that applications shall emulate the behavior of a previously existing word processing application ( Microsoft Word 5.x for the Macintosh ) when determining the resulting formatting when the smallCaps element ( §2.3.2.31 ) is applied to runs of text within this Wordprocessing ML document .
This emulation typically results in small caps which are smaller than typical small caps at most font sizes .
[ Guidance :
To faithfully replicate this behavior , applications must imitate the behavior of that application , which involves many possible behaviors and cannot be faithfully placed into narrative for this Office Open XML Standard .
If applications wish to match this behavior , they must utilize and duplicate the output of those applications .
It is recommended that applications not intentionally replicate this behavior as it was deprecated due to issues with its output , and is maintained only for compatibility with existing documents from that application .
end guidance ]
You ’ll need to take my word for it that “ This emulation typically results in small caps which are smaller than typical small caps at most font sizes ” falls well short of the level of specificity and determinism that is typical of ISO specifications .
Further :
2.15.3.51 suppressTopSpacingWP
( Emulate WordPerfect 5.x Line Spacing )
This element specifies that applications shall emulate the behavior of a previously existing word processing application ( WordPerfect 5.x ) when determining the resulting spacing between lines in a paragraph using the spacing element ( §2.3.1.33 ) .
This emulation typically results in line spacing which is reduced from its normal size .
[ Guidance :
To faithfully replicate this behavior , applications must imitate the behavior of that application , which involves many possible behaviors and cannot be faithfully placed into narrative for this Office Open XML Standard .
If applications wish to match this behavior , they must utilize and duplicate the output of those applications .
It is recommended that applications not intentionally replicate this behavior as it was deprecated due to issues with its output , and is maintained only for compatibility with existing documents from that application .
end guidance ]
So not only must an interoperable OOXML implementation first acquire and reverse - engineer a 14 - year old version of Microsoft Word , it must also do the same thing with a 16 - year old version of WordPerfect .
Good luck .
My tolerance for cutting and pasting examples goes only so far , so suffice it for me to merely list some other examples of this pattern :
lineWrapLikeWord6 ( Emulate Word 6.0 Line Wrapping for East Asian Text )
( Emulate Word 6.0 Line Wrapping for East Asian Text ) mwSmallCaps ( Emulate Word 5.x for Macintosh Small Caps Formatting )
( Emulate Word 5.x for Macintosh Small Caps Formatting ) shapeLayoutLikeWW8 ( Emulate Word 97 Text Wrapping Around Floating Objects )
( Emulate Word 97 Text Wrapping Around Floating Objects ) truncateFontHeightsLikeWP6 ( Emulate WordPerfect 6.x Font Height Calculation )
( Emulate WordPerfect 6.x Font Height Calculation ) useWord2002 TableStyleRules ( Emulate Word 2002 Table Style Rules )
( Emulate Word 2002 Table Style Rules ) useWord97 LineBreakRules ( Emulate Word 97 East Asian Line Breaking )
( Emulate Word 97 East Asian Line Breaking ) wpJustification ( Emulate WordPerfect 6.x Paragraph Justification )
( Emulate WordPerfect 6.x Paragraph Justification ) shapeLayoutLikeWW8 ( Emulate Word 97 Text Wrapping Around Floating Objects )
This is the way to craft a job description so you hire only the person you earmarked in advance .
With requirements like the above , no others need apply .
As I ’ve stated before , if this were just a Microsoft specification that they put up on MSDN for their customers to use , this would be par for the course , and not worth my attention .
But this is different .
Microsoft has started calling this a Standard , and has submitted this format to ISO for approval as an International Standard .
It must be judged by those greater expectations .
Update :
1/14/2007 —
This post was featured on Slashdot on 1/4/07 where you can go for additional comments and debate .
I ’ve summarized the comments and provided some additional analysis here .
2/16/2007 — fixed some typo ’s , tightened up some of the phrases .
UPDATE
When I first began blogging , I believed -- and frequently argued -- that the best strategy for imposing real limits on the excesses of the Bush administration was to attract the support of the group of GOP Senators who did not appear to subscribe to the most extreme elements of the Bush agenda .
I was operating on the assumption that certain excesses would be so intolerable and repugnant to their worldview that they would be virtually compelled , by their own consciences and sense of personal dignity if nothing else , to take a real stand , partisan allegiances notwithstanding .
From Iraq to torture to warrantless eavesdropping and many things in between , it has been conclusively established that those assumptions were fundamentally false .
Articles like this one ( from The Washington Post 's Jeffrey Smith , reporting on how " moderate " GOP Senators deceitfully enabled the torture bill to strip detainees of habeas corpus rights ) and this one ( from AP 's Nedra Pickler , reporting that two GOP Senators have oh - so - boldly announced that we need a " different course " in Iraq without saying what that might be ) illustrate the misleading ritual in which " independent GOP Senators " engage over and over .
They continuously preen around with rhetorical symbols of independence and a willingness to oppose the President , but by their actions , they not only fail to block any of the administration 's worst excesses , but worse , they are usually their key enablers .
The dynamic is most vividly seen in the much - documented humiliations of Arlen Specter , but , with the rarest of exceptions , it 's really how all of them -- John McCain , Chuck Hagel , Olympia Snowe , Susan Collins , Lindsey Graham , John Warner -- regularly conduct themselves .
Nothing has been less significant than the " independent - minded " GOP Senate caucus because it really does not exist in any substantive way .
The above - linked article from the Post reports that during the debate over the torture bill , Arlen Specter had two proposed amendments to provide habeas corpus rights to detainees -- the more " extreme " version , which he introduced ( and which failed by a 48 - 51 vote ) , that allowed full habeas corpus rights to detainees , and a more " mild " version which would have limited detainees to a maximum of one habeas challenge , and which would be triggered only after a full year in detention .
The " mild " habeas version was never introduced by Specter and therefore was never voted on .
The Post article reports that -- unlike the " extreme " Specter amendment -- the more " mild " version had the support of a majority of Senators .
For that reason , Specter " was pressured into discarding [ the ] less extreme and more politically palatable amendment at the Bush administration 's request , in favor of [ the more extreme ] alternative more likely to be defeated . "
The Post article suggests that Specter introduced a habeas amendment which he knew would fail , while refusing to introduce his habeas amendment which would have passed .
Specter , of course , leaps to the defense of Bill Frist and the White House and -- while admitting that Frist " allowed " him to introduce only one habeas amendment -- claims that he chose the more extreme version on his own because he did not believe the more " mild " version went far enough in granting rights of habeas corpus .
The Post has sources which claim that Hagel , Snowe and Collins would all have voted in favor of Specter 's more mild habeas corpus amendment had it been introduced , and that would have enabled the amendment to pass .
The Post article expressly claims that " a Republican aide directly familiar with Hagel 's position confirmed that the senator supported the less extreme alternative . "
But Specter told the Post that he called Hagel after speaking with Smith about the article and Hagel denied ( to Specter ) that he would have supported the " mild " amendment .
Meanwhile , Hagel 's spokesman just refuses to say how Hagel would have voted , and Snowe and Collins also both refuse to say what their position is on this most critical issue .
Whether we vest in the President the power to detain people forever without any right to challenge their detention is one of the most profound political questions of this decade , at least .
It defines who we are as a country and has unparalleled significance in terms of how we are perceived around the world .
Whether we will put people in a black hole forever and deny them any ability to prove their innocence -- as our Congress just empowered the President to do -- implicates the most fundamental principles of what kind of country and government we have .
Yet these " moderate , independent " Republican Senators of conscience can't even bring themselves to say what their position is on these issues .
Do they support habeas corpus rights at all ?
Would they have voted in favor of Specter 's more " mild " amendment ?
Are they angry about Bill Frist 's maneuvers to block Specter 's amendment from coming to the Senate floor , even in light of the standard GOP mantra about the need for " up - or - down " votes ?
Would they support efforts now to amend the torture bill to at least provide detainees with the one - time habeas right , to kick in after one year of detention , so that there is at least some chance for detainees who are wrongfully detained to avoid being imprisoned forever ?
They wo n't say .
They prefer to be coy and silent on one of the most vital issues of our time because to do otherwise would force them to stand in opposition to the administration on a critical question .
And that is something they simply will never do , even if it means enabling one of the most extremist pieces of legislation in the last century to be enacted .
Every time , when the choice is forced , they opt for partisan allegiance and blind support for the administration over everything else .
They are different from the Jon Cornyns and Pat Roberts and Jeff Sessions and Bill Frists of the Senate only cosmetically and , worse , they are far more important in enabling the Bush movement to implement its most radical measures by creating the deceitful appearance that these policies are supported by " moderates .
"
The AP article linked above reports that two of the serious , courageous independent GOP Senators -- Hagel and John Warner -- announced over the weekend their bold discovery that our current " course " in Iraq is n't working .
But , as always , they did this in the most meaningless , self - serving way possible .
Hagel , on CNN , " said it is time to change course , but ' our options are limited . ' "
Warner stated the obvious -- that " there has been an ' exponential increase in the killings and the savagery that 's going on over there ' " -- but then said this : " We have to rethink all the options , except any option which says we precipitously pull out , which would let that country fall into a certain civil war at that time , and all of the neighboring countries would be destabilized .
" So , do Hagel and Warner agree with Democrats like Jack Murtha who want a phased withdrawal ?
Do they object to characterizations by the Republicans of anti-war Democrats as " cut and run " surrender - happy cowards ?
What specifically is the administration doing wrong ?
What do they think ought to be done differently ?
They wo n't say , because their overriding objective is to lavish themselves with the virtues of independence while avoiding doing anything to criticize the President or to oppose administration policy in any meaningful way .
Just like they know that denying habeas corpus is hideously wrong , these pseudo - independent GOP Senators know the Iraq Was is failing , so they want it to appear as part of some sort of Platonic " historical record " that they were one of the bold , independent GOP Senators to stand up and say so -- three - and - a - half years later in the case of Iraq , and only in the most deliberately inconsequential way in the case of torture and habeas corpus .
But their objections , as always , are meaningless because their paramount consideration -- partisan allegiance -- prevents them from saying or doing anything meaningful .
As always , all of this play - acting is designed to fulfill the only real objective these " moderate , independent - minded " GOP Senators have -- to self - servingly cast the appearance of independence and to distance themselves from the administration 's grossest failures and excesses while , simultaneously , remaining blindly loyal and doing everything possible to enable those same failures and abuses .
Over the last five years , particularly when it comes to policies ostensibly justified by The Terrorists , the Senate has fully acquiesced to the dictates of the White House .
They have neither stopped nor meaningfully limited anything .
And at the epicenter of this disgraceful record of Congressional abdication has been this group of " moderate , independent GOP Senators . "
Nobody has done more to enable the worst aspects of the extremist Bush agenda than they have . :
Just to get a sense for how thoroughly in lockstep Republican Senators march , as contrasted with the frequently divided Democratic Senate caucus , observe the following votes on some of the most significant matters the Senate has decided over the last several years : Vote to confirm John Roberts to the Supreme Court : Republicans ( 56-0 ) -- Democrats ( 22 - 22 ) Cloture vote on Sam Alito 's nomination to the Supreme Court : Republicans ( 54-0 ) -- Democrats ( 19 - 25 ) Vote on Authorization to use military force in Iraq : Republicans ( 48 -1 ) -- Democrats - ( 29 - 21 ) Cloture vote on Bankrupty Bill : Republicans ( 55-0 ) -- Democrats ( 14-30 ) Cloture vote on nomination of Priscilla Owens to appeals court : Republicans ( 55-0 ) -- Democrats ( 25 - 18 ) : Republicans ( 53 -1 ) -- Democrats ( 12 - 33 ) Genuine Republican independence in the Congress is a myth .
It does n't exist .
They have spent the last five years as a pitifully obsequious appendange to the Bush agenda .
[ Edited and annotated December 7 , 2012 .
This is a nice work of fiction , and an interesting view of cutting edge doomer thinking in 2005 .
I can see now that my timeline was still much too fast , my vision of the changes was too catastrophic , and I was too optimistic about popular adaptations . ]
Imagine the end of the world in moderation .
It 's hard .
We tend to imagine that either the " economy " will recover and we 'll go on like 1999 forever , plus flying cars , or else one day " the apocalypse happens " and every component of the industrial system is utterly gone .
I 'm not ruling out a global supercatastrophe , like an asteroid impact , an accidental nuclear war , or runaway climate change leading to an anoxic event .
But what I 'm focusing on here is the scenario that includes only events we 're reasonably sure about : the end of cheap energy , the decline of industrial agriculture , economic collapse , wars , famines , infrastructure failures , and extreme weather .
If that 's all we get , the crash will be slower and more complex than the kind of people who predict crashes like to predict .
It wo n't be like falling off a cliff , more like rolling down a rocky hill .
There wo n't be any clear before , during , or after .
Most people living during the decline and fall of Rome did n't even know it .
We 're told to draw a line at the sack of Rome by the Visigoths , but to Romans at the time it was just one event -- the Visigoths came , they milled around , they left , and life went on .
After the 1929 stock market crash , respectable voices said it was a temporary adjustment , that the economy was still strong .
Only years later , when we knew they were wrong , could we draw a line at 1929 .
I suggest we 're already in the fall of civilization .
In 2004 the price of oil doubled , bankruptcies and foreclosures accelerated , global food stockpiles fell to record lows despite high harvests , and we had record numbers of hurricanes and tornadoes -- and a big tsunami to top it off .
If every year from here to 2020 is half as eventful , we 'll be living in railroad cars , eating grass , and still waiting for the big crash we 've been led to expect from watching movies designed to push our emotional buttons and be over in two hours .
You know the story : Electricity and water and heat are off and not coming back on .
Food and fuel will never again be coming into the cities .
People run wild in the streets killing and looting .
If you live in the city , you will have to kill people to steal their food , or even eat them , and they 'll be trying to do the same to you .
If you live in the country , you 'd better have a big gun to fend off the hordes of starving urbanites scouring the countryside .
This condition will last until a strong leader rebuilds civilization .
This is a web of lies .
The first lie is the assumption that breakdowns will be sudden and permanent .
More likely it will go like this :
As energy gets more expensive and the electrical infrastructure decays , blackouts will be more frequent and last longer , but power will come back on .
By the time the big grids go down permanently , the little grids , patched together from local sources , will be ready to take their place .
They will be weaker , less reliable , and more expensive , and they wo n't cover the slums , but by then we 'll all be experts at living without refrigerators and running laptop computers from car batteries scavenged from junked SUV's and recharged with solar panels .
Electricity is a luxury , not a necessity .
When the lights go out , we wo n't go berzerk -- we 'll go to bed earlier .
[ Why did I think the grid would eventually go down everywhere ?
Because that 's easier to imagine than the grid in the most energy - rich areas mostly staying up , and then re-extending after the tech system adjusts to renewable energy .
Then it 's just a question of how much of the grid stays mostly up .
One percent ?
Ninety percent ? ]
Likewise with gasoline .
The oil 's not running out -- it 's just getting more scarce and expensive .
People who want it will not form motorcycle gangs that chase tankers and fight to the last man .
They 'll do what my dad did in 1973 -- wait six hours for a fill - up .
If you already know how to get by with a bicycle , you just wo n't have as many cars to deal with .
Water supplies are mostly gravity - fed .
If something stops the flow , someone will be fixing it .
Even the worst places , like Phoenix or Las Vegas , will not suddenly and permanently run out of water .
As with electricity and fuel , water will get lower quality , more expensive , and unpredictably available .
People will learn to store it and to stop wasting it by watering lawns and washing cars and shitting in drinking water .
Adaptable people will learn to catch rainwater .
With only 12 inches a year , a 10x10 foot square metal roof feeding a storage tank will gather 100 cubic feet , or about 800 gallons , enough for one person to have more than two gallons a day .
Food is more difficult .
It does n't fall from the sky , and industrial agriculture can't possibly continue to feed everyone .
It would be easy to feed even our present bloated population if we converted every lawn and golf course to a food forest , but that 's not going to happen .
Populations have died in famines before and will do so again .
The lie here is that the food supply will end suddenly and permanently , when really , like everything else , it will end in a series of small collapses and partial recoveries .
[ I was underestimating industrial agriculture , which is becoming more efficient as it becomes more automated .
It takes less energy to maintain and power machines , than to maintain human workers at a decent standard of living , so energy decline will not destroy automation .
Solar panels feeding motors can already turn sunlight into work more efficiently than photosynthetic crops feeding animal muscles .
There will be a few decades when the world has scarcer and more expensive energy than during the age of cheap oil , but this will not make energy - dependent systems disappear .
They will just pull back and abandon the poorest populations .
Also , when there 's a famine , most deaths are not from starvation .
They 're from disease or violence as people short of food become weaker and take more risks .
I argue below that people rarely do premeditated murders to steal food , but lack of food makes them fight with each other for all kinds of other reasons . ]
The other lie is that people will kill each other to steal food .
I have n't heard of anyone doing it in areas hit by the tsunami .
In the 1984 Ethiopian famine , in the siege of Sarajevo , even in the Irish potato famine , when Ireland was producing enough meat and grain to feed everyone and exporting it to wealthy Englishmen , when people would have been morally justified in killing for food , they did not kill for food .
The Donner party ate their own dead but did not kill for food .
Napoleon 's soldiers retreating from Moscow would cut the organs from fallen men and horses , sometimes before they were quite dead , but did not kill each other to steal food .
Nations have gone mad and killed millions for empty abstractions of race and religion and politics , but even in Rwanda or Nazi Germany or post - revolution France , it was uncommon that anyone would kill for food .
I can't explain it , why people will kill for ideas and then , when their life is at stake , will quietly starve .
Maybe hunger comes on so slowly that by the time they 're ready to kill , they 're too weak .
Maybe , in a real famine , the elite keep the food so well guarded that there 's no point trying to take it , and the non-elite , not corrupted by power , would rather share what little they have than fight to the death .
Imagine yourself in that position .
Whatever stopped the food coming into the city , it 's probably regional and temporary , and you 'll be expecting it go to back to normal soon , or at least expecting help .
Exposure kills people much faster than starvation , so you 'll want to stay in the place you know and try to get a piece of the aid shipments .
If you leave the city you 'll be headed for a particular place like a cabin or a friend 's house , not roaming the countryside looking for a cornfield .
I 've gone by bicycle from central Seattle over Stevens Pass to near Wenatchee , and over Snoqualmie all the way to Spokane .
I rode freeways , highways , dirt roads , and gravel trails , and I think I saw two fields of edible crops , neither in season .
What about stealing from other people in the city ?
Again , put yourself in that position .
Do you know which houses have food ?
Which have guns ?
Would you really go to a random house and knock the door down ?
If you 're even thinking about it , you 'll be expecting other people to do the same , and you 'll make a defensive alliance with your neighbors .
If you 're allied and you need each other for survival , you 're going to share food .
Those with the most food , if they 're smart , will give some away to earn respect and loyalty .
The situation will be all about social dynamics among neighbors , not physical conflicts against roving gangs .
The popular image of " anarchy " is another lie , an elitist caricature of lower class people as stupid and randomly dangerous , mindless and incomprehensible like a tornado .
In reality , in the Rodney King riots , people were intelligent enough to not harm the Korean grocery stores where the owners had been nice to them .
I was in the Seattle WTO protest , and the destructive actions were not mindless and crazy , but calm , deliberate , and focused .
Notice the propaganda use of the word " streets " : " mean streets " , " I grew up in the streets " , " rioting in the streets " .
Where else are we going to riot ?
The lawn ?
We 're led to believe that the most dangerous thing in the streets is people on foot with free will .
The most dangerous thing in the streets is the automobile .
How many people have been invisibly killed in car crashes in the same intersection where the big media spent days showing Reginald Denny being beaten by black people ?
The function of propaganda is not to tell us what to think but to sink us deeper in what we already thoughtlessly believe : in this case , that in the absence of central control we get a dog - eat - dog universe full of shocking crimes .
That 's what we have now .
The every - man - for - himself morality is a symptom of a culture that uses excess wealth and zero-sum competition to maintain hierarchy .
In the absence of wealth and control , people get nicer .
We learn to take responsibility , to work together , to help each other ... until a new dominator appears and crushes us down .
[ A recent book on this subject is A Paradise Built in Hell by Rebecca Solnit .
She focuses on short - term disasters , and people might have more trouble holding together cooperative networks when there is no recovery in sight .
I think it depends on their emotional intelligence and empathy , and in most of the world today , I would expect a long - term disaster to eventually turn into rule by warlords . ]
All the worst mass - killings of history have been top - down .
Genocide happens not when central control stops but when it stops holding back .
If the killers are not direct agents of government or industry , they are ordinary people who know they have both the protection and the ideological guidance of the biggest bad - ass of the moment .
Usually the ideology is utopian : Hitler , Stalin , Mao , Pol Pot , French revolutionaries , and American " settlers , " all justified their mass murders with a grandiose vision of a noble conflict to wipe the world clean and build heaven .
The danger is not " terrorism " or " chaos " -- the danger is a new order that declares you the danger .
Still , the interesting question is not " How will people die ? " but " How will people live ? "
In the town next to the mass grave , what will we do all day ?
Process data and feign enthusiasm ?
Get on the internet ?
Make crossbows ?
Tend fruit trees ?
The best I can figure it out is to look at a bunch of more and less likely modifiers to the world as we know it , and think through how they could change things .
Peak Oil .
Global oil extraction will peak in the next year or two , if it has n't already .
By 2008 it will be clearly in decline , though some will argue that it 's only a temporary adjustment .
Oil sellers will exploit the hype by raising prices even more than they have to .
We will not figure out some new cheap energy source , but we will figure out that hydrogen is just a storage method , and not a very good one .
[ Did oil peak ?
We can't answer this without getting into the difficulty of defining " oil " .
Now there 's a surge of cheap natural gas .
The more important thing is that the cost of energy will continue to rise more often than it falls . ]
But life will change less than the peak oilers are predicting , because we have so much room to cut out waste : to drive less often in more efficient cars , ride bicycles , turn off the heat and air conditioning , take the machines and industrial chemicals out of agriculture , stop flying food around the world .
Gradually , more people will grow their own food , raise their own kids , tend their own health , do stuff with their own bodies instead of machines , and turn their attention from the stock market and TV characters to their more real lives .
Those who can adjust mentally will recognize this as an improvement .
[ In the paragraphs above and below , just because these adaptations are available and helpful , does n't mean average people will change .
Jared Diamond has written that the Vikings in Greenland starved to death rather than change their culture to eat fish .
I think something like this will happen with American lawns and cars , except the government will prevent starvation by subsidizing industrial agriculture , and most people will just become more poor and sick and unhappy .
So these utopian visions are bad predictions , but still good advice . ]
When energy gets so expensive that people can't afford to drive their cars at all , or to buy the new super - efficient cars , they will abandon the suburbs to enterprising bicyclists or drug gangs or squatter communities or farmers .
The abomination of the lawn will turn out to have preserved a lot of precious topsoil ... which will now be depleted by moderately unsustainable agriculture .
I do n't see any likely way for us to resume the stone age lifestyle for which our bodies are made .
It 's not that we can't , but that most people will choose not to as long as they have other options .
Economic De-repression .
There are many economies , and the one that 's failing is the control economy .
The dominant media will not even call it a depression , but some kind of temporary crisis , when really it 's the permanent end of the centralized techno - industrial order .
What they 'll call temporary " unemployment " will be a permanent transition to self - employment in the meaningful activities of subsistence .
[ Again , you and I can do this , but I fear most people will just become poorer and unhappier in their dependence on a techno - industrial order that continues to chug along .
Technologies like 3D printers will threaten to make the tech system less centrally controlled , but I think it will respond by blocking autonomous manufacturing through expanded intellectual property . ]
The dollar will continue to slide , until non-wealthy Americans will no longer be able to buy anything imported .
Americans will have to learn how to make stuff again , and we could get a renaissance in light manufacturing .
We 'll start local currencies , like Ithaca Hours , or if the rulers jealously forbid it , we 'll build underground barter and gift economies .
All this will be good for us .
Meanwhile , economies that depend on selling stuff to Americans will also decline .
Interest rates will rise and pop the housing bubble , and so many people will default on their mortgages that it will be impossible to evict them all , or to keep squatters out of all the vacant bank - owned houses .
The elite will try to repress squatters enough to preserve their property / power , but not so much that it fuels a movement for land reform .
Something similar will happen with credit card debt , but milder , because the elite are always more willing to forgive debt than to give up their claim on land .
[ It is turning out to be surprisingly easy to keep homeless people out of abandoned houses , and to continue making claims on unpayable debt .
The ruling system seems to be getting better than ever at keeping us under control without killing us .

If we get overt mass - killings in America , this is my pick for how it will happen .
The rulers will pick off cities one by one , feeding the bloodlust of the public in a ritual as old as civilization : demonize them , seal them in , and kill them all .
If a volcanic eruption cuts off food to your city , hold tight -- you 'll be fine .
If the bodies of soldiers or police are dragged through the streets of your city , get out and never expect to return .
Disease .
An epidemic that kills 10 % will slow down or stop many systems , especially the medical system , but in a few months or years it will all go back to almost how it was before .
One that kills 50 % will reorder society in ways we can't predict -- when people think they 're about to die , they do unpredictable things .
[ Now I think that instant global communication greatly reduces the threat of disease epidemics , by making them easier to quarantine . ]
Another factor is if the dead and the survivors have different cultural profiles .
Almost any disease will go easier on people with healthier lifestyles -- in fact , this might already be happening , if sugary overprocessed foods are causing mental and emotional instability that makes people do stupid things that tend to get them killed .
Weather .
Overall global temperatures will continue to rise , but in any particular spot , it will look more like crazy weather than warm weather .
Everyone will get faster winds , bigger storms , wetter floods and drier droughts .
And if the climate is being affected , directly or indirectly , by CO2 emissions , then there will be a lag , just like the lag between turning the hot water up in the shower and feeling it , but much longer because the atmosphere is so much bigger .
If the lag is as long as 30 years , then what we 're getting now is the effect of the relatively mild emissions in the 1970's .
What will it be like when the giant car fad comes back to bite us ?
[ Stuart Staniford has argued that some regions , presently highly populated , will become so hot in the summer that anyone without air conditioning will die .
Preventing deaths will require some combination of massive energy use and massive emigration . ]
Astronomy .
Eventually a mass - extinction - sized asteroid will strike the Earth .
The chance that it will do so in the next 100 years is not worth bothering about .
But some other cosmic events may be .
A fringe theory of comets is that they are not " dirty snowballs " but hot and enormously charged with energy , and that a near pass of a comet can influence Earth in ways we do n't understand .
There could be all kinds of cosmic disasters that we do n't know about because their physical traces are not as obvious as a giant crater or a layer of ash .
One event that is accepted by dominant science , somewhat likely , and could actually give us a sci- fi apocalypse that kills the system and leaves people unharmed , is a giant solar flare .
The solar storm of 1859 fried the telegraph system by overwheming the wires with electric charge .
What would that do to our computers ?
Solar flares are associated with sunspots , and sunspots will peak in 2012 .
[ Telegraph lines are more susceptible to solar storms than computers because the wires are so long .
But a big enough solar storm would kill a lot of satellites .
And there are possible weapons , not yet in use , that could make local electromagnetic pulse strikes strong enough to destroy computers . ]
Human Consciousness Shift .
We wo n't necessarily become better , but different .
This one is fun to think about , and easy to argue for or against , because there are so many ways we are already smarter , stupider , or no different than we were before .
Without some kind of shift in consciousness , it 's hard to see how we can avoid falling out of balance and crashing until we go extinct .
And with a shift , it 's wide open .
Hugo Chavez , Venezuela 's president , has promoted loyalists to key positions and said he will shut down a pro-opposition television station on the eve of his third term in office .
Mr Chavez has signalled more radical policies by tightening his grip in the run-up to his inauguration on Wednesday , the start of what he said would be a new phase in his " socialist revolution " .
Since being re-elected to a six - year term last month he has moved to unite the ruling coalition into a single party , reshuffled the cabinet and fired a shot across the bows of media critics .
The former paratrooper told a gathering of army officers last week that the broadcast licence of Radio Caracas Television ( RCTV ) would not be renewed when it expires in March .
He accused the channel of backing a coup against him in 2002 .
The announcement triggered protests from the Paris - based advocacy group Reporters Without Borders , as well as a regional diplomatic body , the Organisation of American States , which said dissent was being stifled .
" The closing of a mass communications outlet is a rare step in the history of our hemisphere and has no precedent in the recent decades of democracy , " said the OAS secretary general , José Miguel Insulza .
Venezuela 's foreign ministry rejected the criticism and said shutting RCTV would guarantee freedom of expression .
Much of the country 's private media have been hostile to Mr Chavez .
Several stations , including RCTV , appeared to endorse the coup which briefly ousted him .
Analysts say Mr Chavez , emboldened by a landslide endorsement last month , has the momentum to become more radical .
His oil - exporting nation is riding an economic boom which funds social programmes for the poor and credits for regional allies .
Two other leftwing leaders , Nicaragua 's Daniel Ortega and Ecuador 's Rafael Correa , are due to be inaugurated this week , bolstering Mr Chavez 's hopes of building a Latin American counterweight to the US .
Last week he fired the vice president , José Vicente Rangel , a powerful and totemic political veteran .
Jorge Rodríguez , a former chief of Venezuela 's electoral council , was appointed vice - president and the president 's brother , Adan Chavez , was named education minister .
Mr Chavez told state television .
" All of these changes are without a doubt to strengthen ... the path to socialism . "
Mr Chavez also announced a plan to merge his movement 's amorphous grouping of more than 20 political parties into a single body , the United Socialist Party of Venezuela .
The proposal has dismayed some of the smaller parties , especially those on the far - left , who fear losing influence as power is centralised .
Leftwing tide is back
Latin America 's leftwing tide is about to surge with the inauguration of three newly elected presidents , Venezuela 's Hugo Chavez , Nicaragua 's Daniel Ortega and Ecuador 's Rafael Correa .
Mr Chavez starts a consecutive third term on Wednesday at the helm of an oil power which has challenged the US and neo-liberal economics with a self - styled " socialist revolution " .
The same day Mr Ortega will lead the Sandinistas back to power after 16 years , which has left the nation peaceful but impoverished .
The former Marxist revolutionary has promised reconciliation and economic stability .
Next week , Mr Correa , a charismatic political outsider , will take office in a volatile , poverty - stricken country .
The so - called pink tide has returned since conservatives last year won elections in Peru , Colombia and Mexico .
Washington has not disguised its dismay , but has been conciliatory towards the three incoming presidents .
Why gas prices dropped
Trust us .
It was n't OPEC or Republicans trying to influence midterm elections .
( Fortune Magazine ) --
If the recent plunge in gas prices is the result of a conspiracy by President George W. Bush to help the Republicans retain control of Congress , as 42 percent of Americans believe , according to one Gallup poll , a lot of Wall Streeters wish they 'd been in on the plot .
So what really drove prices down - if not an Oliver Stone - worthy scenario involving the Commander - in - Chief , the House of Saud and Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson cajoling his cronies at Goldman Sachs to sink the crude market ?
Hedge funds get ahead of themselves
By late summer , hedge funds and other investors had poured billions into long positions in oil , gasoline , natural gas and the rest of what traders call the " energy complex , " all betting on a replay of the severe 2005 hurricane season that sent prices soaring in the wake of Katrina and Rita .
But one day after oil reached a monthly high of $ 76.98 a barrel on Aug.
7 , government meteorologists downgraded their hurricane forecast and cautioned that a repeat of 2005 was " unlikely . "
That announcement , combined with the end of the summer driving season and a recalibration of the Goldman Sachs ( Charts ) commodity index that reduced the weighting of gasoline , prompted speculators to head for the exits even faster than they 'd piled in .
The switch in Goldman 's basket of commodities had been previously announced by the firm , but that did n't stop the conspiracy theorists .
" Hmm , what a coincidence , luring Goldman 's top dog to take a HUGE pay cut by becoming Treasury 's top dog , and then Goldman Sachs makes this unexpected decision , serving to dramatically drive down gas prices , " said the Grey Matter , a liberal blog .
But the grassy - knoll crowd did n't bother to crunch the numbers .
According to Joel Fingerman of Chicago - based OilAnalytics.net , between the peak of $ 77 a barrel in August and the October low of just under $ 58 , traders dumped nearly 40 million barrels ( a 20 percent drop ) from their long positions .
The volatile gasoline market showed an even sharper decline - with traders cutting long positions from 32 million barrels in midsummer to just 1.7 million in October .
" Whatever you want to call it - speculators , fast money , hot money - a big part of the drop in crude that we 've seen this year is because of selling by hedge funds , " says Merrill Lynch technical analyst Mary Ann Bartels .
That avalanche of cash also explains what 's got the paranoid types talking - not merely the timing of the plunge in prices but its rapid speed .
" Speculators create more velocity around existing trends , " says Bartels .
" Things are happening a lot more quickly in these markets than they used to . "
The losers
Some traders were lucky and got out in time ; most were n't .
Implosions like the collapse of the $ 9.2 billion Amaranth fund seem spectacular , but the fund was merely caught in a bigger and badder bet than others hoping for another Katrina .
Amaranth trader Brian Hunter bet the farm that hurricanes and a cold winter would push up natural gas prices , but , says Bartels , " a lot of people were caught by surprise . "
The average energy hedge fund dropped 4 percent last month , according to Joel Schwab , a managing director of Hedgefund .net , which tracks fund performance .
" They were having a great year , then things fell apart in September when they were caught long , " says Schwab .
Even broader index - type funds that invest in a wide range of commodities and are open to individual investors are down .
Manager John Brynjolfsson's Pimco Commodity Real Return fund is now off 5.6 percent for the year , after being up 1.4 percent before the summer rout .
The winners
One trader who 's been luckier is Julian Barrowcliffe , manager of the $ 500 million Anglian Commodities fund .
He has managed to eke out an 8 percent gain for the year by avoiding bets on which way crude would go , instead playing off the spreads between different products , betting on how , say , heating oil would move if gasoline prices went down .
" Anytime you have a big reversal , the guys who follow the trends get killed trying to get out quickly , " says Barrowcliffe .
As for those conspiracy theories , Barrowcliffe insists he was n't tipped off .
" It 's ludicrous , " he says .
" Maybe 42 percent of Americans think Elvis is alive too . "
Ironically , the current price for crude - $ 59 a barrel - is roughly where oil insiders have been predicting it would be if it were n't for all that hot money flowing into commodities .
Last spring , energy consultant and Deloitte advisor Joe Stanislaw told Fortune that fundamental supply and demand factors suggested a price of about $ 50 a barrel , with geopolitical factors adding $ 10 and speculators putting another $ 10 on top of that .
Unfortunately for drivers , Stanislaw does n't expect the premium caused by worries about tensions in key oil - producing countries like Iran , Iraq , Venezuela and Nigeria to fade anywhere near as quickly as all that hot money did .
And there 's no reason that money wo n't move back into energy if sentiment turns and there 's a new trend to play .
Right now , the latest bet by traders is for a normal winter - if there 's a sudden cold snap before Thanksgiving , expect a bump in crude .
So enjoy the low gas prices while they last .
You can be sure the White House will , even if it did n't orchestrate them .

How to Beat the High Cost of Gasoline .
Forever !
Stop dreaming about hydrogen .
Ethanol is the answer to the energy dilemma .
It 's clean and green and runs in today 's cars .
And in a generation , it could replace gas .
( FORTUNE Magazine ) -
You probably do n't know it , but the answer to America 's gasoline addiction could be under the hood of your car .
More than five million Tauruses , Explorers , Stratuses , Suburbans , and other vehicles are already equipped with engines that can run on an energy source that costs less than gasoline , produces almost none of the emissions that cause global warming , and comes from the Midwest , not the Middle East .
These lucky drivers need never pay for gasoline again -- if only they could find this elusive fuel , called ethanol .
Chemically , ethanol is identical to the grain alcohol you may have spiked the punch with in college .
It also went into gasohol , that 1970s concoction that brings back memories of Jimmy Carter in a cardigan and outrageous subsidies from Washington .
But while the chemistry is the same , the economics , technology , and politics of ethanol are profoundly different .
Instead of coming exclusively from corn or sugar cane as it has up to now , thanks to biotech breakthroughs , the fuel can be made out of everything from prairie switchgrass and wood chips to corn husks and other agricultural waste .
This biomass - derived fuel is known as cellulosic ethanol .
Whatever the source , burning ethanol instead of gasoline reduces carbon emissions by more than 80 % while eliminating entirely the release of acid-rain - causing sulfur dioxide .
Even the cautious Department of Energy predicts that ethanol could put a 30 % dent in America 's gasoline consumption by 2030 .
We may not have to wait that long .
After decades of being merely an additive to gasoline , ethanol suddenly looks to be the stuff of a fuel revolution -- and a pipe dream for futurists .
An unlikely alliance of venture capitalists , Wall Streeters , automakers , environmentalists , farmers , and , yes , politicians is doing more than just talk about ethanol 's potential .
They 're putting real money into biorefineries , car engines that switch effortlessly between gasoline and biofuels , and R&D to churn out ethanol more cheaply .
( By the way , the reason motorists do n't know about the five - million - plus ethanol - ready cars and trucks on the road is that until now Detroit never felt the need to tell them .
Automakers quietly added the flex - fuel feature to get a break from fuel - economy standards . )
What 's more , powerful political lobbies in Washington that never used to concern themselves with botanical affairs are suddenly focusing on ethanol .
" Energy dependence is America 's economic , environmental , and security Achilles ' heel , " says Nathanael Greene of the Natural Resources Defense Council , a mainstream environmental group .
National - security hawks agree .
Says former CIA chief James Woolsey : " We 've got a coalition of tree huggers , do - gooders , sodbusters , hawks , and evangelicals . "
( Yes , he did say " evangelicals " -- some have found common ground with greens in the notion of environmental stewardship . )
The next five years could see ethanol go from a mere sliver of the fuel pie to a major energy solution in a world where the cost of relying on a finite supply of oil is way too high .
As that happens , says Vinod Khosla , a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who has become one of the nation 's most influential ethanol advocates , " I 'm absolutely convinced that without putting any more land under agriculture and without changing our food production , we can introduce enough ethanol in the U.S. to replace the majority of our petroleum use in cars and light trucks . "
Filling up on ethanol is n't new .
Henry Ford 's Model
Ts ran on it .
What 's changing is the cost of distilling ethanol and the advantages it brings over rival fuels .
Energy visionaries like to dream about hydrogen as the ultimate replacement for fossil fuels , but switching to it would mean a trillion - dollar upheaval - - for new production and distribution systems , new fuel stations , and new cars .
Not so with ethanol - - today 's gas stations can handle the most common mixture of 85 % ethanol and 15 % gasoline , called E85 , with minimal retrofitting .
It takes about 30 % more ethanol than gasoline to drive a mile , and the stuff is more corrosive , but building a car that 's E85 - ready adds only about $ 200 to the cost .
Ethanol has already transformed one major economy :
In Brazil nearly three - quarters of new cars can burn either ethanol or gasoline , whichever happens to be cheaper at the pump , and the nation has weaned itself off imported oil .
And have you heard about GM 's yellow gas caps ?
In the next few weeks the auto giant is set to unveil an unlikely marketing campaign drawing attention to E85 and its E85 - ready cars and trucks like the Chevy Avalanche .
They will sport special yellow gas caps , and if you already own such a vehicle , GM will send you a gas cap free .
California governor and Hummer owner Arnold Schwarzenegger is backing a ballot initiative that would encourage service stations to offer ethanol at the pump .
Even big oil companies like Royal Dutch Shell and Exxon Mobil are funding ethanol research .
Says Beth Lowry , GM 's vice president for energy and environment : " People 's perception used to be ' The agricultural lobby is very interested in it . '
Now people are waking up and saying , ' This is n't just about the Midwest .
This is about the U.S. as a whole . ' " Adds Daniel Yergin , one of the country 's top energy experts : " I do n't think I 've seen so many kinds of renewable energy fermenting and bubbling as right now .
The very definition of oil is broadening . "
Not that ethanol will replace gasoline overnight .
There are 170,000 service stations in the U.S. ; only 587 ( count 'em ! ) sell E85 .
To refine enough ethanol to replace the gas we burn ( 140 billion gallons a year ) would require thousands of biorefineries and hundreds of billions of dollars .
Yet one of capitalism 's favorite visionaries is convinced that very soon filling up on weeds and cornhusks will be no more remarkable than tanking up on regular .
Says Richard Branson , whose Virgin Group is starting an ethanol - inspired subsidiary called Virgin Fuels : " This is the win - win fuel of the future . "
BARRELS FROM BUSHELS
In Decatur , Ill. , nobody is waiting around for the future ; demand for ethanol from corn is booming right now .
This grain - elevator - dotted town is home to agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland , which makes it the capital of the old - school heavily subsidized U.S. ethanol industry .
On a blustery January day , the air is thick with fog , sleet , and condensation from the corn mills on the 600 - acre complex next to ADM 's corporate office .
Outside the ethanol plant , the air smells like grape juice gone bad .
Inside , with its giant vats and fermentation towers , the biorefinery resembles a winery , but it 's much noisier .
ADM used to call itself " Supermarket to the World . "
Today , reflecting its emergence as an alternative - energy supplier , it boasts of being " Resourceful by Nature . "
The company created the corn-ethanol industry when Jimmy Carter asked it to in 1978 -- the oil - shocked President wanted a homegrown alternative to gasoline .
ADM now pumps out more than a billion gallons of ethanol per year .
While the fuel accounts for just 5 % of the company 's $ 36 billion in annual sales , analysts estimate that it generates 23 % of ADM 's operating profit .
Says Allen Andreas , the courtly 62 - year - old CEO : " We 've always been feeding people and looking for better alternatives ; now we 're doing the same thing in energy . "
ADM aims to be a big player in what Andreas calls the shift " from hydrocarbons to carbohydrates . "
But for now it 's ignoring E85 and cellulosic ethanol in favor of keeping pace with demand that is already booming .
Corn ethanol 's main use is as an additive that helps gasoline burn more efficiently .
ADM sells nearly its entire output to oil companies , which use ethanol as a substitute for MTBE , a petroleum - based additive that is toxic and is now banned in California and 24 other states .
With two billion gallons of MTBE still in use annually and 25 states that have yet to ban it , the ethanol industry could grow 50 % simply by replacing MTBE .
In September , ADM announced a nearly 50 % expansion project , or 500 million new gallons of annual production capacity .
Archrival Cargill is belatedly ramping up ethanol production , and new entrants are using private capital to build ethanol plants .
The only publicly traded pure - play ethanol maker , Pacific Ethanol of Fresno , plans to build five plants in California and has raised a total of $ 111 million , including $ 84 million from Bill Gates .
( For a guide to playing the ethanol boom , see Investing . )
All told , the planned projects represent a nearly $ 2.6 billion investment and will increase U.S. ethanol capacity by 40 % .
Other major players are making long - term ethanol bets .
Ford is working with VeraSun , a startup in South Dakota , to promote E85 fueling stations .
Shell is the primary backer of Canada 's Iogen , which is attempting the first large - scale production of cellulosic ethanol -- the kind made from cornstalks and grasses -- at a pilot plant in Ottawa ( see following story , " Biorefinery Breakthrough " ) .
Exxon Mobil has pledged $ 100 million to Stanford University for research into alternative fuels .
The oil giant 's new CEO , Rex Tillerson , visited the campus last year to hear what researchers are cooking up .
Biology professor Chris Sommerville says the change in the industry is palpable : " I went to six scientific conferences on biofuels last year ; the previous 29 years I did n't go to any . "
The biggest alternative - fuels player of all , of course , is Uncle Sam .
Oil refiners receive a 51 - cent tax credit for every gallon of ethanol they blend into their gasoline .
That alone will cost taxpayers more than $ 7 billion over five years , estimates the Congressional Budget Office .
The U.S. has also funded research into biodiesel , which uses deep - fryer grease and other nontoxic ingredients to replace regular diesel fuel .
( See box at left . )
But ethanol will never really take off unless consumers demand it , and while the U.S. industry still relies on taxpayer largesse , Brazil has leaped to the next step : a profitable free - market system in which the government has gotten out of the way .
HOW BRAZIL BEATS THE U.S .
Near the prosperous farm town of Sertãozinho , some 200 miles north of São Paulo , the fuel that will fill the tanks of nearly three million Brazilian cars in a few months is still waist - high .
Lush sugar - cane fields stretch as far as the eye can see , interrupted only by the towering white mills where the stalks of the plants will be turned into ethanol when the harvest begins in March .
Brazil boasts the biggest economy south of Mexico , and with annual GDP growth of 2.6 % , it is a powerhouse you might expect to consume growing amounts of oil , coal , and nuclear energy .
But Brazil also happens to have the perfect geography for growing sugar cane , the most energy - rich ethanol feedstock known to science .
And so , for Brazil 's 16.5 million drivers , there is ready access to what 's known in Portuguese as álcool at nearly all of the country 's 34,000 gas stations .
" Everyone talks about alternative fuels , but we 're doing it , " says Barry Engle , president of Ford Brazil .
Ethanol accounts for more than 40 % of the fuel Brazilians use in their cars .
While oil frequently has to be shipped halfway around the world before it 's refined into gasoline , here the sugar cane grows right up to the gates of Sertãozinho 's Santa Elisa mill , where it will be made into ethanol .
There 's very little waste -- leftovers are burned to produce electricity for Santa Elisa and the local electrical grid .
" The maximum distance from farm to mill is about 25 miles , " says Fernando Ribeiro , secretary general of Unica , the trade association that represents Brazilian sugar - cane growers .
" It 's very , very efficient in terms of energy use . "
Although Brazilians have driven some cars that run exclusively on ethanol since 1979 , the introduction three years ago of new engines that let drivers switch between ethanol and gasoline has transformed what was once an economic niche into the planet 's leading example of renewable fuels .
Ford exhibited the first prototype of what came to be known as a flex - fuel engine in 2002 ; soon VW marketed a flex - fuel car .
Ford 's
Engle says flex - fuel technology helps avoid problems that had plagued ethanol cars , such as balky starts on cold mornings , weak pickup , and corrosion .
Consumers loved flex - fuel because it meant not having to choose between ethanol and gas models -- memories were still fresh of the 1990 sugar - cane shortage , when ethanol - car owners found themselves , well , out of gas .
Today " nobody would buy an alcohol - only car , even with tax incentives , " says sales manager Rogerio Beraldo of Green Automoveis , a sprawling dealership in São Paulo .
" Brazilians are traumatized by our earlier experience , when supplies ran out .
But with flex - fuel , there 's no risk of that . "
With Brazilian ethanol selling for 45 % less per liter than gasoline in 2003 and 2004 , flex - fuel cars caught on like iPods .
In 2003 , flex - fuel had 6 % of the market for Brazilian - made cars , and automakers were expecting the technology 's share to zoom to 30 % in 2005 .
That proved wildly conservative :
As of last December , 73 % of cars sold in Brazil came with flex - fuel engines .
There are now 1.3 million flex - fuel cars on the road .
" I have never seen an automotive technology with that fast an adoption rate , " says Engle .
Ethanol 's rise has had far - reaching effects on the economy .
Not only does Brazil no longer have to import oil but an estimated $ 69 billion that would have gone to the Middle East or elsewhere has stayed in the country and is revitalizing once - depressed rural areas .
More than 250 mills have sprouted in southeastern Brazil , and another 50 are under construction , at a cost of about $ 100 million each .
Driving to lunch at his local churrasco barbecue spot in Sertãozinho , the head of the local sugar - cane growers ' association points to one new business after another , from farm - equipment sellers to builders of boilers and other gear for the nearby mills .
" My family has been in this business for 30 years , and this is the best it 's been , " says Manoel Carlos Ortolan .
" There 's even nouveaux riches . "
The key to Brazil 's success is that consumers are choosing ethanol rather than being forced to buy it .
Brazil 's military dictators tried the latter approach in the 1970s and early 1980s , by offering tax breaks to build mills , ordering state - owned oil company Petrobras to sell ethanol at gas stations , and regulating prices at the pump .
This bullying -- and cheap oil in the 1990s - - nearly killed the market for ethanol until flex - fuel came along .
The regime was n't good for much , says consultant Plinio Nastari , but it did create the distribution system that enables drivers to fill up on ethanol just about anywhere .
Even though the U.S. will never be a sugar - cane powerhouse like Brazil , investors now view Rio as the future of fuel .
" I hate to see the U.S. ten years behind Brazil , but that 's probably about where we are , " says one shrewd American freethinker , Ted Turner .
ETHANOL FINDS A GODFATHER
There are venture capitalists , and then there 's Vinod Khosla .
A co-founder of Sun Microsystems and a partner at Kleiner Perkins , he was an early backer of Juniper Networks , whose technology helped end decades of dominance by traditional telecom manufacturers .
A lean , 50 - year - old native of India , Khosla says , without a hint of modesty , " I love the challenge of breaking monopolies . "
Frustrated that Kleiner Perkins was n't taking enough risks after the dot - com crash , Khosla opted out of Kleiner 's most recent fund and started his own group , Khosla Ventures .
He 'd been dabbling in environmentalism but never expected to become an investor .
Brazil 's success , however , made him wonder about ethanol 's U.S. potential .
" I spent two years trying to convince myself that this was never going to be more than another minor alternative fuel , " he says .
" What I discovered was that ethanol might completely replace petroleum in this country .
And a lot of countries .
This was a great shock to me . "
Pretty soon Khosla was surprising plenty of others .
He put together a PowerPoint presentation , " Biofuels : Think Outside the Barrel , " which he fires up on a moment 's notice .
He has made the pitch on ethanol to the President 's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology and elsewhere in the White House .
He is also behind California 's upcoming ballot initiative to fund a subsidy for gasoline retailers that add E85 fuel pumps .
" Getting distribution going is the real problem , " says Khosla .
" We need to increase blending and then introduce E85 pumps , and the possible will become the probable . "
His conversion to energy investing is part of a Silicon Valley trend , as VCs seek the rapid growth and giant markets that computers once offered .
VantagePoint Venture Partners in San Bruno , for instance , established a fund called New Energy Capital that invests in ethanol , wind power , and other energy projects .
Nth Power , a San Francisco energy - investment firm , estimates that $ 700 million of the $ 21 billion flowing into venture funds last year were earmarked for " clean technology " startups .
CELLULOSE NIRVANA
No one , not even a professionally optimistic VC , thinks we 're anywhere near getting rid of gasoline .
The oil superstructure is simply too efficient and too entrenched to just go away .
Nor could corn ethanol generate enough fuel to run America 's cars , pickups , and SUVs .
Already ethanol gobbles up 14 % of the country 's corn production .
Converting a bigger share into fuel would pinch the world 's food supply - - a favorite objection of skeptics .
Critics also contend that producing fuel from crops consumes more energy than it yields .
On this topic of endless Internet bickering , the Energy Department recently reported , " In terms of key energy and environmental benefits , cornstarch ethanol comes out clearly ahead of petroleum - based fuels , and tomorrow 's cellulosic - based ethanol would do even better . "
Because cellulosic ethanol comes from cornstalks , grasses , tree bark - - fibrous stuff that humans can't digest -- it does n't threaten the food supply at all .
Cellulose is the carbohydrate that makes up the walls of plant cells .
Researchers have figured out how to unlock the energy in such biomass by devising enzymes that convert cellulose into simpler sugars .
Cellulose is abundant ; ethanol from it is clean and can power an engine as effectively as gasoline .
Plus , you do n't have to reinvent cars .
Ratcheting up production of cellulosic ethanol , however , is a gnarly engineering problem .
The onus now is on companies like Genencor , a Palo Alto biotech .
Its biological enzymes are used to break down stains in Tide detergent and achieve just the right distressed look in blue jeans .
But making underpants whiter and denim bluer is nothing compared with breaking America 's longstanding addiction to gasoline .
The best way to do this would be to bring down the cost of ethanol to the point where consumers clamor for it .
Before flex - fuel engines came along , Brazilians would mix their own rabo de galo ( cocktail ) of ethanol and gasoline when filling up , simply because it was cheaper than straight gas .
Genencor says its enzymes have cut the cost of making a gallon of cellulosic ethanol from $ 5 five years ago to 20 cents today .
Now refiners have to learn how to scale up production .
Canada 's Iogen is the furthest along in commercialization ; another hopeful is BC International , a Dedham , Mass. , company that 's building a cellulosic ethanol plant in Louisiana .
There 's still a role for government -- and we do n't mean more handouts for corn growers or distillers .
The recently enacted energy bill takes steps in the right direction , like mandating the use of 250 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol a year by 2013 , but much more can be done .
Easing the tariff of 54 cents per gallon on imports of ethanol from Brazil and other countries would certainly help .
Because sugar cane generates far more ethanol per acre than corn , Brazil can produce ethanol more cheaply than the U.S.
Not only would importing more of it broaden access to ethanol for U.S. buyers , but it would also make it cheaper for the ultimate consumers -- us .
That in turn would spur demand at the pump and encourage service station owners to offer ethanol more widely .
What 's also needed is for someone big -- like Shell or BP , which tout themselves as green companies -- to commit to cellulosic ethanol on a commercial scale .
Shell 's bet on Iogen is minuscule compared with the $ 20 billion it plans to spend on producing oil and gas off Russia 's Sakhalin Island .
Of course , the timing of when ethanol goes from dream to reality is n't just a matter of an investment here or a subsidy there .
It took decades of ferment in Brazil before serendipity in the form of high gas prices and flex - fuel engines made ethanol an everyday choice for consumers .
But the sooner we start , the greater our ability to shape a future that 's not centered on increasingly expensive oil and gas .
It 's not as if gasoline demand is going to go down :

Thinking Forth Project
This is the homepage of the Thinking Forth project .
Thinking Forth captures the philosophy of the language to show users how to write more readable , better maintainable applications .
This project makes the book available in electronic form ( LaTeX and PDF ) .
The project has two milestones : the reprint and the 21st century version .
The reprint is done , scroll down for the ongoing project .
The Book Thinking Forth is a book about the philosophy of problem solving and programming style , applied to the unique programming language Forth .
Published first in 1984 , it could be among the timeless classics of computer books , such as Fred Brooks '
The Mythical Man-Month and Donald Knuth 's The Art of Computer Programming .
Many software engineering principles discussed here have been rediscovered in eXtreme Programming , including ( re ) factoring , modularity , bottom - up and incremental design .
Here you 'll find all of those and more - such as the value of analysis and design - described in Leo Brodie 's down - to - earth , humorous style , with illustrations , code examples , practical real life applications , illustrative cartoons , and interviews with Forth 's inventor , Charles H. Moore as well as other Forth thinkers .
If you program in Forth , this is a must - read book .
If you do n't , the fundamental concepts are universal : Thinking Forth is meant for anyone interested in writing software to solve problems .
The concepts go beyond Forth , but the simple beauty of Forth throws those concepts into stark relief .
So flip open the book , and read all about the philosophy of Forth , analysis , decomposition , problem solving , style and conventions , factoring , handling data , and minimizing control structures .
But be prepared : you may not be able to put it down .
This book has been scanned , OCR'd , typeset in LaTeX , and brought back to print ( and your monitor ) by a collaborative effort under a Creative Commons license .
Author Leo Brodie wrote Thinking Forth in 1984 .
Since the book went out of print now the second time ( due to FIG folding up - FIG did the reprint ) , he allowed to publish Thinking Forth as electronic book under a Creative Commons license ( attribute , non-commercial , share - alike ) .
Download Release 1.0 is a reprint with typos fixed , and high - quality typesetting .
The book is available as Onscreen PDF ( 4M )
This is a slightly colored PDF , which is more pleasent to read on screen .

Paper version Release 1.0 also is available as printed book from " Punchy Publising " ( Leo Brodie 's single - book publishing company ) through Amazon .
The ISBN number is 0-9764587-0-5 .
Adobe Reader tips
If you read the PDF with Adobe Reader , change the following settings in the Edit -> Preferences -> General ... dialog box to improve display quality : Set " Use Greek Text : Below ( xx ) Pixels " off .
This just makes some small print text unreadable for no good reason .
Set smoothing on for at least Text and Line Art .
If you have a TFT display , use CoolType .
When you cut&paste from Adobe Reader , some special characters ( ligatures ) like fi and ff and left / right quotes wo n't show up as expected .
Other PDF readers like xpdf do a better job here .
If you really want to lay hand on the text , using the sources is probably a much better idea , anyway .
Things to do : 21st Century
The first step , the reprint , is now done .
The open nature of the license however allows us to update the book to current 21th century practice , and to add the missing chapters .
The plan so far consists of Modify the example sources so that they run with ANS Forth systems .
Update coding style to current practice ( lower case and such ) .
Add chapters about Forth and OOP , Forth debugging , and maintenance .
Interview Forth thinkers that did n't have a chance 20 years ago .
Translate it to other ( natural ! ;-) languages .
A first preprint is available .
Resources
Most of the resources available now are for people who participate in the effort to make the printed Thinking Forth available as LaTeX sources .

cvs add filename adds a new file , and cvs ci checks modified ( and added ) files into the repository .
More documentation can be found on the CVS homepage .
If you like to , you can also use a GUI frontend like WinCVS on Windows .
Font package :
To generate a PDF that is readable with Acroread , we need the cm-super package .
This is necessary , since we use several fonts that are not part of the usually installed set of Type1 fonts from Bluesky .
You can get it from ftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/ps-type1/cm-super.zip ( 64MB ) .
You do n't need that if you do n't want to generate an Acroread - readable PDF ( e.g. just for printing or using alternative viewers ) .
Since we also use the OT1 - encoded cmbtt fonts , I 've created a Type1 fonts for that , too : cmbtt-type1.tar.gz .
I 've also created an OCRB Type1 font for the ISBN number based on the ocrb9 .mf that is part of the EAN package .
It 's sufficient to have Ghostscript know about that font in Fontmap .
GS , ps2 pdf will embed it .

a. Syntax Checking for Boolean Expressions
Such expressions contain the following symbols : variable symbols , negation symbol , operation symbols , parentheses symbols , and space symbol that is needed for the separation of expressions .
The symbols in question are coded in bit sequences .
Sa(x ) : << x is a ' meaningful expression ' , i.e. a ( syntactically correct ) Boolean expression > >.
( i) A variable symbol is a meaningful expression .
( ii ) A meaningful expression , prefixed by a negation symbol , yields a meaningful expression .
( iii ) Two meaningful expressions , connected by an operation symbol , yield a meaningful expression .
( iv ) A meaningful expression , put in parentheses , yields a meaningful expression .
Va(x ) : << x is a variable symbol >>
Op ( x ) : << x is operation symbol > >
Neg( x ) : << x is negation symbol >>
Kla(x ) : << x is opening patenthesis > >
Klz(x ) : << x is closing parenthesis >>
Az(x ) : Va(x ) V Neg( x ) V Kla(x )
Sz(x ) : Va(x ) V Klz(x )
Sq( x , y ) : ( Sz(x ) ^ ¬ Az(y ) ) V ( ¬ Sz( x ) ^ Az(y ) )
1 . The first symbol x has to fulfill Az(x )
2 . Two symbols x , y following each other have to fulfill Sq( x , y )
3 . The last symbol x has to fulfill Sz(x ) .
4 . The number of opening parenthesis has to be equal to the number of closing parentheses .
5 . For any segment of the symbol sequences , the number of opening parentheses must not be smaller than the number of closing parentheses .
The program ( Figure 3 ) checks these conditions : ( 2 ) serves for the special case of condition 1 . ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) are initializations for the repetitive statement which checks condition 2 and the count 5 .
Condition 3 for the final case is then checked in ( 11 ) and the count 4 in ( 12 ) .
The program , by the way , contains mistakes : for example , a count corresponding to ( 7 ) is missing for the first symbol .
More seriously , the condition x V0 [ 0 ] in ( 5 ) should be read as x = V0 [ i ] ^ i 0 .
For a direct transliteration of Zuse 's ( corrected ) procedure , we assume first that suitable Boolean procedures Va(x ) , Op( x ) , etc. , are declared .
Using these predicates , we obtain in ALGOL 68 ( the encircled numbers refer to Figure 3 ) :
We have a name for Tom Ford ’s new fragrance , Black Orchid , which has been described by executives “ as the anchor of what will become the Ford flotilla of fragrance and cosmetics initiatives . ”
Tom has been busy having one on one meetings with top editors of the world ’s biggest fashion magazines and unveiling his new collection .
He ’s reportedly met with editors from Vogue , W , Harperâ€™s Bazaar and Elle , according to the WWD.com .
And not that heâ€™s got the signature fragrance for his collection ; the next thing to do wasâ€¦ find a face of course !
Who is the lucky girl ?
Ms Julia Restoin - Roitfeld .
For those of you who donâ€™t know who she is , she ’s the daughter of French Vogue Editor , Carine Roitfeld , both pictured left .
In the full - color campaign images , photographed by Mert Alas & Marcus Piggott , Roitfeld is shown with glossy long hair and red nails and lips , clutching the bottle in a boudoir - like atmosphere .
“ I ’ve known her since she was a little girl , and it was amazing to see her grow up to become such a beautiful woman , ” Ford told editors , adding that Roitfeld is “ exactly what beauty is to me . ”
The master creative director noted that he didnâ€™t want a model to star in the campaign ; rather , he sought more of a personality .
The campaign for Black Orchid will launch officially in November as Tom Ford Black Orchid by Tom Ford Beauty , with the perfume available in three versions â€ “ the parfum , with a gold band around the bottle ; a hair perfume that ’s gold - toned , and an eau de toilette that boasts a whimsical tiny gold bow and gold front plate .
He also told the editors about his future endeavors to build a complete range of beauty products for fall 2007 before plans to launch a male counterpart to Black Orchid and menâ€™s skincare in Spring 2008 .
Boy will Tom be a busy man .

Experts say they have never seen anything like Weasel the border terrier cross - and hope he can find a new home where his disability wo n't be an issue .
And , despite appearances , it seems the 10 - month - old puppy can actually hear , for he is believed to have working inner ears covered by skin .
Vets hope they will be able to let the tiny dog hear properly for the first time by making tiny openings where his outer ears should be .
Weasel was born with skin covering the whole of his head - with no outer ears or earholes .
Instead of the floppy ears which his breed normally has , he has tiny earflaps sticking out .
The puppy was taken into a police station in Bridgend , south Wales , when he was just five weeks old .
From there he was put into a dog pound before finally being taken to the local Dog Trust rehoming centre .
Workers there named the playful pup Weasel because of his unusual appearance .
But they became bemused by the tiny dog because , despite having no ears , he appeared to be able to hear certain noises .
After examining him , vets believe Weasel does have functioning ears behind the layer of skin which currently covers them .
Veterinary director of the Dogs Trust , Chris Laurence , said : " He does n't look to have any ears at all , there is no hole into the actual ear although inside there does appear to be a normal working ear .
" There seems to be an ear canal which goes down into the skull .
We think the dog can hear a little bit , which would make sense if he has working ears underneath the skin .
" It is a very unusual deformity , I have never seen anything like it before .
It could have been inherited from one of the parents , but the more likely possibility is that his mother was ill in the first third of the pregnancy - when the puppy was not yet fully formed and vulnerable to illness .
" In every other respect Weasel is a perfectly healthy and normal puppy - exactly what you would hope for a dog of his age . "
An operation is now on the cards for Weasel in the hope of opening his ears and letting him hear clearly for the first time .
" We are going to carry out electronic tests and X - rays to check the ears are working , " said Mr Laurence .
" If we get a positive response and they appear to be functioning we will look at making little holes in the skin to open up the skin and help him hear . "
While experts look into how they can help Weasel , he will be taught to understand sign language and facial expressions .
He is already learning how to communicate with dog trainers at the rehoming centre and can understand basic signals .
Weasel has an appointment at a specialist veterinary practice in Southampton on Valentine 's Day , who can help discover whether creating openings for his ears will help .
Beverley Price , manager of Bridgend Dogs Trust , said : " Despite his obvious disability , Weasel is a fantastic dog .
He is happy , friendly and really healthy in every other way .
" We 're going to do all we can to find a way for Weasel to hear properly for the first time in his young life . "
A search for a new home for the puppy has been put on hold until a decision has been made whether to operate on him .
But the Dogs Trust hope that when he is given a clean bill of health they will be able to find a new owner for Weasel .
A couple of summers ago , my husband and I attended a wedding that took place just outside Missoula , Montana , where one of our sons lives .
The groom is an incredibly nice man whose family is from India .
He and his family are Christian , not Hindu .
His uncle , who participated in the wedding ceremony , is a minister in the Pentecostal Church .
During the ceremony , it became obvious there is a philosophical and theological divide in the groom ’s family .
His generation , born in the United States , has rejected the values and beliefs , though not the religion , of the older generation .
The women of the older generation are diffident , speaking only when spoken to , wearing only traditional Indian dress .
The women of the younger generation are liberated American females .
The “ best man ” at the wedding , in fact , was actually the groom ’s sister .
There were covert smiles passed amongst the younger generation , males and females , at the words of their uncle , who preached subservience and obedience for the bride , dominence for the groom .
It was clear , while the younger generation respects its elders in that family and holds very closely to its Christian beliefs , it does not accept its old , rigid patriarchal mores .
It was n’t clear to me until after the wedding just how rigid those patriarchal mores are .
Because my father was a pastor in South Africa , and because the Indian preacher had also been a pastor in South Africa , I thought it quite appropriate to talk to him about our connection , but , to my surprise , his answers to me were very curt and he would not look at me when I spoke to him or when he answered me .
At first , I was disconcerted , then bemused when I finally understood what was happening .
As a woman , I was not supposed to be talking to him .
It would have been acceptable for me to have offered to serve him as long as my eyes had been downcast , but I was talking to him as though we were equals , my life as important as his .
Partly , of course , this was the arrogance of a certain type of preacher , but even more it was the arrogance of the patriarchal true believer , someone who has sanctified his fear of women and his misogyny through his religion .
I have never before personally experienced misogyny so intense , but it ’s clear , from what we hear on the news and from what we read in books like Reading Lolita in Tehran and The Bookseller of Kabul it not only exists but is far more brutal than I experienced that day , and is making a vengeful comeback after briefly loosening its hold in many parts of the world .
The subjugation of women in some Middle Eastern countries and in Africa and India and Pakistan is brutal beyond belief .
Stories coming out of Afghanistan , telling of the Taliban ’s barbaric treatment of women , seem to have come out of the Dark Ages rather than the 20th and 21st centuries .
But , of course , discrimination in more subtle forms exists almost universally .
As a woman , and a small one , I feel as though I have been struggling , all my life , to be taken seriously .
It was n’t until after my mother ’s death , when I was thirty and my father actually had to talk to me , he realized I was something more than “ just a girl . ”
And even after he had recognized my abilities , he held to the belief my goal in life should be to serve in the background rather than shine in the foreground unless I shone in the foreground in such demure womanly arts as cooking , sewing , singing , raising children .
Many women in our western world have struggled against the same tyranny of attitude , fighting not simply to gain equal pay for equal work , but to be recognized according to their abilities , not their gender .
They have fought against sexual objectification that reduces them to symbols rather than individuals .
They still fight against those male politicians and clergymen who seem to believe they must control women ’s sexuality and their reproductive lives .
I believe there is a bizarre male element in the Right to Life faction that is more concerned with this control than with saving fetuses from abortion .
These men , it seems to me , are kindred spirits to the Moslem males who enforce female genital mutilation in Africa and other parts of the world in an attempt to control women ’s sexuality .
But the older I get , the more I come to believe there is more going on here than simply some males ’ need to believe in gender superiority .
I think it is a need to believe in the sanctity of power that drives these ills , and not simply these ills .
Surely , all the wars , all the ethnic cleansing , all the arrogance of blind patriotism , all the religious strife we see is the tragic result of this blind devotion to and lust for power .
And I wonder about the fear behind this instinct .
Recently , my husband and I found ourselves driving our car behind someone who turned on the light bulb for me .
This man was riding a motorcycle , an extremely noisy Harley Davidson .
He made his presence felt through the growl of his vehicle and by his physical appearance .
He was a giant of a man , not just overweight , but large , and dressed , of course , in black leather .
He wore heavy boots and a shiny black helmet reminiscent of a Nazi soldier ’s .
The most telling detail of all , though , was the Confederate flag attached to the back of his bike , his true declaration of individualistic menace .
My husband said , “ There he is , the reason America is hated in the world , the perfect example of an American who believes he can impose himself on everyone else ’s reality , ” or words to that effect .
And the insight that came to me for the first time was here was someone who believes if he does not demonstrate he is superior in whatever way passes as superiority for him , he will simply not exist .
If he cannot believe he is all powerful , he has no reason to live .
He is the quintessential ugly , brutish American , a man so insecure , so afraid he is worth nothing , he has to believe he can “ take ” the world , or he will fade into oblivion .
He is deathly afraid .
It reminds me of what Doris Lessing describes in her second memoir , Walking in the Shade , about the bewildering loyalty to and worship of the power of God , king and country displayed by some of the British working class men she met in London after the Second World War .
In Africa , during the war , she had been a member of the communist party , an affiliation she she continued briefly in England until the reality of communism ’s abuses of power became clear .
She and her fellow communists in Africa were attracted to the philosophy because of their idealism and belief in equality , their passionate desire to free black men and women from the yoke of colonialism .
They were also passionate about improving the lot of the British working class , a class which had been as exploited , as abused as the black people in the British colonies .
Most of her friends were British upper class , and their experiences in two world wars had brought them into contact with working men .
They had become ashamed of their empire and its values .
( Lessing points out the average working class people they encountered were a good foot shorter than the average upper class Britons , the result not of inferior genes , but of malnutrition . )
But the point is , Lessing and her cohorts met almost universal and sometimes violent resistence to their ideas .
The working class Britons they were trying to “ save ” would have none of it .
They were fiercely loyal to their country , their rulers , their empire .
I believe it was because they saw themselves as nothing without the very things that had created their miserable living conditions .
Their only self - esteem came from their fierce patriotism , their pride in the power of the empire they had no hand in ruling .
Their only self - esteem came from their belief they lived in the most powerful nation in the world , and without that power , they would have been nothing .
If and when the majority of these working class people were able to escape from Britain and find opportunity in the colonies , they treated “ the natives ” as brutally as the British ruling class had treated them .
They seized power as opportunistically as any duke or earl had ever done .
And they believed they had a right to do so because they were British .
Aldous Huxley described them and our motorcycle friend very aptly when he wrote the attraction to patriotism for people like this is “ it fulfills [ their ] worst wishes .
In the person of [ their ] nation [ they ] are able , vicariously , to bully and cheat .
Bully and cheat , what ’s more , with a feeling [ they ] are profoundly virtuous . ”
And so it goes .
Some of us are bewildered by the members of America ’s working class who are anti union and appear slavishly devoted to the political party we believe perpetuates their struggle to survive with dignity .
They , too , seem so devoid of self - esteem , they have to believe in the power and supremacy of their nation without which they would be nothing .
We live in a world torn by genocide , war , arrogance , religious fundamentalism , lacking in compassion , lacking in almost anything we can call ethical .
Too many of the leaders of our country , and too many of the people they lead , believe they have the right simply to take what America wants from the rest of the world , by force , if necessary .
They are the heirs of the European colonials who believed the same thing .
Few seem to recognize how these arrogant beliefs have created the escalating crises of environmental degradation , nationalism , fundamentalist religion that threaten our planet .
And there is no doubt it is men who have cast the die , have set the tone .
………………………………………………………………………………….
One of my colleagues at St. Charles Community College has a quote from a comedienne whose name escapes me taped to her office door .
It reads , “ If women ruled the world , and everyone got massages , there would be no war . ”
It ’s a catchy slogan .
I wonder if it ’s true .
Certainly , there are and have been women who have put their lives on the line to end injustice and violence .
In South Africa , a group of white women calling themselves the Black Sash group , my stepmother among them , protested , placed themselves literally in the line of fire between black protesters and the white police intent on shooting the protesters .
( Their name came from the black sashes they wore during public protests . )
Many of them organized an underground railroad to smuggle African political dissidents out of South Africa to safe havens in Britain and elsewhere in Africa .
They were heroines .
In Northern Ireland , there were the mothers , both Protestant and Catholic , who banded together against their men to end the violence and murder killling their husbands and sons .
They , too , were heroines .
In Argentina , there were the mothers , so anguished by the police violence killling their children in the name of a corrupt regime , they defied the police , the government , the military , many dying protesting the senseless oppression .
They were also heroines .
The list goes on , and it is tempting to believe if we women were , by some miraculous sleight of hand , able to wrest power from the hands of the thugs who have created such misery in the world , we would make it all better , would set it all right .
I would love to believe it , but I am unconvinced .
Sarah Hrdy , in her fascinating book , Mother Nature , traces motherhood through 25,000 years of human evolution , using the San ( Bushmen ) of Africa as the closest example we have of our hunter / gatherer forebears , and investigating examples of motherhood in nature .
Her conclusions challenge our belief all females are more caring , more compassionate than all males .
She compares Flo , Jane Goodall ’s favorite chimanzee troop leader , with the female leader of a rival chimpanzee troop .
Flo was what some envision all women rulers would be — the good mother who treated all the members of the troop fairly and kindly , took care of not only her own daughters but of other females ’ chimpanzees .
She was , however , not the prototype of a chimpanzee leader .
Her troop was , at one point , at war with the chimpanzee troop led by the other female in question , who can only be described as evil .
This female not only attacked Flo ’s troop , attempting to kill its members and take over its territory , she ruled her own troop brutally .
She favored her own daughters above all the other infants in the troop , going so far as to kill many newborns to ensure the supremacy of her own line .
The members of her troop were terrified of her .
They dared not challenge her .
When she died , her oldest daughter took her place and was as brutal as her mother had been .
It was n’t until this daughter had also died , and the youngest female in the family had become leader , that peace was restored .
Hrdy points out , this is not an anomaly .
There is no guarantee female leaders among our closest primate relatives will be any nobler than their male human counterparts .
It would seem the lust for power and prestige corrupts across species lines .
When I read this account , it brought to mind the story of the mother of the Texas high school cheerleader who hired a hit man to eliminate her daughter ’s rival in cheerleading competition .
Hrdy writes we must , however , reluctantly , face the fact most females , human and non-human , put the welfare of their own offspring before the welfare of any others .
They are not concerned with the survival of their species .
They , like their male counterparts , are concerned with the survival of their own genetic line .
And while many women are , of course , gentle and compassionate , it seems doubtful to me this is strictly the result of their essential nature .
I ’m convinced nurture has a great deal to do with it as well .
There are so many examples of women who seem utterly lacking in compassion for me to believe otherwise .
Let ’s not forget some Native American tribes turned their prisoners of war over to their women to torture because the women were so good at it .
My mother used to say she believed men do n’t allow women to become soldiers because , once women have crossed a certain psychic threshold , , they are far more vicious fighters than men could ever be .
I ca n’t help thinking she may have been right when I think of some eighth grade girls .
Need I say more ?
It seems some of the members of this generation of females , schooled in the sense of entitlement rampant in our society , have crossed the threshold of which my mother spoke .
They bully verbally , they bully physically , they torture in whatever ways they can .
I used to say , when I taught public school , I could make the boys angry with me and have them won over in ten minutes .
But if I once made some of the girls angry , they would still be plotting my demise in six months .
And for every Cindy Sheehan , there is a woman so lost in fear , so blindly patriotic , she will defend America ’s imperialism no matter what .
Historically , there were the women in Britain during two world wars who handed out white feathers to any male of fighting age not on the battlefront , the white feather being the symbol of cowardice .
They handed these out even to men who had been wounded in combat .
So much for the gentler sex .
It ’s my sense when some women declare their gender morally superior to men , they are indulging in the same self - serving , prejudiced and arrogant posturing as the men who declare the male gender superior .
These women are the opposite side of the same bankrupt coin minted by patriarchy .
In pigeonholing men , they are pigeonholing themselves , creating the very tyranny of attitude they claim to despise .
They have created a stereotype for themselves every bit as sentimental and false as any created by the Victorians who idealized women as “ the angels in the house . ”
And they are not proposing peace and equality , they are proposing dominance and exclusion .
I encounter women , in all walks of life from lower working class to intelligensia , who espouse the philosophy of female superiority .
It is , somehow , more irritating for me to hear it espoused by highly educated women than by other women because I used to believe they were clear eyed critical thinkers , my own sentimental and elitist stereotype .
Some of these women , who would never tolerate stereotyping of black people as stupid , lazy , violent and worthless , tar all men with that brush .
The basis of the friendships of so many of these women is their professed contempt for men , their cynicism about marriage .
This relentless cynicism may be the result of disappointment and fear , but it is a destructive , divisive force .
I believe these women have bought into the same kind of thinking as their male counterparts , and they are as trapped and crippled by it as are the men .
They have bought into the same fears — they are afraid of men , perhaps afraid men really are superior , and so they have to believe in the superiority of women or they will not exist .
They are not interested in being equal , they are interested in controlling , not only men but other women .
They jockey for power amongst each themselves , deciding who , in their social circles , in their workplaces , will be on the A list and who will not .
They compete with each other through their children ’s accomplishments .
Many of those who are teachers have contempt for their students , thinking of them , too , as inferior beings .
I have encountered women like these in all the places where I have worked and in all the organizations to which I have belonged .
No , they are not in the majority , but they are the alpha females , some of whom gain power in whatever arena they operate .
They are hungry for power and will do what they have to do in order to get it .
I would not want any of these women to rule the world .
They are as flawed as the men they hate , and they justify their hunger for power by declaring they have no choice but to be what they are in a male dominated world .
It sounds like the rationalizations for global takeovers mouthed by our illustrious leaders , male and female .
( Let ’s not forget Condoleezza Rice . )
Please do n’t think I ’m advocating an end to the fight for women ’s rights .
Please do n’t think I believe men are superior to women .
I am acutely aware , had it not been for the suffragists of the first half of the twentieth century and the feminists of the 1960 ’s and 70’s , I would not be able to rant as I am doing .
What I am advocating is we examine the nature of power and our motives in wanting it .
What I am avowing is we need to be careful what we wish for .
What I am suggesting is , too often , in revolution , all that happens is power changes hands .
I am questioning if matriarchy would be any more compassionate , any more just , any more inclusive than patriarchy has been as long as it was driven simply by the need for and belief in power .
Surely , it ’s time to end the divisiveness that has almost brought our planet to the point of extinction .
Surely , it ’s time to understand the only good power is the power shared by all , not preempted by the ruthless , greedy , aggressive few .
What will we have changed if women rule the world alone ?
Will we not simply have replaced one flawed , short sighted system with another ?
It seems clear to me , when men exclude women and dismiss the female point of view , they become bizarre , unbalanced caricatures of masculinity .
But it also seems as clear when women exclude men and dismiss their point of view , they become equally bizarre , unbalanced caricatures .
I believe we need to balance the scales , not tip them in the favor of any group , nation , race , gender if our planet is to survive .
The tools are 4,300 years old , say researchers
The discovery represents the oldest evidence of tool use by our closest evolutionary relative .
The skill could have been inherited from a common ancestor of chimps and humans , the authors say , or learnt from humans by imitation .
Alternatively , humans and chimps may have developed tool use independently , the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal reports .
Chimpanzees were first observed using stone tools in the 19th century .
Julio Mercader and colleagues found stone tools at the Noulo site in Ivory Coast , the only known prehistoric chimpanzee settlement .
Nut crunch
The excavated stones showed the hallmarks of use as tools for smashing nuts when compared with ancient human or modern chimpanzee stone tools .
The use of stone tools may have a deep evolutionary origin
" Chimpanzee material culture has a long prehistory whose deep roots are only beginning to be uncovered , " write the researchers in Proceedings .
The tools were found to be 4,300 years old , which , in human terms , corresponds to the later Stone Age , before the advent of agriculture in the area .
The age of the tools was determined by subjecting charcoal from the same ground layers to the technique of radiocarbon dating .
About 200 pornographic films are shot in the US every week
The scale of the Adult Entertainment Expo reflects the huge growth in a business which is said to be bigger than Hollywood and worth $ 57bn ( £ 29bn ) .
Estimates of its annual contribution to the US economy range from $ 12 bn - $ 20bn .
One of the reasons for its recent success is the pioneering use of new technology - video on the internet and use of moving images on mobile phones .
The BBC's Guto Harri in Las Vegas says it is easy to be embarrassed at such a show , with explicit films , intimidating toys and hundreds of half - naked actors on display .
The adult industry is bigger than every professional sports combined - it 's part of life , it 's mainstream now
Adult entertainment model
Jasmine Mai
But the scale and seriousness of the convention is not that different to a more mainstream gathering because pornography is big business , our correspondent says .
Adult entertainment model Jasmine Mai told the BBC : " The adult industry is bigger than every professional sport combined .
It 's part of life - it 's mainstream now . "
' Innovations '
Embracing new technology has been critical to the industry 's development , and has allowed people to access it more easily and more discreetly , bringing in new customers .
Adult entertainment helped determine the dominance of VHS over Beta , it was crucial in the development of video on the web , and is now pioneering moving images on mobile phones .
There are an estimated 200 pornographic films shot in the United States every week .
Improving production and distribution methods has helped to cut costs .
Our correspondent says many people regard pornography with disgust , but mainstream entertainment has and will continue to benefit from the technical innovations of the shameless people who are in Nevada this weekend .

We protect our family , pets , and livestock with our mosquito net made for killing thousands of mosquitoes a night .

Why they do n't upgrade ( and what to do about it ) »
Screaming users considered good
We all know our users can have really strong opinions about our stuff .
And we all know we need to listen carefully .
My very favorite user comment of all time came from a young woman who had been using this cool design tool ( something I ’d built ) for about 12 weeks .
At the end of the project , I was doing the standard debriefing of the users , asking what they liked and did n’t like , what worked , what did n’t work , what was frustrating … the usual sort of post mortem on a project .
She told me that my software , my baby , the thing I ’d been working on for the past 2 years was “ .. the most white male fascist tool I ’ve ever had the misfortune to use … ”
I was somewhat taken aback .
“ Ah , yes … ” I stalled for time , desperately trying to hold it together .
“ And what made you feel this way ? ”
The conversation went on for some time after that ( as you can imagine ) .
And while it was a painful episode , it was a really valuable learning experience .
Although I knew intellectually that not everyone would see my system as I did , I was floored by her reaction .
But it made the point : as a designer , you really have to be aware of other folks opinions ( even when they do n’t jibe with yours ) , and you have to know what it is you ’re building .
Sometimes , your product is going to passionately piss people off .
Sometimes , that ’s okay .
In many cases , you simply can’t design a product that will make everyone sing your praises and want to send you roses .
I love my iPod , but I know there are some people who think it ’s devil spawn .
If Steve ca n’t get everyone to love his things , I ’m not sure I can .
So I ’d succeeded in creating a passionate user .
Sadly , it was passion in the wrong direction .
After I recovered my composure a few weeks later , I realized I was really glad she ’d told me .
The ten users I ’d interviewed before her were all pretty nice and even - keeled .
“ Oh yeah … it worked well … ” or even the sweetly positive comment “ I could do things with it that I could never have done before . ”
But in retrospect , I did n’t learn much from the nice folks who told me everything was fine and ducky .
I did learn a great deal from the ones who struggled , my users that just did n’t get it , had really strong reactions or failures .
As Henry Petroski writes in To Engineer Is Human : The Role of Failure in Successful Design , we learn more from our failures than our successes .
But only if we pay attention to the failures and figure out what to do right the next time .
The trick is to figure out what the message is from the user .
I did have the presence of mind to ask her what “ fascist ” meant .
Sure , I know the dictionary definition , but I could n’t figure out what it meant in the context of the tool I ’d built .
My question opened up the sluice gates and I heard an awful lot about “ not letting the user have a choice ” and how our design tool “ forced the user to do things in a particular order . ”
Gee .
We did it that way because we knew it was more efficient .
But provably correct did n’t win the heart and mind of this user — she did things in a different way , and the tool was forcing her to go along a different path .
It felt fascist to her .
Okay .
Got it .
So it was n’t the Gestapo of all software , but it really was at variance with her approach .
In an instant it became clear what we could do differently the next time around .
Bottom line : Every product evolves .
It ’s the rare ( or trivial ) that gets it right the first time and sticks with it for the rest of time .
Listen to the screamers and whiners and people writing nasty blog posts .
It ’s painful and tough , but worth it .
The screamers may not know it , but they ’re really helping you out with the next release .

At least you took the time to try to understand your user 's complaints , rather than ignore them or , worse yet , badmouth the user .
My pet peeve ?
Asking for help with a problem , complaining when I get no response , and then still getting no response .
I wo n't use PubSub for this reason .
If they 'd listened and taken my request for help with their website seriously , I 'd have been great word - of mouth advertising .
As it stands , I wo n't use their service and I 'll turn away anyone else I know who might want to try it .
Your complaining user may not have liked your product , but she 'll definitely give you a fair shake in the future . . . all because you listened .

This whole post also applies to change management ( and communication in general ) .
I find that when people are really upset , fighting a change , or generally difficult to work with - it's often because they have needs that have been overlooked , minimized , or ignored .
It always helps to listen to the screamers .
Sure there is a percentage that are screaming without adding any value ( just for the " fun " of it ) - but most of them have a point !

Great article , and it reminded me of the simple fact that compliments really do n't get you anywhere further down the road other than " you 're great " - if you need to reinvent , develop , challenge , move along , you need to hear the bad stuff and loudly .

Ugh , you 've caught me .
I was sitting here smugly nodding and thinking of the users that I know I 've converted from problem customers to big fans just by taking their yelling seriously and by talking them through what upsets them and what we can do about it .
But mostly , that was before I was in development .
It seems like the more I develop , the more defensive I get and the more likely I am to respond to those people by letting the users know that it was user error and not programming error that caused their problems .
See me blush .
I know very clearly that approach will never create a passionate user .

Heh ... this reminds me of when I created a YahooGroup composed entirely of users who were very angry and upset at the product I was the lead designer for .
It shell shocked the developers who participated , but it was by far the most useful and valuable input I ever got ... and it had the side effect of turning most of that group into advocates .

I remember the first time I had a software project that I thought was simply amazing and the users thought it was the biggest pile of horse manure they have ever seen .
It was certainly tough to sit there and hear them tear my hard work and wonderful ideas to shreds , but it also taught me to pay more attention to what they want in the first place .
At the time I was younger and knew that I knew better than them what they wanted .
Now I realize I do n't .

What was it about your software that indicated to her that it was white , or male ?
Or was it just that YOU are both of those things ?
Posted by : Michael Campbell | Sep 18 , 2006 11:38:12 AM
One of the best nuggets of wisdom I have been given was that hate is not the opposite of love , apathy is .
People who hate something are often angry because they want to like it , feel like they should like it , but something is getting in the way .
In Cathy - speak , perhaps we could call hate " direction - inverted passion " , because often it involves people who care a lot , and are trying to make things better .
Of course , there are always people who are just whiners in general , but they are few and far between .
If you can see understand that apathy is far more harmful than passion .
Do n't take it personally , because usually they do n't hate you , they hate the problems .
It is just a little threatening to hear the truth .

Yeah that whole ' the customer is always right ' thing goes out the window when you 're faced with criticism .
Our biggest flaw is having so many cool ideas for things , we sometimes get a little over - excited and forget that the customer only wants some simple little feature .
It 's tough to get bad feedback , but you 're right , we'd be terrible if noone ever told us what we were doing wrong .
Posted by : Natalie Ferguson | Sep 18 , 2006 3:05:48 PM
I would suggest that " white male fascist " conspiracy theorists are an atypical user group for most products AND that you would learn even more by observing users than mainly listening to people who complain .
I 'd agree though that it 's useful to be aware of what complaints there are out there .

As much as I love the culture 's positivity , the US is in so many walks of life hamstrung by it .
Not to put too fine a point on it , people ( such as astronauts ) die because of it .
In order to improve , you have to Accentuate The Negative and yes that means even when you do n't have an immediate solution for it .

There are a couple of issues that your post has partially uncovered .
The first is in problems of user interface design - perhaps this is an unreasonable generalisation , but in my experience 9 out of 10 developers suck at user interface design .
( and just before the finger pointing starts - I count myself one of those 9 ! )
But I do n't think that it 's our fault .
Good developers are good developers partially because they do n't think the same as other people .
To some extent , Kathy 's post about " Assumptions have a sell - by date " is an indication .
Developers see things and work through logical problems in quite a different way to most people .
While that works when things are being developed away from the public eye , it means that when those same ' different ' thought processes get unleashed on a user interface , that regular users probably are n't going to get it .
The other issue raised is that interviews / surveys are hard !
The fact that _you_ are interviewing the users is probably going to bias the bulk of the results in a meaningless direction right from the start .
Add to that people 's natural tendency to temper their criticisms , and you 've really got a hard time of it .
One idea that would be interesting to explore is to use the phenomena that make call - in phone - poll surveys not work - and use it for good .
My understanding is that you can't gather any serious statistics from polls that require the user to call in themselves , because only the extremely passionate ( either good or bad ) will actually bother .
Given the difficulty that you 've just described in trying to get critical feedback , if you can tap these passionate users at the time that their complaints are still fresh ( and they 're all fired up ) you might get what you 're after ?
( criticism welcomed - this was a thought that occured to me in the last 5 minutes :-) )
Posted by : omni | Sep 18 , 2006 6:05:07 PM
I agree with Omni that interviews with users are hard , as is good UI design .
Our company is beginning version 2 of our product ( internal users ) and continually struggle with both issues .
We still have users who absolutely dispise our version 1 product - even though we let the users help shape the UI themselves !
Lesson number one : users do n't always know what they want .
Since I 'm better at UI than I am at coding , I handle most of the user calls and am usually at the receiving end of the screamers .
It used to hurt my feelings that some people hated our product , but I 've learned to listen and differentiate between the users who are frustrated just because it's not the system they 're used to using , or if they have a true complaint that we can fix in the next cut .
I calm them down and keep asking questions ( " Really ?
I understand , so what could we do to make it easier for you to do that ? " )
In the past , many usability suggestions I made were fired down by developers saying that doing it my way would be hard or make really ugly code .
But they are now seeing that we may have to do it the " hard " way in order to make it more usable .
We want our users to get past the Suck Factor pretty quickly this time .
Please keep up the great posts , Kathy !
Each entry I read either reminds me of something I 've heard , or teaches me something new .
You and everyone responding to your blog are more helpful than you 'll know ! :-) )
Posted by : Lana B. | Sep 18 , 2006 8:58:25 PM
Lana B. - absolutely true !
I 'd forgotten that one ... the other reason that developers are usually not good at UI work is that they are concentrating on a different game .
Developers are concentrating on the code and the underlying structure .
An elegant design is one that fits together beautifully under the hood and is extensible and clean .
But ( other than exceptional circumstances ) the end user does n't get to see any hints of the underlying design - so they do n't ( and should n't ) care .
Posted by : omni | Sep 18 , 2006 9:44:15 PM
I think we should listen to all the users but making a software that adapts to people is an utopia .
first : people are a lot more adaptable .
second : you can't know how everyone work ( and it is in fact unpredictible )
Using efficient thinking there is only one solution : make software to which people adapt .
Even google search is not natural for a lot of people ( at least at start ) .
The software should show the way to do things , not being able to do everything and at the same time inexplicably unable to do some needed simple things .
Of course we have to test the software , but the best software I know are the one that show the way , the one that ask us to adapt .
I do n't know how to use VIM but I 'm pretty sure that the users think it 's the best thing since canned coke .
I use to draw on computer and I tried long ago a software absolutely unintuitive then gave up the thing , then used " everything you can do " software ( like photoshop , or flash ) , but was never really satisfied because some of the needed basic drawing features are lacking , I do n't need to have 2456 brushes , I need to have at least ONE beautiful one .
People need that the software developer thinks and shows the path , not give them 365 possibilities thinking " there are so much any user could find the one for him " .
That 's a bit like if you are given 365 different color pencils but no basic grey one .
This is a lack of thinking from the developer .
Having so much makes people unable to adapt to the software because in fact ... the is nothing consistent enough to adapt to .
Humans need clear concepts to grasp the tool and make it theirs .
When the tool is too complicated or diversified it burns all the brain power .
Making a software full featured and masterable , that is the challenge .
For drawing the pen is still the best , as well for developping ideas , where do the software fails ?
well ... just my two cents .
Posted by : isd | Sep 19 , 2006 12:10:01 AM
Good point , but there is one trap we must be careful not to fall into , and that 's the whole " you only learn from the dissatisfied users " .
It 's just as important to hear what works and what people like .
Otherwise you may end up changing a feature 100 people like , the first time you hear from someone who hates that feature .
Also , it 's crucial to be able to bask in the appreciation of the good work you 've done :o )
In any given project we can learn equal amounts from what worked and what did n't work - and in most projects ( hopefully ) most of what we did worked , which is why there is more learning in the successful stuff than in the failed stuff .
Unfortunately we tend to pass over what worked very quickly ...
Posted by : Alexander Kjerulf | Sep 19 , 2006 1:10:07 AM
Couple of thoughts from this excellent post .
First , " provably correct did n’t win the heart and mind of this user " is key .
So many of us believe in " facts " ( " it 's [ bigger , brighter , faster ] than it was before ; why are they complaining ? " ) that we forget that facts do n't really matter .
Experience matters .
If I experience the app as slower , then it 's slower , no matter what the stopwatch says .
Second , this whole area points to the importance of " outliers . "
We love to say that " the vast majority of users feel ... "
Fact is , the ones out on the fringe ( the types who call us " fascists " in moments of hyperbole ! ) tell us lots of great stuff ... just as long as we do n't write them off as " nutjobs . "
As Hugh McCleod might say , " listen to the wee voices . "
Finally , Petroski's latest book is very relevant : " Success Through Failure : The Paradox of Design . "
It 's very good .
Cheers !

I would like to second the above comment .
Be careful about changing your interface to accomodate a screamer .
You may alienate a host of ( semi - ) satisfied users .
I still use Visual Studio 6 as much as possible since the " wizards " in Visual Studio .
Net take 3 times as long to do anything ( but they are step by step ) .
I gather that MS has seriously changed the user interface of Office 2007 for some reason as well .

Developers do have habits of thinking that they can use to work around their UI blind spots , if they 're willing to .
They 've already had to learn the habit of discarding fond theories in favour of evidence , because when something does n't compile or a test fails , there 's no fudging it .
If they can get into the mindset of treating user feedback as being as true and objective as an error log , then developers can be quite determined and creative about fixing the issues presented , because they derive so much of their job satisfaction from being problem solvers .
Not to disagree with any of the above comments , but to present another example of an outlying case , recently a user phoned me with an issue , I thought about it , acknowledged that there was a problem , and was about to start discussing possibilities for solving the problem when instead I got a tirade about the flawed development process and how this user 's department were n't consulted etc etc ; and soon afterwards there was an email to various higher - ups about how not only was the system flawed , the developers themselves _admitted_ the flaw .
I may have a UI blind spot , but I have a political blind spot that 's ten times worse , and I had failed to recognise that this user was n't phoning me with criticism , but was fishing for information to make trouble .

I would suggest that " white male fascist " conspiracy theorists are an atypical user group for most products AND that you would learn even more by observing users than mainly listening to people who complain .
( Jason Yip )
I 'll lend my support to that idea as well .
Unless this user has a rapport with you and intimately knows your sense of humour / political beliefs , I think the fact that she chose " white male fascist " ( as if the first two words have anything to do with the 3rd ) , as opposed to something like " restrictive " , says a great deal more about the user than your product .
Putting too much weight on criticism ( especially the non-constructive kind ) is heading in the direction of design - by - committee , and we all know where that leads .
What may drive one user crazy could make 50 other users pee their pants .
There 's no substitute for actually observing users and seeing how they work with your product .
You 're also comparing [ eventually ] specific criticism with vague praise or tacit acceptance .
Specific praise would be just as valuable , but you 're not very likely to get that under any circumstances , and the reason is one that you yourself have pointed out before : a good tool should be practically invisible , transparent .
Users who find something very natural to use are not going to be able to point out specific things they like as easily as the dissatisfied users can point out things they dislike .
We should definitely listen to users , especially their criticism , but the key word is userS and not a user .
I prefer to be scientific : observe several users , look for general trends , investigate the most common questions or complaints , and not necessarily assume that one user represents the whole community .

" Every product evolves .
It ’s the rare ( or trivial ) that gets it right the first time and sticks with it for the rest of time .
Listen to the screamers and whiners and people writing nasty blog posts . "
Good post .
The guys at 37 Signals should give this a read .
We had an interesting discussion recently related to this kind of thing .

The word is getting out about the first 10 Netscape Navigators ( people who took “ the offer ” to become paid bookmarkers ) .
You can see their photos on the right hand column at www.netscape.com.
Here are the basic details , we hired :
1 . Three of the top 12 DIGG users
2 . The # 1 user on Newsvine
3 . The # 1 user on Reddit
4 . We hired a bunch of folks from Weblogs , Inc. ( since we know and love them 🙂
It is important to note that this is all an experiment .
No one knows for sure if this model of “ paying people for work ” us gonna work .
I mean , it ’s crazy to think that people could be paid to do a job and do it with integrity –that ’s just crazy talk . 🙂
Seriously , the fact is that the top 10 users on DIGG are responsible for 30 % of the front page stories on DIGG .
That ’s 3 % of total front page stories each !!!
Think about that for a second … the top 10 users of DIGG do 3 % of the work each –that is stunning .
They get paid nothing but they are responsible for 3 % of the total content on the home page .
Wow .
Like WOW , WOW , WOW !
My hope is that the first 10 Navigators do such an amazing job that we can extend our offer out to other members of the DIGG , NEWSVINE , and REDDIT top 10 .
HOW CAN YOU BECOME THE NEXT NETSCAPE NAVIGATOR ?
Folks have been asking me the best way to get a paid bookmarking job with us .
The best thing you can do to get on our radar and have a chance of getting a gig is to participate in the new Netscape .
Of course , being in the top ten on DIGG / Delicious / Reddit / Newsvine is also great .
However , I ’d also like to see more of these folks participating on Netscape as well .
… and you thought it would be a slow summer . 🙂
UPDATE1 : There is a story on DIGG about the new Navigators here .
The DIGG community is supporting the three users who have left DIGG for Netscape !
UPDATE2 : There is a Netscape story about the new Navigators here .
The Location Field Is the New Command Line
When you publish your opinions on a regular basis , it ’s hard to resist the urge to gloat after you ’ve been proven correct .
( For example , I ’ll be I - told - you - so - ing with regard to the iPod mini for the next couple of years . )
It ’s also rather easy to ignore the times when you ’ve been proven wrong .
It ’s a good thing I was n’t publishing Daring Fireball back in the mid-to - late ’90s , because if I had been , I ’d currently be eating an awful lot of crow with regard to what I would have written about the web ’s potential as an application platform .
At that time , at the peak of the Netscape - Microsoft browser war , the conventional wisdom was that the web was the future of application development .
The technology certainly did n’t yet exist , but the idea was that Netscape ’s web browser posed a serious threat to Microsoft ’s Windows monopoly — that at some point in the future , user applications would be written to run within the browser .
Thus , Microsoft ’s incredible change of course , going from more or less ignoring the Internet to completely dominating it within the course of a few years .
The idea was that Microsoft killed Netscape because Microsoft saw them as a threat to Windows .
Me , however , I just did n’t buy it .
I completely saw the potential of the Web as a publishing medium , but I just did n’t see how the Web was ever going to serve as a high - quality application development environment .
The way I saw it , Microsoft killed Netscape not because it was a threat to Windows , but simply because they ( Microsoft ) wanted control over this new publishing medium .
I simply could n’t have been more wrong .
The conventional wisdom was in fact correct — the web has turned into a popular application development environment .
Where I ’d gone wrong was in getting hung up on the idea of it needing to be high - quality before it could become popular .
I was thinking in terms of the apps that I used every day , circa 1996 : BBEdit , QuarkXPress , Photoshop , Eudora .
There was simply no way that a “ web app ” could ever provide the same quality experience as the “ real ” apps I was already using .
And I was right about that — the user experience of any app running in a web browser is crippled .
What I ’d overlooked is that most people do n’t use advanced text editors or desktop publishing software ; and more importantly , most people simply do n’t care about the quality of an app ’s user experience .
Not at all .
They just want it to work , and to be “ easy ” .
My saying that web apps would never become popular was like a theater critic in the early 1950s dismissing television .
The user experience limitations of a web app are glaringly obvious .
They simply do n’t look or act like normal desktop apps .
The browser in which they ’re running — that ’s a normal app .
But the web apps running within the browser are n’t .
They do n’t have menu bars or keyboard shortcuts .
( The browser itself does . )
This is n’t about being “ Mac - like ” — it applies equally to Windows and open source desktop platforms .
Instead of looking and feeling like real Mac / Windows / Linux desktop apps , web apps look and feel like web pages .
The persnickety little UI details I obsess over — these are nothing compared to the massive deficiencies of even the best web app .
But most people do n’t care , because web apps are just so damned easy to use .
What ’s interesting is that web apps are “ easy ” despite their glaring user experience limitations .
What they ’ve got going for them in the ease - of - use department is that they do n’t need to be installed , and they free you from worrying about where and how your data is stored .
Exhibit A : web - based email apps .
In terms of features , especially comfort features such as a polished UI , drag - and - drop , and a rich set of keyboard shortcuts , web - based email clients just ca n’t compare to desktop email clients .
But .
With web - based email , you can get your email from any browser on any computer on the Internet .
“ Installation ” consists of typing a URL into the browser ’s location field .
The location field is the new command line .
Google ’s Gmail has turned the competition up a notch by providing a few features that actually do compare well against desktop email clients — fast , accurate search ( of course ) , and a very nice threaded display for discussions .
Gmail also offers a bunch of keyboard shortcuts , implemented in JavaScript , but as Mark Pilgrim described them in his Gmail review , they
[ appear ] to have been designed by vi users ( j moves down , k moves up , and we are expected to memorize multi- key sequences for navigation ) .
Gmail ’s threading and searching are indeed nice , but its overall look - and - feel is far inferior to that of a real desktop mail client .
What it has going for it is what all webmail apps have — zero installation , zero maintenance , access from any computer , anywhere ( including from work , a major factor for personal email ) .
Gmail is simply better than the other major web - based mail apps ; but Yahoo and Hotmail and the others are still ragingly popular .
What I missed when I dismissed them a decade ago is that web apps do n’t need to beat desktop apps on the same terms .
What ’s happened is that they ’re beating them on an entirely different set of terms .
It ’s all about the fact that you just type the URL and there ’s your email .
Who Loses As Web Apps Win ?
What got me thinking about this was Joel Spolsky ’s “ How Microsoft Lost the API War ” , a terrific essay published last week .
The gist of Spolsky ’s argument is that Microsoft ’s crown jewel is the Win32 API — the set of programming interfaces that developers use to write desktop Windows software — and that web app development is gaining momentum , at the direct expense of Win32 development .
The reason the Win32 API is so important to Microsoft ’s Windows monopoly is dependence : if your company relies on Win32 software , then it also relies on Windows .
And conversely , as a developer , writing against the Win32 APIs allows your software to run on over 90 percent of the computers in the world .
That ’s the cycle that built a $ 50 billion pile of cash — customers use Windows because that ’s where the software is , and developers write Windows software because that ’s where the customers are .
Switching to , say , Mac OS X is an expensive proposition for a large corporation .
Not only do you need all - new hardware , but you also need all - new software .
And we ’re not just talking about buying new licenses — for large corporations , we ’re also talking about custom apps written in - house ( what do you think all those Visual Basic developers have been writing all these years ? ) .
Switching to open source desktops — KDE or Gnome or what have you — is also expensive .
No , you do n’t need new hardware , but you still run into the same situation with regard to software .
( Yes , I know — you can run Win32 apps on Linux using the WINE Win32 emulator , or with Virtual PC for Macs , but these are second - class Win32 environments .
I ’m not saying it ca n’t be done , just that it ’s unappealing . )
Switching to web applications , however — well , that ’s different .
It can be done gradually , because you can switch one app at a time while still running Windows , and thus , still running all your other Win32 software .
It ’s not so much that switching to web apps is cheap , as that it ’s easy .
In fact , in many ways , switching your employees to web apps is even easier than upgrading the Win32 apps they ’re already using .
I.e. it ’s easier for corporations to migrate to web apps than it is for them to stay Windows - only .
Web apps are easier to deploy .
No need to install software on each client machine ; there ’s just one instance of the app , on a web server .
Every user gets the latest version of the software , automatically .
Custom web apps are easier to develop than custom desktop apps .
That ’s not to say it ’s easy to make a web app that looks and feels like a desktop app — that ’s not really even possible .
But it ’s easy to write a web app that looks and feels like a web page , which is apparently good enough for most purposes , especially data - entry and data - retrieval apps that tie into server - hosted SQL databases .
And if you think the 90 - percent market share of computers that can run Win32 software is huge — how many computers do you think run a typical web app ?
Most email web apps ( e.g. Gmail and Yahoo Mail ) run on any computer with IE , Safari , or any Mozilla - derived browser .
Most weblog web apps ( e.g. Blogger , Movable Type , WordPress , and Textpattern ) run in every browser I ’ve ever tried .
These apps are effectively usable from any Internet - connected computer in the world .
I ’ve been thinking about the rise of the web as an application platform for a while .
But what had n’t occurred to me until I read Spolsky ’s essay last week is this , which I think is quite remarkable : Microsoft totally fucked up when they took aim at Netscape .
It was n’t Netscape that was a threat to Windows as an application platform , it was the web itself .
They spent all that time , money , and development effort on IE , building a browser monopoly and crushing Netscape — but to what avail ?
Here we are , and the web is still gaining developer mindshare at the expense of Win32 .
There are certainly exceptions — banking sites come to mind — but for the most part , web apps are being built to run in any modern browser , not just IE .
I think Spolsky is very much correct that Microsoft is losing the API war .
But what ’s ironic is that they ’re losing this war despite the fact that they won the browser war .
Winning the browser war — destroying Netscape — was supposed to prevent there ever even being an API war .
The video appears to challenge the US military 's account of events that took place in the town of Ishaqi in March .
The US said at the time four people died during a military operation , but Iraqi police claimed that US troops had deliberately shot the 11 people .
A spokesman for US forces in Iraq told the BBC an inquiry was under way .
The new evidence comes in the wake of the alleged massacre in Haditha , where US marines are suspected of killing up to 24 Iraqi civilians in November 2005 and covering up the deaths .
The incident is being investigated by the Pentagon .
The US military has announced that coalition troops in Iraq are to have ethical training following the furore surrounding the alleged killings .
For the next 30 days , they would receive lessons in " core warrior values " , a military statement said .
The news of ethical training for US - led troops is likely to be greeted with cynicism by many Iraqis , the BBC's Ian Pannell in Baghdad says , as the troops have long been accused of deliberately targeting civilians .
Cross-checked
The video pictures obtained by the BBC appear to contradict the US account of the events in Ishaqi , about 100 km ( 60 miles ) north of Baghdad , on 15 March 2006 .
The US authorities said they were involved in a firefight after a tip - off that an al - Qaeda supporter was visiting the house .
According to the Americans , the building collapsed under heavy fire killing four people - a suspect , two women and a child .
But a report filed by Iraqi police accused US troops of rounding up and deliberately shooting 11 people in the house , including five children and four women , before blowing up the building .
The video tape obtained by the BBC shows a number of dead adults and children at the site with what our world affairs editor John Simpson says were clearly gunshot wounds .
The pictures came from a hardline Sunni group opposed to coalition forces .
It has been cross-checked with other images taken at the time of events and is believed to be genuine , the BBC's Ian Pannell in Baghdad says .
It 's the radioactive potassium , dude !
A correspondent has informed me that my explanation of the snow - melting properties of salt is " wrong " .
I am torn between paraphrasing the argument , and quoting it verbatim , which may be a copyright violation and may be impolite .
But if I paraphrase , I am afraid you will inevitably conclude that I have misrepresented his thinking somehow .
Well , here is a brief quotation that summarizes the heart of the matter : Anyway the radioactive [ isotope of potassium ] emits energy ( heat ) which increases the rate of snow melt .
The correspondent informs me that this is taught in the MIT first - year inorganic chemistry class .
So what 's going on here ?
I picture a years - long conspiracy in the MIT chemistry department , sort of a gentle kind of hazing , in which the professors avow with straight faces that the snow - melting properties of rock salt are due to radioactive potassium , and generation after generation of credulous MIT freshmen nod studiously and write it into their notes .
I imagine the jokes that the grad students tell about other grad students : " Yeah , Bill here was so green when he first arrived that he still believed the thing about the radioactive potassium ! "
" I did not !
Shut up ! "
I picture papers , published on April 1 of every year , investigating the phenomenon further , and discoursing on the usefulness of radioactive potassium for smelting ores and frying fish .
Is my correspondent in on the joke , trying to sucker me , so that he can have a laugh about it with his chemistry buddies ?
Or is he an unwitting participant ?
Or perhaps there is no such conspiracy , the MIT inorganic chemistry department does not play this trick on their students , and my correspondent misunderstood something .
I do n't know .
Order
Ball Four
from Powell 's Ball Four in which the rules of baseball are going to be amended to increase the height of the pitcher 's mound .
It is generally agreed that this will give an advantage to the pitcher .
But one of the pitchers argues that raising the mound will actually disadvantage him , because it will position him farther from home plate .
You know , the great thing about this theory is that you can get the salt to melt the snow without even taking it out of the bag .
When you 're done , just pick up the bag again , put it back in the closet .
All those people who go to the store to buy extra salt are just a bunch of fools !
Well , it 's not enough just to scoff , and sometimes arguments from common sense can be mistaken .
So I thought I 'd do the calculation .
First we need to know how much radioactive potassium is in the rock salt .
I do n't know what fraction of a bag of rock salt is NaCl and what fraction is KCl , but it must be less than 10 % KCl , so let 's use that .
And it seems that about 0.012 % of naturally - occurring potassium is radioactive .
So in one kilogram of rock salt , we have about 100g KCl , of which about 0.012g is K40Cl .
Now let 's calculate how many K40 atoms there are .
KCl has an atomic weight around 75 .
( 40 for the potassium , 35 for the chlorine . )
Thus 6.022×1023 atoms of potassium plus that many atoms of chlorine will weigh around 75g .
So there are about 0.012 · 6.022×1023 / 75 = 9.6×1019 K40 - Cl pairs in our 0.012g sample , and about 9.6×1019 K40 atoms .
Now let 's calculate the rate of radioactive decay of K40 .
It has a half - life of 1.2×109 years .
This means that each atom has a ( 1/2 ) T probability of still being around after some time interval of length t , where T is t / 1.2×109 years .
Let 's get an hourly rate of decay by putting t = one hour , which gives T = 9.5×10 - 14 , and the probability of particular K40 atom decaying in any one - hour period is 6.7 × 10 - 14 .
Since there are 9.6×1019 K40 atoms in our 1kg sample , around 64,000 will decay each hour .
Now let 's calculate the energy released by the radioactive decay .
The disintegration energy of K40 is about 1.5 MeV .
Multiplying this by 64,000 gets us an energy output of 86.4 GeV per hour .
How much is 86.4 GeV ?
It 's about 3.4×10 - 9 calories .
That 's for a kilogram of salt , in an hour .
How big is it ?
Recall that one calorie is the amount of energy required to raise one gram of water one degree Celsius .
3.4×10 - 9 calorie is small .
Real small .
Note that the energy generated by gravity as the kilogram of rock salt falls one meter to the ground is 9.8 m/s2 · 1000g · 1 m = 9.8 joules = 2.3 calories .
You get on the order of 750 million times as much energy from dropping the salt as you do from an hour of radioactive decay .
But I think this theory still has some use .
For the rest of the month , I 'm going to explain all phenomena by reference to radioactive potassium .
Why did n't the upgrade of the mail server this morning go well ?
Because of the radioactive potassium .
Why did n't CVS check in my symbolic links correctly ?
It must have been the radioactive potassium .
Why does my article contain arithmetic errors ?
It 's the radioactive potassium , dude !
The nation that controls radioactive potassium controls the world ! [
An earlier version of this article said that the probability of a potassium atom decaying in 1 hour was 6.7 × 10 - 12 instead of 6.7 × 10 - 14 .
Thanks to Przemek Klosowski of the NIST center for neutron research for pointing out this error . ]

Blocks != Functional Programming
January 2 , 2007 at 6:27 pm
Joel Spolsky is one of my heroes .
He has a vast amount of insightful articles that rank among the clearest and most relevant software writing today , and his blog gets more hits in a day than mine ever will .
( Speaking of which , I hit 2000 visitors yesterday – around 10 x more than I ever thought I ’d get . )
He ’s a very smart cookie , and when he speaks , people listen .
But last week , while browsing the top Reddit articles of all time , I was surprised to see his article Can Your Programming Language Do This ? at # 4 .
While it ’s a good primer on Javascript abstraction , I do n’t think it deserves as many points as it recieved .
I spent the next few days thinking about why this article bothered me so much – Joel certainly did n’t say anything untrue , attack any favorite language of mine , or make some outlandish claim .
But then I realized that Joel ’s article fit together in a pattern of recent articles , all of which bothered me slightly .
Here ’s what I realized : it seems that every language under the sun is being evangelized as an excellent functional programming language simply because it supports a few paradigms from FP .
Or , restated : Anonymous functions do not a functional language make .
The most egregious example of a pundit claiming a language is functional when it ’s clearly not is Eric Kidd ’s well - known Why Ruby is an acceptable Lisp .
Kidd tells us explicitly that Ruby is a denser functional language than Lisp – and I ’ll be the first one to admit that if I were to debate the “ denser ” part of that sentence , I would n’t know what I was talking about .
But Ruby is not functional – Wikipedia calls it a reflective , object - oriented programming language , and I agree with them .
Yes , you can have block arguments to methods , continuations , generators , reflection , and metaprogramming – but it is n’t functional , for two reasons .
1 . It ’s hard to carry around functions as objects .
I really do n’t know why Ruby hates parentheses so much – it ’s probably part of its Perl heritage .
In Ruby , you can call methods without sticking superfluous parentheses in there – take a look at this Python code :
" I 'll write about Cocoa soon ; disaster struck the app I was writing " .strip ( ) .lower ( ) .split ( )
Now take a look at the equivalent Ruby code :
" Apple 's releasing a tool with XCode 3 which completely supersedes my Cocoa app - so I 'm very depressed right now " .strip.downcase.split
Though you could put parentheses in front of strip , downcase , and split , Ruby will work just fine without them .
Now , this feature makes for far fewer parentheses , thereby making code significantly more readable .
But what if I want a previously - declared function as an argument ?
If I type in the name , Ruby will just evaluate the function .
Sure , I could use the kludge that is Symbol . to_proc , but that ’s ugly – and it wraps the function inside a Proc object , which has to be called with the call ( * args ) method .
And that ’s just ugly .
In Python , all you need to do is type the function ’s name to use it as an object , and append a pair of parentheses if you need to call it .
2. Variables are .
A purely functional language only has immutable variables .
Ruby does n’t .
( Yes , I know LISP is n’t purely functional .
But it adheres to so many other FP paradigms that we can overlook that . )
But I ’m getting distracted , so I ’ll cut the above point short .
Anyway , what I wanted to say was this – just because your pet language has support for anonymous functions / closures does n’t make it a functional language .
Sure , Python has lambda and list comprehensions ( which are taken from Haskell , a purely functional language ) – but it ’s not functional , it ’s object - oriented .
Yes , Ruby has blocks ( even if you do have to wrap them in Procs ) , but it ’s not functional .
Javascript may have support for anonymous functions , but its syntax can be traced back to Algol and the birth of imperative programming language .
Hell , even Objective - C has blocks if you include the F - Script framework , and it ’s the farthest thing from functional there is .
In conclusion , do n’t say your language is a functional one just because you borrowed a few ideas from Lisp .
If you want a real functional language , try OCaml , Haskell , ML , or Scheme .
Calling imperative / OOP languages functional just makes the term meaningless .

Women protested outside parliament as the debate was held
Until now rape cases were dealt with in Sharia courts .
Victims had to have four male witnesses to the crime - if not they faced prosecution for adultery .
Now civil courts will be able to try rape cases , assuming the upper house and the president ratify the move .
The reform has been seen as a test of President Musharraf 's stated commitment to a moderate form of Islam .
" It is a historic bill because it will give rights to women and help end excesses against them , " Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz told parliament after the vote .
Religious parties boycotted the vote , saying the bill encouraged " free sex " .
' Lewdness '
A woman is raped every two hours and gang - raped every eight hours in Pakistan , according to the country 's independent Human Rights Commission .
The bill will turn Pakistan into a free - sex zone
MMA leader Maulana Fazlur Rahman
Rape victim's blog Send us your comments
Correspondents say these figures are probably an under-estimation as many rapes are not reported .
Campaigners say Pakistan 's laws have made it virtually impossible to prosecute rape .
Attempts to pass a new bill failed in September in the face of angry opposition .
The version of the Women 's Protection Bill put before legislators then caused such an outcry that parliament was prorogued .
It would have allowed alleged rapists to be tried under civil as well as Islamic law .
Gen Musharraf has said women need to be better protected
Human rights activists said this would have created confusion , allowing powerful religious lobbies to manipulate what is seen as a weak judicial system .
Now rape will be tried under civil law , the Pakistan Penal Code .
Sex outside marriage , which has always been illegal , will still be tried by both civil and Sharia courts , depending on which system the complainant chooses , the BBC's Syed Shoaib Hasan in Karachi says .
Pakistan 's religious parties called the new legislation " a harbinger of lewdness and indecency in the country " , and against the strictures of the Koran and Sharia law .
They have threatened nationwide protests over the revised bill .
Addressing parliament on Wednesday , the leader of the six - party MMA Islamic alliance , Maulana Fazlur Rahman , said the bill would " turn Pakistan into a free - sex zone " .
" Existing laws are correct and should be maintained ... The changes are not in line with Islamic teaching . "
The government insisted that some of the MMA 's proposals had been included in the bill .
Lashings
Rape and adultery in Pakistan are dealt with under the Hudood Ordinance , a controversial set of Islamic laws introduced from 1979 by Gen Zia -ul - Haq .
They include sections prescribing lashing and stoning as punishments for adultery .
The bill tabled in the summer and withdrawn was then reviewed by a panel of ulema , or Islamic scholars , who suggested three revisions .
There are so many uh “ professionals ” claiming that all Linden Lab does is incompetently handled and amateurish and that they do n’t know a thing about how to deliver updates , or maintain a grid , or develop software overall …
Well , I also claim my share of professionalism 😉
Yes , I ’ve worked for ISPs dealing with a few tens of thousands of simultaneous users — with far less servers than LL ’s 5000 virtual servers or so , though .
And yes , my application to work for LL was rejected , very likely because my 12 + years of experience running relatively complex network / server operations were not enough .
And they ’re right : SL is far more complex than anything I might have worked on 🙂
It shows , at least , that they ’re raising a very high threshold when accepting new people to work with them on the mission - critical issues .
Some recent comments on LL ’s blog are indeed naive and show a lack of understanding on how the grid operates .
Linden Lab does stress - testing .
They do have QA procedures — they used to be publicly available on their old wiki , and they even invited residents to suggest and implement new QA procedures ( there were not really many who raised to the occasion — and the ones that did , are very likely employees of LL these days ) .
They have a whole grid for public testing purposes .
They have at least another grid for internal testing purposes .
As anyone who has deployed very complex software knows , you can test as much as you want on “ controlled laboratory environments ” — even stress - test it to incredible levels — but there is no better test than “ the real thing ” .
It ’s the nature of so - called “ complex environments ” .
A computer programme running on a single computer on a single CPU with no other programme running at the same time can be analysed to extreme detail , and you can scientifically predict what its output will be given a certain input .
Do the same test under a multi- tasking system , and that prediction will be right most of the time — but sometimes it wo n’t .
Increase the complexity so that not only the system is multi-tasking , but it ’s a networked environment , and it will be even more hard to predict the outcome .
Now go towards the full scale of complexity : multi-tasking , multi-CPU , multiple nodes on the network , multiple virtual servers per physical server — and the “ predictions ” become chaotic .
In essence , what happens is it ’s easy to predict the weather inside your own living room ( just turn up the heat , and the room ’s temperature will rise uniformly ) but not on the whole of the Earth — a chaotic system which is not possible to analyse using a statistical method , and you do n’t know the variables to develop a chaotic model that replicates Earth ’s weather .
Now Second Life is , indeed , a chaotic system , with a limited predictability base .
Like a weather system , you can simulate it .
You can recreate a system that does not have 5000 sims but just 50 , and not 15,000 simultaneous users but at most 150 , and see how it behaves in a controlled environment .
LL even uses very old computers on the testing grids to make sure you can pinpoint algorithm errors ( ie. doing things far less efficiently than you could do in a fast system ) — it ’s an old trick of the trade .
However , a system 100 times bigger than the lab environment is not 100 times more complex — the relationships are exponential , not linear .
At a time there were just 20,000 accounts in the database , one could probably extrapolate the tests made on a smaller system by applying heuristics — “ if the real grid is 100 times bigger , this will be 100 times slower ” .
With 2 million accounts , things sadly do n’t work so well — a grid a 100 times as big as the testing environment might be a millions even a billion times more complex .
Exponentials kill almost all systems , and turn semi-predictable ones into chaotic ones .
That ’s the first issue : SL is complex .
Much more complex than people tend to think .
The second issue is simply a matter of “ time ” .
To reboot the whole grid needs 5 hours — you ca n’t “ cut ” time on that .
It ’s like a constant of the universe — and kudos to LL to make that “ constant ” , well , constant , during all these years that the grid grew exponentially .
So , to suggest that every day the grid should get updated during one hour is , sadly , technically not possible , and that “ demand ” comes mostly from people familiar with other MMORPGs , where there is usually a “ maintenance hour ” every day to reboot all servers .
Most MMORPGs have very simple back - end systems and the complexity is on the viewer .
Most of them also run on Windows servers ; stability on Windows platforms can be accomplished surprisingly by rebooting the servers often ( ie. once per day ) since it is a good way to deal with all the memory leaks inherent to that OS .
Linux or FreeBSD - based operating systems manage memory in a far different way ( I wo n’t say “ better ” since that would be a biased answer 🙂 ) and a “ maintenance reboot ” is really not required — it does neither help nor make things faster after a reboot .
It ’s just different , so rebooting Linux servers does not mean they ’ll be faster , or get suddenly rid of bugs , or perform better , whatever .
It ’s simply not the way they work — thus “ daily maintenances of one hour ” are sadly impossible to accomplish .
It will always take 5 hours .
And that ’s why LL does their upgrades at most once per week , usually once every other week .
Thirdly , being encouraged by the success of the Focus Beta Viewer , which allows client - side functionality to be experimented on the client side — but connecting it to the real grid , ie .
“ talking ” to the “ same ” servers that use the “ stable release ” — some people here are now advocating that Linden Lab should only do things that way : make all releases be tested on the main grid and never on any “ beta grids ” , so they could be tested in a real environment .
One forgets that almost all releases / patches / upgrades / versions — at least , 99 % of them — are not client - side issues !
As a matter of fact , almost all releases require both new client code and new server code .
There is a good reason for this — the “ Second Life Protocol ” , the communication layer that binds your client to the grid servers , is constantly evolving with every new release .
This means that former versions of the SL client will “ talk ” a slightly outdated version of the SL Protocol , which will simply not work any more .
However , when LL can cleverly deploy the SL viewer with only client - side modifications , you ’ll get one of those “ optional viewer download ” messages : this means that the version of the SL Protocol did not need any changes , and only the client was changed .
When you get a “ rolling server upgrade ” to fix things , the reverse is true : only the server needs a change , but the SL Protocol did n’t , so you can still use the same client for the new server version .
And , although this has n’t happened yet , I can assume that one day both will be done simultaneously : both a “ rolling upgrade ” under way and an “ optional client download ” for the ones wishing to use it .
The Focus Beta Viewer is , in essence , something like that — only client - side things have been changed , but the SL Protocol to talk to the servers is still exactly the same one ( of course , if the SL Protocol changes , LL has to release a new version of the Focus Beta Viewer as well ) .
However , most of the bug fixes and new features require changing all the three simultaneously : client server , and SL Protocol .
And that ’s what happens every other week or so when the grid needs to be shut down and relaunched ( taking 5 hours ) and everybody needs a new version of their client to communicate with the new server software on the grid .
Other games / platforms simply do n’t work that way .
Perhaps people are familiar with the Web , which exists since 1992 / 3 .
It also has a communications protocol : HTTP .
Since 1992 , there were only 3 versions of it available : 0.9 , 1.0 and 1.1 .
Most current browsers these days use 1.1 , but a few still use only 1.0 .
On the content side , we went from HTML 0.9 to describe pages to HTML 4.1 — four major versions in over a decade .
Second Life , by contrast , gets both a new version of the protocol every other week and a new description of the client viewer at about the same rate .
It ’s totally different , conceptually , from the way the Web works .
And , unlike SL , nobody needs to “ shut down the Web ” when Mozilla , Opera , or Microsoft launches a new browser — they ’re compatible with both the current version of HTTP and HTML … — in Second Life , things are simply not working like that .
One can , of course , argue about why Linden Lab did not use a more Web - based conceptual environment instead of their current approach .
Two things should be said at this point : first , they are , indeed , changing the way the SL Protocol works , towards an approach where there is not so much need to change the communications .
This would LL allow to do all server releases as rolling updates , as well as doing all client upgrades optional downloads .
I think this is their ultimate goal — even allowing people to use their own , favourite version of the client software ( LL - supported or third - party , either open source or commercial software ) .
This requires , however , changing all the SL Protocol — a daunting task of huge proportions , which has been hinted as being under way for around 18 months now .
Several parts of it are already changed — allegedly , since 1.9 I think , the servers already talk among themselves using a Web - based , version 2.0 of the SL Protocol .
I can only imagine that work is under progress to deploy the client - server communications to the same version as the one that is deployed “ under the hood ” .
But it ’ll take time .
The second point is that LL never really needed to think too much about this at the early stages of deployment , and from studying their SL Protocol it ’s quite clear that their first group of developers did come from games design in the late 1990s , where speed of communication on a local area network to ensure a quick response time was far more important than stability and compatibility across millions of users , dozens of thousands of those simultaneously , and thousands and thousands of servers .
They are n’t , however , crossing their arms and saying “ tough luck , this is what we have devised in the early 2000s , this is what you get … ” .
Rather , they ’re constantly rethinking the way they can “ migrate ” the conceptual framework of their original platform into a new framework which has totally different requirements and expectations , without too much mess .
You can imagine the analogy of having installed Windows 95 on your PC and having Microsoft constantly throwing patches at you so that at the end of the day you ’d have Vista installed .
Nobody in the software industry do things that way : at some point , you simply can’t patch something that was supposed to work well in 1995 and expect it to work on the computing environment of 2007 .
But that ’s what LL is doing with SL !
They have no choice — it ’s impossible to demand that people suddenly start from scratch on “ Second Life 2.0 ” , forfeiting all content — objects , avatars , scripts … — just because the things that LL can do in 2006 are way beyond the ones that were possible in 1999 .
Instead , they have a migration path — slowly introducing those changes that will become “ Second Life 2.0 ” without ever breaking anything done in the past .
Anyone having tried to install , say , a current version of the Windows X System over a Linux installation done in 1999 knows what I mean 🙂
It ’s possible , but be prepared — it ’s a nightmare taking weeks ( and at every point of the process you ’ll be wishing that you ’d be able to simply install a new copy of Linux instead ) .
One could also argue that what LL should be doing is to develop a parallel grid with 5000 servers running “ Second Life 2.0 ” ( which does n’t really exist ) and create a “ migration tool ” to upload all “ old 1.0 content ” and “ convert ” it to “ new 2.0 content ” .
I ’m not even claiming this is technically possible .
What I ’m sure of is that it ’s financially and resource - wise simply not possible — it means adequately testing hundreds of millions of assets and making sure that not a single one will break when updating .
We ’re not talking about a software product that has a few gigabytes of data stored in your disk .
We ’re talking about dozens of terabytes of shared content that needs to be changed !
If that does not impress you , it should .
IMHO , it ’s almost a fantastic miracle that during an upgrade just a negligible amount of data is “ lost ” when , say , converting databases from one asset server to another …
What could , indeed , be done , is something slightly different : not relying so much on a single , centralised server cluster to do all the “ tracking ” .
Right now , as I have patiently explained to some residents , this is the more economically sound alternative .
It would be very easy , for instance , to change the way objects are tracked by the asset server by relying not on the UUID , but a pair of ( sim server , UUID ) as identifiers .
What would this accomplish ?
Well , currently , assets are stored on the simulator server they were uploaded first , but the information on that storage is kept on the asset server .
Every time you need an asset on a different sim , all it takes is a request to the asset server to ask where the asset is , contact the sim where it was uploaded , and download it to you , while keeping a local cache at the sim you are .
But technically you could get rid of the central asset server by simply storing the ( server , UUID ) pair and have your client contact that server directly , and ( also ) store a local copy on the sim you are now .
There would be no need of keeping the expensive bottleneck called “ asset server cluster ” — which causes most of the issues you ’re familiar with with lost inventory , Search not working , unable to teleport , etc .
So why does LL use a centralised method ?
It ’s purely an engineering / financial decision .
It ’s far better and cheaper to maintain a centralised system than a fully distributed one .
Imagine the following example : you send a bug report to LL complaining that you have lost an object called “ My Nice Clothes ” —
A ) Today ’s system : “ Sure , we ’ll take a look at the central database and retrieve it for you .
There you are .
Sorry for the mess . ”
All the tech support has to do is look it up on the central asset cluster , see where a copy is found , and retrieve it from the backups .
B ) Decentralised system : “ Sure , do you know the server ’s name and the UUID of the object you ’ve lost ? ”
Well .
Under this model , naturally people have no idea on where the object was first uploaded .
So LL ’s tech support team would have to log in on all the 5000 servers separately , and search , one by one , to see where a copy is located .
This takes a huge amount of time , as you can imagine .
What will very likely happen in the future is a model with sub-grids , ie . , parts of the grid being controlled by their own “ local asset servers ” .
Assets would be identified by pairs of ( subgrid , UUID ) .
Immediate advantages :
LL could upgrade part of the grid while keeping the other parts down for maintenance .
The cool thing is that there would be “ no absolute downtime ” .
People would just have to jump from part of the grid to another part ( like during a rolling upgrade ) .
Sure , during the upgrade period , part of the assets would not be visible ( if they were on the “ other subgrid ” and not locally cached ) , but in most cases , most of the things would still work .
If currently there were four grids , for instance , you ’d have 75 % of all content always available — and probably more , due to local caching — and , the more important bit , you would always be able to log in
LL could abort an upgrade process mid-way .
Having 25 % of the grid to experiment with load is currently very likely to be enough to figure out what is going wrong after the upgrade was deployed .
They could just warn people to restrict themselves to the rest of the grid while they fix the problems on just the sub - grid under update .
Sure , 25 % of the users — who happen to have all their content on the sub - grid under upgrade — would still complain .
But they would , at least , be able to jump to the rest of the grid running the “ old version ” while the new one is tested .
It ’s a fairly good compromise .
This would naturally allow sims to be on geographically different co-location facilities .
Since we know that Linden Lab wants to do this , it would be one possible approach ( the much easier one would be to simply have the asset server cluster separated geographically , but it would always be a single grid nevertheless ) .
Looking up manually assets for a handful of sub - grid asset clusters takes not much longer than looking them up on a single asset cluster .
There is quite a difference in doing 4 queries for 4 subgrids than doing 5000 manual queries on a totally decentralised model .
What are the requirements for implementing this approach ?
Actually , not many .
LL is working on changing the way the objects are stored on the grid anyway — to allow for “ first use ” tags , or attachment of Creative Commons licenses — so they would just need to add a different way to reference assets , using a pair of keys instead of a UUID .
When “ migrating ” to a sub - gridded grid , objects would all be automatically “ updated ” to reflect this key pair instead , so that would be easy as well .
So , what would be the biggest issue then ( or : “ why has n’t anyone at LL done this before , if it ’s so good ? ” ) .
Mostly , LSL scripts .
There is no “ easy ” way to change millions of lines of code to deal with the notion that keys would now have to be differently expressed as pairs of info instead of single UUIDs .
This does n’t mean the task is impossible , just very hard to do .
A lot of scripts rely upon the fact that an UUID is really just a string , and lots of clever trickery is employed to make all LSL scripts “ backwards compatible ” .
It ’s not an impossible task — just a very , very hard one .
A little more on social networking sites
I think the social networking sites will face a day of reckoning in the not too distant future when it becomes obvious that their users do not respond to the ads .
A Jupiter analyst told me a few months ago that MySpace had some of the cheapest / least desirable real estate on the Web .
Investors take note .
In response to the Digg item this morning , a plugged - in friend who runs this spirited , sometimes goofy blog writes : Investors take note .
Social Networking Sites Fuel E-Commerce Traffic
by Mark Walsh , Thursday , Dec 7 , 2006 6:00 AM ET
SOCIAL NETWORKING SITES INCLUDING MYSPACE and Facebook are driving a bigger portion of traffic to retail sites than a year ago , according to new research by Hitwise .
Social sites are driving more than 6 % of retail traffic , up from 2.9 % in 2005 .
MySpace alone accounted for about one - third of that traffic .
The increase in retail traffic reflects social sites increasingly becoming a starting point for Web users .
" What we 're seeing is a trend among social networking sites , particularly MySpace , becoming a home base for Internet users , " said Bill Tancer , general manager of global research at Hitwise .
That trend in turn generates more traffic from social sites to online retailers .
Posted By : 1:23 PM
Those are interesting figures you cite from Hitwise , Iti , but I 'd like to know a bit more .
For example , which genres of Web sites are responsible for driving the remaining 94 percent ?
Or , more to the point : if you are part of the fastest growing segment of Web sites , would you be satisfied with single - digit traffic generation ?
Do n't get me wrong .
I find the growth of social media sites fascinating , and I believe there is more growth yet to come -- particularly overseas .
( Still , it must be noted , Facebook is a complete unknown entity outside of the U.S. , thus from this side of the Atlantic I find an $ 8 billion -- or 6 billion euro -- valuation little more than hot air . )
But as we learned in 1999 and 2000 , there 's a big difference between surging traffic and ad revenue potential .
Discussing pie - in - the - sky valuations publicly is dangerous territory , for all but the lucky few who can take the cash and run .
And , on a final point , I should elaborate on the Jupiter analysis cited earlier .
As of August , MySpace was carrying a CPM of 10 U.S. cents , primarily because there is such a vast ghetto of uninteresting user - generated pages that attract barely a blip of interest .

A Reuters photograph of smoke rising from buildings in Beirut has been withdrawn after coming under attack by American web logs .
The blogs accused Reuters of distorting the photograph to include more smoke and damage .
The photograph showed two very heavy plumes of black smoke billowing from buildings in Beirut after an Air Force attack on the Lebanese capital .
Reuters has since withdrawn the photograph from its website , along a message admitting that the image was distorted , and an apology to editors .
Reuters withdraws doctored image
In the message , Reuters said that " photo editing software was improperly used on this image .
A corrected version will immediately follow this advisory .
We are sorry for any inconvience . "
Ignored Israeli war deaths go largely unnoticed Yaakov Lappin Hours after mother and two daughters are killed in Hizbullah rocket attack , media outlets around world fail to report deaths ; meanwhile , British press continues anti-Israel tirade Israeli war deaths go largely unnoticed
Reuters ' head of PR Moira Whittle said in response : " Reuters has suspended a photographer until investigations are completed into changes made to a photograph showing smoke billowing from buildings following an air strike on Beirut .
Reuters takes such matters extremely seriously as it is strictly against company editorial policy to alter pictures . "
" As soon as the allegation came to light , the photograph , filed on Saturday 5 August , was removed from the file and a replacement , showing the same scene , was sent .
The explanation for the removal was the improper use of photo - editing software , " she added .
Earlier , Charles Johnson , of the Little Green Footballs blog , which has exposed a previous attempt at fraud by a major American news corporation , wrote : " This Reuters photograph shows blatant evidence of manipulation .
Notice the repeating patterns in the smoke ; this is almost certainly caused by using the Photoshop “ clone ” tool to add more smoke to the image . "
News version of photo ( Photo : Reuters )
Johnson added : " Smoke simply does not contain repeating symmetrical patterns like this , and you can see the repetition in both plumes of smoke .
There ’s really no question about it . "
Speaking to Ynetnews , Johnson said : " This has to cast doubt not only on the photographer who did the alterations , but on Reuters ' entire review process .
If they could let such an obvious fake get through to publication , how many more faked or ' enhanced ' photos have not been caught ? "
A series of close ups are then posted on the blog , showing that " it ’s not only the plumes of smoke that were ' enhanced . '
There are also cloned buildings . "
The close ups do appear to show exact replicas of buildings appearing next to one another in the photograph .
The Sports Shooter web forum , used by professional photographers , also examined the photo , with many users concluding that the image has been doctored .
Threat From Reuters Reuters employee issues ' Zionist pig ' death threat Yaakov Lappin Worker suspended after telling American blogger : ' I look forward to day when you pigs get your throats cut ' Reuters employee issues
' Looks so obviously doctored '
" I 'll second the cloned smoke ... but it looks so obvious that I do n't know how the photographer could have gotten away with it , " wrote one user .
After further research , Johnson posted a photograph he says is the original image taken before distortions were made , showing much lighter smoke rising .
Other blogs have also analyzed the photographs , and reached similar conclusions , such as Left & Right , which states : " The photo has been doctored , quite badly . "
The author of the Ace of Spades blog wrote : " Even I can see the very suspicious " clonings " of picture elements here .
And I 'm an idiot . "
The Hot Air blog also looked at the photo , describing the image as " the worst Photoshop I have ever seen . "
Adnan Hajj , the photographer who sent the altered image , was also the Reuters photographer behind many of the images from Qana – which have also been the subject of suspicions for being staged .
" A photographer who would blatantly falsify an entire ' news ' image would certainly not be above posing and staging photographs of rescue workers , " Johnson concluded .
I 'm a genius .
It makes me angry that this is n't more widely recognised .
I should be making millions from book deals and speaking engagements but that will come .
It 's all part of the master plan .
For now I have to convince people of my genius one by one at work and in slightly higher numbers via this blog .
The fact that my rantings on this blog probably convince an equal number of people I 'm insane is neither here nor there .
There a fine line between genius and insanity .
That 's my story and I 'm sticking to it .
Anyway , on to my latest evidence that I am in fact a genius .
At work yesterday I had a breakthrough with the age - old problem of IT workers , how do you explain IT requirements to non-IT people ?
My role as a Business Analyst ( BA ) means I have to document the requirements for IT projects which usually presents two challenges .
One is the actual discovery process – finding what the requirements actually are is harder than it sounds .
Everybody thinks they know what they want from an IT system but once you start to press them on the specifics they realise ( 9 times out of 10 ) they have n't thought it through very well .
The second issue is often simply convincing a business they need some sort of formal requirements gathering process .
This usually follows on closely from the " we know what we want " delusion .
I call it the " just do it " delusion – that might work as a slogan for a shoe company but it 's the equivalent of a suicide note for most IT projects .
At this point any proponents of XP / Agile development approaches will be calling me an old stick - in - the - mud .
Any reader who has no idea what XP / Agile development means can safely ignore that comment .
Proponents of XP / Agile methodologies are crazy people ( who nevertheless never respond to deliberate troll comments in blog posts ) .
So we had a team meeting yesterday to discuss our methodology , how to improve it and how to communicate the process to the business .
Our System Development Life Cycle ( SDLC ) involves defining scope first , then formalising the Business Requirements , then a Functional Specification then handing off to the development group .
One team member put forward how he had tried to describe the SDLC in architectural terms because he used to be an architect .
This did n't work because nobody else used to be an architect .
So we decided we needed a simpler analogy , how about describing it like a recipe ?
Why not indeed .
So I took that idea and ran with it .
Forget IT , we 're working on something else .
There 's a big party coming up and our project is to provide a chocolate cake .
The first step is to meet with the business and confirm the scope .
Do we have to do anything else for the party ?
Book a venue ?
Set up decorations ?
Bring beer and chips ?
No on all counts .
Our scope is confirmed : all we are providing is a chocolate cake .
Next we have to confirm the Business Requirements in some more detail .
What do they specifically want from the chocolate cake ?
Well , it has to be enough for 36 people .
Ken is allergic to nuts so make sure it does n't contain nuts .
Should it be a sponge cake or a mud cake ?
At this point we do n't worry about the details of the recipe ( that 's in the Functional Specification ) or the baking process ( that 's the Technical Specification ) , we just talk about the outcomes we want .
A mud cake that can feed 36 people and wo n't kill Ken because of his nut allergy .
Then comes finalising the recipe ( the Functional Specification ) .
This tells us everything that needs to happen to deliver on the business requirements ( the mud cake needs this much flour , this much cocoa etc. ) but does n't tell a baker what to do ( the IT development team write a Technical Specification – the equivalent of baking instructions ) .
If you 've ever worked on an IT project you 'll know one of your big enemies is " scope creep " .
This is when the business wants more and more features even when you have previously agreed on the limits of what you are doing .
This takes longer , costs more money and makes it more likely that something will go wrong .
So what happens when our chocolate cake project is chugging along and a manager sees a lifestyle program extolling the virtues of Moroccan chocolate ?
He decides the cake absolutely must be made with Moroccan chocolate and comes in the next day to insist the project plan is changed .
How do you deal with this ?
It depends how far the project has progressed when the manager starts pressing for Moroccan chocolate .
If this happens in your requirements stage , you 're in luck .
The manager declares the cake project will be a failure without this so , by definition , Moroccan chocolate is a core business requirement .
This may require some changes to your project plan .
Is Moroccan chocolate more expensive ?
If it is , that means either increasing the budget or cutting back somewhere else .
Can you get it locally or will someone have to fly to Morocco ?
Does cooking with Moroccan chocolate require special training ?
If so , do the skills already exist in - house or will an outside expert be required .
Time and money comes into it again .
The later the requirement for Moroccan chocolate is identified , the bigger the impact may be .
If you were already finalising your recipe ( Functional Specification ) , you need to change it .
If you want to keep track of why the project changed ( and it 's a big mistake not to ) you need to document this change request .
You can use this later to identify why it took longer and cost more .
The later you were in your project the more trouble you may have making the change .
If the bakers had already started they will have to throw out the work they 've done so far .
And if they do n't have Moroccan chocolate cooking expertise , well , the whole thing 's on hold until you find someone with the right experience .
In essence , you can always add Moroccan chocolate as a requirement , so long as the person asking for it appreciates the additional trouble , time and expense involved .
And this is harder to establish if you do n't document your scope , business requirements and functional specification .
And with that convoluted analogy we had had our solution .
Explain to the business : it 's all about the Moroccan chocolate .
Do you need it ?
Are you willing to accept increased time and expense ?
Can you see how bringing up these requirements later causes many more problems than bringing them up earlier ?
And the funny thing is the business understood what we were getting at .
It 's quickly becoming a catchphrase , if someone talks about a new or potentially difficult requirement the response is " Is that a Moroccan chocolate requirement ? "
And that 's how I spend the non -blog part of my day .
With Hezbollah ’s entry into the war between Israel and Hamas , Fourth Generation war has taken another developmental step forward .
For the first time , a non-state entity has gone to war with a state not by waging an insurgency against a state invader , but across an international boundary .
Again we see how those who define 4GW simply as insurgency are looking at only a small part of the picture .
I think the stakes in the Israel - Hezbollah - Hamas war are significantly higher than most observers understand .
If Hezbollah and Hamas win  and winning just means surviving , given that Israel ’s objective is to destroy both entities  a powerful state will have suffered a new kind of defeat , again , a defeat across at least one international boundary and maybe two , depending on how one defines Gaza ’s border .
The balance between states and 4GW forces will be altered worldwide , and not to a trivial degree .
So far , Hezbollah is winning .
As Arab states stood silent and helpless before Israel ’s assault on Hamas , another non-state entity , Hezbollah , intervened to relieve the siege of Gaza by opening a second front .
Its initial move , a brilliantly conducted raid that killed eight Israeli soldiers and captured two for the loss of one Hezbollah fighter , showed once again that Hezbollah can take on state armed forces on even terms ( the Chechens are the only other 4GW force to demonstrate that capability ) .
In both respects , the contrast with Arab states will be clear on the street , pushing the Arab and larger Islamic worlds further away from the state .
Hezbollah then pulled off two more firsts .
It responded effectively to terror bombing from the air , which states think is their monopoly , with rocket barrages that reached deep into Israel .
One can only imagine how this resonated worldwide with people who are often bombed but can never bomb back .
And , it attacked another state monopoly , navies , by hitting and disabling a blockading Israeli warship with something ( I question Israel ’s claim that the weapon was a C - 801 anti-ship missile , which should have sunk a small missile corvette ) .
Hezbollah ’s leadership has promised more such surprises .
In response , Israel has had to hit not Hezbollah but the state of Lebanon .
Israel ’s Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , referring to the initial Hezbollah raid , said , “ I want to make clear that the event this morning is not a terror act but the act of a sovereign state that attacked Israel without reason . ”
This is an obvious fiction , as the state of Lebanon had nothing to do with the raid and cannot control Hezbollah .
But it is a necessary fiction for Israel , because otherwise who can it respond against ?
Again we see the power 4GW entities obtain by hiding within states but not being a state .
What comes next ?
In the short run , the question may be which runs out first , Hezbollah ’s supply of rockets or the world ’s patience with Israel bombing the helpless state of Lebanon .
If the latter continues much longer , the Lebanese government may collapse , undoing one of America ’s few recent successes in the Islamic world .
The critical question is whether the current fighting spreads region - wide .
It is possible that Hezbollah attacked Israel not only to relieve the siege of Hamas in Gaza but also to preempt an Israeli strike on Iran .
The current Iranian government is not disposed to sit passively like Saddam and await an Israeli or American attack .
It may have given Hezbollah a green light in order to bog Israel down locally to the point where it would not also want war with Iran .
However , Israel ’s response may be exactly the opposite .
Olmert also said , “ Nothing will deter us , whatever far - reaching ramifications regarding our relations on the northern border and in the region there may be . ”
The phrase “ in the region ” could refer to Syria , Iran , or both .
If Israel does attack Iran , the “ summer of 1914 ” analogy may play itself out , catastrophically for the United States .
As I have warned many times , war with Iran ( Iran has publicly stated it would regard an Israeli attack as an attack by the U.S. also ) could easily cost America the army it now has deployed in Iraq .
It would almost certainly send shock waves through an already fragile world economy , potentially bringing that house of cards down .
A Bush administration that has sneered at “ stability ” could find out just how high the price of instability can be .
It is clear what Washington needs to do to try to prevent such an outcome : publicly distance the U.S. from Israel while privately informing Mr. Olmert that it will not tolerate an Israeli strike on Iran .
Unfortunately , Israel is to America what Serbia was to Russia in 1914 .
That may be the most disturbing aspect of the “ summer of 1914 ” analogy .

All my years in studying Urban Planning helped me grow a greater appreciation for the dense downtown skyline of the big city .
The downtown core of big cities across the Americas , Europe and Asia are the cultural pulse and economic engines of urban regions where millions of people live .
All urban " life " begins and ends , each day and night under the watch of the city 's tallest skyscrapers and most grand architectural structures .
So kick back and appreciate the view that they have to offer ... Hong Kong is number one on my list for many reasons : Hong Kong has a whopping 43 buildings over 200 metres tall , 30 of which were built in the year 2000 or later !!!
It also boasts four of the 15 tallest buildings in the world … that 's all in one city !
Hong Kong ’s skyline shows a large selection of distinct sky - reaching towers , with beautiful night lighting and reflection .
This city exemplifies the post - modern skyscraper and skyline .
Finally , the mountain backdrop makes this skyline ( as you can clearly see ) the greatest on the planet !
Chicago is the birthplace of the modern skyscraper .
When Chicago built its first steel high - rise in 1885 , it was not the tallest structure in the world but the first example of a new form of engineering that would change nearly every city on earth .
Chicago has 19 buildings over 200 metres tall ( three of which are among the top 20 tallest buildings in the world , including the tallest in North America ) .
Chicago has some of the finest mid-century architecture and examples of modern skyscrapers .
Not to be mistaken for a space station , Shanghai is a real city !
China 's biggest and most advanced city , Shanghai was said to be the most cosmopolitan city in the beginning of the 20th century , but lost its glory during the “ Mao era ” .
It is now quickly regaining its position as one of the biggest economic powerhouses in the world as well as a showcase of modern architecture .
In Shanghai you ’ll find 25 structures that are over 200 metres tall , one of which is the insanely tall , the 468 m downtown Oriental Pearl TV Tower .
New York City has one of the densest and most diverse skylines , with a huge collection of buildings and building styles .
Thanks to Hollywood ’s obsession with the city , it is also the most easily recognizable skyline in the world .
New York City has an amazing 47 buildings over 200 metres - the most in the world !
The four tallest buildings in NYC were all built in the early 1930s !
Home of the famous , now destroyed World Trade Center Towers , the Empire State building , the Statue of Liberty and the United Nations , New York City is the financial capital of the western world .
Upon the completion of the new " Freedom Tower " ( built on the old site of the World Trade Centers ) , it may rank higher in this list ( depending on how good it looks of course ) .
Tokyo is the world 's most populated city .
Its skyline has a number of unique characteristics that set it apart from other big city skylines , among them 15 structures at over 200 metres tall ( including the Tokyo Tower which changes colors every night ) .
But because of the density and vast size of the city , every corner appears to have its own skyline .
With the height restrictions and the required red lights that flash atop all mid to tall - sized buildings make the city look spectacular at night .
Tokyo is filled with neon lighting and unique , contemporary architecture , and like New York City is also often portrayed in movies for its aesthetic and eye - catching cityscapes .
Interesting fact :
Tokyo houses the world 's largest fleet of helicopters to get around town if traffic gets too crazy .
One of the best ( urban ) planned and cleanliest metropolitan cities in the world , Singapore looks like an architectural model city come to life .
The buildings cannot be higher than 280 metres due to air traffic control restrictions , but that has added a tall ( but not too tall ) and consistent building height and space pattern that makes this skyline unique :
Three buildings are exactly 280 metres tall and 5 others ( 8 total ) stand at just over 200 metres .
The buildings are mostly light - coloured and there is a large expanse of greenery dotted around the city core .
This South - Eastern city is definitely in a league of its own .
Toronto is a meeting place , a crossroads of many cultures and ethnicities .
Toronto is downtown Canada , the biggest city in the country with a skyline to match .
Toronto has 7 structures in its skyline that stand at over 200 metres , including the astonishingly tall 553 metre , CN Tower , which is often referred to as the tallest free - standing structure in the world .
While mostly untrue ( because there are taller TV masts in the world ) , the CN Tower possess the world 's highest observation deck , making this city 's skyline one of the most immediately identifiable .
This is probably the most impressive city worldwide that has less than 2 million residents .
Marvelous modern buildings reach the sky here , and while the skyline is not too dense , it does allow buildings to soar and stand out .
Kuala Lumpar has three of the 25 tallest buildings worldwide , including the tallest twin buildings , the Pretonos Towers ( which are arguably the second and third tallest overall in the world ) as well as the 420 metre Menara Kuala Lumpur Tower .
What was a tiny fishing village on the border of Hong Kong in 1970 is now a buzzing metropolis of over four million people .
With 13 buildings at over 200 meters tall , including the Shun Hing Square ( the 8th tallest building in the world ) , Shenzen is a marvel of lights after sunset .
You ca n’t help but ask yourself if you are in a video game or in a real city .
This city 's skyscrapers are divided into many clusters , spread amongst the main businesses and residential districts .
Most of the recent growth in Seoul 's skyline , however , has been of residential towers over 60 storeys high that are shooting up like blades of grass !
There are 10 buildings in Seoul over 200 meters tall and much of the mid-rise to high - rise structures are lined up in a linear fashion , creating a " wall " of buildings like no other .
Seoul is where the ancient Eastern world meets the modern West .
“ What building did you say they lived in ? ”
Finding it in the largest mass of condensed apartment buildings anywhere would be like finding a needle in a haystack .
Sao Paolo has a population of over 18 million people !
While the buildings are not super tall ( with only a single structure at over 200 meters tall ) this skyline is nevertheless stacked .
Sao Paolo has a fleet of over 500 helicopters , the second largest helicopter fleet in the world .
Australia ’s showcase city , Sydney has one of the most recognizable skylines due to its world - famous harbour , often referred to as the most beautiful natural harbour in the world .
The Sydney Harbour has many bays , inlets and secondary harbours .
It is spanned by the monumental Harbour Bridge , and the Opera House decorates the shoreline like a white flower .
The Sydney skyline is world - class with hundreds of skyscrapers in the central business district and many more high - rise buildings in the outlying neighbourhoods .
Sydney has 8 buildings over 200 metres tall .
Certainly one of Europe 's most interesting cities in terms of skylines , Frankfurt is home to five structures that are over 200 metres tall .
These modern skyscrapers are marvels compared to those other , mostly non-existent ones scattered across European cities .
The contrast here is interesting :
The city combines low - rise , high - density traditional European architecture ( some of which is over 1,000 years old ) , with modern towers that stick out like sore thumbs , but are impressive nonetheless .
Is this a mirage in the Middle East ?
Seemingly out of nowhere emerges a city in the middle of a desert .
This is Dubai , a city that produces only the best modern architecture in the world .
Already home of the world 's tallest all - hotel building and the tallest all - residential building in the world , AND currently proposed to build the world 's tallest building , this skyline might just leap to the number 1 spot in the near future .
While the skyline is not so dense , each building is a marvel all on its own .
As a skyline it probably can't compete with the larger cities , however the individual buildings in this city are by far the greatest examples of modern architectural accomplishments .
All seven structures in this city at over 200 metres tall were built in 1999 or later - that 's how new this city is .
Seattle is the commercial , cultural and advanced technology hub of the Northwest USA and a major port city for Pacific and European trade .
Home 4 buildings over 200 m and the famous 184 m Space Needle observation tower , Seattle is surrounded by mountains and water and offers some picture - perfect views .
Seattle is commonly referred to as the Emerald City and renowned as a great social and corporate city with great planning and planning .
Although Pittsburgh only has two buildings over 200 m tall , its skyline is very impressive nonetheless .
Pittsburgh has nicknames like the " city of bridges " , " the Burgh " or the " golden triangle " which outlines its true characteristics .
It is surround by three rivers and the CBD is shaped in a triangle and surrounded by golden color bridges .
The city is also surrounded by hills and valley 's giving access to great views of the city .
The city has not had a major skyscraper raised since 1988 , but good planning and a scenic surrounding region still makes it a great skyline .
Guangzhou is a very modern city , yet it is called " the City of Flowers , ” as each of its spectacular skyscrapers is surrounded by grand green spaces and flower beds .
Although it only has six structures at over 200 metres tall , there are plenty of other high - rises , each displaying a design that stands out in its own respect .
This includes the 391 metre , 80 - floor , CITIC Plaza which appears transparent against the ( usually ) clear blue sky !
The " Big D " , is a major inland American city .
The city and metropolitan area lies amidst vast , high , and varying rolling prairies - with hundreds of large & small lakes , rivers , creeks , waterways and meanders .
But Dallas ; downtown is the center of the Forth - Worth - Dallas Metro Region which is home to 5.9 million people .
Dallas ' skyline is home to 7 buildings over 200 meters and the 187 m Reunion Tower which looks like huge sphere of light !
The skyline is very distinctive at night as it building lighting is very colorful , particularly with lots of green .

Walk on water
There 's an astonishing art installation right now in London , called Bridge .
Michael Cross took a former church and flooded it with water .
Sunk beneath the water , a series of stepping stones .
Stand at the water 's edge and the first stone rises up out of the depths .
Step on that first stone , and the next stone slowly surfaces , one step ahead .
Step forward again , and another stone rises up in front of you , while the stone behind sinks away again .
It takes 30 steps to make it out to the middle of the lake within the church , another 30 steps to go back the way you came .
Visitors to Bridge ( which is part of the London Design Festival ) say that participants have widely varying reactions .
Some think it 's a wonderful experience , others find the whole thing terrifying .
Personally , I do n't know if I 'd try it .
But I sure would love to see it .

What drove me to check out this link was the Indiana Jones movie where Jones is stepping out over a deep cavern in an attempt to get to the other side .
With each step ( as he took the step ) a new step appeared .
I watched that scene in total fascination because I realized ( like Wayne ) that that was how God expects us to walk ; taking each step in our walk of faith , anticipating that God will provided and take care of us .
I remember crying because it was so powerful a moment for me .
In all honesty , I do n't walk that way .
I do n't know if I 'd call the exhibition " art " , but it is very interesting .

churches are just like any other room .
you christians might as well have your " mass " or " ceremony " or whatever you idiots call it in a basement or a bed room .

I could visualize static stones all visible above the waterline , but arranged by design to artsy dynamism ; into the realm of , say , the Zen Garden , cutting across religious clubs into the universality of faith .
It is to me more blasphemous to put faith into any structured religious form of worship .
The church , abandoned , is SO APT .
Posted by : peter kou at November 15 , 2006 09:30 AM
I reckon it's a great modern day example of an instruction from Jesus that ( to my knowledge ) was a lesson for us all ; Peter just happened to be the character that we learned it from !
Jesus would say to each of us , ' You of little faith .
Why did you doubt ?'
Does anyone know if the account of Matthew 14:22 - 33 is discussed at all at the display ?
As for flooding the Church beng blasphemous , I am reminded of Jesus ' instruction to the disciples when He tells them to not hinder other people preaching the word ( Luke 9:49 - 50 ) .
They were n't preaching in the traditional sense , but they were preaching .
God Himself gives us the ' okay ' to step and think outside the box .
This is a form of preaching , and the " Church " is merely a building .
PEOPLE make a church , not bricks and mortar .

Not that Mr. Bush is immune from national political trends even among the most faithful .
A poll released in May by SurveyUSA , conducted in Utah for KSL - TV , found that 51 percent of respondents approved of the job Mr. Bush was doing , with 46 percent disapproving .
The margin of error was plus or minus four percentage points .
The firm , through its other polling , found that the only other state above 50 percent was Idaho , at 52 ; in Wyoming , it was 50 percent .
Mr. Bush 's approval rating has dropped as low as 23 percent in Rhode Island and New York .
In Utah , Mr. Bush took 72 percent of the presidential vote in 2004 .
His support has dropped since then , according to polls , because many conservatives are upset over immigration and , to a lesser extent , the expansion of the federal government .
" When you get down to almost 50 percent in Utah , that 's the canary - in - the - mine - shaft of all warnings for Republicans , " said Kelly Patterson , director of the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young .
The walls of Mr. Patterson 's office bear a headline from the last time a Democrat won Utah in a presidential race — it was Lyndon B. Johnson , in 1964 .
Frontiers are always fraught with danger , romance , utopian flights of fancy , and no small amount of madness .
When Peter Sugarman and I first began talking about creating the Beyond Cyberpunk !
HyperCard stack in 1990 , the frontier towns of cyberspace were tiny outposts and the populace was a rough and tumble crowd of hackers , research scientists , libertarians , academics , military types , and various flavors of bohemians .
It was a time of great excitement and hyperactivity .
Cyberpunk science fiction was still a major inspiration to the advance teams building cyberspace , Mondo 2000 was the hip new magazine and the hacker community was still licking its wounds after Operation Sundevil / The Hacker Crackdown .
Academia had discovered in the burgeoning cyberculture a full - blown example of postmodernism , with its decentralized , anarchic structure , its virtualizing of the human body , and its use of multimedia and hypertexts to socially construct stories and knowledge .
Social scientists like Donna Haraway began using the idea of the cyborg as a useful metaphor for describing the human / machine hybrids we'd become in the twilight hours of the 20th century .
When we began Beyond Cyberpunk ! ( BCP ) , there was no such thing as the World Wide Web .
Hypermedia programs like Apple 's HyperCard were the only way to inexpensively deliver hypertext with linked sounds , images , and animation .
We saw in HyperCard the opportunity to create a compendium of all this cybercultural output .
We wanted to map the territory , but to do so in a way that allowed the user to explore her own links and interests .
We tried to cram in as much material as we could , covering everthing from high - brow crit theory to sci - fi lit and films to the wired worlds of hackers / crackers and the zine publishing scene which was starting to move into cyberspace .
The result was a 5.5 megabyte " connect - the - dots " cyber - manifesto .
In 1993 , we followed up the first BCP stack with a one - disk update .
Since doing the BCP project , the online world and the cyberculture have reinvented themselves several times over .
What you 're reading here is an artifact from a future past .
Some of the material holds up , some of it is down - right prescient .
Other parts make us cringe , and it's all we can do not edit out the embarassingly dated ( or poorly - written ) parts .

An invited talk given at Second International Mozart / Oz Conference Common programming practice grants excess authority for the sake of functionality ; programming principles require least authority for the sake of security .
If we practice our principles , we could have both security and functionality .
Treating security as a separate concern has not succeeded in bridging the gap between principle and practice , because it operates without knowledge of what constitutes least authority .
Only when requests are made -- whether by humans acting through a user interface , or by one object invoking another -- can we determine how much authority is adequate .
Without this knowledge , we must provide programs with enough authority to do anything they might be requested to do .
We examine the practice of least authority at four major layers of abstraction -- from humans in an organization down to individual objects within a programming language .
We explain the special role of object - capability languages -- such as E or the proposed Oz - E -- in supporting practical least authority .

Editors Note :
As the United States heads toward a pivotal election on Nov. 7 , both Republicans and Democrats are worried about the prospect of an  October Surprise that could alter the political dynamic in the next two weeks .
Though last - minute campaign surprises are probably as old as democracy itself , the phrase in its modern usage dates back just over a quarter century to 1980 when President Jimmy Carter was seeking the freedom of 52 American hostages in Iran .
Then - vice presidential candidate George H.W. Bush fretted publicly that a hostage release might be an  October Surprise that would catapult Carter to reelection .
Ironically , however , the 1980  October Surprise controversy came to refer to an alleged dirty trick by Bush and other Republicans that thwarted Carter from gaining the hostages freedom .
Carters failure propelled Ronald Reagan and George Bush Sr. to a landslide victory .
Arguably , the  October Surprise of 1980 ushered in the modern era of GOP dominance , with the 12 years of the Reagan - Bush administrations .
Arguably , too , the Democrats failure in December 1992 to get the truth out about the Republican chicanery set the stage for the Rights congressional resurgence in 1994 and for todays George W. Bush Era .
So , given the importance of the 1980 election in shaping todays political terrain  and given the current interest in what might happen in the days ahead  we are publishing a series about the original October Surprise adapted from Robert Parrys Secrecy & Privilege : Rise of the Bush Dynasty from Watergate to Iraq :
History turned in December 1992 when the truth about what happened in the pivotal 1980 presidential election might finally have been revealed to the American people .
Just a month after Bill Clinton defeated George H.W. Bush , the dam that had held back the 12 - year - old secrets finally gave way .
An investigative House Task Force was putting the finishing touches on a report intended to debunk the longstanding October Surprise allegations of Republican interference with the Iranian hostage crisis in 1980 .
The bipartisan Task Force planned to treat the story as a conspiracy theory run wild .
But suddenly the Task Force found itself inundated by a flood of new evidence going the other way , indicating that the long - whispered suspicions of a grotesque Republican dirty trick a dozen years earlier were true .
Task Force chief counsel Lawrence Barcella , who had been onboard for the debunking , was stunned by the late surge of new evidence .
He concluded that it couldnt be ignored and that it justified extending the investigation at least a few more months .
Years later , Barcella told me that he recommended a three - month extension to the Task Force chairman , Rep. Lee Hamilton , but the Indiana Democrat rejected the idea of taking the extra time to check out the new evidence .
An extension would have required getting approval from the new Congress being seated in 1993 .
Plus , Hamilton , who was about to ascend to the chairmanship of the House International Affairs Committee , had other priorities .
He treasured perhaps more than anything his reputation as a respected centrist figure in a capital city torn by partisanship .
Hamilton , with his no -nonsense butch haircut and home - spun eloquence , was a candidate for one of Washingtons highest unofficial honors , the title of Wise Man .
Indeed , Hamiltons passion for bipartisanship had made him the Democrat that the Republicans most wanted to run an investigation into Republican wrongdoing .
When Hamilton was chosen in late 1991 to chair the October Surprise Task Force , Republicans hailed his selection .
Hamilton then selected investigators who werent inclined to press too hard , even as Hamiltons GOP counterpart , Rep. Henry Hyde , staffed his side with tough - minded partisans .
At one point , in a gesture of bipartisanship , Hamilton even granted Republicans veto power over the choice of a Democratic staff investigator .
Hyde exercised this extraordinary offer by blocking the appointment of House International Affairs Committee chief counsel Spencer Oliver because Oliver suspected the October Surprise allegations might just be true .
Debunking Bias
So , as the investigation proceeded in 1992 , there was a powerful inclination inside the Task Force to dismiss the allegations that had dribbled out over the years , depicting a kind of a prequel to the Iran - Contra scandal , which broke in 1986 with disclosures of other secret arms - for - hostages deals between the Reagan administration and Irans radical Islamic government .
Despite exposure of the lies that had surrounded the Iran - Contra Affair , Hamiltons Task Force didnt want to believe that George H.W. Bush and other Republicans had begun those contacts six years earlier by undercutting President Jimmy Carters negotiations to free 52 Americans held hostage in Iran in 1980 .
By the early 1990s , the climate in Washington also was extremely hostile to the 1980 October Surprise allegations .
They had been denounced by Republicans and attacked by influential journals , such as the neoconservative New Republic .
The very idea that then - President Bush would have exploited the national humiliation of that earlier hostage crisis for political gain was unthinkable to many Washington insiders .
Plus , in December 1992 , after Clinton had defeated George Bush Sr. , the Democrats saw little reason to pursue divisive allegations dating back a dozen years that also would tarnish the legacy of the well - liked Ronald Reagan .
It was feared , too , that exposing these old crimes might engender more partisan bitterness and poison the political climate as a new President , Bill Clinton , was taking office .
At that naïve moment  14 years ago 
Democrats felt it made sense to bargain away a few seemingly unimportant historical facts for a chance at better cooperation with Republicans on domestic issues that Clinton held dear , like the budget and health care .
The House October Surprise Task Force , therefore , turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to the late - arriving evidence that tended to corroborate the October Surprise allegations , which had emerged over the years from a variety of intelligence operatives and foreign officials .
But in late 1992 , the newly arriving evidence left chief counsel Barcella not entirely comfortable with a definitive conclusion rejecting the October Surprise allegations .
On Dec. 8 , 1992 , he instructed his deputies to put some language in , as a trap door in case later disclosures disproved parts of the report or if complaints arose about selective omission of evidence .
 This report does not and could not reflect every single lead that was investigated , every single phone call that was made , every single contact that was established ,  Barcella suggested as trap door wording .
 Similarly , the Task Force did not resolve every single one of the scores of curiosities ,  coincidences ,  sub-allegations or question marks that have been raised over the years and become part of the October Surprise story . 
But some of the information that would arrive during the investigations final month would deal not just with curiosities ,  but with central questions behind the mystery of why the American hostages were freed immediately after Reagan and Bush were sworn in on Jan. 20 , 1981 .
Iranian Testimony
On Dec. 17 , 1992 , former Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr sent a letter describing the internal battles of the Iranian government over the Republican intervention in the 1980 hostage crisis .
Bani -Sadr recounted how he threatened to expose the secret deal between Reagan - Bush campaign officials and Islamic radicals close to Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini if it werent stopped .
Bani-Sadr said he first learned of the Republican secret deal with Iranian radicals in July 1980 after Reza Passendideh , a nephew of Ayatollah Khomeini , attended a meeting with Iranian financier Cyrus Hashemi and Republican lawyer Stanley Pottinger in Madrid on July 2 , 1980 .
Though Passendideh was expected to return with a proposal from the Carter administration , Bani -Sadr said Passendideh instead carried a plan from the Reagan camp . 
 Passendideh told me that if I do not accept this proposal , they [ the Republicans ] would make the same offer to my [ radical Iranian ] rivals .
He further said that they [ the Republicans ] have enormous influence in the CIA ,  Bani -Sadr wrote .
 Lastly , he told me my refusal of their offer would result in my elimination . 
Bani-Sadr said he resisted the threats and sought an immediate release of the American hostages , but it was clear to him that the wily Khomeini was playing both sides of the U.S. political street .
This secret Republican plan to block release of the hostages until after the U.S. elections remained a point of tension between Bani-Sadr and Khomeini , according to Bani -Sadrs letter .
Bani -Sadr said his trump card was a threat to tell the Iranian people about the secret deal that the Khomeini forces had struck with the Republicans .
 On Sept. 8 , 1980 , I invited the people of Teheran to gather in Martyrs Square so that I can tell them the truth ,  Bani -Sadr wrote .
 Khomeini insisted that I must not do so at this time .
...
Two days later , again , I decided to expose everything .
Ahmad Khomeini [ the ayatollahs son ] came to see me and told me ,  Imam [ Khomeini ] absolutely promises to reopen talks with Carter if Bani - Sadr would relent and not go public .
Bani-Sadr said the dispute led Khomeini to pass on a new hostage proposal to the U.S. government through his son- in - law , Sadegh Tabatabai .
Though Tabatabai did deliver a new peace plan to U.S. officials in West Germany , the initiative unraveled when Iraqs Saddam Hussein invaded Iran in mid-September 1980 .
Meanwhile , high - level contacts between Republicans and Khomeini representatives allegedly continued , often using Israeli and European intelligence operatives as the intermediaries .
On the outs with Khomeini , Bani - Sadr saw his political position deteriorate and he was soon forced to flee into exile .
Bani-Sadrs detailed account meshed with previous statements made by two other senior Iranian officials , former Defense Minister Ahmad Madani and the former acting Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh .
Madani had lost to Bani -Sadr in the 1980 presidential race despite covert CIA assistance funneled to his campaign through Cyrus Hashemi .
Madani also discovered that Hashemi was double - dealing with the Republicans .
In an interview with PBS Frontline in the early 1990s , Madani said Hashemi brought up the name of Reagans campaign chief William Casey in connection with these back - channel negotiations over the U.S. hostages .
Madani said Hashemi had urged Madani to meet with Casey , earning a rebuke from Madani that we are not here to play politics . 
Ghotbzadeh made his comments about the Republican interference contemporaneously to the events , telling Agence France Press on Sept. 6 , 1980 , that he had information that Reagan was trying to block a solution to the hostage impasse .
( Ghotbzadeh was later executed by Iranian hardliners . )
Despite Bani-Sadrs claims of first - hand knowledge and these corroborating statements by two other senior Iranian officials , the House Task Force dismissed Bani-Sadrs account as hearsay that lacked probative value .
French Account
Soon , however , there was more evidence to explain away .
On Dec. 18 , 1992 , a day after Bani-Sadrs letter , David Andelman , the biographer of French intelligence chief Alexandre deMarenches , gave sworn testimony to the Task Force about the Republican - Iranian contacts .
Andelman , an ex-New York Times and CBS News correspondent , said that while he ghost - wrote deMarenchess biography , the arch - conservative spymaster admitted arranging meetings between Republicans and Iranians about the hostage issue in the summer and fall of 1980 , with one meeting held in Paris in October .
Andelman said deMarenches ordered that the secret meetings be kept out of his memoirs because the story could otherwise damage the reputation of his friends , William Casey and George H.W. Bush .
At the time of Andelmans work on the book , Bush was running for re-election as President of the United States .
Andelmans testimony corroborated longstanding claims from a variety of international intelligence operatives about a Paris meeting involving Casey and Bush .
But the Task Force brushed this testimony aside , too , paradoxically terming it credible  but then claiming it was insufficiently probative . 
The Task Forces reasoning went that Andelman could not rule out the possibility that deMarenches had told him he was aware of and involved in the Casey meetings because he , deMarenches , could not risk telling his biographer he had no knowledge of these allegations . 
Yet , besides corroborative testimony from intelligence operatives , including Israeli intelligence officer Ari Ben-Menashe , the Task Force was aware of contemporaneous knowledge of the alleged Bush - to - Paris trip by Chicago Tribune reporter John Maclean .
Maclean , the son of author Norman Maclean who wrote A River Runs Through It , said a well - placed Republican source told him in mid-October 1980 about Bushs secret trip to Paris to meet with Iranians on the U.S. hostage issue .
Maclean passed on that information to David Henderson , a State Department Foreign Service officer .
Henderson recalled the date as Oct. 18 , 1980 , when the two met at Hendersons Washington home to discuss another matter , the Carter administrations handling of Cuban refugees who had been arriving in the Mariel boat lift .
For his part , Maclean never wrote about the Bush - to - Paris leak because , he told me later , a Reagan - Bush campaign spokesman subsequently denied it .
As the years passed , the memory of the leak faded for both Henderson and Maclean , until the October Surprise allegations bubbled to the surface again in the early 1990s .
Henderson mentioned the meeting in a 1991 letter to a U.S. senator that was forwarded to me while I was working for PBS Frontline .
In the letter , Henderson recalled the conversation about Bushs trip to Paris but not the name of the reporter .
A Frontline producer searched some newspaper archives to find a story about Henderson and the Mariel boat lift as a way to identify Maclean as the journalist who had interviewed Henderson .
Though not eager to become part of the October Surprise story in 1991 , Maclean confirmed that he had received the Republican leak .
He also agreed with Hendersons recollection that their conversation occurred on or about Oct. 18 , 1980 .
But Maclean still declined to identify his source .
The significance of the Maclean - Henderson conversation was that it was a piece of information locked in a kind of historical amber , untainted by subsequent claims by intelligence operatives whose credibility had been challenged .
One could not accuse Maclean of concocting the Bush - to - Paris allegation for some ulterior motive , since he hadnt used it in 1980 , nor had he volunteered it a decade later .
He only confirmed it when approached by Frontline and even then wasnt particularly eager to talk about it .
State of Denial
Despite the mounting evidence that the Republicans indeed had made secret contacts with Iranian radicals in 1980 , the House Task Force kept refusing to rethink its conclusions or to extend its investigation .
For its debunking , the Task Force relied on supposed alibis for Casey and Bush , but the investigators knew how shaky and uncorroborated those alibis were .
Meanwhile , the incriminating evidence kept on coming .
On Dec. 21 , 1992 , former CIA officer Charles Cogan recounted a remark in early 1981 from banker David Rockefellers aide Joseph Reed to then - CIA Director William Casey about their success in blocking Carters  October Surprise . 
Reed had been Rockefellers point man in helping the Shah of Iran after his 1979 ouster , which led the Khomeini regime to seek the withdrawal of billions of dollars from the Shahs accounts at Rockefellers Chase Manhattan Bank .
Ironically , the Iranian hostage crisis worked to the banks advantage because the U.S. government  as retaliation for the hostage - taking  froze those accounts .
If the crisis were resolved quickly and the money suddenly unfrozen , Chase Manhattans financial viability would be put in doubt .
After Reagan and Bush took office  and the Chase accounts remained frozen 
Reed was appointed ambassador to Morocco , which led him to visit Casey at CIA headquarters , as Cogan lingered at the door to Caseys office .
 Joseph Reed said , we and then the verb [ and then ] something about Carters October Surprise ,  Cogan testified in a secret deposition .
 The implication was we did something about Carters October Surprise . 
Task Force investigators understood the full quote to have been ,  We fucked Carters October Surprise ,  a claim that was at the heart of what the Task Force was assigned to investigate .
But the Task Force left Cogans recollection out of its report altogether .
The pattern of the Task Forces selective judgments began to grate on some of the Democratic congressmen assigned to the investigation .
Though the October Surprise allegations supposedly were a myth , the information developed by the Task Force staff was kept under tight security .
Congressmen were only allowed to review the evidence in a secure room under guard .
The restrictions meant that many members were forced to rely on the Task Force staff that had been assembled largely by excluding anyone who thought the allegations might actually be true .
On Jan. 3 , 1993 , Congressman Mervyn Dymally , a California Democrat and Task Force member , submitted a dissent to the impending Task Force debunking of the October Surprise allegations .
Dymally s dissent complained about selective handling of evidence to clear the Reagan - Bush campaign .
Dymally , who was retiring from Congress , cited the investigations reliance on shaky circumstantial data for exonerating the Republicans and the uncritical acceptance of accounts from Caseys associates .
In reviewing the Task Force report , Dymally s staff aide , Marwan Burgan , quickly spotted some of the reports absurd alibis , including the claim that because someone wrote down Caseys home phone number on one day that proved Casey was home , or that because a plane flew from San Francisco directly to London on another important date that Casey must have been onboard .
Sources who saw Dymallys dissent said it argued that just because phones ring and planes fly doesnt mean that someone is there to answer the phone or is on the plane .
But Dymally s reasonable observations were fiercely opposed by Barcella , who enlisted Task Force chairman , Lee Hamilton , to pressure Dymally into withdrawing the dissent .
Dymally told me that the day his dissent was submitted , he received a call from Hamilton warning him that if the dissent was not withdrawn ,  I will have to come down hard on you . 
The next day , Hamilton , who was becoming chairman of the House International Affairs Committee , fired the staff of the Africa subcommittee that Dymally had headed .
The firings were billed as routine , and Hamilton told me that  the two things came along at the same time , but they were not connected in my mind . 
Hamilton said his warning to Dymally referred to a toughly worded response that Hamilton would have fired off at Dymally if the dissent had stood .
However , hoping to salvage the jobs of some of his staff , Dymally agreed to withdraw the dissent .
Russian Complication
So the House Task Forces report was shipped off to the printers with its conclusion that there was no credible evidence of Republican double - dealing with Iran over the 52 U.S. hostages in 1980 .
The report was scheduled for release on Jan. 13 , 1993 , just one week before George H.W. Bushs Presidency officially would come to an end .
But there was still one more surprise for the October Surprise Task Force .
On Jan. 11 , 1993 , Hamilton received a response to a query he had sent to the Russian government on Oct. 21 , 1992 , requesting any information that Moscow might have about the October Surprise case .
The Russian response came from Sergey V. Stepashin , chairman of the Supreme Soviets Committee on Defense and Security Issues , a job roughly equivalent to chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee .
In what might have been an unprecedented act of cooperation between the two longtime enemies , Stepashin provided a summary of what Russian intelligence files showed about the October Surprise charges and other secret U.S. dealings with Iran .
In the 1980s , after all , the Soviet KGB was not without its own sources on a topic as important to Moscow as developments in neighboring Iran .
The KGB had penetrated or maintained close relations with many of the intelligence services linked to the October Surprise allegations , including those of France , Spain , Germany , Iran and Israel .
History had shown , too , that the KGB had spies inside the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies .
So , Soviet intelligence certainly was in a position to know a great deal about what had or had not happened in 1980 .
The Supreme Soviets response was delivered to the U.S. Embassy in Moscow by Nikolay Kuznetsov , secretary of the subcommittee on state security .
Kuznetsov apologized for the lengthy preparation of the response .
It was quickly translated by the U.S. embassy and forwarded to Hamilton .
To the shock of the Task Force , the six - page Russian report stated , as fact , that Casey , Bush , CIA officials and other Republicans had met secretly with Iranian officials in Europe during the 1980 presidential campaign .
The Russians depicted the hostage negotiations that year as a two - way competition between the Carter White House and the Reagan - Bush campaign to outbid one another for Irans cooperation on the hostages .
The Russians asserted that the Reagan - Bush team indeed had disrupted Carters hostage negotiations , the exact opposite of the Task Forces conclusion .
As described by the Russians , the Carter administration offered the Iranians supplies of arms and unfreezing of assets for a pre-election release of the hostages .
One important meeting occurred in Athens in July 1980 with Pentagon representatives agreeing in principle to deliver a significant quantity of spare parts for F - 4 and F - 5 aircraft and also M - 60 tanks ... via Turkey ,  the Russian report said .
The Iranians discussed a possible step - by - step normalization of Iranian - American relations [ and ] the provision of support for President Carter in the election campaign via the release of American hostages . 
But the Republicans were making their own overtures to the Iranians , also in Europe , the Russian report said .
 William Casey , in 1980 , met three times with representatives of the Iranian leadership ,  the report said .
 The meetings took place in Madrid and Paris . 
At the Paris meeting in October 1980 ,  R[ obert ] Gates , at that time a staffer of the National Security Council in the administration of Jimmy Carter and former CIA Director George Bush also took part ,  the Russian report said .
 In Madrid and Paris , the representatives of Ronald Reagan and the Iranian leadership discussed the question of possibly delaying the release of 52 hostages from the staff of the U.S. Embassy in Teheran . 
Both the Reagan - Bush Republicans and the Carter Democrats started from the proposition that Imam Khomeini , having announced a policy of neither the West nor the East ,  and cursing the American devil ,  imperialism and Zionism , was forced to acquire American weapons , spares and military supplies by any and all possible means ,  the Russian report said .
The Republicans just won the bidding war .
 After the victory of R. Reagan in the election , in early 1981 , a secret agreement was reached in London in accord with which Iran released the American hostages , and the U.S. continued to supply arms , spares and military supplies for the Iranian army ,  the Russian report continued .
The deliveries were carried out by Israel , often through private arms dealers , the Russian report said .
Spares for F - 14 fighters and other military equipment went to Iran from Israel in March - April 1981 and the arms pipeline kept flowing into the mid-1980s .
 Through the Israeli conduit , Iran in 1983 bought surface - to - surface missiles of the  Lance class plus artillery of a total value of $ 135 million ,  the Russian report said .
 In July 1983 , a group of specialists from the firm , Lockheed , went to Iran on English passports to repair the navigation systems and other electronic components on American - produced planes . 
In 1985 , the weapons tap opened wider , into the Iran - Contra shipments .
The matter - of - fact Russian report was stunning .
It also matched other information the Task Force had .
The Task Force had discovered that the Israelis , for example , had shipped U.S. military spares to Iran in 1981 , with the secret acquiescence of senior Reagan - Bush administration officials .
After receiving the Russian report , a U.S. Embassy political officer went back to the Russians seeking more details .
But the Russians would state only that the data came from the Committee on Defense and Security Issues .
The embassy political officer then speculated that Moscows report might have been based largely on material that has previously appeared in the Western media . 
But there was no serious follow - up by the House Task Force or the U.S. government  even though Moscow , the communist enemy in the 1980s , claimed to possess incriminating evidence about two CIA directors ( Casey and Gates ) and two U.S. Presidents ( Reagan and Bush ) .
Though the Russian claims about Carters negotiations with Iran might cause embarrassment for Democrats , Carter , as President , possessed the constitutional authority to negotiate with a foreign power .
The Republicans did not .
Hamilton 's Quandary
The Task Force faced its own quandary about what to do with the explosive Russian report , which  if accurate  made the Task Force report , which was then at the printers , not worth the paper it was being printed on .
Reputations , including Hamiltons , could have been severely damaged .
During his days as House Intelligence Committee chairman in the mid-1980s , Hamilton had come under criticism for dismissing early evidence about Oliver Norths secret contra-supply operations and getting blindsided by the covert military shipments to Iran in 1985 - 86 .
When the Iran - Contra scandal finally broke in late 1986 , Hamilton was named chairman of the investigative committee and quickly bought into White House cover stories that were later shattered by Iran - Contra special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh .
If Hamilton had to renounce his own October Surprise report , he might have been left with a tattered reputation as the Republicans favorite chump .
He might not have built a glittering post - congressional career as a well - regarded senior statesman invited to sit on important panels like the 9/11 Commission and now a task force with former Secretary of State James Baker to recommend future strategy in the Iraq War .
So , in January 1993 , the decision was made to bury the Russian report .
 We got the stuff from the Russians just a few days before  the Task Forces own report was set for release , Barcella told me in an interview in 2004 .
 We werent going to be able to look into it , whether it was new information , disinformation or whatever it was . 
When I asked him why the Task Force didnt just release the Russian report along with the Task Force report , Barcella responded that the Russian report was classified , precluding its disclosure to the public .
There was no interest in pressing for its declassification , though Hamilton would have been in a strong position to do so .
So the extraordinary Russian report was simply boxed up and filed away with other unpublished information that the Task Force had collected in its year - long investigation .
Barcella said he envisioned the Task Force material ending up in some vast warehouse , like in the movie  Raiders of the Lost Ark . 
Actually , the Russian report found an even less elegant resting place .
In late 1994 , I discovered the documents , including the Russian report , in boxes that had been piled up in a former Ladies Room in an obscure office off the Rayburn House Office Building s parking garage .

A yet - to - be- published study is making some startling claims about psychological treatment .
According to researchers at The Australian National University in Canberra , spending time on therapeutic and educational web sites can be just as effective as regular visits to the psychotherapist .
Researchers studied a group of patients who were referred to two web sites : The MoodGYM and education site BluePages .
The MoodGYM is therapeutic in nature , a cognitive behavior therapy site dedicated to preventing depression by helping users to " identify and overcome problem emotions , " showing them how to " develop good coping skills for the future " in order to enjoy good mental health .
BluePages is a depression education site , providing information about the symptoms of and treatments for depression .
After 12 months , users of both web sites reported improvement .
Interestingly enough , the educational site BluePages proved to be more effective than the behavior - therapy site .
BluePages users " were less likely to use actions that did not have an evidence basis , " researcher Helen Christensen said .
" We do n't know exactly why the Internet interventions are so effective in the longer term , but it may be that there is a reduction in use of ineffective and potentially damaging treatments . "
" In some ways the results are not that surprising , " psychotherapist Kerry DeVries told Ars Technica .
" Cognitive behavioral strategies sometimes in conjunction with medication are the most effective means of treating depression . "
DeVries also believes willingness to use the web sites shows the kind of initiative needed to successfully treat depression .
" A person who is visiting an educational site like BluePages is taking the necessary steps with her own self - care .
That 's a key component of successful treatment for depression . "
The researchers believe that the results indicate that Internet - based strategies educational and therapeutic can be as effective as in - office treatment .
If that is indeed the case , educational and treatment - focused sites could become useful tools in treating people in remote or rural areas for whom access to professional help is problematic .
Some therapists make use of remote treatments already , mostly over the phone , but using the Internet as a means of delivering psychiatric care is a relatively new phenomenon .
While it can't replace individual psychotherapy or medication in all instances , the study does show that sites dedicated to education and treatment can be a valuable tool in the therapist 's arsenal .
The move caught the television industry by surprise , and left several lost properties , including Futurama , ripe with possibility .
" Three months ago , I would have said we were going to start tomorrow , " says writer David X. Cohen , who collaborated with Groening on Futurama .
" And one month ago I would also have said we were going to start tomorrow .
So ... "
He pauses .
" My current estimate is that we 're starting tomorrow . "
The series , relaunched on Ten earlier this month ( it previously aired on Seven ) , was something Groening and Cohen tinkered with in the writer 's room at The Simpsons for more than two years .
Cohen 's background was in computer science , but both , Groening recalls , had a passion for science fiction .
" What Matt is saying , " Cohen interjects , " is that I stood out as the nerd on The Simpsons writing staff , and that is really saying something . "
In the series , pizza delivery boy Philip J. Fry ( Billy West ) is accidentally frozen in a cryogenic facility and revived in 2999 .
Signing on with Planet Express , a space courier service , he befriends a one - eyed alien , Leela ( Katey Sagal ) , an alcohol - powered robot , Bender ( John Di Maggio ) , office manager Hermes Conrad ( Phil LaMarr ) and Dr Zoidberg ( also voiced by West ) , a lobster - like alien .
Sitting in his office , an oasis of organised chaos in the relative calm of Los Angeles 's 20th Century Fox film lot , Groening concedes their partnership was lucky but unlikely .
" Not everyone wants to tell stories about robots , " he says .
Cohen adds from across the room : " I only want to tell stories about robots . "
In Futurama , Cohen says , they hoped to " incorporate all the craziest ideas from science fiction , but we also wanted to have a point and reflect on life today .
I think on our good days we had it both ways . "
Their biggest obstacle was being taken seriously , Groening says .
" We had this show that looked goofy , with robots and aliens , but was actually very sophisticated .
Having people overcome the hurdle of taking us seriously was something we did n't anticipate .
Interestingly , it was my original worry on The Simpsons , where I felt for sure kids would watch , but I did n't know if adults would give it a chance .
What I love about the reaction to Futurama these days is that people who did give it a chance and fell in love with it are still ardent fans . "
Australia is at the vanguard of that popularity , Cohen says .
" I made the mistake of giving out my email on one of the DVD commentaries and it was staggering .
Loads of email came in , most of it from Australia , so I know we 're popular there .
Either that or you all have a lot of time on your hands . "
Both Futurama and The Simpsons , Groening says , share an ambition to tell timeless jokes .
" Both shows are trying to do something which will knock people out the first time they watch it , but will also hold up years later , " he says .
" Jokes that make sense now , and will also make sense 10 or 20 years from now . "
He concedes , however , that Futurama 's US network Fox " never understood " the show .
The series was cancelled in May 2002 and its final episode , the 72nd , aired in the US in August 2003 .
The end came , however , at a fortuitous time .
" We were cancelled just at the time the DVD market blew up and became huge , " Cohen says .
" It 's far and away the No. 1 factor in a resuscitation if we do have one . "
A return to television or , better , a direct - to - DVD feature would be a natural transition for the show , Cohen says .
" The more seriously we took the epic nature of the setting , the better the episodes turned out .
For that reason , we always thought that would bode well for a movie because then we could take that to its extreme and do something we could n't do in 22 minutes . "
Modern medical science has exposed the villainy of the crocodile mummy sellers of Hawara , more than 2,000 years after they defied the edict of a Pharaoh and turned neatly bandaged bundles of rubbish into a nice little earner .
Before the reopening this month of the Egyptian Galleries at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge , curators took their animal and human mummies to the city 's Addenbrooke 's Hospital , as part of a £ 1.5 m re-display of the internationally renowned collection , which dates in part back to the founding of the museum in 1816 .
Analysis continues after the mummies were run through a CT scanner and other tests , but the preliminary results are startling .
The two baby crocodile shaped mummies were originally sold to worshippers at the temple at Hawara , to be buried in ritual pits as an offering to the god Sobek .
There was clearly a history of problems with the animal sellers : a pharaonic decree a century earlier had ordered that each mummy should contain the body of one animal .
The museum 's kitten mummy did indeed hold a very small cat , and there was a sacred ibis within the spectacularly elaborate wrappings of another .
The crocodiles however were spectacularly lacking in crocodile : one held a minute vertebra , the other a handful of straw , rags and mud without a scrap of any animal content at all .
The museum 's single human mummy , collected by Flinders Petrie in the early 20th century , is exceptional .
It comes from the Fayum , where the cultures of Ancient Greece , Rome and Egypt met , producing Egyptian - style mummies , sometimes with inscriptions in Greek , decorated with hauntingly beautiful portraits painted in encaustic wax .
Archaeologists have argued since their discovery about whether the images of men , women and children were idealised types or true portraits .
Although a reconstruction of the head of one woman for the British Museum showed a close resemblance to her portrait , the Cambridge tests reveal a sadder truth .
The Fitzwilliam 's mummy has the image of a dazzlingly handsome young bearded man , with a wreath of gold leaves in his dark curly hair .
The tests show the body inside is a disaster , his back and neck broken after death , head crushed onto the chest , and apparently left so long before mummification that only the skin on the inside thighs remains .
Work continues to try to establish his age , what killed him - and how wide the gulf was between the real man and the beautiful image .
· The Egyptian Galleries at the Fitzwilliam Museum , Cambridge , open free every day except Monday .

But he did not blame only the Taliban for the increase .
He specifically accused the former governor of Helmand Province , Sher Muhammad Akhund , of encouraging farmers to grow more poppies in the months before he was removed from office .
The result was an increase of 160 percent in that “ villain province ” from its harvest last year , he said , the highest rise in the country .
“ There is evidence of major pressure exerted by him in favor of cultivating opium , ” Mr. Costa said .
In the news briefing on Saturday , Mr. Costa also criticized the government ’s action of removing the governor and giving him a position in the upper house of Parliament .
“ I have been on record for asking the president for corrupt officials not to be moved around but to be removed , to be neutralized ; if records can prove conviction , to be arrested and convicted .
So far we do not have much evidence for that And we hope that more forceful initiatives will be taken exactly in that area , ” he said .
One province in the north , Badakhshan , where there is no problem of an insurgency , also had a significant increase in poppy cultivation .
Mr. Costa attributed that mostly to the lack of government control and the presence of powerful warlords and corrupt local officials .
A substantial drought also played a part , because no alternative crop could survive as the poppies did .
While the government had improved its performance at eradication of the poppy crop , it had failed to do enough to catch traffickers and corrupt officials , he said .
The United Nations drugs office , which measures the eradication program , said about 38,000 acres of poppy fields were confirmed to have been destroyed , whereas only about 12,000 acres were confirmed destroyed last year .
Government reporting on how much was eradicated was also less exaggerated , Mr. Costa said .
In 2005 , province governors had reported eradicating about 87,000 acres and the United Nations could only confirm 12,000 destroyed .
In 2006 , governors reported 57,000 acres destroyed , and the drug office confirmed 38,000 , he said .
It has now become all too common .
Peculiar weather precipitates immediate blame on global warming by some , and equally immediate pronouncements by others ( curiously , quite often the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in recent years ) that global warming can’t possibly be to blame .
The reality , as we ’ve often remarked here before , is that absolute statements of neither sort are scientifically defensible .
Meteorological anomalies cannot be purely attributed to deterministic factors , let alone any one specific such factor ( e.g. either global warming or a hypothetical long - term climate oscillation ) .
Lets consider the latest such example .
In an odd repeat of last year ( the ‘ groundhog day ’ analogy growing ever more appropriate ) , we find ourselves well into the meteorological Northern Hemisphere winter ( Dec - Feb ) with little evidence over large parts of the country ( most noteably the eastern and central U.S. ) that it ever really began .
Unsurprisingly , numerous news stories have popped up asking whether global warming might be to blame .
Almost as if on cue , representatives from NOAA ’s National Weather Service have been dispatched to tell us that the event e.g. “ has absolutely nothing to do with global warming ” , but instead is entirely due to the impact of the current El Nino event .
[ Update 1/9/07 : NOAA coincidentally has announced today that 2006 was officially the warmest year on record for the U.S. ]
[ Update 2/11/08 :
It got bumped to second place . ]
So what ’s really going on ?
The pattern so far this winter ( admittedly after only 1 month ) looks ( figure on the immediate right ) like a stronger version of what was observed last winter ( figure to the far right–note that these anomalies reflect differences relative to a relatively warm 1971 - 2000 base period , this tends to decrease the amplitude of positive anomalies relative to the more commonly used , cooler 1961 - 1990 base period ) .
This poses the first obvious conundrum for the pure “ El Nino ” attribution of the current warmth : since we were actually in a ( weak ) La Nina ( i.e. , the opposite of ‘ El Nino ’ ) last winter , how is it that we can explain away the anomalous winter U.S. warmth so far this winter by ‘ El Nino ’ when anomalous winter warmth last year occured in its absence ?
The second conundrum with this explanation is that , while El Nino typically does perturb the winter Northern Hemisphere jet stream in a way that favors anomalous warmth over much of the northern half of the U.S. , the typical amplitude of the warming ( see Figure below right ) is about 1C ( i.e. , about 2 F ) .
The current anomaly is roughly five times as large as this .
One therefore cannot sensibly argue that the current U.S. winter temperature anomalies are attributed entirely to the current moderate El Nino event .
Indeed , though the current pattern of winter U.S. warmth looks much more like the pattern predicted by climate models as a response to anthropogenic forcing ( see Figure below left ) than the typical ‘ El Nino ’ pattern , neither can one attribute this warmth to anthropogenic forcing .
As we are fond of reminding our readers , one cannot attribute a specific meteorological event , an anomalous season , or even ( as seems may be the case here , depending on the next 2 months ) two anomalous seasons in a row , to climate change .
Moreover , not even the most extreme scenario for the next century predicts temperature changes over North America as large as the anomalies witnessed this past month .
But one can argue that the pattern of anomalous winter warmth seen last year , and so far this year , is in the direction of what the models predict .
In reality , the individual roles of deterministic factors such as El Nino , anthropogenic climate change , and of purely random factors ( i.e. “ weather ” ) in the pattern observed thusfar this winter cannot even in principle be ascertained .
What we do know , however , is that both anthropogenic climate change and El Nino favor , in a statistical sense , warmer winters over large parts of the U.S.
When these factors act constructively , as is the case this winter , warmer temperatures are certainly more likely .
Both factors also favor warmer global mean surface temperatures ( the warming is one or two tenths of a degree C for a moderate to strong El Nino ) .
It is precisely for this reason that some scientists are already concluding , with some justification , that 2007 stands a good chance of being the warmest year on record for the globe .
A few other issues are worthy of comment in the context of this discussion .
A canard that has already been trotted out by climate change contrarians ( and unfortunately parroted uncritically in some media reports ) holds that weather in certain parts of the U.S. ( e.g. blizzards and avalanches in Colorado ) negates the observation of anomalous winter warmth .
This argument is disingenuous at best .
As clearly evident from the figure shown above , temperatures for the first month of this winter have been above normal across the United States ( with the only exceptions being a couple small cold patches along the U.S. / Mexico border ) .
The large snowfall events in Boulder were not associated with cold temperatures , but instead with especially moisture - laden air masses passing through the region .
If temperatures are at or below freezing ( which is true even during this warmer - than - average winter in Colorado ) , that moisture will precipitate as snow , not rain .
Indeed , snowfall is often predicted to increase in many regions in response to anthropogenic climate change , since warmer air , all other things being equal , holds more moisture , and therefore , the potential for greater amounts of precipitation whatever form that precipitation takes .
Another issue here involves the precise role of El Nino in climate change .
El Nino has a profound influence on disparate regional weather phenomena .
Witness for example the dramatic decrease in Atlantic tropical cyclones this most recent season relative to the previous one .
This decrease can be attributed to the El Nino that developed over the crucial autumn season , which favored a strengthening of the upper level westerlies over the tropical North Atlantic , increased tropical Atlantic wind shear , and a consequently less favorable environment for tropical cyclogenesis .
If a particular seasonal anomaly appears to be related to El Nino , can we conclude that climate change played no role at all ?
Obviously not .
It is possible , in fact probable , that climate change is actually influencing El Nino ( e.g. favoring more frequent and larger El Nino events ) , although just how much is still very much an issue of active scientific debate .
One of the key remaining puzzles in the science of climate change therefore involves figuring out just how El Nino itself might change in the future , a topic we ’re certain to discuss here again in the future .
FINDINGS : Researchers report that for patients hospitalized with acute heart failure , a higher body mass index ( BMI ) was associated with a substantially lower in - hospital mortality rate .
For every 5 - unit increase in body mass , the odds of risk - adjusted mortality fell 10 percent .
The finding held when adjusted for age , sex , blood urea nitrogen , blood pressure , and additional prognostic factors .
IMPACT : The finding offers more insight into an observed phenomenon in chronic heart failure called the ' obesity paradox . '
This is the first study to document that this inverse relationship with BMI holds in the setting of acute hospitalization for heart failure .
Further study is required but the finding suggests that nutritional / metabolic support may have therapeutic benefit in specific patients hospitalized with heart failure .
BACKGROUND :
The study found that by weight category , in - hospital mortality rate was 6.3 percent for underweight , 4.6 percent for healthy weight , 3.4 percent for overweight and 2.4 percent for obese patients .
" The study suggests that overweight and obese patients may have a greater metabolic reserve to call upon during an acute heart failure episode , which may lessen in - hospital mortality risk , " said Fonarow .
Obesity is a known risk factor for developing heart disease and heart failure and every effort should be made to avoid it , but once heart failure has manifested , this paradox seems to occur .
Researchers utilized data on over 100,000 acute heart failure patient episodes , taken from the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure National Registry ( ADHERE ) .
The study and ADHERE is funded by Scios , Inc .
The authors have received research grants and served as consultants for Scios .

Medical Self - Defense and the Risk that Compensation for Organs Will Drive Away Volunteers :
One of the commenters asks :
Finally , any guess as to how many of those healthy organs donated benevolently will not be available when the pricing game starts ?
Believe it or not , everyone and their descendents is NOT motivated by money .
Look at how many community women stopped volunteering -- the work that truly built American character before the market - inclined came into the game -- once there was some expectation people could be paid for such services .
Sure you 'll pick up some donors in it for the money ; how many of the " volunteers " -- in it for the end result , not the pay -- will you lose ?
I had a section in an earlier draft addressing this argument , but I had to cut it for space reasons ( though I included a little bit of it in other places ) .
Here 's what I said :
Some have also hypothesized a somewhat different altruism effect : that offering money for organs might alienate donors who would give the organs for free , and might therefore decrease ( or not substantially increase ) the aggregate donor supply .
One can imagine some such mechanisms :
If some people believe ( whether rightly or wrongly ) that an organ market is immoral or disgusting , they may refuse to participate .
If some people start thinking of the transaction in financial terms , they may conclude that $ 30,000 is too low a price for parts of their bodies , even if they would have donated the body parts for free .
Likewise , some people might be turned off from the loss of the emotional benefit that accompanies a pure selfless act .
Or some people might donate organs under the current system because they seek the emotional reward that comes from doing something that can only be done by the charitably minded .
Once organ provision becomes the sort of thing that is routinely done for money , they might no longer be interested in doing it .
Yet while one can imagine such reactions , my sense is that they ’d be quite rare .
To begin with , only about 1.5 % of all U.S. living donor transplants -- in 2005 , 89 transplants in total -- are purely unrelated anonymous donations .
Even if all these unrelated anonymous donors become alienated by the prospect that others are being compensated for providing organs , and are n’t mollified by the prospect of refusing compensation or donating the compensation to their favorite charity , this will be a very small loss to the organ pool .
The remaining 98.5 % are either donations to relatives , targeted donations ( presumably mostly to acquaintances ) , or “ paired exchange ” donations in which the recipient ’s relative or acquaintance provides an organ in exchange to the donor ’s relative or acquaintance .
These donors , I suspect , will care primarily about the welfare of the transplant beneficiary , and wo n’t refuse to donate just because compensation is offered .
The cadaveric organs do often go to strangers .
But how likely is it that a next - of - kin who would be willing to donate the decedent ’s organs under a pure donation system would instead refuse when offered money ( even given the option of declining the money , or sending it to his favorite charity ) ?
On the other hand , the opposite reaction -- a financial incentive doing what financial incentives usually do , which is stimulated the rewarded conduct -- should , I suspect , sway quite a few people .
We see some evidence of this in the supply of eggs to infertile couples :
In America , where women routinely get $ 5000 to $ 15,000 for such eggs , the eggs are generally available ; in England , where the compensation is capped at £ 250 , there is a years - long waiting list ; in Australia , where payment for eggs is banned , there is a five - year - long list .
We also see plenty of evidence of this in our daily experience with the overwhelming majority of other goods and services , where offering money will get you much better results than asking for charity .
Moreover , the offer of money may easily be presented in ways that harness charitable people ’s charitable attitudes .
Providing your ( or your recently deceased relative ’s ) kidney for money , after all , saves a person ’s life just as much as donating the kidney would ; and then , if you have strong charitable impulses , you can just take that money and give it to your church , or your favorite charity .
The recipient is no worse off because you took the money .
( Under an organ market system , the cost of the organ would surely be paid by private or government insurance , just as the much greater cost of the other inputs into the transplant -- doctor time , hospital space , pharmaceuticals and surgical supplies -- is now paid . )
And if you are charitably minded , you can just take the money and give it to your church , or your favorite charity , or if you prefer some fund that will support organ transplants for the poor .
You get to feel good about two things , the saving of a life and the donation of the proceeds , rather than just one .
What ’s more , many genuinely altruistic people understandably feel that their charity should begin at home .
A father ’s death in an accident , which makes the organ donation possible , might at the same time strip away his wife ’s and children ’s main source of financial support .
Getting money for the organs and using it for the children ’s benefit will likely seem far more appealing -- even if the mother is generally charitably inclined -- than just giving the organs away .
This leaves one sort of person who might still be turned off , despite the option of declining payment or routing the payment to his favorite cause : someone who is deeply attached to the concept of doing the sort of thing that can not be done for compensation .
Note that this person is n’t the hyper - altruist who just wants to provide an organ to save a stranger ’s life ; he can still do that if he gets paid .
Nor is it the hyper - altruist who just wants to give the organ free ; he can still do that by forgoing compensation .
Rather , it ’s someone who wo n’t want to save the stranger ’s life if such lifesaving is also done by others for compensation .
Yet how common are such people likely to be , compared to those who will see an offer of payment as an incentive ?
Consider a thought experiment : Imagine a requirement that doctors who do organ transplants do them for free , or not at all .
Do we expect that such a requirement would on balance increase the number of doctors willing to perform such operations , since some doctors will be thrilled to do something that can only be done by the charitably minded ?
Would we say , “ Sure , some doctors wo n’t want to invest their time and effort with no compensation , but think of how many more doctors would want to perform such a public service ” ?
Or would we expect that counting on a combination of incentives and conventional altruism ( in which some doctors may contribute their time and effort while forgoing compensation ) is a much surer bet than counting on pure altruism alone ?
According to an Air Force power point briefing provided to POGO , earlier this month at 0815 on April 10th , the controls on an F - 22A at Langley Air Force Base showed that the aircraft 's canopy was n't locking .
After several attempts at opening and closing the canopy , on the final try it locked and jammed -- trapping the pilot inside .
According to the briefing , the 27th Aircraft Maintenance Unit then " consulted Lockheed Martin and the F - 22A System Program Office to determine alternative methods to open the canopy and extract the pilot . "
The mission was accomplished approximately five hours later .
As you can see from the pictures here , while the " alternative method " ultimately used was fairly cheap ( click here and scroll to the last picture at the bottom ) , the resulting damage was n't -- according to the briefing slides , the cost of canopy replacement will run $ 182,205 .
( But after tens of billions of dollars , what 's another $ 182,205 ? )
As one of our sources puts it , the episode " raises a very interesting maintainability issue . "
Oh , and if you have n't read it yet check out Ed Offley 's Raptor piece on the Nieman Watchdog .
You know how you 're watching those hidden camera or funny home video shows and someone gets hurt real bad , and you 're laughing at them and pitying them simultaneously ?
That 's how we felt when we saw Asimo fall down a set of stairs during a demo .
It 's ugly , man .
Aismo turns its head and falls back , seized up like a clenched fist as sparks fly -- and yet it keeps on chattering away to the audience as robo-medics rush to the scene .
One day we 're going to pay for this .

The Recording Industry Association of America has drawn plenty of fire from the thousands of consumers it has sued for illegally downloading music .
But on Thursday , a record label threw its hat in the ring , speaking out strongly against the RIAA 's actions and offering to pay the legal fees and fines for one family that has been sued .
Nettwerk Music Group , the Canadian record label and artist - management company that is home to Avril Lavigne , Sarah McLachlan , Barenaked Ladies and Sum 41 , is taking on the RIAA on behalf of Elisa Greubel , a 15 - year - old Texan whose father was sued by the recording industry trade group in August 2005 for owning a computer that allegedly shared more than 600 music files .
Among the nine songs the RIAA is focusing on in the suit , according to Nettwerk , is management client Lavigne 's " Sk8er Boi . "
The RIAA is demanding Greubel 's family pay $ 9,000 to settle the suit , or half that amount if the family signs off on the conditions built into a standard settlement agreement ( see " RIAA Sues 784 For File - Sharing , Gives Props To Supreme Court Ruling " and " Single Mother Of Five Takes On RIAA In Downloading Case " ) .
Nettwerk Music Group CEO
Terry McBride said in a statement that legal action is not the answer .
" Suing music fans is not the solution , it 's the problem . "
The company got involved after Greubel sent an e-mail to another one of its artists , self - described " post - punk laptop rapper " MC Lars , who has a track on his upcoming album called " Download This Song . "
The track , from The Graduate ( which comes out March 22 ) , finds Lars castigating the music industry for suing fans and features Jaret Reddick of Bowling for Soup singing the refrain , " Hey mister record man , the joke 's on you /
Running your label like it was 1992 /
Hey mister record man , your system can't compete /
It 's the new artist model , file transfer complete . "
According to Nettwerk , Greubel heard the song and wrote an e-mail to Lars '
Web site in which she said , " My family is one of many seemingly randomly chosen families to be sued by the RIAA .
No fun .
You can't fight them , trying could possibly cost us millions .
The line , ' They sue little kids downloading hit songs ' basically sums a lot of the whole thing up .
I 'm not saying it is right to download but the whole lawsuit business is a tad bit outrageous . "
A label representative denied that its actions are at all intended to promote MC Lars ' album .
Chicago attorney Charles Lee Mudd Jr. has defended more than 100 consumers who have been sued by the RIAA .
He said he took on the Greubel case — which names Elisa 's dad , David — prior to Nettwerk 's involvement because of his philosophical and legal opposition to the way the RIAA is pursuing users through litigation .
" I believe the RIAA 's approach is wrong and there are a number of better alternatives out there , " Mudd said .
" I think they 're misusing the copyright laws , which were designed to be used more as a shield than a sword .
They 're going after families that , in a lot of cases , do n't know that what they or their children are doing is illegal . "
Unfortunately for the Greubels , Mudd said that " most " of his clients have been compelled to settle with the RIAA because the cost of fighting the charges was insurmountable .
" Stealing another person 's property is theft , it 's against the law and breaking the law must carry consequences or no one will think twice , " said RIAA spokesperson Jonathan Lamy .
" Theft undermines the ability of the music companies to invest in the new bands of tomorrow and deprives labels , songwriters and musicians of their hard - earned royalties . "
McBride said he decided to weigh in because the action involves his artists .
" Litigation is not ' artist development , ' " he said in the statement .
" Litigation is a deterrent to creativity and passion and it is hurting the business I love .
The current actions of the RIAA are not in my artists ' best interests . "
Nettwerk has offered to pay all legal fees and any fines for the family in the event that they lose the suit and Mudd said he has reduced his fees in the case .
David Greubel , who lives with his family in Arlington , Texas , and found out about the suit last year when he read his name in a local newspaper , said his family owes a huge thank you to Nettwerk for helping him fight the suit .
" The more I looked into it , the more it seemed like a classic [ case ] of David and Goliath , " Greubel said .
" The RIAA had the resources to bring these suits against people who did n't have the resources to fight them . "
Greubel would not discuss the specifics of the case , but said he hopes the attention his plight is receiving will result in more debate about the RIAA 's actions and lead the organization to seek alternatives to the lawsuits .

Lectures on Quantum Computation by David Deutsch
Personal and Historical Perspectives of Hans Bethe
IN 1999 , legendary theoretical physicist Hans Bethe delivered three lectures on quantum theory to his neighbors at the Kendal of Ithaca retirement community ( near Cornell University ) .
Given by Professor Bethe at age 93 , the lectures are presented here as QuickTime videos synchronized with slides of his talking points and archival material .
Website of these lecture
Pricenton University has a huge collection of video lectures in physics , maths , economics , politics .
Lectures from Pricenton University
Intended for an audience of Professor Bethe 's neighbors at Kendal , the lectures hold appeal for experts and non-experts alike .
The presentation makes use of limited mathematics while focusing on the personal and historical perspectives of one of the principal architects of quantum theory whose career in physics spans 75 years .
A video introduction and appreciation are provided by Professor Silvan S. Schweber , the physicist and science historian who is Professor Bethe 's biographer , and Edwin E. Salpeter , the J. G. White Distinguished Professor of Physical Science Emeritus at Cornell , who was a post - doctoral student of Professor Bethe .
Across the country , the income gap between blacks and whites remains wide , and nowhere more so than in Manhattan .
But just a river away , a very different story is unfolding .
In Queens , the median income among black households , nearing $ 52,000 a year , has surpassed that of whites in 2005 , an analysis of new census data shows .
No other county in the country with a population over 65,000 can make that claim .
The gains among blacks in Queens , the city ’s quintessential middle - class borough , were driven largely by the growth of two - parent families and the successes of immigrants from the West Indies .
Many live in tidy homes in verdant enclaves like Cambria Heights , Rosedale and Laurelton , just west of the Cross Island Parkway and the border with Nassau County .
David Veron , a 45 - year - old lawyer , is one of them .
He estimates that the house in St. Albans that he bought with his wife , Nitchel , three years ago for about $ 320,000 has nearly doubled in value since they renovated it .
Two - family homes priced at $ 600,000 and more seem to be sprouting on every vacant lot , he says .
“ Southeast Queens , especially , had a heavy influx of West Indian folks in the late 80’s and early 90’s , ” said Mr. Veron , who , like his 31 - year - old wife , was born on the island of Jamaica .
“ Those individuals came here to pursue an opportunity , and part of that opportunity was an education , ” he said .
“ A large percentage are college graduates .
We ’re now maturing and reaching the peak of our earning capacity . ”
Knowing what you do n't know is a type of abstract thought process called metacognition .
A pigeon does n't know what it does n't know , but Murph and Natua do and that means they are both very intelligent and have a basic requirement for consciousness .
It occurred to me that during 2006 , most of us have been exhibiting precisely the opposite to Murph and Natua 's talent .
We do n't know what we know .
Or , rather , we chose not to know the incontestable and unequivocal truth about the character of this government .
Certainly , we know about the sale of peerages , the scandal over the manipulation of legal advice and intelligence before the Iraq war , the constant move to centralise power and authority at the expense of ordinary people and the associated contempt for parliamentary scrutiny .
We knew these things , but decided not to know them in the political sense , that is , to remain conscious of them , to hold them at the front of our minds and create the weight of opinion necessary to restrain a government .
So we must accept part of the responsibility for this government 's high - handed behaviour , though the lion 's share goes to Tony Blair and those members of his cabinet who have been most active in the degradation of standards and the general attack on liberty , which has been unapologetically the concern of this column for so much of 2006 .
A year ago , it was difficult not to be depressed .
The Serious Organised Crime and Police Act was about to come into force and so allow the police to arrest anyone for any offence and take their fingerprints , photo and DNA whether they were charged or not .
Ahead of us lay the bill which would ban the glorification of terrorism and the ID card bill , both of which were passed after forlorn opposition in the Lords .
There were many measures we had no idea about .
The Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill , for instance , which lurked in Labour 's programme and offered ministers the chance to bypass parliament and make laws by decree .
This was watered down a little after a few in the press alerted MPs to the actual nature of the bill .
We had no such luck with the slew of criminal justice legislation announced by John Reid , Charles Clarke 's replacement at the Home office .
The police demanded and received legislation allowing them discretionary powers that properly belong to the courts .
Barely a week went by without Reid unveiling a tough new package to address terrorism , organised crime or delinquency .
The theme of this legislation was to reduce defendants ' rights and make the business of obtaining a conviction easier .
And still the nation slept , believing that in some way this frenzy of law - making was benevolent and protective rather than a menace to the rule of law .
A year has gone past , but can anyone honestly say that they feel more secure after all this activity ?
Of course not , because the effect of late - period Blair legislation has been to extend the powers of the executive and of the police - who have got everything they wanted from him - while diminishing the individual and his rights .
The judiciary has never been more concerned .
It is unusual for one of the country 's most senior judges to approach a journalist and ask him what the hell has got into the Prime Minister .
Judges do n't do this sort of thing .
But this judge wanted to know whether I thought he should read developments as an expression of New Labour 's character in general or of Tony Blair 's in particular ?
Was the government set on this disastrous course for the foreseeable future ?
How bad was the crisis ?
We will not know the answer until Tony Blair has gone and we see how Gordon Brown reacts to the gradually mounting concern about civil liberties .
This last year has been lowering because the government 's hand was rarely ever stayed .
Indeed , sometimes it seemed that in making the argument about liberties , we only succeeded in inflaming Blair 's passion to remove more of them .
And in this , he was aided by the tabloid press , which intentionally confused the idea of human rights with every category of unearned , frivolous and vexatious claim produced by the modern culture of entitlement .
Something has to be done in 2007 to separate the two and to restore nobility to the cause of human rights .
But 2006 was not without achievement or hope .
The opposition parties have at last taken the cause of British freedom to heart .
Both the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats are against the ID card and both have begun to talk seriously about a bill of rights to secure and embed the liberties that we once took for granted .
The Liberal Democrats have suggested a general act to repeal all the authoritarian laws that Blair has slipped on to the statute book while we were n't looking .
What I hope has been gained in the dark hours of 2006 was an understanding of the preciousness of liberty and our democratic institutions .
At the beginning of the year , I was astonished how little MPs understood about so many measures passed by their own house .
Knowledge of the Inquiries Act or the Civil Contingencies Act , both of which reduce parliamentary scrutiny , was hard to come by .
No more than one in 10 MPs could have told you how , using the Courts Act together with the Domestic Violence , Crime and Victims Act , the government swept away a 400 - year - old common law , which guaranteed that an Englishman 's home was his castle and that no bailiff could break in to collect civil debts .
That kind of ignorance among legislators is not nearly so common now .
Labour MPs are beginning to see that many of the laws passed in the last nine years persecute those who are least able to defend themselves , the very people that Labour has traditionally championed .
As things stand , single mothers are to be given Asbos if they cannot control their children .
Changes in legal aid will mean that it will that much harder to provide adequate defence .
The collection of fines by bailiffs using forced entry is penalising - to say nothing of terrorising - many innocent people who happen to share an address with an offender .
Often , these are women and children who know nothing about the fine .
There are signs of unease about the tone of these laws among many decent Labour MPs and we can expect their views to become more sharply expressed when Blair leaves office .
For despite the Chancellor 's brooding presence , he is unlikely to start out with the total control that Blair imposed on the party .
Another achievement of 2006 has been a vivid appreciation of the threat of databases , the potential for abuse in the ID national identity register , the national health database and the national children 's index , which , until September , was being set up in conditions of virtual secrecy .
In 2007 , the fight must go on to popularise the menace that this apparatus of surveillance presents to democracy .
So the analysis has been done .
We can see what New Labour has been up to much more clearly than we did a year ago .
In 2007 , we should resolve to know what we know and re-engage with politics .
It is evident that there is no better way of achieving this than a public debate about a bill of rights - with or without New Labour 's participation .

Comment Sometimes
I hear a story that is simply breathtaking in its stupidity and potential for disaster .
For your delectation , horror , and amazement , here is one relayed to me by a good friend a few days ago .
He 's living in a European country that shall remain unnamed ; in addition , the names and some details have been changed to protect the guilty ( and the very dumb ) .
It was transmitted to me via Skype , so I 've also cleaned up the spelling and punctuation common to IM conversations so that it 's more readable .
Boy have I got a story for your Security Focus column .
My brother - in - law just bought a used Intel 20 " iMac .
The seller was a nice looking blonde , who did n't wipe the disk .
You can probably see where this is going , but it 's better than that .
For some reason , he thought he needed her password to reinstall the system , so he called her and she gave it to him .
Well , he had already seen some pornographic pictures on the hard drive that were n't password protected .
Most of them were n't too explicit , aside from a couple of [ oral sex ] shots .
But the password uncovered some videos where she gets sodomized , apparently by her boyfriend , or only one guy at any rate .
Now the pics and vids are all on his iPod .
He pulled them off the computer .
It gets better .
At this point , I was thinking , " How in the world could it ? "
But my buddy was right .
It got better .
My brother - in - law does n't watch a lot of television , but somehow he figured out that the blonde is the host of [ a very popular television show in that country ] !
I saw the vids and I went to the official website , and there she was .
There 's no doubt about it , it 's the same woman .
I could n't believe it either .
How can you be that stupid !?
Do n't even bother asking me for her name , or the name of the TV show , as I 've been sworn to secrecy .
Instead , let 's ponder the lessons we can learn from this salacious debacle .
Lesson 1 : Wipe your disks
I 've touched on this one before , and I know it seems like common sense to the folks reading this column , but my pal 's story sure makes one thing painfully clear : many ( most ? ) " ordinary " users do n't understand the concepts of wiping a hard drive securely before relinquishing a computer .
It 's one thing to drag your personal files to the trash and then empty it - lots of people undoubtedly think that will be enough to protect them .
A few more knowledgeable ones understand that trashed files can still be recovered , so they want to remove that sensitive data more completely .
This usually means asking a friendly computer nerd for advice or help , or Googling for freeware , or paying for some commercial piece of software that will overwrite data the necessary number of times ( Editor 's note : Mac users can use the Secure Empty Trash menu to securely delete files ) .
A tiny number of people - call them " paranoid security experts " - will go the final step and drill , bash , or bend their hard drives so that the data will be totally unrecoverable .
And then we have the ... well , I do n't really want to call them users , since they 're more used by than users of their computers - people who do n't even try to remove their data from the PCs in their possession .
Even if that data is intensely personal .
As in , involving acts or knowledge that really should be kept private .
Or , to put it another way , in what reality did that young woman think leaving pictures of her engaged in sexual acts on her Mac was a good idea ?
Did she not understand that those images and videos were left on the machine that she was selling ?
Had she copied them somewhere - to another machine , an iPod , or a USB stick - and thought that copying was actually moving ?
IV ............................... WHY PENSIONS MATTER
To understand why pensions are still important , you have to understand the awkward beast that benefits professionals refer to as the U.S. retirement system .
It is not really one " system " but three , which complement each other in the crudest of fashions .
The lowest tier is Social Security , which provides most Americans with a bare - bones living ( the average payment is about $ 12,000 a year ) .
The highest tier , available to the rich , is private savings .
In between , for people who do not have a hedge - fund account and yet want to retire on more than mere subsistence , there are pensions and 401 ( k ) 's .
Currently , more than half of all families have at least one member who has qualified for a pension at some point in his or her career and thus will be eligible for a benefit .
And among current retirees , pensions are the second - biggest source of income , trailing only Social Security .
During most of the 90's the decline in pension coverage was barely lamented .
It was not that big companies were folding up their plans ( for the most part , they were not ) but that newer , smaller companies were n't offering them .
As the small companies grew into big ones ( think Dell , or Starbucks , or Home Depot ) , traditional pensions covered less of the private - sector landscape .
This did not seem like a very big deal .
Younger workers envisioned mobile careers for themselves and many did not want pension strings tying them to a single employer .
And most were able to put money aside in 401 ( k ) 's , often matched by an employer contribution .
It happened that 401 ( k ) 's , which were authorized by a change in the tax code in 1978 and which began to blossom in the early 1980's , coincided with a great upswing in the stock market .
It is possible that they helped to cause the upswing .
In any case , Americans ' experience with 401 ( k ) 's in the first two decades of their existence was sufficiently rosy that few people shed tears over the slow demise of pension plans or were even aware of how significantly pensions and 401 ( k ) 's differed .
But 401 ( k ) 's were intended to be a supplement to pensions , not a substitute .
From the beneficiary 's standpoint , pensions mean unique security .
The worker gets a guaranteed income , determined by the number of years of service and by his or her salary at retirement .
And pensions do n't run dry ; workers ( or their spouses ) get them as long as they live .
Because the employer is committed to paying a certain level of benefits , pensions are known as " defined benefit " plans .
Since an individual 's benefit rises with each year of service , the employer is supposed to sock money away , into a fund that it manages for all of its beneficiaries , every year .
The point is that workers do n't ( or should n't ) have to worry about how the benefit will get there ; that 's the employer 's responsibility .
Of course , the open - ended nature of the guarantee -- the very feature that makes pensions so attractive to the individual -- is precisely what has caused employers to rue the day they said yes .
No profit - making enterprise can truly gauge its ability to meet such promises decades later .
A 401 ( k ) , on the other hand , promises nothing .
It 's merely a license to defer taxes -- an individual savings plan .
The employer might contribute some money , which is why 401 ( k ) 's are known as " defined contribution " plans .
Or it might not .
Even if the company does contribute , it offers no assurance that the money will be enough to retire on , nor does it get involved with managing the account ; that 's up to the worker .
These disadvantages were , in the 90's , somehow perceived ( with the help of exuberant marketing pitches by mutual - fund firms ) to be advantages : 401 ( k ) 's let workers manage their own assets ; they were a road map to economic freedom .
Post - bubble , the picture looks different .
Various people have studied how investors perform in their 401 ( k ) 's .
According to Alicia Munnell , a pension expert at Boston College and previously a White House economist , pension funds over the long haul earn slightly more than the average 401 ( k ) holder .
Among the latter , those who do worse than average , of course , have no protection .
Moreover , pensions typically annuitize -- that is , they convert a worker 's retirement assets into an annual stipend .
They impose a budget , based on actuarial probabilities .
This might seem a trivial service ( some pensioners might not even realize that it is a service ) .
But if you asked a 65 - year - old man who lacked a pension but did have , say , $ 100,000 in savings , how much he could live on , he likely would not have the vaguest idea .
The answer is $ 654 a month : this is the annuity that $ 100,000 would purchase in the private market .
It is the amount ( after deducting the annuity provider 's costs and profit ) that the average person could live on so as to exhaust his savings at the very moment that he draws his final breath .
So the question arises : what if he lives longer than average ?
This is the beauty of a pension or of any collectivized savings pool .
The pension plan can afford to support people who live to 90 , because some of its members will expire at 66 .
It subsidizes its more robust members from the resources of those who die young .
This is why a 401 ( k ) is not a true substitute .
Jeffrey Brown , an associate finance professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and a staff member of the president 's Social Security commission , notes that as baby boomers who have nest eggs in place of pensions begin to retire , they will be faced with a daunting question : " How do I make this last a lifetime ?

JavaScript Files
graph.js :
The graphing engine and supporting objects .
The engine is independent of a UI implementation .
domui.js : A client to the graph engine .
This implementation draws user interface components using the DOM .
control.js : Encapsulates event handling functions .
event.js :
An event - handler factory .
timer.js : A object wrapper around JavaScript's " settimeout " .
Example Implementation
Here 's a simplified example .
For a more complete example , see Example # 1 .
Import all of the supporting js files .
< html > < head > < script src=" event.js " ></ script > < script src=" timer.js " ></ script > < script src=" graph.js " ></ script > < script src=" domui.js " ></ script > < script src=" control.js " ></ script > </head >
Add an " onload " event handler for the timer we 're going to create below .
< body onload=" timer.start ( ) " >
Add an element to represent the origin of our graph .
< div id =" origin " style= " position : absolute ; " ></div >
Add an element to frame to our graph .
< div id =" frame " style = " width :400 px ; height :400 px ; position : absolute ; left:0 p x ; top:0 px ; border : 1 px solid # 444444 ; " ></div >
Create and initialize the timer that will control this graph .
< script > var timer = new TimerControl ( ) ; timer.initialize( 1 ) ;
Construct and initialize the object that draws the user interface components .
We pass in the frame and origin elements from above and boolean flags indicated whether we wish to display origin and non -origin edges .
For this example , we 're going to display only the non -origin edges .
See Example # 1 for a better way to create the frame .
var graphui=new GraphUI ( ) ; graphui.initialize ( document.getElementById(' frame ' ) , document.getElementById('origin' ) , false , true ) ;
Create and initialize the Graph instance .
We pass in the dimensions of the frame as well .
var graph=new Graph ( ) ; graph.initialize ( 400 , 400 ) ;
Subscribe the GraphUI instance to the Graph so it will receive updates .
graph.setUI ( graphui ) ;
Timers control other objects via an observer pattern .
We subscribe the Graph instance to the Timer .
timer.subscribe( graph ) ;
Set up the control ( which apparently knows about all the other objects ... yick ) .
var control = new UserControl ( ) ; control.initialize ( timer , graph , graphui ) ;
Finally , time for data .
Add some nodes to the graph .
A node may have text and mass , and connect to the origin with a specific edge weight .
var node1 = control.addNode ( null , 3 , true , 55 ) ; graphui.getNode ( node1.id ).style.backgroundColor=" #99ee55 " ; graphui.getNode ( node1.id ).style.border = " 1px solid # 69be25 " ; var node2 = control.addNode ( null , 2 , true , 55 ) ; graphui.getNode ( node2.id ).style.backgroundColor=" #eeee66 " ; graphui.getNode ( node2.id ).style.border= " 1px solid # bebe36 " ; var node3 = control.addNode ( null , 1 , true , 55 ) ; graphui.getNode ( node3.id ).style.backgroundColor=" #ee9944 " ; graphui.getNode ( node3.id ).style.border = " 1px solid # be6914 " ; var node4 = control.addNode ( null , 3 , true , 55 ) ; graphui.getNode ( node4.id ).style.backgroundColor= " #6688ee " ; graphui.getNode ( node4.id ).style.border = " 1px solid # 3658be " ;
Add any edges .
control.addEdge ( node1 , node2 , 45 ) ; </ script > </ body > </html >
That 's it !
This is what it looks like .
Give it a shot with your data !

Below average mental agility raised heart attack risks , the study found
Dr Beverly Shipley from Edinburgh University surveyed the mental agility of more than 6,400 people from across Britain over the past two decades .
She found those with slower reaction times and a poorer memory had a higher risk of dying of cardiovascular or respiratory disease .
Dr Shipley will present the results of the study at a conference in Perth .
Participants in the 21 - year study were aged between 18 and 99 .
More than 1,500 members of the group had died by 2005 , when the research ended .
' Wired together '
Even after taking into account other factors usually linked with heart disease , such as physical activity , blood pressure , body mass index and smoking , it was shown that longer reaction times were associated with higher death rates .
Dr Shipley said the testing suggested that differences in mental ability were a risk factor for certain vascular health conditions .
The results found that lower than average mental agility led to at least a 10 % greater chance of developing heart disease .
She said one of the surprising outcomes of the research was that both younger and older adults exhibited the same link between cognition and heart disease mortality .
The researcher suggested one possible explanation from the study was that human reaction time was an indicator of a body with better " system integrity " , meaning how well it is wired together .
However , she said : " It 's not really clear why cognition and reaction time is related to mortality .
" That 's the next step of my work . "
About 100 experts are attending the British Psychological Society 's Scottish conference , where the research will be presented .
Everyone uses money .
We all want it , work for it and think about it .
If you do n't know what money is , you are not like most humans .
However , the task of defining what money is , where it comes from and what it 's worth belongs to those who dedicate themselves to the discipline of economics .
While the creation and growth of money seems somewhat intangible , money is the way we get the things we need and want .
Here we look at the multifaceted characteristics of money .
What Is Money ?
Before the development of a medium of exchange , people would barter to obtain the goods and services they needed .
This is basically how it worked : two individuals each possessing a commodity the other wanted or needed would enter into an agreement to trade their goods .
This early form of barter , however , does not provide the transferability and divisibility that makes trading efficient .
For instance , if you have cows but need bananas , you must find someone who not only has bananas but also the desire for meat .
What if you find someone who has the need for meat but no bananas and can only offer you bunnies ?
To get your meat , he or she must find someone who has bananas and wants bunnies ...
The lack of transferability of bartering for goods , as you can see , is tiring , confusing and inefficient .
But that is not where the problems end : even if you find someone with whom to trade meat for bananas , you may not think a bunch of them is worth a whole cow .
You would then have to devise a way to divide your cow ( a messy business ) and determine how many bananas you are willing to take for certain parts of your cow .
To solve these problems came commodity money , which is a kind of currency based on the value of an underlying commodity .
Colonialists , for example , used beaver pelts and dried corn as currency for transactions .
These kinds of commodities were chosen for a number of reasons .
They were widely desired and therefore valuable , but they were also durable , portable and easily stored .
Another example of commodity money is the U.S. currency before 1971 , which was backed by gold .
Foreign governments were able to take their U.S. currency and exchange it for gold with the U.S. Federal Reserve .
If we think about this relationship between money and gold , we can gain some insight into how money gains its value : like the beaver pelts and dried corn , gold is valuable purely because people want it .
It is not necessarily useful - after all , you can't eat it , and it wo n't keep you warm at night , but the majority of people think it is beautiful , and they know others think it is beautiful .
Gold is something you can safely believe is valuable .
Before 1971 , gold therefore served as a physical token of what is valuable based on people 's perception .
Impressions Create Everything
The second type of money is fiat money , which does away with the need to represent a physical commodity and takes on its worth the same way gold did : by means of people 's perception and faith .
Fiat money was introduced because gold is a scarce resource and economies growing quickly could n't always mine enough gold to back their money requirement .
For a booming economy , the need for gold to give money value is extremely inefficient , especially when , as we already established , value is really created through people 's perception .
Fiat money , then becomes the token of people 's apprehension of worth - the basis for why money is created .
An economy that is growing is apparently doing a good job of producing other things that are valuable to itself and to other economies .
Generally , the stronger the economy , the stronger its money will be perceived ( and sought after ) and vice versa .
But , remember , this perception , although abstract , must somehow be backed by how well the economy can produce concrete things and services that people want .
That is why simply printing new money will not create wealth for a country .
Money is created by a kind of a perpetual interaction between concrete things , our intangible desire for them , and our abstract faith in what has value : money is valuable because we want it , but we want it only because it can get us a desired product or service .
How Is It Measured ?
Sure , money is the $ 10 bill you lent to your friend the other day and do n't expect back anytime soon .
But exactly how much money is out there and what forms does it take ?
Economists and investors ask this question everyday to see whether there is inflation or deflation .
To make money more discernible for measurement purposes , they have separated it into three categories :
M1 – This category of money includes all physical denominations of coins and currency , demand deposits , which are checking accounts and NOW accounts , and travelers ' checks .
This category of money is the narrowest of the three and can be better visualized as the money used to make payments .
M2 – With broader criteria , this category adds all the money found in M1 to all time - related deposits , savings deposits , and non-institutional money - market funds .
This category represents money that can be readily transferred into cash .
M3 – The broadest class of money , M3 combines all money found in the M2 definition and adds to it all large time deposits , institutional money - market funds , short - term repurchase agreements , along with other larger liquid assets .
By adding these three categories together , we arrive at a country 's money supply , or total amount of money within an economy .
How Money Is Created
Now that we 've discussed why and how money , a representation of perceived value , is created in the economy , we need to touch on how the central bank ( the Federal Reserve in the U.S. ) can manipulate the money supply .
Among other things , a central bank has the ability to influence the level of a country 's money supply .
Let 's look at a simplified example of how this is done .
If it wants to increase the amount of money in circulation , the central bank can , of course , simply print it , but as we learned , the physical bills are only a small part of the money supply .
Another way for the central bank to increase the money supply is to buy government fixed - income securities in the market .
When the central bank buys these government securities , it puts money in the hands of the public .
How does a central bank such as the Federal Reserve pay for this ?
As strange as it sounds , they simply create the money out of thin air and transfer it to those people selling the securities !
To shrink the money supply , the central bank does the opposite and sells government securities .
The money with which the buyer pays the central bank is essentially taken out of circulation .
Keep in mind that we are generalizing in this example to keep things simple .
( For more information , see the Federal ( the Fed ) Reserve Tutorial . )
Conclusion
Remember , as long as people have faith in the currency , a central bank can issue more of it .
But if the Fed issues too much money , the value will go down , as with anything that has a higher supply than demand .
So even though technically it can create money " out of thin air , " the central bank cannot simply print money as it wants .

Abstract
People who 've known me for a long time know that I grew up drug - free , staunchly refusing to try anything illegal , despite a lot of peer pressure to try marijuana .
However , my questions about the drug have nagged at me over the years , and with the topic of legalization often appearing in the news of late , I decided I needed to find out for myself , once and for all , what it 's really like .
Since it 's essentially legal to smoke pot in Holland , I decided to go to the High Times Cannabis Cup , held last week in Amsterdam , as a sort of undercover reporter .
I was amazed at what I learned .
I return , convinced that our marijuana laws are a disaster at every level and must be repealed .
This is the report on my findings .

A movie tagline is one of the most powerful elements of a movie 's marketing process .
Even a completely crap movie can seem like the coolest thing , when you have a cool taglie that has people talking about it .
Making a good tagline is not easy .
Nowadays most taglines are n't much more than variations on older taglines , or they do n't bear any creativity inside them at all .
I mean , " Everything comes to life " ( Night at the Museum ) is n't something that speaks to you in the way that something like " Life is in their hands ...

This is n't just finding the fastest way to get trucks to their destinations .
That is not a simple problem , but you must also solve the flow problem :
when do the trucks have to leave your yard in order to arrive at each customer 's site on schedule
To do this job well , you 're going to have to have a really good model of traffic in the city you serve .
Do n't forget to build the football ,
?
If a customer is ninety minutes away and traffic is building towards ruch hour , you have to leave earlier .
How much earlier ?
Do you send two trucks by different paths at certain times and reroute one of the trucks if the other arrives ahead of schedule ?
When an accident suddenly clogs the freeway , is your system able to predict how long the freeway will be closed and what the effects will be on alternate routes ?
To do this job well , you 're going to have to have a really good model of traffic in the city you serve .
Do n't forget to build the baseball hockey , and basketball schedules into your system , along with big ticket concerts :-)

Well ?
Business programming simply is n't that hard , right ?
Seriously , how hard can it be to wire a SQL database to some basic business rules ( " " ) and add some AJAXy goodness on top like ?
Business applications are a simple pyramid with the frameworks doing the heavy lifting at the bottom and the AJAXy goodness on the top providing the sizzle that makes users say " wow . "
Right ?
And needless to say , business applications are borrrring !
Nothing about the programming is stimulating .
It 's all a question of managing requirements , priorities , and figuring out how to cram ninety hours worth of work into a seventy hour week to stave off the outsourcing .
But ...
Could there be interesting problems to seek out in business ?
Try a couple of these on for size :
You have an online banking application .
Your goal is to produce a system that can alert a customer service rep when suspicious activity is detected so that they can telephone the customer before the customer has left the web site .
How can you detect suspicious activities in real time ?
For an example of how this works , consider credit cards .
I often make very large computer purchases , and they never bat an eyelash .
But when I purchase jewelry for my wife , I get a call .
A friend swears she gets the same pattern , but they called her when she purchased an iPod because she does n't usually purchase electronics .
Your system will notice weird patterns , like a customer who never banks internationally suddenly trying to transfer money to Russia .
But take heed : you do n't want to be bothering the fur importer who regularly does business in the " Wild Wild East . "
You need to look forpatterns .
And you need to explain it simply enough that a customer service rep knows how to verify the transaction with the customer .
Did I meantion ?
Visa normally calls me within a few hours .
Your goal is to make the call Concrete is funny stuff .
From the moment you start mixing it , you have a limited amount of time it can sit in the mixer truck before it has to get poured .
Construction sites need so much an hour , no more and no less .
A cement company can't send a customer one hundred trucks simultaneously and have them idling on site , they have to arrive just as they 're needed .
In major cities , is a problem .
So build a system that can dispatch and direct the trucks in real time .
Your input will be demand from customers plus real time traffic and road construction reports , which your system will use to update a graph representation of the road network .
Naturally , it will search the network in real time for apropriate paths for the trucks .
They 're outfitted with GPS units , so you will have real time locations for your trucks .
Do n't forget to manage the return of the empty trucks to your site .
Concrete is a low margin business , so operational efficiency is a .
Do a great job , and your company could become the dominant supplier .
Consider any large organization that makes big - ticket sales to walk - in prospects .
Let 's choose car sales .
Some prospects will walk in and buy right away , others will never buy .
Some will buy , but only if you follow up with a call after they 've been in for a test drive .
When 's the right time to call them back ?
If salespeople call too soon , they waste time , make the prospects feel pressured , and their quote ends up being fodder for the competition to beat and steal the business .
But of they call too late , the prospect will have bought from someone else .
Build a system that learns over time when to call each prospect .
For starters , you 'll have access to a survey team that will call a sample of prospects that did n't buy .
They will fill out a form about the prospect ( age , gender , household income , zip code , car they owned , car they bought , anything else you can gather ) , along with when they bought .
This becomes your training corpus .
Now build a system that the salespeople use to manage callbacks .
Your system must suggest when to call the prospect in order to have the best chance of closing the deal .
Yes , your system must be able to train itself .
Yes , your system must do " meta - training " : if the zip code is n't significant but the age of their existing car is significant , your system must recommend dropping the former from the survey and promoting the latter to the top of the form .
And you ought to add new questions from time to time and test them for relevance .
Oh yes , you 'll have to infer distributions like the Erlang Normal , or Binomial for purchase times : it should figure out the most appropriate model for lag between test drive and purchase .
Did I mention the scale ?
This system should be rolled out to every dealer in North America , and every salesperson on duty will be using it .
How many dealers are there ?
I think you answered that question in your job interview , did n't you ?
Does business programming have to suck

By combining quantum computation and quantum interrogation , scientists at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign have found an exotic way of determining an answer to an algorithm – without ever running the algorithm .
Using an optical - based quantum computer , a research team led by physicist Paul Kwiat has presented the first demonstration of " counterfactual computation , " inferring information about an answer , even though the computer did not run .
The researchers report their work in the Feb. 23 issue of Nature .
Quantum computers have the potential for solving certain types of problems much faster than classical computers .
Speed and efficiency are gained because quantum bits can be placed in superpositions of one and zero , as opposed to classical bits , which are either one or zero .
Moreover , the logic behind the coherent nature of quantum information processing often deviates from intuitive reasoning , leading to some surprising effects .
" It seems absolutely bizarre that counterfactual computation – using information that is counter to what must have actually happened – could find an answer without running the entire quantum computer , " said Kwiat , a John Bardeen Professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Physics at Illinois .
" But the nature of quantum interrogation makes this amazing feat possible . "
Sometimes called interaction - free measurement , quantum interrogation is a technique that makes use of wave - particle duality ( in this case , of photons ) to search a region of space without actually entering that region of space .
Utilizing two coupled optical interferometers , nested within a third , Kwiat 's team succeeded in counterfactually searching a four - element database using Grover 's quantum search algorithm .
" By placing our photon in a quantum superposition of running and not running the search algorithm , we obtained information about the answer even when the photon did not run the search algorithm , " said graduate student Onur Hosten , lead author of the Nature paper .
" We also showed theoretically how to obtain the answer without ever running the algorithm , by using a ' chained Zeno ' effect . "
Through clever use of beam splitters and both constructive and destructive interference , the researchers can put each photon in a superposition of taking two paths .
Although a photon can occupy multiple places simultaneously , it can only make an actual appearance at one location .
Its presence defines its path , and that can , in a very strange way , negate the need for the search algorithm to run .
" In a sense , it is the possibility that the algorithm could run which prevents the algorithm from running , " Kwiat said .
" That is at the heart of quantum interrogation schemes , and to my mind , quantum mechanics does n't get any more mysterious than this . "
While the researchers ' optical quantum computer cannot be scaled up , using these kinds of interrogation techniques may make it possible to reduce errors in quantum computing , Kwiat said .
" Anything you can do to reduce the errors will make it more likely that eventually you 'll get a large - scale quantum computer . "

For the past three and a half years , U.S. government agents have been torturing alleged “ dirty bomber ” Jose Padilla via methods that Congress just enshrined in law .
If you have a strong stomach , you can read the never - before - surfaced details of his captivity here .
via Glen Greenwald :
Mr. Padilla ’s dehumanization at the hands of his captors also took more sinister forms .
Mr. Padilla was often put in stress positions for hours at a time .
He would be shackled and manacled , with a belly chain , for hours in his cell .
Noxious fumes would be introduced to his room causing his eyes and nose to run .
The temperature of his cell would be manipulated , making his cell extremely cold for long stretches of time .
Mr. Padilla was denied even the smallest , and most personal shreds of human dignity by being deprived of showering for weeks at a time , yet having to endure forced grooming at the whim of his captors .
A substantial quantum of torture endured by Mr. Padilla came at the hands of his interrogators .
In an effort to disorient Mr. Padilla , his captors would deceive him about his location and who his interrogators actually were .
Mr. Padilla was threatened with being forcibly removed from the United States to another country , including U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , where he was threatened his fate would be even worse than in the Naval Brig .
He was threatened with being cut with a knife and having alcohol poured on the wounds .
He was also threatened with imminent execution .
He was hooded and forced to stand in stress positions for long durations of time .
He was forced to endure exceedingly long interrogation sessions , without adequate sleep , wherein he would be confronted with false information , scenarios , and documents to further disorient him .
Often he had to endure multiple interrogators who would scream , shake , and otherwise assault Mr. Padilla .
Additionally , Mr. Padilla was given drugs against his will , believed to be some form of lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) or phencyclidine ( PCP ) , to act as a sort of truth serum during his interrogations .

To make matters worse , phone systems are rarely designed to allow more than 10 percent of the population to talk simultaneously , and far more people than that rush to the telephone in an emergency .
In the New York City blackout of 2003 , while most land lines continued to function , the cellphone circuits were overjammed .
Katrina posed even worse problems .
As phone traffic surged , the water was destroying a vast area , including underground phone lines .
Mobile - phone networks , too , were ruined , because they 're routed through communication towers that crumpled like paper in Katrina 's 140 - mile - an - hour winds .
As a final insult , Katrina knocked out the power grid in swaths of the Gulf Coast -- which was fatal for phone systems that require thousands of watts of juice .
The surviving mobile - phone sites in New Orleans could run on diesel - generator backup , but with just one tank of gas each , they were capable of operating for only a few days .
Even the mayor nearly lost contact with the outside world .
After their satellite phones ran out of power , employees of the mayor 's office broke into an Office Depot and lifted phones , routers and the store 's own computer server .
WiFi meshes elegantly dodge our phone system 's central problems .
They 're low - power and ultracheap -- and decentralized like the Internet itself , which was initially conceived to withstand a nuclear attack .
You can use WiFi to build a do - it - yourself phone system that is highly resistant to disaster .
In Chicago , the Center for Neighborhood Technology , a nonprofit organization , hooked up dozens of households in the neighborhoods of North Lawndale and Pilsen with WiFi nodes that form a mesh .
Each node can communicate with its neighbor a few hundred feet away ; by cooperating in this fashion , they form an enormous bucket brigade , each passing the data signal along until everyone is sharing it .
If one single household connects to the Internet , all the other households can instantly dip in .
Best of all , the WiFi mesh can handle not only data but also phone calls -- via the magic of " voice over IP , " an increasingly popular technique for transmitting conversation over the Internet .
Should the local phone lines suddenly collapse , the residents of these neighborhoods can still make calls to one another using headsets attached to their computers .
In essence , they are their own backup phone company .
Unlike a normal land - line or mobile phone system , a WiFi mesh has no single weak point .
Knock out any single node in one of the Chicago neighborhoods -- destroy an entire house , for that matter -- and the mesh has enough redundancy to work around the missing link .
The nodes are also durable ; they 're tiny shoe - box - size devices , which means they 're far less likely to be wiped out by hurricanes than enormous mobile - phone - company antennas .
" We 've been running these little Apollo 13 disaster scenarios where a bunch of our nodes get taken out , and the whole system just reconfigures itself automatically , " said Paul Smith , who helped build the Chicago networks .

Crowds thronged the streets of Istanbul to escort Dink 's coffin
The newspaper editor , 53 , was gunned down in the Turkish city on Friday , metres from his offices .
Dink wrote controversial articles about the mass killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks during World War I .
Mourners carrying placards reading " We are all Armenians " paused and applauded as they passed where he was shot .
From there they walked five miles ( 8 km ) to an Armenian Orthodox church , where the funeral service was led by the patriarch .
Much of the city centre was closed to traffic .
Priests chanted and doves were released as Dink was buried at Istanbul 's Armenian cemetery .
He was convicted in October 2005 of " insulting Turkishness " through his writings on the Armenian " genocide " of 1915 .
His widow addressed the crowds before the cortege set off , telling them , " We are seeing off our brother with a silent walk , without slogans and without asking how a baby became a murderer . "
The BBC's Sarah Rainsford in Istanbul says those who spilled onto the streets wished to express their sense of solidarity and horror at the murder .
Many , she says , are already beginning to consider Dink a martyr .
Suspects held
Turkish prosecutors said a teenage suspect had confessed to the killing .
Ogun Samast was arrested after he was identified by his father from CCTV images taken near the murder scene .
Ogun Samast was arrested on Saturday in Samsun
One of them was named as Yasin Hayal , a friend of Mr Samast , who has spent 11 months in jail for a 2004 bomb attack outside a McDonald 's restaurant in Trabzon .
Turkey 's Hurriyet newspaper reported on Monday that during police questioning Mr Hayal said that he had given Mr Samast , aged 16 or 17 , a gun and money .
Investigators say that so far they have found no links between Mr Samast and any known political group .
Armenian government officials and religious leaders , as well as some members of Turkey 's Armenian diaspora , attended the funeral , despite the fact that Armenia and Turkey have no diplomatic relations .
' Genocide '
Journalists and politicians in Turkey have expressed outrage at the killing , which many described as a political assassination , while the US , EU , France , and several human rights groups also voiced shock and condemnation .
Dink had received multiple death threats from nationalists because of his views on the mass killings of Armenians during the final days of the Ottoman Empire .
The issue is a sensitive subject in both Armenia and Turkey .
Many Armenians have campaigned for the killings to be recognised internationally as genocide .
Turkey admits that many Armenians were killed but it denies any genocide , saying the deaths happened during widespread fighting in World War I .
MUCH of the cash that keeps Kim Jong
Il 's bankrupt regime in business stems from the 600,000 ethnic Koreans in Japan .
They have plenty of grievances with their host country and a lot of sympathy for the regime in Pyongyang .
Many feel duty - bound to donate money for its upkeep .
Japanese authorities have watched helplessly as the cash flowing from pachinko parlours ( pinball arcades run largely by the Korean underworld ) has also gushed offshore .
The sluice - gates are at last closing .
In September the Japanese government approved measures to block the transfer of funds to North Korea .
Banks had to report suspicious transactions and to demand proof of identity for cash transfers exceeding ¥ 100,000 ( $ 840 ) .
Previously , sums up to ¥2 m could be transferred anonymously as cash , even without an account in the bank concerned .
The government gave the banks three months to prepare for the extra workload and to alter their automated teller machines so they could not accept large sums of anonymous cash .
On January 4th the new money - laundering measures came into effect .
Since its nuclear test last October , North Korea has been facing tighter international sanctions .
For its part , Japan has banned North Korean vessels from its ports and tightened export controls .
Any money or supplies reaching North Korea from Japan these days have to be carried by ethnic - Korean tourists .
But with ferry connections between Japan and North Korea discontinued , Koreans wishing to make the pilgrimage to their ancestral home now have to charter flights via Beijing .
This adds hugely to the cost , and deters many .
On their return , they now have to brave immigration officials with new powers to deny re-entry to Japanese passport - holders who have visited North Korea .
No surprise that Mr Kim has been dishing out invitations to power - brokers in Japan 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) to visit .
The only taker so far has been Taku Yamasaki , an out - of - favour former vice - president of the LDP , who failed to inform party bosses about his trip until he was already on his way .
Judging from the outrage in the prime minister 's office , Mr Yamasaki will be even more out of favour when he returns — provided , of course , the immigration officials let him back in .

Researchers at the University of Rochester may have answered one of neuroscience 's most vexing questions — how can it be that our neurons , which are responsible for our crystal - clear thoughts , seem to fire in utterly random ways ?
In the November issue of Nature Neuroscience , the Rochester study shows that the brain 's cortex uses seemingly chaotic , or " noisy , " signals to represent the ambiguities of the real world — and that this noise dramatically enhances the brain 's processing , enabling us to make decisions in an uncertain world .
" You 'd think this is crazy because engineers are always fighting to reduce the noise in their circuits , and yet here 's the best computing machine in the universe — and it looks utterly random , " says Alex Pouget , associate professor of brain and cognitive sciences at the University of Rochester .
Pouget 's work for the first time connects two of the brain 's biggest mysteries ; why it 's so noisy , and how it can perform such complex calculations .
As counter - intuitive as it sounds , the noise seems integral to making those calculations possible .
In the last decade , Pouget and his colleagues in the University of Rochester 's Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences have blazed a new path to understanding our gray matter .
The traditional approach has assumed the brain uses the same method computation in general had used up until the mid-80s :
You see an image and you relate that image to one stored in your head .
But the reality of the cranial world seems to be a confusing array of possibilities and probabilities , all of which are somehow , mysteriously , properly calculated .
The science of drawing answers from such a variety of probabilities is called Bayesian computing , after minister Thomas Bayes who founded the unusual branch of math 150 years ago .
Pouget says that when we seem to be struck by an idea from out of the blue , our brain has actually just resolved many probabilities its been fervently calculating .
" We 've known for several years that at the behavioral level , we 're ' Bayes optimal , ' meaning we are excellent at taking various bits of probability information , weighing their relative worth , and coming to a good conclusion quickly , " says Pouget .
" But we 've always been at a loss to explain how our brains are able to conduct such complex Bayesian computations so easily . "
Two years ago , while talking with a physics friend , some probabilities in Pouget 's own head suddenly resolved .
" One day I had a drink with some machine - learning researchers , and we suddenly said , ' Oh , it 's not noise , ' because noise implies something 's wrong , " says Pouget .
" We started to realize then that what looked like noise may actually be the brain 's way of running at optimal performance . "
Bayesian computing can be done most efficiently when data is formatted in what 's called " Poisson distribution . "
And the neural noise , Pouget noticed , looked suspiciously like this optimal distribution .
This idea set Pouget and his team into investigating whether our neurons ' noise really fits this Poisson distribution , and in his current Nature Neuroscience paper he found that it fit extremely well .
" The cortex appears wired at its foundation to run Bayesian computations as efficiently as can be possible , " says Pouget .
His paper says the uncertainty of the real world is represented by this noise , and the noise itself is in a format that reduces the resources needed to compute it .
Anyone familiar with log tables and slide rules knows that while multiplying large numbers is difficult , adding them with log tables is relatively undemanding .
The brain is apparently designed in a similar manner — " coding " the possibilities it encounters into a format that makes it tremendously easier to compute an answer .
Pouget now prefers to call the noise " variability . "
Our neurons are responding to the light , sounds , and other sensory information from the world around us .
But if we want to do something , such as jump over a stream , we need to extract data that is not inherently part of that information .
We need to process all the variables we see , including how wide the stream appears , what the consequences of falling in might be , and how far we know we can jump .
Each neuron responds to a particular variable and the brain will decide on a conclusion about the whole set of variables using Bayesian inference .
As you reach your decision , you 'd have a lot of trouble articulating most of the variables your brain just processed for you .
Similarly , intuition may be less a burst of insight than a rough consensus among your neurons .
Pouget and his team are now expanding their findings across the entire cortex , because every part of our highly developed cortex displays a similar underlying Bayes - optimal structure .
" If the structure is the same , that means there must be something fundamentally similar among vision , movement , reasoning , loving — anything that takes place in the human cortex , " says Pouget .
" The way you learn language must be essentially the same as the way a doctor reasons out a diagnosis , and right now our lab is pushing hard to find out exactly how that noise makes all these different aspects of being human possible . "
Pouget 's work still has its skeptics , but this , his fourth paper in Nature Neuroscience on the topic , is starting to win converts .
" If you ask me , this is the coming revolution , " says Pouget .
" It hit machine learning and cognitive science , and I think it 's just hitting neuroscience .
In 10 or 20 years , I think the way everybody thinks about the brain is going to be in these terms . "
Not all of Pouget 's neurons are in agreement , however .
" … but I 've been wrong before , " he shrugs .

House candidate to face litany of criminal charges after alleging vote fraud Miriam Raftery
Published : Monday June 12 , 2006 Print This | Email This
In an exclusive interview with Florida House of Representatives candidate Charlie Grapski - arrested after he filed a lawsuit alleging voting fraud against Alachua County City Manager Clovis Watson , RAW STORY learns of corruption allegations that can only be described as not seen since the days of Boss Tweed .
Charlie Grapski , a Democrat running for the Florida House of Representatives , was arrested in April after filing a lawsuit alleging that City officials abused power and influenced the outcome of an election by manipulating the absentee voting process .
The story , however , does not start or end with election fraud allegations .
What Grapski tells is a tale that one cannot imagine occurring in a law abiding country , one of false arrest , intimidation , and a crony - business system all centered around money interests .
Clovis Watson is not only the City Manager of Alachua county and , as such , the defendant in Grapskis lawsuit , he is also the Police Commissioner of Alchua , Florida , a town dominated by the Republican Party and pro-development Democrats .
Watson , one website alleges , is funded by the Alachua County Republican Party , and declined to accept the Democrat of the Year Award because he is planning a switch to the Republican Party .
The site also takes aim at Grapski .
According to Grapski ,  Clovis Watson filed a sworn complaint as a police officer himself , and as City Manager he was the aggrieved party .
As Police Commissioner , he was his own boss and accepted the sworn complaint from himself -- and then instructed his subordinates on the police force to have me arrested .
Now , RAW STORY has learned , the Sheriffs office has announced that additional charges , including felony wiretapping , will be filed against Grapski and Michael Canney , a Green Party member who witnessed and videotaped Grapskis efforts to obtain public records .
In this exclusive interview with RAW STORY on June 11 , 2006 , Grapski reveals startling details of his situation and updates regarding an election outcome allegedly changed by absentee ballot manipulation .
He also levels serious allegations of abuse of power by public officials , including officials linked to President George W. Bush 's brother , Florida Governor Jeb Bush .
Raw Storys Miriam Raftery :
What was your background before you decided to run for public office ?
Charlie Grapiski : Im a political scientist and political theorist .
I taught those topics at the University of Florida .
I am finishing two doctorates , one in politics and one in law ; that s a PhD in law , not a JD .
Ive been involved in local politics for a long time as an activist .
I served on a campaign charter review board for the City of Gainsville .
RS : How did you become involved in election reform ?
CG : Ive been involved in election reform a long time and have been pushing for election reform through charter review board this year .
RS : Lets go back to April and what happened that that started all the troubles leading up to your arrest .
CG : On April 11th there was an election in the City of Alachua .
That s part of my district that I m running for .
I went up to the polling location to meet people and get petitions signed and campaign for my candidacy .
I knew of some problems in Alachua , but I didnt know how bad they were ; people came to me with all sorts of concerns .
I said " Ill stay around to watch the vote count on election night . "
So I went there and saw a number of violations of the law .
This was at City Hall .
The City officials conducted the elections themselves , which is problematic .
RS : What happened next ?
CG : I began investigating this matter and speaking to other people who conveyed stories of their experiences in the election .
What they were alleging is that city officials abused their authority and power and actually manipulated the election outcome through use of the absentee ballot process .
RS : How did they manipulate the absentee ballot process , in your opinion ?
CG : More will come out this week , but in effect they improperly influenced citizens who cast absentee ballots and instructed them on how to cast them .
This included Clovis Watson , the City Manager who is also the Police commissioner .
He served on the canvassing board , which is supposed to be neutral , and he is the one who personally arrested me .
Another one is Alan Henderson , the City Deputy Clerk , he acted as supervisor of elections for that election .
RS : Were they on the ballot themselves ?
CG : No .
They influenced the election for a guy named James Lewis .
He won the election by 18 absentee ballots but lost it prior to the absentee ballots being counted .
This was his election to his 40th consecutive commission .
He was on the City Commission ( like a City Council ) .
Basically they went up and actively influenced voters on how to vote .
RS : Could that be legal campaigning ?
CG : Not if you re a city official and an election official I dont want to go into too much detail , but in the conduct of giving people ballots they were also engaged in telling them how to cast the ballots .
We believe that this is not the first time that they have done this .
RS : Did they try to influence the general public , or are you referring to City employees ?
CG :
We know that one of the ways they did this was to the general public people that work for the city are either part of the problem or they are afraid to stand up against it .
The people in the City of Alachua are afraid of retaliation by the public officials and the police officials if they stand up to the government .
People are literally afraid .
RS : What did you do that started the trouble you re facing ?
CG :
The first thing I did was I began investigating on my own and organizing and explaining to people what the law was , after the April 11 election .
We began talking to others .
I spoke to a law professor and former Mayor of Gainsville .
His name is Joe Little .
He said these are very serious problems and we need to do something about them .
We met and discussed it , then I brought citizens of Alachua down to his office and we discussed what we knew .
At that point we began interviewing people who were unduly influenced in the election .
The things we found out were beyond your imagination .
We have an amended complaint being filed this week ( week of June 19 , 2006 ) .
RS : When was the earlier complaint filed ?
CG : We filed a complaint April 23 against the city officials including the mayor and Clovis Watson .
RS : What happened after that ?
CG : Later that week , what I began to do was review all of the records of the election to strengthen the case as we wrote up the filing and to document what we knew , to make sure we were correct in our allegations .
On Thursday after filing the lawsuit I filed a formal public records request under Florida law with Alan Henderson ( the City Deputy Clerk who is also Supervisor of Elections ) .
He is required under law to have those documents ready every day by noon .
I said Id come in on Friday of that week to review the documents .
I also knew that with a similar problem ten years ago , the City destroyed the records and told citizens they no longer existed .
RS : So you had reason to be suspicious ?
CG : The Citys normal approach even to City Commissioners they didnt like was to deny them the public records .
So I went in on that Friday with a witness , Eileen McCoy , who was the sole plaintiff at the time , a resident of Alachua .
A lot of people were afraid to put their name on the complaint , but she did .
I brought my video recorder , because if the city was going to tell me lies or deny me records I wanted a record of that .
So I walked in and I told Alan Henderson that I was recording him even though I didnt have to tell him , and he even talked to the recorder to make sure he was being heard clearly .
RS : Did he give you any records ?
CG : He basically denied me the records .
I said put it in writing and give me the reason you re denying access .
And he called the police !
RS : What was your reaction and what happened next ?
Were you surprised that the police were called ?
CG : Whenever anybody comes to City Hall in Alachua and speaks up , they call the police force .
Clovis Watson holds more than one office ( City Manager / Police Commissioner / Clerk Canvassing Board Member ) .
It s unlawful in state of FL to hold 2 offices .
Then Clovis came in and began speaking ; a few minutes into it said I notice you re recording me .
He said  If I dont give consent , that s a felony . 
I said ,  No , you can clearly see that I m recording , two is that you re continuing to talk , and three is you re a public official engaged in public business .
He actually wrote in a memorandum to the City Commission that he had no problem being recorded .
RS : So they arrested you ?
CG : He didnt arrest me that day .
He then said I could review the records Monday at 10:30 .
Over the weekend he e-mailed me asking for a copy of the tape .
I said Id consider it He asked to be notified in advance if I planned to record him .
I said  Be on notice that I will record all my transactions with you .
I came in on Monday , began reviewing the records and in the middle of doing that he came out with a police chief and two armed officers and arrested me for what is a felony wiretap statute .
RS : Is that a state , local or federal statute ?
CG : It s a state law intended to make wiretapping illegal .
Clovis Watson filed a sworn complaint as a police officer himself , and as City Manager he was the aggrieved party , as police commissioner he was his own boss and accepted the sworn complaint from himself and then instructed his subordinates on the police force to have me arrested !
All along , he is the defendant in the elections lawsuit we filed !
RS : What did the Mayor have to say about all of this ?
CG : The Mayor ( Jean Calderwood ) had been appointed in the past by Jeb Bush .
Her husband was the treasurer of the James Lewis campaign .
Shes also a defendant in the case .
Shes come out publicly in the newspapers over the weekend saying that she was in constant communication with Clovis Watson to arrange my being arrested She said Clovis Watson did not go out on a limb alone , he was in constant communication with her She said that in a letter to the editor of the newspaper editor .
RS : Can you send me a copy of that editorial ?
CG : Yes , I will scan in that and some other documents .
RS : When was the arrest and whats the status of your case now ?
CG : I was arrested May 1st in City Hall .
There are photos online www.freealachua.org.
A judge ordered my release by 5:00 that day .
Someone in sheriffs office decided to hold me over and we had to wake up another judge at midnight to have the original judges order [ upheld ] .
RS : Did you have to post bail ?
CG : I was released on my own recognizance .
RS : What s happened since then ?
CG :
It only got worse from there .
I tried to get the records I d been seeking .
The city put obstacles in our way and refused to turn over the documents .
Michael Canney , a member of the Green Party , came as a witness and saw me arrested .
He then began filing public records requests himself to get access to records theyve denied me Slowly but surely we began getting some documents .
One that weve been asking for and still havent given us is a log of requests for all the absentee ballots .
They think we are requesting the log to find out who cast ballots so we could interview them .
We already know who cast ballots and are in the process of interviewing them .
We have another reason .
But the City officials , Clovis Watson sent out a memorandum accusing us of intimidating voters and threatened to arrest us for that !
RS : On what grounds ?
CG : When Michael received a list of absentee ballot voters , not the one we requested but another one , Clovis Watson sent a certified letter warning him about how he uses that list .
They then put an ad in the newspaper for the last two weeks telling people who voted absentee that if we contact them , they should contact the city so they can take legal action !
RS : How many people voted absentee ?
CG :
There were about 120 requests for absentee ballots , of which 107 were counted .
Without all the records we cant say for certain anything .
RS : Were there people who say they turned in an absentee ballot request but their ballots werent counted ?
In other words , do you have reason to believe there was any destruction of ballots ?
CG :
There was destruction of ballots , but in a different context .
Now on May 15th I went into the City Commission ; it decided to try to pass the conclusions of election in a consent agenda item , which is illegal .
I went to that meeting and attempted to have them follow rules and law .
They threatened to have me arrested that night .
After that meeting , the Mayor sent a memo to Clovis Watson asking him to have me arrested .
RS : On what grounds ?
CG : Saying I violated conditions of my release from jail by attending a meeting , they called it disruption .
Of course my disruption was to basically make points of order , formal motions under the rules .
That they called disruptive .
RS : Were you arrested again ?
CG : No , but they were threatening to ; it came very close .
Last week the city commission met again .
They thought I would be there but I wasnt there for other reasons .
But the City had arranged to have a local TV station there and they were going to arrest me that night on TV .
Clovis Watson , when he arrested me the first time on May 1st , sent out press releases to the media so it was a very staged event .
RS : How is the media responding ?
Is there any outrage ?
CG : The Gainsville Sun , which is the biggest paper in town , their coverage hasnt been the best but they did run an editorial and a great editorial cartoon and they are very concerned about it .
Now Hugh Calderwood , the mayors husband and Stafford Jones the chairman of the Republican Party for Alachua County and the Republican Party of Alachua County has put up a website designed to attack me and draw a line in the sand for Alachua County , which they designate as a model of how a city should be run .
See links on the www.freealachua.org site .
The High Springs Herald has done the best job so far of reporting this .
They have been reporting it weekly .
Another , the Observer is not online but well be putting it up online today .
RS : Has there been any national coverage ?
CG :
The first national was in LA CityBeat on Thursday , an article by Andrew Gumbel , who wrote the book Steal This Vote .
RS : What s happening now ?
CG : This week the Sheriffs office and the Sheriff , a guy named Steve Oelrich , a Republican running for the State Senate right now , on Friday I was contacted by the Gainsville sun and informed ( because they alerted the newspaper and not me ) that the Sheriffs office is filing two further complaints against me for unlawful taping .
They are accusing me of felony violations of the law and now filing two charges against Michael Canney for videotaping .
The irony of this of course , is that when I contacted the television news with videotape of one of the incidents that they ( the officials ) claim Michael violated the law by videotaping , Michael videotaped me audio taping Clovis Watson .
But the television station was there too , videotaping .
They showed this on the news , yet Michael and I are being charged with videotaping while the television station isnt -- and they were there doing the exact same thing at the exact same time .
That s how absurd this whole thing is .
RS : When will these charges be heard ?
CG : The State Attorneys office has not formally charged us , but theyve refused to drop the charges , so they are playing this game of harassment .
They know the minute they drop the charges we will go on the offense and bring false arrest and civil rights charges .
To make matters worse , the former state attorney who many in state attorney office work for is Rod Smith , a Democrat running for Governor .
Rod Smith is from Alachua and he wrote Clovis Watsons dual office - holding contact .
RS : Is Clovis Watson a Republican ?
CG : Clovis Watson is a Democrat who the Republican Party says on their website is coming over to the Republican Party .
But Rod Smith is a player .
There is another dimension to whats happening in Alachua County .
The County of Alachua is one of the two Democratic voting areas in Florida ; the rest of the state has gone Republican .
The Republican Party has taken over the City of Alachua and basically opened it up for drive - through development .
There are all kinds of land deals where these city officials and cronies are benefiting by development of land , including Rod Smith .
We re talking a Wal - Mart distribution center , a Wal - Mart super - center and a Home Depot
They cant get these developed in Alachua County so they absolutely have control over some of these small towns .
They are just opening doors for unrestrained growth and development  multi-millions of dollars changing hands .
RS : What is the party affiliation of the other key players ?
CG : Henderson  I have no idea .
He used to be a journalist I believe ; Im told he may have family relationship with one of key political players .
Calderwood , the Mayor , is a Republican appointed by Jeb Bush ; she also served on the water board which had to approve the development for all of this .
Her husband , Hugh Calderwood , he and chairman of Rep .
Party are putting all this stuff on the attack site openly under their own names now .
It used to be done anonymously on blogs .
Steve Oelrich , the Sheriff , is a Republican .
Bill Cervone , State Attorney , is a Republican .
He was assistant State Attorney under Rod Smith , the Democrat .
RS : So this is basically Republicans abusing power and causing these problems , except for Smith and Clovis , whos converting to become a Republican ?
CG :
There are some Democrats , old style southern Democrats who are very development oriented .
As for Clovis being recruited by Republicans , I dont think there is any Democrat in the county who would miss him .
If you see the free Alachua site , there are all kinds of charges of corruption within the police dept under Clovis , a number of allegations going on around that .
When you start seeing the stories and documents it will blow your mind .
RS : How optimistic are you about the outcome of all of this , and what are the implications ?
CG : If you can clean up one city , you can clean up the whole country .
But if you cant clean up one city , we have no chance at the national level .
I see a lot of significance in this one case , because it is a small example of whats going on nationally , and its a lot easier to tackle corruption at the local level , which is the root and foundation of national problems .
Im confident in the end that in terms of justice , I know that what we are doing is on the side of justice .
What these officials know is that they have the power and authority and they can abuse it with very little repercussions to themselves normally .
They have a lot of power and resources .
They are used to people being afraid to stand up .
But as long as we keep fighting and pushing this issue , I believe in the end that we will prevail .
But its a struggle to do that .
We have mounting legal bills and we are trying to raise money nationally to help with that .
( see www.freealachua.org for how you can help ) .
RS : Do the officials there control the court system , too ?
CG : It s very much a company town , and it all depends on what judge we get .
Unfortunately , on our elections challenge case , we found that in another open records case a few months ago the judge completely ignored the law , and weve got that on appeal right now .
This judge is Robert Roundtree , he is also a Bush appointee .
He basically threw out with prejudice a lawsuit filed by the residents of the City of Alachua regarding this multi-million dollar land deal that was the basis of the Wal - Mart land deal with a company called Waco of Alabama .
Their lawyer had medical problems at the time and missed a filing deadline and the judge , instead of reprimanding the lawyer , used that opportunity to throw out the case without ever hearing it on the merits , so we dont have a lot of faith in him .
But there are other judges in town .
The problem is that the more local you are , there is a culture among public officials and they all have this unwritten rule to go after each other  so nobody polices the police and nobody holds to account public officials .
They have nearly free reign in anything they do .
There is one other factor .
On the Alachua City Commission , and thus the boss of Clovis Watson , is a woman named Bonnie Burgess .
She is running for the State House in the same State House race I am , as a developer - friendly Democrat .
These people are supporting her run for that office as well  Clovis and the Calderwoods , the powers - that - be in the City of Alachua .
RS : When is your primary election :
CG : September fifth ..
RS : Who else is in the race ?
CG :
There are three Democrats and one Republican , but this is a Democratic district , so they know that whoever wins the Democratic primary is going to win the race .
In this essay , the bestselling secularist author of “ The End of Faith ” delivers a scathing review of “ The Language of God , ” a new book by Human Genome Project head Francis Collins that attempts to demonstrate a harmony between science and evangelical Christianity .
Francis Collins — physical chemist , medical geneticist and head of the Human Genome Project — has written a book entitled ?
The Language of God .?
In it , he attempts to demonstrate that there is ? a consistent and profoundly satisfying harmony ?
between 21st - century science and evangelical Christianity .
To say that he fails at his task does not quite get at the inadequacy of his efforts .
He fails the way a surgeon would fail if he attempted to operate using only his toes .
His failure is predictable , spectacular and vile .
?
The Language of God ? reads like a hoax text , and the knowledge that it is not a hoax should be disturbing to anyone who cares about the future of intellectual and political discourse in the United States .
Collins ’ book reveals that a stellar career in science offers no guarantee of a scientific frame of mind .
Most reviewers of ?
The Language of God ? seem quite overawed by its author ?s scientific credentials .
This is understandable .
As director of the Human Genome Project , Collins participated in one of the greatest scientific achievements in human history .
His book , however , reveals that a stellar career in science offers no guarantee of a scientific frame of mind .
Lest we think that one man can do no lasting harm to our discourse , consider the fact that the year is 2006 , half of the American population believes that the universe is 6,000 years old , our president has just used his first veto to block federal funding of embryonic stem - cell research on religious grounds , and one of the foremost scientists in the land has this to say , straight from the heart ( if not the brain ) :
As believers , you are right to hold fast to the concept of God as Creator ; you are right to hold fast to the truths of the Bible ; you are right to hold fast to the conclusion that science offers no answers to the most pressing questions of human existence ; and you are right to hold fast to the certainty that the claims of atheistic materialism must be steadfastly resisted ?.
God , who is not limited to space and time , created the universe and established natural laws that govern it .
Seeking to populate this otherwise sterile universe with living creatures , God chose the elegant mechanism of evolution to create microbes , plants , and animals of all sorts .
Most remarkably , God intentionally chose the same mechanism to give rise to special creatures who would have intelligence , a knowledge of right and wrong , free will , and a desire to seek fellowship with Him .
He also knew these creatures would ultimately choose to disobey the Moral Law .
According to Collins , belief in the God of Abraham is the most rational response to the data of physics and biology , while ?of all the possible worldviews , atheism is the least rational .?
Taken at face value , these claims suggest that ?
The Language of God ? will mark an unprecedented breakthrough in the history of ideas .
Once Collins gets going , however , we realize that the book represents a breakthrough of another kind .
After finding himself powerless to detect any errors in the philosophizing of C.S. Lewis ( a truly ominous sign ) , Collins describes the moment that he , as a scientist , finally became convinced of the divinity of Jesus Christ :
On a beautiful fall day , as I was hiking in the Cascade Mountains ?
the majesty and beauty of God ?s creation overwhelmed my resistance .
As I rounded a corner and saw a beautiful and unexpected frozen waterfall , hundreds of feet high , I knew the search was over .
The next morning , I knelt in the dewy grass as the sun rose and surrendered to Jesus Christ .
If this account of field research seems a little thin , don?t worry — a recent profile of Collins in Time magazine offers supplementary data .
Here , we learn that the waterfall was frozen in three streams , which put the good doctor in mind of the Trinity ?
It is at this point that thoughts of suicide might occur to any reader who has placed undue trust in the intellectual integrity of his fellow human beings .
One would hope that it would be immediately obvious to Collins that there is nothing about seeing a frozen waterfall ( no matter how frozen ) that offers the slightest corroboration of the doctrine of Christianity .
But it was not obvious to him as he ? knelt in the dewy grass , ? and it is not obvious to him now .
Indeed , I fear that it will not be obvious to many of his readers .
If the beauty of nature can mean that Jesus really is the son of God , then anything can mean anything .
Let us say that I saw the same waterfall , and its three streams reminded me of Romulus , Remus and the She - wolf , the mythical founders of Rome .
How reasonable would it be for me to know , from that moment forward , that Italy would one day win the World Cup ?
This epiphany , while perfectly psychotic , would actually put me on firmer ground than Collins — because Italy did win the World Cup .
Collins ?
alpine conversion would be a ludicrous non sequitur even if Jesus does return to Earth trailing clouds of glory .
While the mere sighting of a waterfall appears to have been sufficient to answer all important questions of theology for Collins , he imagines himself to be in possession of further evidence attesting to the divinity of Jesus , the omnipotence of God and the divine origin of the Bible .
The most compelling of these data , in his view , is the fact that human beings have a sense of right and wrong .
Collins follows
Lewis here , as faithfully as if he were on a leash , and declares that the ? moral law ?
is so inscrutable a thing as to admit of only a supernatural explanation .
According to Collins , the moral law applies exclusively to human beings :
Though other animals may at times appear to show glimmerings of a moral sense , they are certainly not widespread , and in many instances other species ?
behavior seems to be in dramatic contrast to any sense of universal rightness .
One wonders if the author has ever read a newspaper .
The behavior of humans offers no such ? dramatic contrast .?
How badly must human beings behave to put this ? sense of universal rightness ?
in doubt ?
And just how widespread must ?
glimmerings ? of morality be among other animals before Collins — who , after all , knows a thing or two about genes — begins to wonder whether our moral sense has evolutionary precursors in the natural world ?
What if mice showed greater distress at the suffering of familiar mice than unfamiliar ones ?
( They do . )
What if monkeys will starve themselves to prevent their cage - mates from receiving painful shocks ?
( They will . )
What if chimps have a demonstrable sense of fairness when receiving food rewards ?
( They have . )
Wouldn ?t these be precisely the sorts of findings one would expect if our morality were the product of evolution ?
If one didn ?t know better , one might be tempted to conclude that religious dogmatism presents an obstacle to scientific reasoning .
Collins ?
case for the supernatural origin of morality rests on the further assertion that there can be no evolutionary explanation for genuine altruism .
Because self - sacrifice cannot increase the likelihood that an individual creature will survive and reproduce , truly self - sacrificing behavior stands as a primordial rejoinder to any biological account of morality .
In Collins ?
view , therefore , the mere existence of altruism offers compelling evidence of a personal God .
( Here , Collins performs a risible sprint past ideas in biology like ? kin selection ?
that plausibly explain altruism and self - sacrifice in evolutionary terms . )
A moment ?s thought reveals , however , that if we were to accept this neutered biology , almost everything about us would be bathed in the warm glow of religious mystery .
Forget morality — how did nature select for the ability to write sonnets , solder circuit boards or swing a golf club ?
Clearly , such abilities could never be the product of evolution .
Might they have been placed in us by God ?
Smoking cigarettes is n?t a healthy habit and is unlikely to offer an adaptive advantage — and there were no cigarettes in the Paleolithic — but this habit is very widespread and compelling .
Is God , by any chance , a tobacco farmer ?
Collins can ?t seem to see that human morality and selfless love may be derivative of more basic biological and psychological traits , which were themselves products of evolution .
It is hard to interpret this oversight in light of his scientific training .
If one didn ?t know better , one might be tempted to conclude that religious dogmatism presents an obstacle to scientific reasoning .
Having established that our moral sensitivities are God - given , Collins finds himself in a position to infer the nature of our Creator :
And if that were so , what kind of God would this be ?
Would this be a deist God , who invented physics and mathematics and started the universe in motion about 14 billion years ago , then wandered off to deal with other , more important matters , as Einstein thought ?
No , this God , if I was perceiving him at all , must be a theist God , who desires some kind of relationship with those special creatures called human beings , and has therefore instilled this special glimpse of Himself into each one of us .
This might be the God of Abraham , but it was certainly not the God of Einstein ?.
Judging by the incredibly high standards of the Moral Law ?
this was a God who was holy and righteous .
He would have to be the embodiment of goodness ?.
Faith in God now seemed more rational than disbelief .
I hope the reader will share my amazement that passages like this have come from one of the most celebrated scientists in the United States .
I find that my own sense of the moral law requires that I provide a few more examples of Collins ?
skill as a philosopher and theologian …

How does Collins settle the problem of theodicy — the mystery of why there is evil and misfortune in a world created by an omniscient , omnipotent and perfectly benevolent God ?
He takes it very much in stride … .
On the question of why God simply doesn?t provide better evidence for his existence :
If the case in favor of belief in God were utterly airtight , then the world would be full of confident practitioners of a single faith .
But imagine such a world , where the opportunity to make a free choice about belief was taken away by the certainty of the evidence .
How interesting would that be ?
One is tempted to say that it might be more ?
interesting ?
than a world unnecessarily shattered by competing religious orthodoxies and religious war , only to be followed by an eternity in hell for all those who believe the wrong things about God .
But , to each his own .
How does Collins settle the problem of theodicy — the mystery of why there is evil and misfortune in a world created by an omniscient , omnipotent and perfectly benevolent God ?
He takes it very much in stride :
Science reveals that the universe , our own planet , and life itself are engaged in an evolutionary process .
The consequences of that can include the unpredictability of the weather , the slippage of a tectonic plate , or the misspelling of a cancer gene in the normal process of cell division .
If at the beginning of time God chose to use these forces to create human beings , then the inevitability of these other painful consequences was also assured .
Frequent miraculous interventions would be at least as chaotic in the physical realm as they would be in interfering with human acts of free will .
Any intellectually honest person must admit that he does not know why the universe exists .
Secular scientists , of course , readily admit their ignorance on this point .
Believers like Collins do not .
But why was God obliged to make cell division susceptible to the perversity of cancer ?
And why could n?t an all - powerful , all - knowing , perfectly benevolent God perform as many miracles as He wanted ?
There is n?t time to entertain such questions , however , as Collins must solve all outstanding problems in the science of cosmology :
The Big Bang cries out for a divine explanation .
It forces the conclusion that nature had a defined beginning .
I can not see how nature could have created itself .
Only a supernatural force that is outside of space and time could have done that .
It is worth pointing out the term ?
supernatural , ? which Collins uses freely throughout his book , is semantically indistinguishable from the term ? magical .?
Reading his text with this substitution in mind is rather instructive .
In any case , even if we accepted that our universe simply had to be created by an intelligent being , this would not suggest that this being is the God of the Bible , or even particularly magical .
If intelligently designed , our universe could be running as a simulation on an alien supercomputer .
As many critics of religion have pointed out , the notion of a Creator poses an immediate problem of an infinite regress .
If God created the universe , what created God ?
To insert an inscrutable God at the origin of the universe explains absolutely nothing .
And to say that God , by definition , is uncreated , simply begs the question .
( Why can ? t I say that the universe , by definition , is uncreated ? )
Any being capable of creating our world promises to be very complex himself .
As the biologist Richard Dawkins has observed with untiring eloquence , the only natural process we know of that could produce a being capable of designing things is evolution .
Any intellectually honest person must admit that he does not know why the universe exists .
Secular scientists , of course , readily admit their ignorance on this point .
Believers like Collins do not .
The major and inescapable flaw of ?
[ the ] claim that science demands of atheism is that it goes beyond the evidence .
If God is outside of nature , then science can neither prove nor disprove His existence .
Atheism itself must therefore be considered a form of blind faith , in that it adopts a belief system that cannot be defended on the basis of pure reason .
Is disbelief in Zeus or Thor also a form of ? blind faith ??
Must we really ?
disprove ?
the existence of every imaginary friend ?
The burden of producing evidence falls on those making extravagant claims about miracles and invisible realities .
What is more , there is an enormous difference between acquiring a picture of the world through dispassionate , scientific study and acquiring it through patent emotionality and wishful thinking — and only then looking to see if it can survive contact with science .
Somewhere during the course of his scientific career , Collins acquired the revolting habit of quoting eminent scientists out of context to give an entirely false impression of their religious beliefs .
Consider the following fact : Ninety - nine percent of the species that have ever lived on Earth are now extinct .
There are two very different questions one could ask about a fact of this sort , if one wanted to assess the reasonableness of believing in God .
One could ask , ?
Is this fact compatible with the existence of an omnipotent , omniscient and compassionate God ??
Or , one could ask , ? Does this fact , alone or in combination with other facts , suggest that an omnipotent , omniscient and compassionate God exists ??
The answer to the first question is always , ?
Well , yes — provided you add that God ?s will is utterly mysterious .?
( In the present case , He may have wanted to destroy 99 % of his creatures for some very good reason that surpasses our understanding . )
The answer to the second question is ? absolutely not .?
The problem for Collins is that only the second question is relevant to our arriving at a rational understanding of the universe .
The fact that a bowdlerized evangelical Christianity can still be rendered compatible with science ( because of the gaps in science and the elasticity of religious thinking ) does not mean that there are scientific reasons for being an evangelical Christian .
Collins ? sins against reasonableness do not end here .
Somewhere during the course of his scientific career , he acquired the revolting habit of quoting eminent scientists out of context to give an entirely false impression of their religious beliefs .
Misappropriation of Einstein and Hawking , while common enough in popular religious discourse , rises to level of intellectual misconduct when perpetrated by a scientist like Collins .
Where either of these physicists uses the term ?
God ? — as in Einstein ?s famous ?
God does not play dice ?? — he uses it metaphorically .
Any honest engagement with their work reveals that both Einstein and Hawking reject the notion of Collins ?
God as fully as any atheist .
Collins suggests otherwise at every opportunity .
In his role as Christian apologist , Collins also makes the repellent claim that ?
the traditional lore about Galileo ?s persecutions by the Church is overblown .?
Lest we forget : Galileo , the greatest scientist of his time , was forced to his knees under threat of torture and death , obliged to recant his understanding of the Earth ?s motion , and placed under house arrest for the rest of his life by steely - eyed religious maniacs .
He worked at a time when every European intellectual lived in the grip of a Church that thought nothing of burning scholars alive for merely speculating about the nature of the stars .
As Collins notes , this is the same Church that did not absolve Galileo of heresy for 350 years ( in 1992 ) .
When it did , it ascribed his genius to God , ? who , stirring in the depths of his spirit , stimulated him , anticipating and assisting his intuitions .?
Collins clearly approves of this sordid appropriation , and goes on to say that all the fuss about Galileo was , in the end , unnecessary , because ?
the claims that heliocentricity contradicted the Bible are now seen to have been overstated ?.?
( And what if they were n?t overstated ?
What then ? )
It is simply astonishing that a scientist has produced such a pious glossing of the centuries of religious barbarism that were visited upon generations of other scientists .
If one wonders how beguiled , self - deceived and carefree in the service of fallacy a scientist can be in the United States in the 21st century , ? The Language of God ? provides the answer .
The only thing that mitigates the harm this book will do to the stature of science in the United States is that it will be mostly read by people for whom science has little stature already .
Viewed from abroad , ?
The Language of God ? will be seen as another reason to wonder about the fate of American society .
Indeed , it is rare that one sees the thumbprint of historical contingency so visible on the lens of intellectual discourse .
This is an American book , attesting to American ignorance , written for Americans who believe that ignorance is stronger than death .
Reading it should provoke feelings of collective guilt in any sensitive secularist .
We should be ashamed that this book was written in our own time .

Did you know that the U.S. Northern Command just tightened its control over Northern California ?
" NORTHCOM " is the combatant command created by the Bush administration to control armies on the move inside the so - called North American battle space , which includes Mexico and Canada .
The self - described job of NORTHCOM is to repel invaders , eliminate drug dealers and " terrorists , " and control civil disturbances .
To spot these nuisances , NORTHCOM runs an intelligence " fusion center " at its headquarters in Colorado Springs , Colo .
It correlates electronic data collected from military and commercial sources with duly recorded suspicions forwarded by local law enforcement agencies and neighborhood watch groups .
On Nov. 19 , NORTHCOM 's 9th Reconnaissance
Wing announced the deployment of the Global Hawk at Beale Air Force Base in Yuba County .
On that day , the Air Force 's newest unmanned spy plane flew its first official combat command mission over the continental United States .
Beale will soon host a dozen of these $ 132 million war - fighting machines , which can fly at 65,000 feet for 34 hours while leisurely photographing Americans and uploading their pixels to the fusion center at Colorado Springs .
Privacy ?
Fuhgeddaboutit .
In the Middle East , the Global Hawk 's main activity is targeting houses and individuals for instant destruction by Hellfire missiles .
It is difficult to conceive of a legitimate peacetime application for this harbinger of death in American airspace .
Global Hawk " pilots " fly by remote control from ground - based control booths the size of shipping containers .
Concurrent with the deployment of Global Hawk , NORTHCOM ran a military - law enforcement exercise in the North Bay called Golden Guardian .
The operation tested the intelligence - gathering and combat - command capabilities of local police forces and homeland - defending troops known as U.S. Army North during a simulated earthquake .
Army North 's Soldiers ( the S is always capitalized in Rumsfeldspeak ) are charged with " interdicting " enemies of the corporate state to " protect the American people and their way of life . "
Hey !
Since when did our way of life include 24 - hour surveillance by Global Hawks and interdiction by Soldiers ?
Who is the enemy ?
Us ?
On Oct. 26 , the Army released The manual declares , " The goal of modern warfare is control of the populace . "
That goal applies to domestic as well as foreign operations : " From the mid-1950s through the 1990s , the Army conducted UO [ urban operations ] in the U.S. . . . during civil unrest and anti-Vietnam [ War ] protests . "
Urban warfare doctrine targets poor inner city neighborhoods for destruction and occupation whether they are in Third World countries or festering inside the homeland .
" Urban Operations " warn Soldiers that youth gangs in Los Angeles , known collectively as " Threats , " temporarily united to fight Soldiers during the policing of the Rodney King riots in 1992 .
Ignoring the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , which generally prohibits Soldiers from acting as law enforcers , the manual calls for " full spectrum " urban operations ( led by NORTHCOM ) , which combine law enforcement and military operations with air support against the Threat flavor of the day .
" Urban Operations " makes it clear that , as in Fallujah , Panama City and occupied Palestine , sections of rebellious cities will be exploded by air strikes or plastic explosives because " rubble piles provide excellent covered and concealed positions " for invading Soldiers .
" Shantytowns " may be " knock[ed ] down and traversed [ by tanks ] without affecting mobility at all . "
Destruction of neighborhoods and vital infrastructure is termed " a necessary shaping operation . "
It is done to keep " insurgents " from merging with and politically mobilizing the populace .
Taking a lesson from the Pentagon , " Urban Operations " warns , " [ T ] hreat forces may not abide by international agreements , such as the Geneva Conventions . "
Nor will the idle , young , politically active , dark - skinned criminals necessarily play fair with Global Hawk budgets : " Threats will [ use ] decoys to absorb expensive and limited precision - guided munitions as well as cause misallocation of other critical Army resources . "
Hint , hint .
Even worse : " [ A ] disgruntled civilian population may attack or disrupt commercial activities as a political statement against the United States . "
Beware : " [ T ] errorist elements . . . may also employ ' rent - a- crowds ' — civilians paid or incited to demonstrate against military forces armed with only sticks , stones and Molotov cocktails . "
Taking a cue from Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet , " Urban Operations " recommends that Soldiers use sports stadiums as interrogation centers and holding facilities for the disgruntled masses .
As a final warning , Soldiers are reminded that video is a two - edged sword : " [ N]egative visual images of military operations presented by the media can change political objectives .
. . .
Commanders should . . . induce cooperation between the media and Army forces . . . successfully engaging the media as a force multiplier . "
And that is why you knew little or nothing about NORTHCOM and Global Hawk until today .
Force multipliers do n't report on those things .

Update : Apparently this site ( talking about the ways in which people blew their Google interviews ) links to me .
They highlighted my mention of the guy with the thick accent , implying I blew the interview by not understanding him .
I ’d like to clarify , that part of the experience was just a relevant part of the story , which is why I shared it .
I blew the Google Interview not for that reason , but because my algorithm skills simply were not up to snuff at the time .
Blaming the rejection on having a hard time with accents would be petty and silly .
I was rejected because I was n’t good enough , plain and simple .
Recently , I had the pleasure of interviewing with Google .
It was very exciting , as I ’ve wanted to work for Google for quite some time , and they opened up a branch near my home through an acquisition recently .
I wanted to share the process of interviewing with Google , not because it was particularly noteworthy , but because I wondered about interviewing with Google before I did so , and I figured others might .
I ’ve had to sign an NDA , so I ’m going to be pretty careful about what I share in this post .
The position I interviewed for was a Software Engineer position in the Boulder , Colorado office ( near where I live ) , but they still conduct their interviews from the California office .
Because I ’m not in California , I had to go through two phone interviews first .
The questions Google asks are pretty interesting for a number of reasons .
I think the best word I could use to describe the questions is “ fair ” .
I did n’t get any tricky puzzle questions .
Nobody asked me what I would do if I were shrunk to the size of a nickel and thrown in a blender .
Not a single question was an “ a - ha ! ” type brain - teaser .
Pretty much every question was a good question for figuring out if someone can write code .
Even though I was interviewing for a Java position , I only had one Java - specific question .
I could really feel from the questions that Google was n’t concerned with me being good with a specific language ; they really wanted to know if I was just a good coder .
When I was first told by the recruiter that the questions would be algorithm - based , I was worried I ’d have to reproduce quicksort or something .
In fact , the questions were far , far more reasonable ( though reviewing sorting algorithms WAS a good idea ) .
Most of them involved manipulating data in an array for some purpose .
I ’d give an answer that worked , and they ’d ask me if there were any corner cases .
I was asked to solve the problem in a way that avoided those problems .
Then I was asked to improve the space efficiency or running efficiency of the solution .
A solution that “ worked ” was never enough , the interviewers always pushed me further , trying to squeeze out performance .
I had to say the runtime complexity for nearly every solution I suggested .
I would NOT recommend interviewing with Google without a Computer Science degree .
You need to be able to look at a function and know the Big - O for it immediately .
Specifically , you need to look at YOUR OWN functions and know the Big - O immediately .
After doing well with both of these interviews , Google actually flew me out to California for a weekend for an all - day interview on the Google campus .
They paid for my plane ticket , hotel room , rental car , and some food .
I bought a second ticket for my fiancee and we did touristy crap around San Francisco .
Overall , it was a lot of fun , but I could n’t help but keep the back of my head occupied with the thought of an all - day interview .
On Monday , I went to the Google campus .
In the main lobby , they have a projector with a scrolling list of Google searches .
I sat in the lobby waiting for my interview to begin , happily watching the searches scroll by .
Lots of female celebrities were being searched , and someone searched for “ vista crack ” which made me laugh out loud , ensuring the receptionist thought I was an idiot .
I sent my fiancee a text message telling her to search for “ Rod is awesome ” but it did n’t show up .
They also had a neat visualization showing where people were doing searches on a spinning globe .
Pictures of Googlers with celebrities adorned the wall next to the new Google whiteboard .
For those that do n’t know , Google has a giant whiteboard which was finally erased not too long ago .
Before being erased , someone took pictures and posted them to the internet .
The new board was already mostly full by the time I saw it , and a large section of it was devoted to complaining about the board being erased .
I also had lunch in one of the cafes on campus .
The Google cafes are all buffet - style , and completely free .
You simply walk in , grab whatever the hell you want , and leave .
My “ lunch - date ” was one of my phone interviewers , and he took me to the health food cafe .
Salads , tofu , bean sprouts , and similar food items filled the buffet .
I searched desperately for some meat and filled my plate when I finally found it .
I ’m definitely NOT a California person .
People looked at me like I personally killed a cow in front of them .
The on - site interviews were much like the phone interviews .
I had one - on - one meetings with a handful of people , one after another .
Each person asked me algorithm - type questions .
I did some whiteboarding , but was mostly able to write the answers in my notebook , which was better for me as I could keep up with my brain much more easily on paper than on a whiteboard .
It was sometimes difficult to focus on the questions while “ OH MY GOD I ’M INTERVIEWING WITH FUCKING GOOGLE ” whizzed by in my brain over and over .
Luckily , pretty much everyone was extremely friendly , which helped calm my considerable nerves .
The biggest difference in the questions between phone and on - site interviews was how my answers had to be presented .
On the phone , it was sufficient that I explain , at a high - level , how the solution to a problem would work .
On - site , I had to actually write it out .
Of my four interviewers , two actually wanted it to be valid Java .
I finished early with one of my interviewers , and he asked me a joke question : if a Stormtrooper shoots a red - shirt , does he hit ?
It was comical how universal this seemed .
Of course I ’d know what he was talking about , I write software .
Luckily , I was familiar with the term redshirt from being a film nerd , and I was able to come up with a joke answer that did n’t let him on to the fact I ’ve never seen a single episode of Star Trek in my life .
The worst part of the process was my fourth and final interview of the day .
The guy was from Moscow , and he had a very thick accent .
All of my life , I ’ve had immense trouble with accents , even slight ones .
My project manager at work has a thick accent from Italy , and she basically sounds like Chewbacca to me .
I ’m not complaining that Moscow Guy had an accent ( all tech companies have folks with accents ) , but it sure made the rest of the interview process challenging for me .
My interview with the Moscow Guy resembled one of those satellite interviews on the news .
He ’d say something to me , and there ’d be this long pause before I responded .
To make matters worse , he told me his first question was going to be “ an easy one ” , so when I barely understood what he said at all , I imagine I looked like a complete imbecile .
“ What was that ?
You want me to WHAT two numbers together ?
Mo de ploy ?
Mah dah bu ?
Oh , multiply !
Right , two times two is four .
I ’m obviously an idiot . ”
To make matters worse , the Moscow guy was the only person I talked to the entire day who was n’t friendly .
He was n’t a complete jerk or anything , but he definitely was n’t as warm as my other interviewers .
Right before the interview ended , he asked me what I ’d work on for my “ 20 % time ” project .
Each Google employee gets to devote 20 % of their time to a side project , which is why so many of the Google Labs projects exist ( like Gmail and Movie Search ) .
I actually had an answer to this question , since I thought about it on the plane ride out to California .
There ’s been a side project I ’ve been wanting to work on at home , but I have n’t had time .
I figured , if I got the job , I ’d just make that a Google Labs project and do it there .
I explained my idea to him , and he told me it sounded interesting , then proceeded to write it down right in front of me .
All I could think was “ I hope I get this job so I do n’t regret that . ”
I imagine the four interview feedback e-mails looked like this :
“ Candidate knew his stuff , but seemed awfully nervous . ”
“ Candidate knew his stuff and seemed relatively comfortable . ”
“ Candidate kept joking around like I was his friend .
Clearly was not nervous enough , given that he was interviewing at FUCKING GOOGLE . ”
“ Candidate seemed to have the brain of a chimp .
Was surprised he could speak without forgetting to breathe .
Interviewer confident candidate eats glue . ”
I flew back to Colorado feeling pretty good about the whole thing .
As it turns out , though , I was told over the phone ( while trying to push a car out of the snow during the Denver blizzard ) that I did n’t get the position .
I need to work on my algorithm skills , so I guess I got docked for not thinking of the best solution right away .
The Google Recruiter told me it was n’t the last guy that did me in , but I ca n’t help but wonder how close I was to writing this blog post from a desk at Google .
Considering how much I wanted the job , I admit I ’m pretty bummed about this .
I ’m allowed to re-apply in a year , but I ca n’t imagine improving my “ algorithm skills ” without more information on where my problem areas were .
What ’s really unfortunate is that I know if Google had hired me , I ’d have done a good job .
If I see my idea appear on Google Labs any time soon , I ’m going to go nuts .
All in all , it was a pretty pleasant experience .
I ’m disappointed , but I ’m proud of myself for at least being considered seriously by Google .
It was honestly kind of fun answering their interview questions .
The questions reminded me of my undergraduate work , and it was nice to think about that kind of material again .
I ’m bummed that my progress into the world of Google came to such a screeching halt , but the journey has definitely been fun and interesting .
And hey , I got a free trip to San Francisco out of it .

It can sometimes seem like there are two competing ways to make a decision about any complex matter of evidence based medicine .
One is to purchase and digest â€ œHow to Read a Paper : The Basics of Evidence - Based Medicine â€ by Professor Trisha Greenhalgh ( BMA Books , a life changing experience if you have a week to spare ) , and then find , read , and critically appraise every single published academic study independently and in full for yourself .
The other more common method is to rely on â€œexpertsâ€ , or what I like to call â€œprejudiceâ€ .
But there is a third way : what we might call â€ œEvidence Based Prejudiceâ€ .
I canâ€™t possibly debunk every single alternative therapy column you will ever read : but if I could show that their single most popular claim has no foundation , then you could safely ignore everything else they say , thus saving valuable brain energy , and freeing up extra time for you to write best - selling novels and eradicate world poverty .
And so to antioxidants .
The basic claim of the alternative therapy industry is as follows : free radicals in the body are bad , but antioxidants neutralise free radicals ; people who eat vegetables with antioxidants in them live longer , therefore antioxidant tablets are good .
Now this â€œfree - radicals - bad antioxidants - goodâ€ morality tale looks great on paper : but if youâ€™re going to read a biochemistry textbook and pull bits out at random , you can prove anything you like .
For example , my phagocytic cells build a wall around invading pathogens and then use free radicals â€ “ amongst other things – to kill the bacteria off , before the bacteria kill me .
Theyâ€™re probably doing it right now , somewhere in here .
So do I need free radical supplements to help me fight infections ?
Sounds plausible .
You can see , now , how I could make some serious money if I ever turned to the dark side ( alternative therapists , why not just pick some more chemicals at random from Stryer Biochemistry , 5th Ed. ) .
Of course the â€œantioxidants goodâ€ story didnâ€™t come entirely out of the blue : it came , like almost all the evidence on diet and health , from observational studies .
People who eat well , with plenty of fruit and vegetables in their diet , tend to live longer , healthier lives .
But these are observational studies , not intervention studies .
These are not studies where you take a few thousand people and make them eat salad .
These are surveys , looking at people who already have healthy diets : people like me , and since youâ€ ™re asking , I also cycle to work , get a good nightâ€™s sleep , have a fairly comfortable lifestyle , a stable relationship , and a plausible career .
People like me do live longer ( thanks for asking ) but itâ€™s not just the antioxidants in our rocket salad .
So what happens , then , when people do big studies , forcing people to eat salad ?
Well itâ€™s not an easy thing to do , if only because itâ€™s difficult to get people to eat what you tell them , and measure what they eat , and check if theyâ€™re truthful , and so on : the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial in the 1970s was probably the single biggest medical project ever undertaken , it took 12,866 men , advised them , monitored them , cajoled them , persuaded them , followed them up for a decade , and found little benefit from dietary change .
Intervention trials for diet have continued , since then , to produce negative results .
Maybe theyâ€™re technically too difficultâ€ ¦
But what about vitamin tablets ?
Theyâ€™re easy to study , in the sense that itâ€™s easy to take a tablet – easier than changing your whole food lifestyle – easy to find a placebo control for , and so on .
And there have been innumerable studies , and systematic reviews of those studies , and meta - analyses of those studies , and they have found no benefit for antioxidants .
A meta-analysis â€ “ a mathematical combination of lots of smaller studies to give one larger and more accurate answer – of 15 studies , a total of over 200,000 patients , being followed up for between 1 and 12 years , found no benefit for cardiovascular outcomes .
The current Cochrane Review on antioxidants and bowel cancer had just as many patients , and again found no benefit for the pills .
That must be the single most prevalent claim of the whole alternative therapy industry : and it is in stark contradiction of the experience of hundreds of thousands of individuals who have been carefully studied in these trials , examining the very advice the alternative therapy industry is giving .
If they canâ€™t get that one thing right , why would you listen to them on anything else ?
