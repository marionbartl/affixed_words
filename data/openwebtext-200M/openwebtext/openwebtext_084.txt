Since I ’ve been away from the Haskell world for a long time , it ’s been interesting to return and observe some surprises about the practical side of working with the language .
For me , an early gotcha has been the relative paucity of information on how to obtain and install third - party software packages .
So here ’s my little contribution , in the form of simple instructions for the newcomer .
I hope that someone will find them useful .
If you ’re using Debian , you ’re in great shape ; there ’s a good chance that whatever third - party package you ’re interested in is already available .
Whatever the Haskell package is named , if there ’s a corresponding Debian package , it will ave a lowercase name .
So here ’s how use the regular package management tools to see if , for example , the indispensable MissingH is available : Nice !
Whether you prefer to do your Haskell hacking with hugs or ghc , you ’re set .
The “ libghc6 - ” prefix indicates that the package is for use with ghc , while the ” libhugs - ” prefix denotes a hugs - specific version of the same package .
Fedora users are n’t nearly so well - off .
While hugs and ghc themselves are up to date and available in Fedora Extras , there are few third - party Haskell packages available .
There exists a Fedora Haskell project , but it ’s moribund ; there are no packages available for FC6 , for example .
To level the playing field , I ’ll discuss how to build and install a third - party project that I ’m fairly sure has n’t yet been turned into a Debian or other package .
The first thing you should know is that Haskell has a de facto standard way of managing software packages , called Cabal .
Cabal ’s concept of a package is similar to , but independent of , the packages that your operating system ’s package manager handles .
A Cabal package has a name , a version number , and dependencies , but Cabal does n’t know anything about the operating system ’s packages ; it has its own independent database of packages .
If you use ghc , you can find out what packages Cabal thinks are installed using the “ ghc- pkg list ” command .
I ’m not going to discuss any of Cabal ’s more interesting features here ; I just want to illustrate the basics , because I could n’t even find those a few days ago .
The third - party package I ’m going to work with is a new one , Martin Grabmueller ’s rdtsc .
It ’s easiest to download using Darcs .
A lovely feature of Cabal is that it acknowledges that people do n’t necessarily want to install packages as root ; you can install a package into a directory that ’s specific to you , and Cabal will maintain a package database of your personal packages , as well as those installed system - wide .
If you want to install a “ you - only ” package , it ’s simple .
This will print a lot of output , some of which is downright confusing and scary - looking :
As far as I can tell , Cabal is merely complaining that some software that it would like to use , but that is n’t necessary , is missing .
Unless configure explicitly says there ’s an error , and exits with an error code , the build should run fine .
Configuring for a system - wide install is just as easy ; merely omit the “ –user ” and “ –prefix ” options .
( Just remember that you ’ll need to run the final install step as root if you ’re doing a system - wide install . )
The next step is to build the package .
And finally , the installation step .
Cabal remembers whether you specified “ –user ” and the prefix you used when you configured the package , so you do n’t need to tell it a second time .
After the install , ghc - pkg should be able to find the package :
The last two lines of output are what we were looking for .
We have the package installed !
It should now be available to both ghc and the interactive interpreter :
This stuff is actually documented , and quite thoroughly so , but I found it amazingly hard to find .
If you do n’t already know that ( a ) there ’s a standard Haskell packaging mechanism and ( b ) exactly what commands you must run to work with it , it ’s surprisingly hard to construct a Google query that will return a result that gives you any practical clue of what to do .
Finally , thanks to the wonderful denizens of #haskell for guiding me through the maze over the past few days .
Last year I cooked up the big family Thanksgiving dinner all by myself – no mean feat for a young guy .
How did I do it ?
I made most of it three days before and froze or refrigerated the various dishes .
I even made the gravy beforehand .
Now , usually I ’m super stressed when I have to cook for company .
That day , one of the biggest extravaganzas of mass food consumption , I was cool as a cucumber .
In preparing for the big day , I asked my parents for any make - ahead recipes they might have .
In reply , my mom gave me her nearly new Better Homes and Gardens Make - Ahead Recipe Book from 1970 - something .
Did you know food was fluorescent in the seventies ?
It was !
And almost all of the dishes were carefully held together in a lifelike assemblage of gelatin and frozen vegetables .
Know the strata .
Fear the strata .
Needless to say , I did n’t use the book .
I found a make - ahead Thanksgiving menu on the internet instead .
If Suzie Theodorou had of been around though and her book , Can I Freeze It ?
were around I might have looked for it .
It sounds like the make - ahead Bible .
From the book description :
In Can I Freeze It ? veteran food writer and stylist Susie Theodorou explains the tips , tricks , and rules of freezing food , from containers and wrappers ( foil or Tupperware ? ) to the best methods for retaining moisture and flavor to what ingredients and dishes can and ca n’t be frozen .
She provides a wealth of recipes , along with color photographs , for whole and partial dishes .
Some are completely preassembled ( for example , chicken in a marinade ) , frozen , and cooked later .
Others combine frozen ingredients with fresh ones — pair a pastry from the freezer with berries from a farm stand , or defrost a sauce and use it to top fish straight from the market .
I did n’t have to sweat it out in the kitchen for Easter this year but before you know it Thanksgiving will be around again – maybe I should start looking for Can I Freeze It ? now .

Just because something wo n’t die does n’t mean it ’s good idea .
For those lucky 2 of you in America that never heard of the “ No Gas Day ” idea , is goes like this : just about every year since 1999 , someone has decided that we should try to lower gas prices by boycotting the gas pumps for one entire day .
Gas company profits will fall !
Prices will drop by 30 cents or more due the sudden decrease in demand !
Our consumer outrage will be heard and our demands will be met !
Only , it does n’t work .
It did n’t work in 1999 , or 2000 , and it ’s not going to work in 2007 , either .
First of all , I ’m not getting down on “ hippies ” or environmentalists at all .
I ’ve mentioned before , I ’m a staunch environmentalist who has gone as far as not buying anything new in the name of saving the planet ( and a significant amount of money ) .
I see the good intentions of a “ No Gas Day . ”
But I also see the insanely flawed logic , and even worse , how detrimental such an idea can be to our long term gas prices .
Sexy , Not Effective
People want to participate in a “ No Gas Day ” because it ’s easy , and it sounds ever so sexy and powerful .
“ Yeah !
I wo n’t buy gas today , how do you like that , oil man ? ”
But it does n’t make any real sense .
First of all , the average consumer probably does n’t fill their tank more than once a week , let alone every day .
So we can only assume that gas companies do n’t measure sales on a daily basis , but more likely , a weekly one .
A “ No Gas Day ” would n’t even register a blip on their radar , since everyone will likely fill up their tank some other day that week .
Also , you have to consider the actual way a boycott works .
Remember learning about Rosa Parks and the Montgomery Bus Boycott in school ( or , if you happen to be old enough to remember it yourself ) ?
A one day bus boycott would n’t have really made a big difference to the bus companies , because everyone would just be riding again the next day .
Sure , they would have lost that much of one day ’s profits , but if everything returned to normal the next day , do you really think they would have changed their racial seating policy ?
No .
Instead , it took a year - long boycott and the intervention of the Supreme Court to change the Alabama law that dictated the bus companies ’ policies .
Could you give up gas for a year ?
If you , and many others , could , it might actually make a difference .
There Is Another Way
It does n’t have to be as extreme as a year - long complete boycott of gas .
Sure , that would help .
But if you live in the middle of nowhere ( like me ) and need a car to get anywhere , and have n’t yet figured out how to get your car to run on coffee , you can still find ways to cut back on your gas consumption .
Yes , this is the real way to show the gas companies you ’re mad as hell and not going to take it any more : slow and steady reduction .
Most of this is n’t going to be news to you – you ’ve probably heard it all before .
But how much of it are you actually doing ?
Carpool , bike , rollerblade , or walk , when you can .
Or just stay home !
When choosing between two fun activities , include the distance you ’ll have to drive in your decision - making .
Make right turns instead of left turns .
Do n’t speed .
Empty your trunk – extra weight uses more gas .
When you buy a new car , make fuel efficiency a major priority .
Combine errands – if you have a bunch of things to do in the same area this week , do them all in one day instead of driving out there multiple times .
The average American family has more than two cars .
Try to drive the most fuel efficient one .
( Get used to saying “ Let ’s take my car – it gets better gas mileage ! ” )
Tips like these will save your pocketbook in the “ now , ” as well as help cut down on overall demand for gas in this country , which should lower gas prices and save you money in the “ then . ”
Anybody else have some fuel efficiency tips to add ?
The Danger
I really do believe “ No Gas Day ” is a dangerous idea .
People feel like they ’re making a difference , but they ’re really having no impact .
And because they feel like they did good , they can also feel like they ’re excused for things like having a gas guzzling SUV that they do n’t need , or anything else they might do ( but know better ) .
The excuse “ Yeah , but I participated in No Gas Day ! ” is useless , and gives the false idea that a simple stunt can make a real impact .
So fill up your tank on May 15th , 2007 … but only if you really need gas .

A stylish new all - electric city car is about to hit the streets of the UK 's congested towns and cities .
Designed and built in Italy , it is rapidly becoming the must - have city transport for the style conscious Italians who are looking for an environmentally friendly vehicle for town driving .
Designed around a stainless steel chassis with all independent suspension the compact two seater , it is less than nine foot long , has a surprising amount of storage space under the bonnet and behind the high back contoured seats , and the front opening doors makes it easy for even the tallest person to get in and out of .
Click to enlarge
The Maranello4 is manufactured by the EFFIDI Automotive Group , and marketed in the UK by London based Sakura Battery Company .
The all electric powered car has a top speed of 30 MPH and a range of around 45 miles on a charge .
It is exempt from the London congestion charge and parking is free in many areas .

With the saving on fuel , the congestion charge , parking in London and zero road tax , the Maranello4 could almost pay for itself in the first year for many London buyers .
" Due to the demand in Europe delivery times are typically around six to eight weeks , but our partners EFFIDI are working to increase production , so we hope by the end of this year no one will have to wait more than four weeks " said Sakura Battery MD Dan Hornby .

Disenchantment ...
Will you be enchanted ?
Hi all ,
So I meant to get this review up at the beginning of the week but life happened so I 'm posting the night before the release of Matt Groening 's new show , Disenchantment , worldwide on Netflix .
So here for delectation is my rambling , hopefully helpful review ...
It s been almost 20 years since the launch of Matt Groening s last show , Futurama but on Friday 17th August Netflix will launch all 10 episodes of his newest show , Disenchantment .
I was lucky enough to get access to the first 5 episodes ( actually it was 7 but I didnt want to binge all 7 for the purposes of a review ) .
This is a relatively spoiler free review of those first 5 episodes from the perspective of a Futurama diehard .
But also from someone who is realistic about whats bad and whats good .
Ill be the first to admit Futurama had some dud episodes but there were handful of episodes that were some of the best television of the last 10 years .
Disenchantment has a high bar to clear .
So I came into this show with quite high expectations .
Matt Groening , animation by Rough Draft who produced Futurama , music by Mark Mothersbaugh , some of the best Futurama writers including Futurama co-creator David X Cohen , Futurama voice cast
This all sounded great and to sum up my feelings on the show , I loved it .
But with some caveats .
Some bigger than others .
The basic concept for the show is thus ; its about a Princess , Bean , who doesnt really want to be a Princess and would rather gamble , drink and hook up with guys and go off and have her own adventures .
So she hates the fact she is being forced into a marriage created mainly for political reasons .
For reasons that dont really matter just yet , a personal demon , Luci , assigns himself to her and makes it his job to persuade her to misbehave and generally cause trouble .
Shes also joined by Elfo , an elf who escapes his kingdom fearing hes missing out on the world .
Together under the watchful and frustrated eye of her father King Zog we follow their adventures around the kingdom of  Dreamland .
There is quite a lot going on with this show so I m going to break it down into some elements to make it easier .
The first area is animation which is easy to sum up - fantastic !
Rough Draft have really out done themselves on this .
While the character work is relatively the same quality as on Futurama there is some interesting work going on with Luci who is jet black with eyes and no other defining look .
This makes for some interesting movements and some good comedic moments like when Bean kicks him against the wall and he slowly rolls down it like a sticky toy .
Elfo also seems slightly devolved in his look like hes jumped straight out of the pages of Groening s comic strip Life in Hell .
And I like that about him !
But where the visuals really stand out is some of the amazing painted backgrounds and sets .
Rather than being drawn like Futurama or the Simpsons these have far more detail and look gorgeous .
It also adds to the whole fantasy world setting much more .
The 3D work is also really seamless .
While on Futurama it stood out more that was ok because it was a sci fi show , this is nt so it needs to blend in with the new painted backgrounds which for the most part it does very well .
It will be interesting to see what flourishes they come up with as the show gets going and gets more adventurous with plots and locations .
Then on top of all that is some really nice opening credits which show scenes from the episode underneath the credits made out of simplified outlines in different tones of greens or blues etc .
Its really nice .
Next up are the actors , which again is hard to find fault with .
All the Futurama cast bar Katey Sagal are here which is an embarrassment of riches in itself .
These are people on the top of their game and its hard not to be in awe .
They re also joined by Abbi Jacobson as Bean , Eric André as Luci and Nat Faxon as Elfo .
They re well cast too .
Jacobson brings a rebellious but often insecure quality to Bean which makes her likeable from the start while Eric André is obviously having fun being a very smooth kind of evil and his droll delivery of put downs are fun to hear roll off his tongue .
My favourite of the three is Nat Faxon though .
Is zany delivery always gets a laugh but he can also dial it back to bring some real heart to the confused , slightly stupid little elf .
Other actors such as Matt Berry , Lucy Montgomery and Noel Fielding are fun too and while its shame theres not more Billy West its great to see Maurice LaMarche and Tress MacNeille with leading roles .
The real stand out though , is John DiMaggio as King Zog .
It s hard not to wonder how he has a voice anymore after you hear him rant and rave at Bean .
You can almost hear the veins on his neck pulsing .
But the great thing about his performance is not all the yelling but how he manages to convey a character with real depth .
While hes a very angry and demanding King its obvious hes quite insecure and is sometimes torn between making Bean do what he thinks is right and gradually realising he cant really control her and that tradition makes her miserable .
It s really great to hear and scenes with him often really crackle .
I particularly like the way he looks at things , vocalising his inner thoughts as he casts his eye over the different parts .
Mark Mothersbaugh from the band Devo who also created the fantastic score for Thor : Ragnarok last year has provided the music , including a very catchy theme tune .
The music has a grand fantasy feel to it that s been mixed in with some nutty rhythms and eccentric brass instruments and many more elements .
It s really great and adds so much to some scenes that sometimes might be lacking a bit of zip .
More on that later .
So plenty of great ingredients there so what are the actual stories like ?
In short , very good but certainly with room to grow as the characters and writers fall into a rhythm .
One thing that can be said is that the plotting is pretty much solid all the way through .
These are folk who really know how to break a story and create good arcs both within episodes and longer ones for characters .
Groening has said that for this they wrote the stories and then added jokes and you can tell as the rhythm of each episode moves well with not many instances of skipping over plot points or lingering too long within scenes that dont require it .
Sometimes the pacing could be a bit quicker but it doesnt often feel like were in a scene for no reason .
The first two episodes act more as a two part pilot and were the strongest of the 5 I saw .
While it starts off a little slowly as were introduced to the world and our main protagonist it quickly picks up and by the time we meet Elfo a few minutes in the plot is moving along well and the jokes are flowing .
The scene in Elfos home land is very funny and reminded me a little of Santas elves in Futurama though doing a lot better for themselves .
It also has one of the darkest jokes so far where one of the characters gets hung but then is too light so someone suggests just stabbing them .
It s very funny for sure ( trust me ) but it shows a real bite which does seem to appear more regularly than on Futurama or The Simpsons .
Matt Groening has said this show is more adult and I think this is what he means rather than putting in strong language , really crude humour all the time ( though there is some of course ! ) or really edgy plots that aim to offend .
It almost seems like some of the darker humour from Life in Hell ( still some of Groenings finest , unfiltered work ) is making its way onto the show and I for one welcome that .
But back to the first two episodes .
It has to be said what an achievement it is for these two .
Nostalgia always plays a part affecting our memories but if you re really honest the first episodes of most shows including Futurama and The Simpsons were not huge successes .
They were good for sure but its hard to set up a new world and new characters in just half an hour .
If you look at Futurama , it does a solid job of setting up the show but there was lots that it grew into .
Fry was a slightly stupid but earnest character .
Leela was very bossy and Bender was mainly a sarcastic , selfish robot .
Think about how much that show blossomed and added so many more layers in just following few episodes .
Dont get me wrong I really love that episode but the really great stuff comes later .
On Disenchantment they seem very sure of their world early on .
A lot of the characters have direction early on and you understand a lot of what they re about .
The parts with Elfo were the most enjoyable as he journeys through Dreamland encountering lots of weird things and creatures including a very funny war .
By the end of the episode were all set with a 3 piece gang ready for adventures .
The next three episodes are good but maybe suffer a little from growing pains .
There s some really great stuff with Elfo & Luci plus we get to know more of Beans insecurities but I couldnt help wanting them to go and find some weird creatures in the land and in episode 4 when Bean throws a  Castle Party  after Zog goes away it kind of feels like weve seen this sort of story many times before .
Luckily there is some good character work and you start to really see Beans loneliness and how she lives .
It seems so far that the show really hits a rhythm with story and especially jokes when were away from the castle in particular like when at the end of episode 5 we meet a very twisted version of Hansel and Gretel .
But the writers are certainly having fun creating this world , from versions of modern things such as police chases to  Land Vikings  there are some really enjoyable twists on the fantasy and medieval tropes .
The joke rate in these episodes is maybe not as consistent as you might expect but its not that the jokes arent landing its just there are less .
The focus is more on story and character .
Im putting this down to the show finding its way and I m sure by the end of this season well be moving along at more of a click .
And its certainly better to pick your jokes when they re funny rather than throwing so many at the wall to see what sticks .
Ahem , Family Guy .
The humour of the show seems much more akin to Futurama .
While The Simpsons got most of its jokes out of satire or very relatable family situations , Futurama was about people who werent sure where they were going but were trying to have fun anyway and the jokes came from that .
It was a much more loose show that felt it could go anywhere and I m sure it will .
That s really what it comes down to .
The show is growing into itself and has all the ingredients for something amazing .
For now its just great with a lot of potential and already some really noteworthy moments under its belt .
Im really enjoying it so far , things are looking good for this show and I cant wait to dive into more episodes .
Though I wont be binging and I wouldnt recommend it .
You re going to want to savour this .
It s not often a Matt Groening show comes along and when youve watched it its another year until season 2 !
It s your choice but theres something to be said with enjoying an episode and letting it sink in rather than sitting for 5 hours and being done with it !

Tens of thousands of people have died in Iraq since the US - led invasion of March 2003 .
But exactly how many Iraqi lives have been lost is a controversial topic , with estimates varying wildly .
More than 4,000 coalition soldiers have died , but US forces do not keep complete records of civilians killed .
Nor does the Iraqi government have a precise figure .
Health ministry estimates in November 2006 ranged from 100,000 to 150,000 dead .
This contrasts with a survey of Iraqi households in the Lancet , which suggested that - by July 2006 - about 655,000 Iraqi deaths were " a consequence of the war " .
A survey published in September 2007 suggested that up to 1.2 m people might have died because of the conflict .
UK - based polling agency Opinion Research Business extrapolated the figure by asking a random sample of 1,461 Iraqi adults .
These estimates are higher than the running total of reported civilian deaths maintained by the campaign group , Iraq Body Count .
Using two media reports as its source for each death , IBC says the civilian death toll by October 2007 was between 74,000 and 81,000 .
But the organisation also warns that many deaths may not have been reported .
These pages - updated monthly - give an overview of the most recent estimates .

One of the most beautiful family star clusters in the sky has been captured by NASA 's Spitzer Space Telescope .
The dazzling Seven Sisters are swaddled in a cushiony veil by clouds of dust and bathed in a green and orange light .
More follows ...
The sisters , also known as the Pleiades , have been joined by Venus in the evening sky over the past three days .
Star gazers can also expect to see the crescent moon between them on April 19th .
The star cluster in the Taurus constellation is 400 light years from earth , and was born when dinosaurs still roamed our planet , about 100 million years ago .
The 19th - century poet Alfred Lord Tennyson described them as " glittering like a swarm of fireflies tangled in a silver braid " .

The handicap of high socio-economic status in attractive males
Abstract
Highest ratings were consistently given to attractive males of medium status rather than high status .
( Article in Press ) Simon Chu et al .
Empirical evidence concerning human mate - choice preferences suggests that females should select partners on the basis of cues to genetic quality and / or ability to contribute resources to childcare .
Paradoxically , while high levels of both factors should be an attractive combination to females , they might also dissuade females from entering into a relationship with such males since , by definition , they are likely to be highly attractive to other females , and therefore might increase the likelihood that such a male may cheat or desert the relationship .
If so , females should be wary of entering into long - term relationships with physically attractive , high status males as compared with males of lower physical attractiveness or status .
We asked females to rate a number of different males in terms of attractiveness as a long - term partner .
Females were presented with attractive , average and unattractive male faces paired with lonely - hearts advertisements implying high , medium or low socio- economic status .
We suggest that females see physically attractive , high status males as being more likely to pursue a mating strategy rather than parenting strategy .
Under particular circumstances , high socio- economic status in males can be subtly counter - productive in terms of attractiveness as a long - term partner .

The star is in the equatorial constellation of Ophiuchus
The star flared up suddenly last February , briefly becoming 1,000 times brighter than normal .
RS Ophiuchi is close to destroying itself in a nuclear explosion called a type 1a supernova , scientists report in the journal Nature .
These are among the brightest phenomena in the Universe , radiating five billion times as much light as the Sun .
They are so bright they can be seen far across the cosmos .
They also seem to be remarkably uniform - they always appear to give off the same amount of light , so that their visibility from Earth , dimmed only by their immense distance , has been used to measure the size of the Universe .
The only problem , which is a great embarrassment to astronomers , is that they have never seen a type 1a close up - their measurements are all based on theory .
They are very rare events in our galaxy .
It seems certain a type 1a was seen in our galaxy in 1572 by the great Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe , who first coined the term nova , for " new star " , not realising he was in fact witnessing the violent end of an unknown star .
Death throes
It has long been believed that type 1a supernovae are the death throes of white dwarf stars .
But all modern ones have been so distant that it has not been possible to see what had been there beforehand .
The explosion is so energetic it actually lifts an envelope of material off the surface of the star and throws it off into space
Jeno Sokoloski , Harvard University
Several times in the past century it has flared up , as if in a failed supernova explosion .
It is as if a thermonuclear flame has swept across the face of the star without quite catching hold .
The last time it flared up was in 1985 , when astronomers ' technology was not up to catching all the details .
With space - based telescopes and large arrays of radio dishes , this has all changed .
Writing in the journal Nature , a team of astronomers said they managed to detect a plume of gaseous material thrown out by the conflagration .
" The explosion is so energetic it actually lifts an envelope of material off the surface of the star and throws it off into space , " lead author Jeno Sokoloski , of Harvard University , US , told the BBC's Science in Action programme .
By tracking the plume , she adds , they could learn more about the star that launched it .
" It started slowing down almost immediately , within just two days , and that tells us the white dwarf must be extremely massive ; in fact , almost massive enough to collapse . "
Critical mass
Theory says that white dwarfs self destruct when their mass equals 1.4 Suns .
RS Oph is nearing that critical mass .
It is slowly gobbling up material from a nearby giant star , gaining a millionth of a solar mass every decade .
At the moment , sitting just below the critical mass , the novae on RS Oph blow themselves out , achieving brief episodes of brilliance .
But soon , RS Oph could pass the tipping point .
It is not a certainty ; RS Oph could just as easily be eating itself up in these explosions .
But if it does reach the critical mass , it will collapse in on itself and blow apart .
How soon that might happen is not clear .
" It could be tomorrow , but most likely it'll be 1,000 , 10,000 , 100,000 years from now , " says Jeno Sokoloski .
Whenever it happens , it will be , she says , a spectacular event , outshining the planets , so that its final glory will be visible against the daytime sky .
In the meantime , astronomers will be studying the star closely , to watch its every step towards destruction , and hoping to understand the full details of one of the heavens ' great mysteries .
Experiences of Using PHP in Large Websites

1. Introduction
The PHP scripting language has an enjoyed an enormous growth in popularity over the past few years .
It benefits from being particularly easy to pick up , and from having been designed as a language specifically for producing webpages .
This means that choosing PHP as your implementation language allows you to build a dynamically - generated webpage quickly and easily .
However , it is not clear how well PHP scales for use in larger commercial websites .
This paper examines the issues in trying to do so .
Issues covered include :
Separation of presentation from business logic
Using a team of developers to build a site
Problems that are hard to find in development , but can readily trip you up in deployed sites
Areas where PHP ’s initial simplicity can actually make things more complicated
We concentrate on the last of these , and on the irony that a language which hopes to distinguish itself by its simplicity is in many cases inappropriate because of its complexity .
The conclusion arrived at is that , in some circumstances at least , PHP ’s tendency to create more problems than it solves makes it an inappropriate choice .
However , we also recognise that there are some situations in which PHP is to be used .
For those who find themselves in such situations , we use the experience gained from using PHP in a range of sites ( including the geographic search engine Somewherenear.com and a multi-million - dollar e-commerce site in the canning industry ) to offer some guidance on how best to deal with PHP ’s deficiencies .
Finally , we identify a checklist of pertinent questions for determining PHP ’s suitability for a given project .
2. Separation of Presentation from Business Logic
Modern websites are expected to be able to react quickly to changing demands .
For the developers , this translates into a need to be able to change the content and the look of a website with a minimum of effort .
It has long been recognised that the most effective way of meeting this need is to enforce a separation of presentation ( the purely æsthetic look of a site ) from business logic ( what the site actually does ) .
A separation of this sort also allows websites to be built by two teams of developers : one responsible for the business logic , and another responsible for the design .
Since few capable programmers are equally capable when it comes to visual design , this is a significant advantage .
Unfortunately , PHP , far from promoting such a separation , actually promotes the inverse .
The whole point of PHP is to combine the HTML that forms the site ’s look with the business logic — the code that produces the site ’s content , which in turn is presumably derived from a database .
Even inexperienced programmers have little difficulty understanding of HTML markup with the code that generates the content ; this in turn makes PHP an easy language to learn and to teach .
And compared to the common alternative of generating HTML markup with a programming language ’s print function , this certainly represents a significant improvement in readability and writability .
However , the effect this has is precisely the opposite of that desired : the business logic and the presentation are thoroughly commingled .
This makes incremental design changes particularly hard .
An uncharitable observer might speculate that this is why so few PHP - driven websites receive timely improvements to their æsthetics and user interface .
How then should you cope with this disadvantage ?
The only option is for the developers to voluntarily impose on themselves a disciplined separation that the language cannot enforce .
The basic approach is as follows :
Divide every PHP page up into two parts : the former performs database queries and does whatever else is needed to calculate the content for the page , before storing the calculated content into a series of variables which — and this is crucial — contain no markup .
Then the latter part of the page can simply embed variable values into HTML markup , using loops where appropriate to traverse potentially - complex data structures containing the actual content .
Should the site ’s design need to change at a later date , it is likely that many alterations can be made only to the latter part of the page ; the business logic ( which was presumably written with significant attention to security and correctness ) should remain as it is .
In some cases , it may even be possible to put the two parts of the page in separate files .
This approach can be augmented with any of a wide of variety of templating systems built in PHP — or even something like XSLT , given that roll - your - own templating systems are never quite powerful enough .
Once you ’ve made the decision to use a templating system of some sort , it ’s worth stopping to consider what PHP actually gains you in comparison with a templating system for some other language — given that mixing code and markup is one of the PHP ’s defining features .
3. Using a Team of Developers
PHP seems to be aimed predominantly at lone developers , rather than at teams attempting to develop serious websites .
The single biggest problem with PHP qua team development language is its paucity of namespaces .
All functions live in a single namespace , with no exceptions .
This has the following consequences :
You can redefine a function defined by another member of the team .
Developers need to have extremely good lines of communication to avoid this .
Even worse , you can redefine a built - in function used in code written by another developer .
File inclusion ( PHP ’s main mechanism for code reuse ) tends to exacerbate this problem : trying to use code written anywhere else can be a portability nightmare .
Significant problems crop up even outside the function namespace .
PHP has historically defaulted to allowing undeclared variables with no warnings ; this exacerbates the single - namespace problem for developers trying to collaborate .
Relying on the register_globals setting in the php.ini file ( as many projects do ) further compounds this problem , as we discuss in more detail below .
4. Deployment Problems
Many aspects of the PHP language can be configured dynamically using a php.ini file .
Developers accustomed to traditional languages are typically surprised to discover that the php.ini file allows them to configure such features as whether certain global variables are created implicitly ( register_globals ) and whether incoming data is arbitrarily munged ( magic_quotes_gpc ) .
The ability to change the language in this way is in one sense a good thing : some of the most awkward parts of the language can — and should — be disabled during development .
For example , it ’s best to configure PHP to throw an error when you try to use unassigned variables ; this makes PHP more similar to programming languages which require all variables must be declared before use .
However , this can lead to problems in deployment .
The biggest issue with the php.ini file is that there can be only one per web server .
For a web application that will not share hardware with other sites this is n’t much of a problem , but it is n’t universally the case that this can be accomplished .
It ’s common for companies to deploy many smaller sites on one machine , to save on hardware , bandwidth , and administration costs .
It ’s also common for sites to be deployed on servers managed by web - hosting companies .
With web hosts in particular , if the hosting company configures PHP in one way , every site served by that hosting company will have to use that configuration .
With Perl , by contrast , each individual source file specifies ( for example ) whether it has ‘ strict ’ variable declarations .
Another problem thrown up in deployment is that you ca n’t in general rely on a web host having any particular version of PHP .
To all intents and purposes , this requires that the developers both know what version of PHP will be on the web host , and in addition use the same version for development .
Ironically , the effect of this problem is diminished by the presence of security holes in a number of PHP versions : web hosts in particular are likely to use more recent versions of PHP because they contain fixes for vulnerabilities in earlier versions .
Related to the versioning issue is one of module availability .
One of the advantages claimed for PHP over languages such as Perl is that ‘ everything is built in ’ .
Where Perl requires you to download and install , say , a library that provides access to a given database server , for PHP such code is an integral part of the language implementation .
The problem , of course , is that a given web host might not provide a particular module that your code relies on .
For PHP , this is essentially impossible to fix without the assistance of the web server administrator ; for a language like Perl , on the other hand , add - on modules for CGI programs can readily be installed in a user ’s home directory .
These issues are very hard to deal with ; versioning and module availability in particular simply cannot be handled without knowledge of the deployment platform .
As for the php.ini file , the best approach is two - pronged .
Firstly , configure PHP on the development system to impose strictness where possible — for example , to warn about unassigned variables .
Secondly , make sure that the code is agnostic about other configuration settings ; we return to this issue in the next section .
5. Oversimplification Leading to Excessive Complexity
PHP was originally a collection of CGI scripts designed for building a ‘ personal home page ’ .
PHP 2 was much more akin to modern PHP : it was a simple scripting language with almost entirely the same syntax as what we now know as PHP .
The fundamental design of the PHP 2 language was that it be simple to use , even for non-programmers .
The claim of this section is that this design goal has resulted in precisely the inverse of the desired effect .
PHP 2 was probably a reasonable solution : it was a minimal scripting language for adding dynamic behaviour to webpages .
Unfortunately , PHP has since outgrown itself .
PHP is nowadays a programming language simplified to the point where the available abstractions and concepts just are n’t sufficient to express the programmer ’s intent .
Furthermore , PHP suffers from a related issue : the language was accreted , rather than ever having been designed .
Most programming languages that have achieved genuine long - lasting popularity have been the work of at most a small team of gifted language designers .
These designers have worked as much on deciding what to leave out of their languages as on what to put in .
PHP ’s creator , Rasmus Lerdorf , adopted a deliberate policy of letting others contribute freely to the development of the PHP implementation — and thus implicitly to that of the language itself .
Where languages like C , C++ , or Perl have had a Ritchie , Stroustrup , or Wall directing their evolution , Lerdorf does not seem to have applied the same sorts of controls to PHP .
The result in some cases is that PHP lacks any sort of coherent world view .
This in turn only increases the complexity for those trying to actually build working solutions with PHP .
We will examine these issues in some depth , looking at some representative constructs in the language .
PHP ’s built - in functions are a good place to start .
The vast majority of PHP ’s functionality — database access , regular expressions , etc. — is made available through built - in functions .
This constitutes a problem right from the start : there is no modularity .
Our assumption must be that namespace mechanisms were omitted from the language because they might be hard for non-programmers to understand .
This seems like a minor point , but it does have repercussions , as discussed above .
Perhaps a worse problem in this area is simply the naming of the functions themselves .
Function names ( and semantics ) have been liberally borrowed from Unix system calls ( unlink ) , the C standard library ( strcspn ) , and Perl ( split ) , among other places .
Some function names have multiple words separated by underscores ( str_replace ) ; others have words squashed together ( strtoupper ) .
Some functions have aliases , like disk_free_space and diskfreespace .
Some functions are just plain misnamed , like the addslashes and stripslashes routines which deal with backslashes in strings .
These complaints sound trivial , but the cognitive load of dealing with such a motley collection of names is anything but .
I blame this problem entirely on PHP ’s piecemeal evolution .
Many languages offer both a numerically - indexed array type , and at least one other type which allows data to be indexed by strings ( map < T > in C++ , or Perl ’s hashes for example ) .
PHP has both , but conflates them into a single array structure .
This sounds like a big advantage from the point of view of simplicity : programmers need n’t worry about type to use , because there is only one choice .
Regardless of the wisdom or otherwise of this approach — are programmers to be encouraged to think sloppily about their data structures ? — it certainly leads to increased complexity .
On the surface , it seems straightforward enough .
We can use an array as if it ’s numerically indexed :
$ array = Array ( 10 , 11 , 12 ) ; echo $ array [ 0 ] ;
or as if it ’s a hash :
$ age = Array ( ' Anne ' => 32 , ' Bob ' => 28 ) ; echo $ age [ ' Anne ' ] ;
and PHP handles everything else behind the scenes .
However , you can also do things like this :
$ a1 = Array ( 10 , ' Anne ' => 32 , 11 , ' Bob ' => 28 , 12 ) ; $ a2 = Array ( 1 => 21 , 2 => 22 , 3 => 23 ) ; $ a2 [ 0 ] = 20 ;
Questions to consider :
What index do we have to consult to get the value 11 out of $ a1 ?
?
What ’s the iteration order for $ a2 ?
Is it numerically - indexed or hash - style ?
?
Is it numerically - indexed or hash - style ?
What happens if you use PHP ’s $ a2 [ ] = ... construct to add a new element to the ‘ end ’ of the array ?
construct to add a new element to the ‘ end ’ of the array ?
Can numerically - indexed arrays have elements missing ?
If so , can you still trivially iterate over the values in index order ?
While these questions can be answered ( by careful reading of the manual and not a little experimentation ) , the answers are n’t entirely obvious .
Programmers with a reasonable understanding of basic data structures would be well advised to program as if a given PHP array can be indexed by either contiguous integers or by strings , but not both .
A similar problem crops up with relational operators .
PHP ’s simple variables can contain either a number or a string .
PHP converts between numbers and strings whenever necessary , so that the programmer need not worry about the underlying type .
That ’s the theory , anyway ; in practice , this makes it extremely difficult to compare two values of different types for equality .
The standard PHP equality - testing operator is spelled == :
$ n1 = 0 ; $ n2 = 10 ; $ s1 = ' foo ' ; $ s2 = ' bar ' ; $ n1 == $ n2 ; // Numeric comparison , returns false $ s1 == $ s2 ; // String comparison , returns false $ n1 == $ s1 ; // Good question $ s1 == $ n1 ; // Is this any different ?
The problem is that , when the values are weakly typed , and there is only one equality - testing operator , the language cannot determine the programmer ’s intention .
PHP has a variety of kludges to deal with this :
Some programmers recommend using ! strcmp ( $ n1 , $ s1 ) to force a string interpretation .
to force a string interpretation .
You can cast one or both sides to the intended type .
PHP 4 has a === operator .
It works the same way as == , except that it additionally requires both sides to have the same type .
This sounds initially like the perfect solution — just use === wherever you would otherwise have used == .
Unfortunately , you lose the convenience of being able to treat numbers and strings interchangeably : it is no longer the case that 3 === " 3 " .
Perl has similar rules for its scalar variables : they can contain either a number or a string , and the language freely converts as necessary .
However , Perl allows the programmer to express the intent : it offers both a numeric - equality operator == and a string - equality operator eq .
PHP explicitly rejects this approach .
The manual for PHP 2 says “ Once you start having separate operators for each type you start making the language much more complex .
You ca n’t use == for strings , you now would use eq .
I do n’t see the point , especially for something like PHP where most of the scripts will be rather simple and in most cases written by non-programmers who want a language with a basic logical syntax that does n’t have too high a learning curve . ”
Unfortunately , in cases like this , the complexity is rather like an air bubble under freshly hung wallpaper : pushing it from one place to another will only leave more mess on the wall .
This is a clear case of PHP trying to simplify the problem beyond the limits of possibility .
Languages like C++ can manage with only one equality testing operator because they are statically typed .
Perl avoids static typing distinctions for numbers and strings , but uses additional operators to determine the programmer ’s intent .
PHP follows neither path , with the result that comparing values is unnecessarily complex .
Variable scoping in user - defined functions is extremely peculiar .
PHP almost entirely follows the common convention of using block scoping .
PHP variables are created by assigning to them .
Once a variable has been assigned , it is available within inferior scopes ( nested blocks ) as most programmers would expect :
$ message = ' Hello , world ! ' ; if ( ! $ quiet ) { echo $ message , " < br /> " ; }
However , function bodies do n’t have access to variables from higher scopes :
$ message = ' Hello , world ! ' ; function print_message ( ) { //
Tries to print a nonexistent local variable echo $ message , " < br /> " ; }
Accessing a global variable from within a function requires the use of the global statement :
$ message = ' Hello , world ! ' ; function print_message ( ) { //
Bring the variable into this function 's scope global $ message ; echo $ message , " < br /> " ; }
This scoping rule is sufficiently unusual that many PHP programmers — even skilled programmers with a great deal of PHP experience — report spending lots of time tracking down bugs caused by forgetting to use global .
The problem is particularly severe for PHP ’s built - in variables .
For example PHP provides a $ HTTP_USER_AGENT variable , taken from the web server ’s equivalent status variable .
What happens if you use this in a PHP function without declaring it global ?
PHP does n’t let you access the global variable that it created for you .
Nor does it by default give you any error message .
Instead , it assumes that you wanted a completely random , uninitialised variable .
The rationale for designing the language in this way was that it would prevent inadvertent changing of global variables .
This strikes me as an extremely good example of how designing the language for surface simplicity in fact leads to a great deal of underlying complexity .
One of the most abject examples of PHP ’s tendency to pander to non-programmers is the feature called magic_quotes_gpc .
The idea behind this is as follows .
Many PHP pages need to take data from HTML forms and use that data in database queries .
It ’s common to see code roughly like this :
// $ max_price is taken directly from the CGI parameters db_query ( " SELECT id , name , description , price FROM item WHERE price <= $ max_price " ) ;
This makes use of PHP ’s convenient variable - interpolation feature to build a dynamic query from user - supplied data .
However , consider what the unpleasant consequences of this could be .
Unexpected characters in the user ’s data could confuse the query parser ; this would be awkward , but not terrible .
Or worse , a user might be able to construct malformed data that would persuade the database server to run an additional query of the attacker ’s choosing .
Given that fact , languages with convenient database interfaces make it easy to have user - supplied data quoted appropriately .
For example , some languages let you write the query with ‘ placeholders ’ for user - supplied data .
The programmer can then supply the actual data in a separate step .
As long as the database API knows how to quote data for the DBMS in use , this is guaranteed to avoid errors .
PHP ’s approach is rather different .
Instead of making sure that database queries are valid , PHP chooses to ensure that the input ca n’t be invalid .
When you enable the magic_quotes_gpc setting , PHP alters its handling of the CGI parameters , and actually inserts backslashes before ‘ dangerous ’ characters in the incoming data .
( An astute reader might stop to wonder why this feature is n’t called magic_backslashes_gpc , but that ’s rather a side issue . )
If you were n’t expecting this behaviour , the symptom is that PHP randomly throws backslashes into perfectly valid data — all in the name of not corrupting data !
Lerdorf attempted to justify this in a recent interview as follows : “ the worst that would happen is that someone would see an extra \ on the screen when they output the data directly instead of sticking it into the database . ”
I for one get rather concerned when I encounter such flagrant disregard for data integrity .
How to deal with this ?
The goal is to work transparently , regardless of the setting of magic_quotes_gpc .
It ’s quite hard , though , because the damage has already been done by the time your PHP code runs .
You must examine the configuration settings , and apply stripslashes to each CGI parameter before running the rest of the program :
if ( isset ( $ param1 ) & & get_magic_quotes_gpc ( ) ) $ param1 = stripslashes ( $ param1 ) ;
Then you can write the rest of your program as if magic_quotes_gpc did n’t exist .
The last area I will cover is PHP ’s handling of CGI parameters .
Traditionally , PHP takes all the GET and POST parameters , any values set in HTTP cookies , any environment variables , and all the web server status variables , and made each of them available to PHP programs as a global variable .
This is certainly a helpful feature for beginners : no effort need be expended to find the CGI parameters .
This feature is enabled by the register_globals configuration setting .
However , this approach has three major problems :
It leads to hideous pollution of the global variable namespace , with all the concomitant security vulnerabilities and problems for working in larger teams .
Within your functions , you have to remember to global ise the variables you ’re interested in .
It ’s just too plain hard to distinguish cookies , CGI parameters , and server variables .
There ’s a further configuration setting , gpc_order , which specifies which family of variables take precedence , but relying on yet another .ini - file setting would be unwise .
For these reasons , the PHP maintainers have long counselled against enabling register_globals , and the most recent releases default to turning that setting off .
Instead , the language now has some special ‘ autoglobal ’ or ‘ superglobal ’ variables to hold information like this .
These autoglobal variables are like ordinary globals , with the exception that they do n’t need to be explicitly global ised .
Amonth the available autoglobals are :
$ _GET , an array of CGI GET parameters
, an array of CGI parameters $ _POST , an array of CGI POST parameters
, an array of CGI parameters $ _COOKIE , an array of incoming HTTP cookies
, an array of incoming HTTP cookies $ _REQUEST , an array of all the above
There are two major problems with the autoglobals :
They are n’t available in older versions of PHP
You still have CGI parameters conflated with cookies
In many sites , all the programmer wants is to be able to access the CGI parameters appropriate for the request method that the client used , and to keep those separate .
The only reliable way to do this in a way that will work for older PHP versions as well as current ones is to check both $ HTTP_GET_VARS and $ HTTP_POST_VARS for CGI parameters , and remember to global ise when necessary .
It ’s merely an additional annoyance that PHP wo n’t let you create your own autoglobal variables .
If you could , you create a $ _CGI autoglobal that did the right thing .
6 . When to Use PHP
We have identified a number of problems that arise when attempting to use PHP on large websites .
However , we do not claim that PHP should never be used , only that these issues make its use inadvisable in certain circumstances .
The following checklist suggests questions that should be considered before making a decision to use PHP for a given project .
How much control will you have over the deployment platform ?
PHP ’s one - size - fits - all approach to the php.ini file makes it hard to share servers with sites that were developed with different settings .
How many people will work on the site , now and in the future ?
PHP as a language lacks the features necessary to promote effective teamwork ; the bigger your team , the greater the problems you ’ll have .
How big will the site be , in terms of numbers of distinct pages ?
This is related to the previous item : the bigger the site , the greater your need will be for language features that promote teamwork .
How long will the site be expected to last ?
The longer it lasts , the more likely it is that significant design changes will be needed .
If you use PHP in the obvious manner , major design changes are difficult .
If you extend PHP with a templating system , whether ad hoc or carefully enforced , using PHP buys you little if anything .
How experienced are the developers ; and how complex will the site need to be ?
Experienced developers will find themselves hindered rather than helped by the language ’s simplicity .
Inexperienced developers will find the simplicity a significant boon — but if you have inexperienced developers trying to develop a complicated dynamic site , you will soon run into other problems .
7. Conclusions
PHP is a convenient language for rapidly prototyping simple dynamic websites .
Websites thus built can in many cases be deployed indefinitely , without spending time and money on refactoring code in a different language .
PHP ’s simplicity makes it a good language for inexperienced programmers , such as those moving from a pure page - design rôle to a site development one .
For more experienced developers , though , the language ’s simplicity rapidly turns into complexity , slowing down the development process .
These developers are the ones who have the skills needed to build large and / or complex websites ; using PHP for such sites therefore tends to be a net loss .
This tendency is reinforced by PHP ’s lack of the linguistic features needed to promote working on large software projects .
If your project is at all large or complex , it may be better to look elsewhere when choosing an implementation language .
In cases where PHP has been determined to be inappropriate , what language should be used ?
There is considerable choice here ; few languages are as bad as PHP for doing serious development work .
The author and his colleagues have had good results with Perl , and believe that languages such as C++ , Java , and Python should serve equally well .
WASHINGTON , Feb . 10 — The 110th Congress opened with the passage of new rules intended to curb the influence of lobbyists by prohibiting them from treating lawmakers to meals , trips , stadium box seats or the discounted use of private jets .
But it did not take long for lawmakers to find ways to keep having lobbyist - financed fun .
In just the last two months , lawmakers invited lobbyists to help pay for a catalog of outings : lavish birthday parties in a lawmaker ’s honor ( $ 1,000 a lobbyist ) , martinis and margaritas at Washington restaurants ( at least $ 1,000 ) , a California wine - tasting tour ( all donors welcome ) , hunting and fishing trips ( typically $ 5,000 ) , weekend golf tournaments ( $ 2,500 and up ) , a Presidents ’
Day weekend at Disney World ( $ 5,000 ) , parties in South Beach in Miami ( $ 5,000 ) , concerts by the Who or Bob Seger ( $ 2,500 for two seats ) , and even Broadway shows like “ Mary Poppins ” and “ The Drowsy Chaperone ” ( also $ 2,500 for two ) .
The lobbyists and their employers typically end up paying for the events , but within the new rules .
Instead of picking up the lawmaker ’s tab , lobbyists pay a political fund - raising committee set up by the lawmaker .
In turn , the committee pays the legislator ’s way .
Lobbyists and fund - raisers say such trips are becoming increasingly popular , partly as a quirky consequence of the new ethics rules .

Scam : Identity thieves trick the unwary into revealing their personal details by telling them they ’ve failed to report for jury duty and warrants for their arrest are being issued .
Status : Real fraud , potential for financial harm unknown .
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , 2005 ]
Here ’s a new twist scammers are using to commit identity theft : the jury duty scam .
Here ’s how it works :
Here ’s a new twist scammers are using to commit identity theft : the jury duty scam .
Here ’s how it works :
The scammer calls claiming to work for the local court and claims you ’ve failed to report for jury duty .
He tells you that a warrant has been issued for your arrest .
The victim will often rightly claim they never received the jury duty notification .
The scammer then asks the victim for confidential information for “ verification ” purposes .
Specifically , the scammer asks for the victim ’s Social Security number , birth date , and sometimes even for credit card numbers and other private information — exactly what the scammer needs to commit identity theft .
So far , this jury duty scam has been reported in Michigan , Ohio , Texas , Arizona , Illinois , Pennsylvania , Minnesota , Oregon and Washington state .
It ’s easy to see why this works .
The victim is clearly caught off guard , and is understandably upset at the prospect of a warrant being issued for his or her arrest .
So , the victim is much less likely to be vigilant about protecting their confidential information .
In reality , court workers will never call you to ask for social security numbers and other private information .
In fact , most courts follow up via snail mail and rarely , if ever , call prospective jurors .
Action :
Never give out your Social Security number , credit card numbers or other personal confidential information when you receive a telephone call .
This jury duty scam is the latest in a series of identity theft scams where scammers use the phone to try to get people to reveal their Social Security number , credit card numbers or other personal confidential information .
It does n’t matter * why * they are calling — all the reasons are just different variants of the same scam .
Protecting yourself is simple :
Never give this info out when you receive a phone call .
Origins :
This helpful heads - up began appearing in inboxes in August 2005 .
While this particular attempt to coerce information from potential identity theft victims is not new , it is real .
In a number of U.S. states , con artists have been contacting people by phone to assert those they ’ve targeted have evaded jury duty and announce warrants are being issued for their arrest .
When the about - to - be - duped protest they never received such notifications , that surely a mistake has been made , the sharpies go after what they really want , which is their pigeons ’ personal and financial information .
Under threat of being hauled off in paddy wagons unless they succeed in straightening out this terrible mess , many folks who would otherwise be more wary about what they reveal of their personal data will find themselves reeling off their birth dates and social security and credit card numbers in an effort to convince their callers the notifications that never arrived actually went to other addresses or were never meant for them in the first
place .
However these calls conclude — whether those who have been approached are left with the impression they ’ve failed to show up for jury duty and are still expected to discharge their civic duties , or that a big misunderstanding has now been resolved — their true purpose has been accomplished : the scam artists now have the information necessary to open accounts or charge goods in the names of their victims .
The scheme outlined in the message quoted above might be categorized as a “ social engineering ” scam — a technique which preys upon people ’s unquestioning acceptance of authority and willingness to cooperate in order to extract from them sensitive information .
On 22 August 2005 , the Minnesota Judicial Branch issued a warning about the bogus calls .
The Minnesota Judicial Branch points out its courts always use the mail to send jury service summons , communicating by telephone only after prospective jurors have returned completed summons information forms .
In New Mexico , Rep. Tom Udall has been warning citizens about the scam .
As he points out , Federal courts do not require anyone to provide any sensitive information over the telephone .
Most contact between a federal court and a private citizen is conducted by mail .
The Superior Court of California has posted an alert on its web site , warning that identity thieves posing as court officials have been trying to get confidential information through phone calls about jury duty .
Once again , callers have been telling potential victims they failed to report for jury duty , then demanding their Social Security numbers .
While court personnel may occasionally call people at home , “ We never ask for Social Security numbers or personal identifying information , ” said Marita Ford , chief deputy executive officer for Riverside Superior Court .
In September 2005 , in an effort to alert the public nationwide about the scam , the FBI issued a press release which explained that “ the judicial system does not contact people telephonically and ask for personal information such as your Social Security number , date of birth or credit card numbers ” and those so contacted should “ not provide any personal or confidential information to these individuals . ”
Though the ‘ jury duty ’ information - gleaning scam has been garnering attention in 2005 , it is not new .
In 2004 , residents of Franklin County , Ohio , were hit by this scam .
At least five people called the Franklin County Municipal Court in September 2004 to ask where they were to report for duty after someone telephoned to obtain personal information .
In Ohio , as in Minnesota , jury summonses are sent by mail and court workers do not call potential jurors to ask for Social Security numbers or dates of birth .
In February 2004 , the scam was active in Charles County , Maryland .
Once again , the fraud came to the attention of authorities via residents who had been contacted by phone afterwards asking the County Clerk about the attempts to wheedle personal information from them .
They too had been asked for birth dates and Social Security numbers , that time by callers who claimed such intelligences were needed to assemble a pool of jurors for selection in upcoming trials .
The Charles County Circuit Court does not telephone residents who are selected for jury duty .
Potential jurors are sent notices in the mail .
In 2001 the Erie County Commissioner of Jurors reported someone in that area had been staging telephone scams about jury duty in Chautauqua , Seneca , and Jefferson counties , seeking information about home addresses and bank accounts allegedly “ for reimbursement purposes . ”
Targets of that fraud were being told by the swindlers attempting to deceive them that this information was required for the purpose of directly depositing their $ 40 - a - day jury duty stipends .
Erie County officials point out their jurors ’ checks come directly from Albany and not from local jurors offices , nor are these payments deposited directly into jurors ’ bank accounts .
Though the ‘ jury duty ’ information phishing scheme is not new , it has been heavily put to use around the U.S. in August 2005 .
Be wary of any calls of this nature and refuse to give out your personal information .
Barbara “ verdict : not foolish ” Mikkelson
How to Avoid Falling Victim to ‘ Jury Duty ’ Scams :
Court workers will not telephone to say you ’ve missed jury duty or that they are assembling juries and need to pre-screen those who might be selected to serve on them , so dismiss as fraudulent phones call of this nature .
About the only time you would hear by telephone ( rather than by mail ) about anything having to do with jury service would be after you have mailed back your completed questionnaire , and even then only rarely .
you have mailed back your completed questionnaire , and even then only rarely .
Do not give out bank account , social security , or credit card numbers over the phone if you did n’t initiate the call , whether it be to someone trying to sell you something or to someone who claims to be from a bank or government department .
If such callers insist upon “ verifying ” such information with you , have them read the data to you from their notes , with you saying yea or nay to it rather than the other way around .
Examine your credit card and bank account statements every month , keeping an eye peeled for unauthorized charges .
Immediately challenge items you did not approve .

In Fukuoka City in Japan , they have an amazing building called “ ACROS Fukuoka ” with two very distinct sides : one side looks like a conventional office building with glass walls , but on the other side there is a huge terraced roof that merges with a park .
The garden terraces , which reach up to about 60 meters above the ground , contain some 35,000 plants representing 76 species .
A huge semicircular atrium and the triangular lobby provide contrast to the greenery , in this space is a symphony hall , offices and shops .
The building was also featured in a book about green roofs .
The Arcos building was constructed on the last remaining green space in the city center , so the architects , Emilio Ambasz & Associates , created a design to preserve the green space as much as possible , while still fitting in a large office building .
In addition , a green roof reduces the energy consumption of a building , because it keeps the temperature inside more constant and comfortable .
Green roofs also capture rainwater runoff , and support the life of insects and birds .
The building is a success in Japan , its terraced south facade utilized by many in the area for exercise and rest , affording views of the city and the harbor beyond .
Unfortunately it has received little press overseas , especially in the United States .
Murray Wells StoryMurray
Wells was studying at the West of England University in Bristol when he discovered he needed reading glasses .
So he visited his nearest high street optician but was appalled when he found that his new metal frames , ‘ essentially some wire and two pieces of glass ’ cost £ 150 .
" I was managing on a student loan and £ 150 was a fortune – half a month 's rent .
I just could n't understand why my glasses were so expensive , and my curiosity led me to investigate further .
" He began to call manufacturers , opticians and industry insiders but he was met with a ‘ wall of silence ’ .
But then a disgruntled employee at a laboratory in the north of England gave him the lowdown .
“ He talked me through the industry , ” says Murray Wells .
“ And it turned out that my £ 150 pair of glasses probably only cost about seven pounds to make . ” Murray Wells was supposed to be hammering the books in preparation for his finals but instead found himself immersed in the glasses industry .
He learnt about optometrical testing , how the frames are made and the lenses are cut .
He discovered that the market is around 70 per cent controlled by just four high street retailers : Vision Express , Boots , Dolland & Aitchison and Specsavers .
But , most significantly , he leant that he could make glasses for a fraction of the price that they were being sold on the high street .
Murray Wells enlisted the help of some students at his university who helped him build the website and design the logo .
He then used the final instalment of his student loan and some money from his father to establish Glassesdirect.co.uk , they began trading in September 2004 .
Manufacturers were initially reluctant to endanger their relationships with high street opticians but eventually they relented .
In a year Glasses Direct had sold 22,000 pairs of spectacles and Murray Wells believes that this has saved UK consumers an estimated £ 2 m .
“ People generally can't believe our Glasses Direct prices , ” he says .
“ As the high street shops are maintaining retail prices at 10 to 20 times the cost price .
“ What I 'm giving people is choice , and they are delighted , ” he says .
“ An average pair of glasses is manufactured for less than £ 7 , so I charge just over double .
Even with advertising and overheads , I still make a profit .
” His business has gone from strength to strength and he now employs 17 staff and turnover is around the £ 1 m mark .
“ It ’s all been a bit of a whirlwind , ” he admits .
“ But I have always been determined to get very big , very fast ” .
To aid this expansion Glasses Direct are now seeking investment from Venture Capitalists , however he says that they are also seeking him .
“ It ’s been a lot easier than I ever thought it would be , ” he says .
“ We ’ve literally been getting new calls from potential investors every day .
It ’s wonderful and we ’re in a very enviable position to choose who we want to work with .
” It ’s not just a decision who to take money from .
Murray
Wells knows the next move is crucial .
“ It ’s not only about the investment , we need someone who will be helpful at board level and is experienced in dealing with big organisations , large marketing campaigns and has e-commerce expertise .
” Talks are ongoing , but Murray Wells expects a deal to be struck soon and says press reports of raising £ 5 m “ are n’t far off ” .
A large bulk of the money will be spent on marketing .
“ We ’ve made massive strides but still only occupy 1 % of a £ 1.7bn industry so we ’re really still just a drop in the ocean .
I want to move as quickly as possible as we know it ’s only a matter of time before competitive entry occurs .
” The big players in the optical industry appear to have accepted Glassesdirect .
co.uk is here to stay too – even if they ’re not happy about it .
“ They ’ve changed tack a little and are n’t rubbishing us in the press as much as they were , ” says Murray Wells .
Murray
Wells remains undeterred by the high street ’s desire to stamp him out , but is looking to shake off the David vs. Goliath tag .
“ As well as marketing ourselves to the mass market we ’re in talks with several major retail organisations and expect to announce a number of partnerships by the start of 2006 .
” Subsequently , Murray Wells is strapping himself in for another 100 mph 12 months and expects turnover to triple to £ 3 m , and reach £ 10 m by 2008 .
March 15 , 2007  -- ABC News ' Barbara Walters sits down with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela for an interview in which Chavez shares his views on the United States , President Bush and America 's 2008 presidential elections .
Hugo Chavez made headlines across America when he famously called Bush " the devil " in a speech at the United Nations headquarters in New York last year .
Watch Barbara Walters ' full interview with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela Friday on " 20/20 " at 10 p.m. EDT on ABC
When Walters asks Chavez about the name - calling , he explains it by saying that he wanted his strong words to bring attention to the facts .
" Yes , I call him a devil in the United Nations , " says Chavez .
" That 's true .
Another time , I said that he was a donkey just because I think that he is very ignorant … about the things that are actually happening in Latin America and the world .
If that is an excess on my side , I accept .
And I might apologize .
But who is causing more harm ?
He burns people , villages and he … invades nations . "
Chavez also accuses Bush of planning a coup against him .
The Venezuelan president briefly lost power in a coup in 2002 but with help from a popular uprising against the coup leaders , reclaimed his position within days .
Bush is not the only U.S. official to become the butt of Chavez 's words .
Chavez has referred to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as an illiterate who suffers from sexual frustration .
Chavez shrugs off these insults as jokes , saying that his words are nothing when compared to the the loss of lives in Iraq and Afghanistan .
About both Bush and Rice , Chavez says , " As a lady I respect her , for the president of the United States , as a human being , I respect him , but they are killing people . "
CIA Assassination Plot
Chavez insists that the CIA is collaborating with dissident elements within Venezuela to assassinate him .
He says the CIA killed Chile 's President Salvador Allende in 1973 , and has attempted to kill Fidel Castro of Cuba .
The New York Times reported in 2004 on an intelligence brief showing that the CIA was aware of plans of a coup against Chavez .
The documents do not , however , indicate that the CIA or the Bush administration supported the coup in any way .
Possibly sending a message to his supporters , Chavez tells Walters , " If something happens to me , if I get killed , the president of the United States should be held responsible . "
Oil and Democracy
Despite the animosity between the two nations , Venezuela continues to be the U.S. 's fourth - largest supplier of oil .
He says that " Venezuela is supporting tens of thousands of poor families in the United States with heating oil , " and that his country sends " 1.5 million barrels of oil " to the United States every day .
Chavez also says , " There is no intention to reduce or eliminate that supply , but we have said , in case of any other aggression by the U.S. administration , we would cut this oil supply , but we expect this not [ going ] to happen . "
Chavez refuses to endorse an American presidential candidate for 2008 , saying that his support would be a burden for the candidate .
He does , however , express great confidence that if he could run for president in the United States , he would have no trouble winning and that he could win over any right wing candidate within six months .
Asked about his governing methods , Chavez dismisses the idea that he rules by decree , saying instead that he leads a society that is both socialist and democratic .
He calls himself " an enemy of an empire who wants to dominate the world " but a " friend of equality and freedom . "
Iran and Fidel
Though Chavez affirms his support for the state of Israel , he also says that he would support Iran against any attack from the United States .
Chavez expresses doubt that there would ever be such an attack , cautioning that it would be " a boomerang " and seen as an attack against the entire world .
Chavez also updates Walters on the health of his friend Fidel Castro of Cuba .
He says that Castro is making a remarkable recovery from a very serious illness and insists that the Cuban leader has not stopped governing .
Says Chavez : " He 's got a rein in his hand and the other rein is in Raul 's [ Fidel 's brother 's ] hand . "
Walters asks Chavez about Bush 's just concluded five - nation trip through Latin America , asking how he'd rate it on a scale of one to 10 .
" One , " says Chavez .
" One , because I am generous .
Because it could be minus five . "
NYS update :
There has n’t been a lot of clear movement in New York State on the COVID front for the past 10 days or so .
The story is still all about the rest of the U.S. being a disaster where COVID response is concerned , and everyone suffering from a lack of lab capacity .
Testing turnaround is now back to March and April delays in much of the state .
About the only thing we have going for us is that masking and social distancing has n’t been thrown out the window here .
The New York Times last week released a hotly discussed map that purports to show exactly where people are more likely to wear masks than not , based on a large survey .
It seems to be breaking down by zip code (? ) and I admit I do n’t really understand the methodology .
According to this map , Upstate cities are doing very well with mask - wearing , but even most rural areas in the state are doing relatively well .
New York Times analysis : Mask use is high in the Northeast and the West , and lower in the Plains and parts of the South .
But researchers found that political party is a better predictor of mask use than any other factor they measured .
https://t.co/AjjZM7O9sT
— Keith Boykin ( @keithboykin ) July 17 , 2020
I remember that exceedingly effective social distancing commercial ( the one with the bouncing ping pong ball ) that was commissioned by the state of Ohio . “ Effective ” though it may have been , it apparently had little effect on Ohioans if this map is to be believed .
We hear so much about how Upstate cities are “ flyover , ” but even Buffalo , even the North Country is doing better on masking .
Even though it ’s a “ mandate ” here , there is n’t any real enforcement .
What ’s happened is that mask - wearing has reached critical mass as a social norm in the Northeast and it has n’t elsewhere .
Cuomo , who allegedly does n’t want to run for president , apparently wants to extend the borders of New York State so he can stay governor and still have a national influence .
He went to Savannah today for a photo op , but when asked if he would quarantine after returning , said he ’s an essential worker so he does n’t have to .
I wonder what gym and spa owners think of this after they have been told “ no , you ca n’t reopen ” over and over again while Cuomo can actually fly down to a hot state and not have to miss a beat .
The powerful are not like you and me .
Or are they ?
“ Twice convicted by unanimous juries for abusing his powerful state office to enrich himself , Sheldon Silver will now finally report to prison to begin serving a sentence that can begin to repair the harm his conduct caused to the people of this District and to their trust in local government , ” said Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in a statement .
In addressing the court , Silver expressed remorse .
“ I want to be clear : What I did was wrong , ” he said .
“ Let me just say I am very sorry . ”
The worm sure does turn .
Maybe in ten years , when this cruel revolution is over , it will be a felony for elected leaders to foist their bad poster art upon the public .
Onondaga County update : Briefings continue to be held on Mondays and Thursdays .
Monday ’s briefing was n’t very interesting , but last Thursday the CE came out ready to roll with lots of new granular figures .
What was n’t usual at this briefing was that actual circumstances of actual spread were now given .
Some weeks ago , Dr. Gupta came out with some fictionalized stories of how spread was occurring , but these were the real deal :
Close contact to a friend visiting from out of state — no mask .
Family funeral in a neighboring county , which then led to multiple positive cases .
Exposed at a Fourth of July party .
Exposed at a Fifth of July party .
Travel — Florida , New Jersey , North Carolina , Massachusetts .
Exposed via an employee .
Exposed at a graduation party .
Had lunch with someone in a breakroom in close proximity , while not wearing a mask .
While the squeamishness over telling these stories now appears past , McMahon still does n’t want to get into specifics about which school districts had problem parties ( like it was n’t Westhill and West Genesee , come on ) ; and while reporters seemed to want him to get tough on a Fayetteville sports coach who tested positive after an unauthorized off - school coaching session , he did n’t bite .
The “ top story ” of the Thursday county briefing , however , was the news that the county is considering spending its own money on rapid testing in preparation for the fall .
Today ( Monday ) , it was noted that the county does plan to buy its own rapid testing equipment and that it might arrive in 2 - 3 weeks .
This ca n’t be cheap for the county , but it seems that McMahon is committed to ensuring that CNY stays open for business and probably sees it as a business investment .
I also ca n’t help wondering if the current crisis is being seen as a once - in - a - lifetime chance to dig CNY out of a hole .
I do n’t have any evidence to lead me to think that our local leaders are that forward - thinking , and no one has a crystal ball .
But if you take to heart the concept that what you do today has an impact three weeks from now , why would n’t it be true projected even farther out ?
( In other words , how long can a virtuous spiral be drawn out ? )
I ’m not sure if any amount of forward thinking or planning can fill the fiscal hole , though .
This tweet from the CE yesterday got a lot of local attention .
This is a Joke .
@senatemajldr threre is still time to get this right .
https://t.co/KEbJQsjrO4 — Ryan McMahon ( @CHM_McMahon ) July 19 , 2020
The reporters today were all over this looking for follow - up quotes .
One thing I like about McMahon is that he does n’t tweet off the cuff and then dance around it later — nope , he was eager to clarify .
It ’s an absolute joke .
It ’s a dereliction of duty .
I understand this process .
In my own previous world I was the chairman of the legislature , so I was in charge of that branch of government .
When you are the boss of a legislative body , you do not just represent a district or a state .
[ McConnell ] is essentially a national leader , and we have a national crisis .
So he needs to do his job , and recognize that in previous stimuluses , they said “ We ’ll get to local governments — we want to see how bad this is going to be on local governments before we commit to a process or a number . ”
Okay .
We ’ve gone through all this .
It is bad .
We need help .
I do n’t even understand this — he has states that have senators up for election .
I do n’t know how he thinks his incumbent senator [ in Montana ] , who ’s in a tough race , can go to his local government and say “ We ’re not going to help you . ” …
So it ’s mind - boggling to me on many fronts .
I think we ’re being used as a bargaining chip .
It ’s not me being used as a bargaining chip , it is my workforce .
I have people who are working very hard to fight this pandemic and to put ourselves in a position for success …
They ’re still just in denial that state and local governments need help .
We are not saying , “ We have a $ 100 million hole , give us $ 100 million . ”
We could say that , but we have held back hiring 300 positions , almost 10 percent of our workforce .
I could have filled all those spots , and that would have been 300 people who are paying in to this economy , but I did n’t do that .
I realized that we had to cut our own way to the bone so we had the moral argument to go to the federal government and say “ Help us . ”
So his initial plan is a joke .
Enough …
I ’ve been pretty bipartisan over the years and I will speak truth to power in this process .
I have n’t really second - guessed those executives at the higher level .
I ’ve given them the benefit of the doubt with intention because I understand what they ’re going through .
But this is just ridiculous at this point .
This is n’t a time where you pick and choose where you want to help out related to a 100 - year pandemic .
We need help , you told us to shut down , we did .
Help us .
Republicans do n’t believe in unfunded mandates .
Leader McConnell knows this .
There are n’t any Republicans in Washington any more , County Executive McMahon .
There are only zombies occupying their animated political corpses .
You ’re on your own .
Believe it .

GalaXQL is based on the SQLite database engine .
1.0 and 2.0 were written with wxWidgets for multi-platform capabilities , which is kind of ironic because wxWidgets seems to be the reason people can't build new versions for osx and linux .
Older builds :

GalaXQL 1.0 C/C++
Source ( without data file ; download windows zip as well )
NOTE : When launched for the first time , GalaXQL first generates the database .
This may take some time , so please be patient .
Note for mac users - apparently something has changed in the last few mac os updates , and the universal build for intel is broken .
You can still use the 2.0 version by forcing it to run under rosetta .
Sorry for the inconvenience .
( And yeah , I 'd love a mac mini if someone wants to give me one ) .
Version 2.0 introduces better layout , new rendering mode for lower - end computers , optional rendering of the 3d coordinate axes , updated SQLite database engine with CHECK constraints , and various little fixes and rephrasings .
Version 2.0 sources should compile fine for both ansi and unicode builds , so GalaXQL should compile under ubuntu now ( given that all neccessary development packages are installed , of course ) .
The source package also contains the required data file .
Any comments etc. can be emailed to me .
Congress Looks To Outlaw E-Voting Machines Without An Audit Trail

Over the past few years , it seems that more and more people have realized the problems with e-voting systems .
Amusingly , in the comments to our last post about the limits Florida was trying to put on researchers testing the e-voting machines for security , we had someone show up in the comments claiming that this is all a big charade -- and that e-voting machines are thoroughly tested by government agencies .
Despite being asked a few times , the commenter has not explained why the company hired to do the testing was barred from further testing after they were unable to document whether or not they had conducted the tests at all .
His response was that we 're all just a bunch of conspiracy theorists , and that no one other than approved government agencies should get to test these machines , since we 're all too ignorant to understand how e-voting machines should work , and because of our ignorance we'd hand over info to irresponsible parties ( which seems like an admission that the machines are n't actually safe -- if there is information that can be handed over that would cause problems , then the machine should n't be used in an election ) .
He also accuses anyone ( including respected professors Ed Felten and Avi Rubin ) of just being " conspiracy theorists " though none of us have put forth any conspiracy theory -- except for the commenter .
He claims that the security concerns over e-voting machines are really a big conspiracy to spread fear and make everyone mistrust the voting system so we stay home on election day .
Of course , it 's not clear how that fear is targeted in a way to ensure that one side wins -- but perhaps we 're not thinking it through enough .
In the meantime , it looks like Congress must be up for continuing this " conspiracy . "
Despite the fact that most in Congress seemed to show little to no interest for many years as security experts pointed out the problems with the machines , now they 're talking about introducing new legislation that would require that e-voting machines have an audit trail .
It 's not clear how a system that allows for recounting the votes is a way to add more fear to the e-voting process and keep us home , so I hope the same commenter can enlighten us on how this conspiracy works .
Paul Krugman explains why the right is so paranoid :
The Paranoid Style , by Paul Krugman , Commentary , NY Times : Last week Dennis Hastert , the speaker of the House , explained the real cause of the Foley scandal .
“ The people who want to see this thing blow up , ” he said , “ are ABC News and a lot of Democratic operatives , people funded by George Soros . ” ...
[ I]t was n’t his first outburst along these lines .
Back in 2004 , Mr. Hastert said : “ You know , I do n’t know where George Soros gets his money .
I do n’t know where — if it comes overseas or from drug groups or where it comes from . ”
Does Mr. Hastert really believe that George Soros and his operatives , conspiring with the evil news media , are responsible for the Foley scandal ?
Yes , he probably does .
For one thing , demonization of Mr. Soros is widespread in right - wing circles .
...
More generally , Mr. Hastert is a leading figure in a political movement ... historian Richard Hofstadter famously called “ the paranoid style in American politics . ”
Hofstadter ’s essay introducing the term was inspired by his observations of the radical right - wingers who seized control of the Republican Party in 1964 .
Today , the movement that nominated Barry Goldwater controls both Congress and the White House .
As a result , political paranoia — the “ sense of heated exaggeration , suspiciousness , and conspiratorial fantasy ” Hofstadter described — has gone mainstream .
To read Hofstadter ’s essay today is to be struck by the extent to which he seems to be describing the state of mind not of a lunatic fringe , but of key figures in our political and media establishment .
The “ paranoid spokesman , ” wrote Hofstadter , sees things “ in apocalyptic terms .
...
He is always manning the barricades of civilization . ”
Sure enough , Dick Cheney says that “ the war on terror is a battle for the future of civilization . ”
According to Hofstadter , for the paranoids , “ what is at stake is always a conflict between absolute good and absolute evil , ” and because “ the enemy is thought of as being totally evil and totally unappeasable , he must be totally eliminated . ”
Three days after 9/11 , President Bush promised to “ rid the world of evil . ”
The paranoid “ demand for total triumph leads to the formulation of hopelessly unrealistic goals ” — instead of focusing on Al Qaeda , we ’ll try to remake the Middle East and eliminate a vast “ axis of evil ” — “ and since these goals are not even remotely attainable , failure constantly heightens the paranoid ’s sense of frustration . ”
Iraq , anyone ?
The current right - wing explanation for what went wrong in Iraq closely echoes Joseph McCarthy ’s explanation for the Communist victory in China , which he said was “ the product of a great conspiracy ” at home .
According to the right , things did n’t go wrong because the invasion was a mistake , or because Donald Rumsfeld did n’t send enough troops , or because the occupation was riddled with cronyism and corruption .
No , it ’s all because the good guys were stabbed in the back .
Democrats , who undermined morale with their negative talk , and the liberal media , which refused to report the good news from Iraq , are responsible for the quagmire .
...
Which brings us back to the Foley affair .
The immediate response by nearly everyone in the Republican establishment — wild claims , without a shred of evidence behind them , that the whole thing is a Democratic conspiracy — may sound crazy .
But that response is completely in character for a movement that from the beginning has been dominated by the paranoid style .
And here ’s the scary part : that movement runs our government .
Dana Kelly , director of financial planning at High Point University in North Carolina , said she accepted the company ’s invitation to sit on its advisory board because she was providing advice about how students might react to various loans .
The company was already on the university ’s “ frequently used lenders ” list , she said , and she received payment only for transportation and lodging at meetings .
But in at least one case , Mr. Balestri encouraged a university loan official to buy stock in the company , a practice that several university loan officials say they had never heard of .
Lawrence Burt , director of the financial aid office at the University of Texas at Austin , said that Mr. Balestri encouraged him to buy shares in Education Lending Group and that he bought 1,500 shares for $ 1,000 in late 2001 .
Mr. Balestri , Mr. Burt said , told him “ this is kind of a risky venture .
We think it will end up turning a profit but we do n’t really know for sure . ”
Mr. Burt said his purchase was not a conflict of interest because the company at the time was focused more on loan consolidation and only later began expanding its business of originating loans .
Mr. Burt said he sold in 2003 when the company was raising more money through the sale of additional shares .
The shares of Education Lending Group were worth roughly $ 10 each .
That translates into a profit of about $ 14,000 for him .
Others who put stock up for sale at that time , according to S.E.C. filings , included the financial aid director for Columbia ’s undergraduate college and its engineering school , David Charlow ; Catherine Thomas , director of financial aid at the University of Southern California , and Matteo Fontana , who is general manager in a unit of the Office of Federal Student Aid at the Department of Education , and , according to a person who knows him , a longtime friend of Mr. Balestri’s .
Mr. Fontana planned to sell about $ 100,000 in stock up for sale in 2003 .
In the last few days , these officials have been put on paid leave pending investigations .
Last week , Ms. Frishberg of Johns Hopkins said she had been encouraged to acquire stock in 2002 , at a dinner she and other members of the company ’s advisory board attended .
She turned it down , she said .
“ I told them it was not allowed in my position , ” Ms. Frishberg said .
Johns
Hopkins put her on leave after learning that she had received payments from the company .
Mr. Cuomo ’s office wrote that she received $ 43,000 for consulting and $ 22,000 in tuition reimbursement for a doctoral program she was enrolled in .
Student Loan Xpress is a preferred lender at Johns Hopkins for some loan programs .
[ Haskell ] Newbie : what are the advantages of Haskell ?
( note to Haskellers : Yeah , I 'm handwaving things here , no need to point out counter - examples to my generalisations ! )
On 4/26/07 , phiroc at free . fr < phiroc at free. fr > wrote :
We 'll do this one first :
What are the mysterious " side effects " which are avoided by using Haskell , which everyone talks about ?
Null pointers ?
Side effects are usually things like mutable state .
In Haskell variables do n't vary .
" x=x+1 " is n't valid in Haskell .
This means , among other things , that functions always do the same thing given the same input ( they ca n't depend on some mutable state changing value ) , which is great since you 'll never get those " oh I forgot that I must first call foo before I call bar , or I 'll get an error " .
This really is a HUGE win , since programming with state is unreasonably error - prone .
I 'm afraid it 's next to impossible to convince anyone that this is true , unless they 're willing to give it a serious try , though :-)
Null pointers are possible when you 're dealing with C functions mostly .
You do n't use pointers in Haskell normally , only when you 're interfacing with external C libraries etc.
Hello , > > what are the advantages of haskell over semi-functional programming > languages > such as Perl , Common Lisp , etc . ?
For me ?
Purity .
I mean you can get plenty of the benefits of FP in any old language ( witness C# 3.0 ) , but the one thing you can never get by just adding support for a " functional style " in another language is purity .
Once purity is gone , it 's gone !
It ca n't be retrofitted on an existing language .
Purity is great because it makes it much easier to write programs without making silly mistakes .
When writing programs in languages with lots of side effects you have to sort of keep a " mental log " in your head for all possible execution paths ( " in this branch x is equal to y plus w , and this pointer here is null in the other branch x is null and ... " ) .
For me I can quite literally * feel* " brain resources " being freed up when using Haskell , which I can use to get stuff done quicker ( or probably more accurate : I can feel how much brainpower I waste on book keeping and keeping track of this " mental log " when using languages like C++ ) .
Also purity is very interesting when you want to paralellize programs ( a pure function can be executed on any thread , at any time , and its guaranteed to never interfer with the computation of other functions -- in impure languages this does n't hold at all ! ) .
This is probably the killer app for functional programming IMO .
FP is cool for a number of reasons , but I think " is n't almost unusable in a multithreaded setting " is what sets it apart the most from imperative languages .
Haskell also has STM which is great for that low level shared state concurrency that you sometimes need ( no locks , monitors , or any of that non-composable , insanity - inducing , messiness ! ) >
Are n't Haskell 's advantages outweighed by its complexity ( Monads , etc. ) > and > rigidity ?
I can sometimes feel that Haskell looses out on not being user friendly in the Java sense ( i.e. " cut out any feature that can't be understood in five minutes by a chimp " ) .
Some things do take some effort to learn , but there is a huge payoff for it ( it 's really powerful ! ) .
But yeah , there might be plenty of folks who will never bother learning about them , and they wo n't understand your code .

I just read another linux advocacy article off of reddit , in this case Five Reasons why Linux will eventually rule the world , and it hit a lot of my pet peeves about these kinds of articles .
In a nutshell , for users , all that matters is that their work gets done , and all other arguments are wasted bits .
I have a few suggestions for open source / linux advocates :
Do n’t mention Microsoft
Just do n’t do it .
My friend Nathan has a set of trolls , and regularly downmods anything referring to those in any setting ( slashdot , reddit , what - have - you ) , and for you linux advocates , Microsoft should enter your troll - sphere .
I ’ve heard that any press is good press , and while that might not be true ( ask Bush about Iraq ) , I do know that zero press is zero press .
I also believe that branding - advertiso - brainwashing works ( ask deBeers ) , so do everyone a favor and not mention the “ competition ” .
At this point the fact that Microsoft exists is almost a non-issue to you .
You solve all your problems without Microsoft products , so they are about as relevant to you as vitameatavegamin .
Do n’t mention intangibles
For most people , the choice of operating system or office suite has nothing to do with freedom , morality , or elegance of the code .
It ’s a non-issue for non-techies , and a dead end for advocates .
Technical folks can look all that up , and understand the advantages / disadvantages , but you do n’t need to convince them .
You need to convince the non-technical CEOs and managers who believe that using open source takes money from their pocket .
I run into people in the course of my job who have little to no to false understanding of what “ open source ” really means .
I ’d guess half the CEOs in the country think that their codebase is their competitive advantage , and if they employ open source then competitors will steal their business .
They will not be convinced by tirades about liberty .
Blog your solutions
Get a blogger account , and start blogging how you solved your problems using linux or open source .
Please , do n’t plan to run your own server from your apartment with your hand - rolled Erlang blog engine , cause you ’ll never get to it .
Just go ahead and start the blogger account with the crappy template that does n’t use CSS classes the way you ’d prefer .
When people google to solve their problem , you want there to be multitudes of open source solutions clogging the results .
This mostly already happens , but more content ca n’t hurt , and I ’m curious how many dead accounts blogger will keep hosting .
Appeal to the wallet
In case you have n’t realized it , money makes the world go round .
That will remain the case until the either the zombies or the aliens arrive , and then we ’ll have a brief respite while exchange rates re-adjust .
When people ask why they should use open source , the answer needs to be “ because it saves you money ” .
Last week alone using Firefox with Firebug saved me probably 12 hours worth of time in debugging javascript and reverse - engineering colors and styling from a mock - up .
That sort of productivity gain gives managers and CEOs a high equivalent to 3 whippets .
Time and cost savings need to be a main point in any article designed to convince someone to switch .
Focus on the user benefit
Users care about how they benefit .
That ’s it .
I feel this Gimp vs Photoshop article is a good example of open source advocacy .
It ’s focused on what benefits differentiate the two , and concludes : I know I ’ve beat the horse to death , but unless you want to pirate software , there is no reason to use Photoshop if you ’re not producing a print publication – use the Gimp .
That is the essential message to send : “ Unless you want to ( increase cost | increase risk | break the law | behave irrationally ) , use the open source equivalent ” .
Be rational
Lastly , and most importanly , you have to be rational .
Avoid ( or at least acknowledge ) logical fallacies , call spades spades , and admit weaknesses where you believe them to be .
Do n’t speak as if you are the end - all , be - all authority .
Computing is ridiculously varied , and your solution might not work for others for a wide variety of legitimate reasons .
Your mileage will always vary .
Do n’t be whiny .
I read many posts about linux , and sometimes all I can hear is Luke Skywalker whining “ But I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters … ” .
It does n’t matter if its unfair , it does n’t matter if its right , it does n’t matter if its monopolist , do n’t whine .
Open source is going to take over the world , but not because M$ sux0rs or the mafiaa does n’t want you to watch DVDs .
Advocates , next time you want to rant about Microsoft doing something bad for humanity , take some time and additionally post how you solve a day - to - day problem .
Open source and linux will win because they will be the path of least resistance , and as advocates , it ’s our job to make sure the path of least resistence is well - lit .
This tutorial will show you how to create a great looking dark logo using Adobe Photoshop .
Start by Opening a new document
Now using the text tool type the word “ Darkness ” on the screen using white as the color .
The font that I am using is blade 2 and the size is 150 px .
The Blade 2 font can be downloaded here .
Now open the Layer Style window by right clicking the layer and selecting Blending Options .
Now apply an Outer Glow with the following settings .
Now the Bevel and Emboss settings .
Then apply this gradient overlay .
Here are the color settings for the gradient .
Now apply the settings and your image should look like this .
Now we need to add another layer .
With the shape Custom Shape tool select the Grass 3 shape , pictured below .
This is a default shape in Photoshop CS2
Use white as your fore color and draw a large section of grass over top of your text .
Now set the layer blend mode to Overlay and reduce the Opacity to 63 %
Now you are finished .
Your final image should look like this .
it depends on businesses working together , on them cooperating
personal
just enough

( Update - Mar 21 - fixed a couple of typos and added the link )
Do n't get too excited by the title .
But I do want to share a few thoughts ...
It was running through my head just now , the work that we were doing here in Moncton to work on an e-learning cluster .
Because I saw that ' cluster building ' is still one of the major pillars of NRC 's strategy , and I was wondering whether our work would ever be a part of that again .
And I was thinking about some of the things that did n't go so well in our first few years .
Some companies went under - a couple , before we even talked to them , another , after we were in a project with them .
And then there was the company that we sat down with , oh in 2002 or 2003 , and laid it all out - RSS , content syndication , social networks .
The whole Web 2.0 thing .
And they were n't interested .
And in less than a year , they were gone .
And I thought about where we 're right today and where we might be wrong , and why .
Because despite having a pretty good track record ( check for yourself , it 's all on the public record - this year 's predictions ( bucking everyone else ) include OpenID and the runaway success of Wii ) .
And I 'm saying the semantic web wo n't work .
Ca n't work .
But how do you explain that intuition ?
And I was thinking about the edgy things of Web 2.0 , and where they 're working , and more importantly , where they 're beginning to show some cracks .
A few of key things today :- Yahoo is forcing people to give up their Flickr identities and to join the mother ship , and - MySpace is blocking all the widgets that are n't supported by some sort of business deal with MySpace - the rumour that Google is turning off the search APIAnd that 's when I realized :
The Semantic Web will never work becauseWe are talking about the most conservative bunch of people in the world , people who believe in greed and cut - throat business ethics .
People who would steal one another 's property if it were n't nailed down .
People like , well , Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch .
And they 're all going to play nice and create one seamless Semantic Web that will work between companies - competing entities choreographing their responses so they can work together to grant you a seamless experience ?
Not a chance .
Now - there are many technical reasons why I think the Semantic Web is a loser , along with some cultural and philosophical reasons .
Namely : the people who designed the Semantic Web never read their epistemology texts .
But the big problem is they believed everyone would work together :- would agree on web standards ( hah ! ) - would adopt a common vocabulary ( you do n't say ) - would reliably expose their APIs so anyone could use them ( as if ) Shall I go on ?
So ... Maybe we wo n't be building clusters in Moncton , maybe we will .
I do n't know - I 'd like to keep trying .
Maybe people will listen to us or maybe ( more likely ) they wo n't .
The future is not in the Semantic Web ( or in Java , or in enterprise computing - all for the same reason ) .
Careers based on that premise will founder .
Because the people saying all the semantic - webbish things - speak the same language , standardize your work , orchestrate the services - are the people who will shut down the pipes , change the standards , and look out for their own interests ( at the expense of yours ) .
I do n't trust any of them .
Not even as far as I could throw them .
Because I know they 'd sell me down the river in a minute , if it meant one iota of business advantage .
You know this too .
Yeah - we 'll play games on Yahoo , create a not - too - serious blog with Google , post some tunes on MySpace ( under an alias of course ) , and mess around with some photos on Flickr .
And we 'll even go along with some unimportant things , like the university account and email , so we can access the course notes on Blackboard .
The personal email address , that we got from our ISP , we will tell only to our closest friends - and we 'll use the gmail account for logons and the Yahoo identity for spam .
We 'll post to these Web 2.0 sites , but if the content means anything , we 'll keep a copy on our computer as well ( until Windows crashes and eats all your data , that is ) .
But trust them ?
Not a chance .
The future of the web will be based oncomputing .
Not because everybody in the world is some sort of Ayn - Rand - clone backstabbing money - grubbing leech .
But because there 'sof them - and they 're the ones who tend to rise in business .
And whensay " give me your data " ( or " let me manage your money " or " base your career on my advice " ) it 's merely a prelude to their attempting to take you to the cleaners .
If my online world depends on them - and in the Semantic Web , it would - then my online world will fail .
Will be a house of cards that will eventually collapse .
Yeah - I know .
It 's not a technical argument .
And it probably reveals some of my own biases .
But I can't shake the intuition that I 'm right here .
Experts say lying patients at risk CHICAGO 
There 's an open secret in medicine : Patients lie .
They lie about how much they smoke and whether they 're taking their medicine .
They understate how much they drink and overstate how much they exercise .
They feign symptoms to get appointments quicker and ask doctors to hide the truth from insurance companies .
" Doctors have a rule of thumb .
Whatever the patient says they 're drinking , multiply it by three , " said Dr. Bruce Rowe , a family doctor in suburban Milwaukee .
" If they say two drinks a day , assume they have six . "
Hippocrates , the father of medicine , is said to have warned his students around 400 B.C. that patients often dissemble when they say they 've taken their medicine .
TV 's fictional Dr. Gregory
House repeats the same message to his crack team : " Everybody lies . "
But lying can lead to expensive diagnostic procedures and unneeded referrals to specialists .
It also can have disastrous results .
" I definitely learned my lesson .
I could have ended up in a coma , " said Michael Levine , a 28 - year - old financial adviser in Los Angeles , who lied to a specialist he saw for a wrist injury .
Misguided pride , he said , kept him from mentioning the Xanax he was taking for anxiety .
He did n't think the doctor needed to know .
" He was n't my regular doctor .
He was treating my wrist , " Levine explained .
The doctor prescribed the pain reliever Vicodin and Levine took it on top of Xanax .
The next few days vanished in a cloud of grogginess .
Levine slept through ringing phones and alarms and woke up exhausted .
His wrist pain was easing , but he could barely function .
Eventually , he stopped the Vicodin , returned to the doctor and , under questioning , confessed .
" The doctor said , ' Why did n't you tell me ?
I never would have prescribed you that , " ' said Levine , who now realizes how easily he could have overdosed and died .
" For the future , I will always ' fess up . "
Why do patients lie ?
The examination room itself is an environment that discourages honesty , said Los Angeles psychiatrist Dr. Charles Sophy .
" You 're naked in a gown and you have a guy standing there clothed , with a coat on and there 's all sorts of things in his pocket .
And you 're sitting there , basically naked ... that makes it hard to come clean , " Sophy said .
On top of that , the doctor may be rushed .
Researchers say patients often lie to save face .
They want to be " good patients " in their doctors ' eyes .
But that 's a misguided and risky practice .
For example , a woman who does n't want to admit she smokes and then is prescribed birth control pills is at greater risk for blood clots .
Some researchers estimate more than half of patients tell their doctors they 're taking their medicine exactly as prescribed when they 're not .
In reality , they do n't like the side effects , can't afford the pills or did n't understand the instructions .
A study by researchers at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine found a big gap between what patients said and what they did .
Researchers looked at how patients with breathing problems used an inhaler equipped with a device that recorded the date and time of use and compared that with what the patients said .
Seventy - three percent of patients reported using the inhaler on average three times a day , but only 15 % actually were using it that often .
And 14 % apparently deliberately emptied their inhalers before their appointments to make it look as if they were good patients .
Some doctors are seeking approaches that encourage more honesty .
Dr. Zach Rosen , medical director of New York 's Montefiore Family Health Center , asks his patients a series of questions to determine whether they 're taking their medicine .
" I ask , ' What medications are you taking ? '
At first , I just want the names , " he said .
" They say , ' I 'm taking X , Y or Z . '
Then I 'll say , ' That 's great .
How often are you taking that medication ? ' ...
Then I 'll say , ' Are you experiencing any problem in taking your medications ? " '
Asking several questions takes more time .
But the approach elicits better , more honest responses than a single question , Rosen believes .
Doctors also should avoid phrases that sound judgmental , said Nate Rickles , an assistant professor of pharmacy at Northeastern University .
There 's a big difference between " Why are n't you taking the medication as prescribed ? " and " A number of my patients do n't take their medication as prescribed and they do it for a variety of reasons .
What do you think might be going on with you ? "
When alcoholics seek detox treatment from Dr. Akikur Mohammad , an addiction specialist at the University of Southern California School of Medicine , they must tell him exactly how much they 've been drinking so he can give them the right dose of medication to treat withdrawal .
" I tell them , ' You can lie to your friend , you can lie to your family members , but you came here for help and your report will determine the treatment plan .
If I undermedicate you , you may have seizures and die , " ' Mohammad said .
Despite the warnings , patients still sometimes mislead him , he said .
Cyndi Smith , a 45 - year - old Weight Watchers leader in suburban Chicago , admits her own lying past when it came to questions about her exercise and eating habits .
She says she lied because she was fooling herself .
" You convince yourself of certain things and it becomes true , when in reality it 's not , " she said .
If her doctor had questioned her more thoroughly , she says she might have told the truth .
" I think doctors could be a little more point - blank , " she said .
" And we need to be a little more honest . "

Wednesday the European Commission released a series of Communications proposing a new revolutionary Energy Policy attempting to address EU ’s energy challenges for the XXI century .
This is a set of first comments to such proposals .
[ ED by Prof. Goose ] Jerome a Paris also has an article on the EU energy plan today , it can be found here .
It will be up on TOD : Main tomorrow morning .
This new Energy Policy can be considered revolutionary for two reasons , first it acknowledges ( although shyly ) problems in the future energy supply and secondly it integrates Energy and the Environment .
In doing so the Commission clearly draws a direction towards energy efficiency / conservation that suits both concerns with energy sources and sinks .
But in spite of a new clearer direction being drawn , the ways to follow it are in some cases not at all clear and in others openly wrong .
Following is a brief analysis of each of the Communications , taking in perspective the daunting challenges imposed by the internal peaks in Oil and Gas production .
A New Impetus for the Internal Energy Market ( full text )
The EU has clearly recognised that the internal energy market is the policy line that ensures fair prices to citizens and industries .
At the same time , it guarantees that even smaller companies , for instance those that invest in renewable energy , have access to the energy market .
A well functioning market also ensures sufficient investments in power plants and transmission networks to avoid interruptions in power or gas supply .
In order to realise the full potential of the internal gas and electricity market , the European Commission has put forward new proposals as part of its Energy Policy for Europe .
The main goal of this Communication is a fully integrated energy market , both physically as economically .
First to achieve is the complete liberalization of the electrical and gas networks .
On the electrical network , emphasis is given to the decoupling of the generation and distribution sectors , still commonly hold locally by the same companies .
The Commission believes that a more competitive internal market will allow more efficiency and investment , benefiting consumers and improving supply security .
On the Physical side the Commission has as goal to achieve a fully integrated internal energy network by January of 2009 , leading to a true single European energy grid .
An unified grid is for the Commission essential to secure sufficient generation capacity in the future .
Four lines of action are drawn to achieve such grid :
Separation of energy production from energy distribution ;
Management by a single body in partnership with the Commission ;
Transparency ;
Investment in bottlenecks ( mainly borders between countries ) .
On the last item the Commission has a clear idea where the investment is needed :
A number of the most problematic missing links has been identified , such as power links between Germany , Poland and Lithuania , off - shore wind power connections in Northern Europe , electricity connections between Spain and France , gas pipelines from the Caspian to central Europe .
Since the model of state owned energy utilities is being put aside by the EU it is naturally better to have the private owned companies working on a fully liberalized market , improving the service to the final costumer .
In such model , liberalization measures are surely welcome .
As for the Integrated Energy Grid it also presents major improvements for the EU internal energy market , allowing for better load balancing and helping to give a single “ energy voice ” to the Union .
But beyond that , a fully integrated energy grid is essential to take complete advantage of the growing renewable energy generation sector , allowing for the compensation of its intermittent nature .
Such integration is already underway in Scandinavia with encouraging results .
Absent from this section of the initiative are measures to directly address the current peaking of internal Natural Gas production .
Although put forward as so , market liberalization wont secure the increasing Natural Gas imports needed in the following years to meet internal demand .
Lines of action to substitute Natural Gas or to secure other foreign sources simply do not exist .
The main energy problem in Europe is not mentioned even less dealt with .
A Low CO2 fossil fuel future ( full text )
Climate protection involves making the most efficient use possible of our available energy sources .
The potential to increase the efficiency of converting coal into electricity must therefore be exploited in Europe and worldwide .
Furthermore , the technologies for the capture and permanent storage of carbon dioxide produced by power plants must be developed further and used more widely .
As part of its Energy Policy for Europe , the European Commission has adopted today a Communication on how to generate power from fossil fuels in a sustainable manner with a focus on sustainable coal technologies – these will enable coal to maintain its important contribution to secure and competitive energy supplies for Europe .
In this section the Commission acknowledges that Oil and Natural Gas will leave the dominating position in the current energy mix , expecting the world - wide doubling of the electricity produced from Coal by 2030 .
Such doubling , thinks the Commission , will turn the EU on a net Coal exporter from the current net importer position .
Internal Oil production has already peaked , Natural Gas production is peaking , Coal is being imported from as far as New Zealand ; how that will evolve to a Coal surplus is hard to envision .
The Commission is endorsing Coal as the alternative energy source capable of assuring the correct energy security for the EU .
To achieve such goal the Commission pretends to improve research and investment on CO2 capture and storage technology , systematizing the use of “ near zero emission ” power generation by 2020 .
To further improve it , the Emission Trading Scheme is proposed to incorporate capture and storage .
On this section two main lines of action are drawn :
Design a mechanism to stimulate the construction and operation by 2015 of up to 12 large - scale demonstrations of sustainable fossil fuel technologies in commercial power generation in the EU ;
Provide a clear perspective when coal - and gas - fired power plants will need to install CO2 capture and storage .
Today , the Commission believes that by 2020 all new coal - fired plants should include CO2 capture and storage technologies and existing plants should then progressively follow the same approach .
This push for “ clean coal ” presents some very optimistic views on this finite energy source .
Coal is simply admitted as being capable of fulfilling the energy needs of the EU and the World , in whatever flow rates desired .
The declining EROEI of European Coal Exploration and the EROEI reduction imposed by CO2 capture and storage are ignored , leaving a considerable hole in this Communication .
Promoting biofuels as credible alternatives to oil in transport ( full text )
With the significant rise in oil prices and the growing concern about stable , secure and environmentally friendly energy supplies , the promotion of biofuels use in transport is a priority on the European political agenda .
Today , biofuels are the only way to significantly reduce oil dependence in the transport sector .
As part of its Energy Policy for Europe , the Commission is committed to encouraging the production and use of biofuels by proposing to set a binding minimum target for biofuels of 10 % of vehicle fuel by 2020 .
Unfortunately this is the weakest section of the initiative , exactly where it should be the strongest .
Like the Commission notes
Oil represents today 98 % of the base energy used for transportation , and transportation accounting for more than half of the EU ’s Oil consumption .
But for the Commission life without cars and trucks is unimaginable .
The lines of action pointed are two : tax exemption for biofuels and the introduction of biofuels obligations .
The fuels of election are those usable in today ’s internal combustion engines : biodiesel ( from rapeseed , sunflower , etc ) and bioethanol ( beet , cereals , etc ) .
The Commission seems to be taking the same unsuccessful path took by the US executive , keeping the business - as - usual auto dependency and in parallel promoting oil substitution by fuels with lower or even negative EROEI .
At roughly the same latitudes , European states do not present harvest improvements over the low results already patent across the Atlantic .
Absent is also an assessment of the impact of such policies in food production .
Without actions to reduce demand and with substitution policies bound to failure , Transport dependency on foreign Oil is set to grow .
Without a proper energy policy for Transport the whole program rest at risk .
A major change in attitude and concept towards Transport is needed ; life without ( or with less ) cars and trucks has to start to be imaginable .
An energy policy for Europe : Commission steps up to the energy challenges of the 21st Century ( full text )
The world today is facing energy and environmental challenge , a challenge that is acute for Europe , and a challenge which is shared by all Member States .
This is : how to secure competitive and clean energy for Europe against a backdrop of climate change , escalating global energy demand and future supply uncertainties .
If one Member State fails to meet this challenge , other Member States will be affected .
If problems arise outside the European Union , they can have an impact on the whole of the EU .
This is why Europe needs a strong energy policy .
The European Commission ' Strategic Energy Review is an important step towards an effective energy policy for Europe .
Again the Commission shyly admits to difficulties in the future energy supply .
To tackle that a new integrated Energy Policy is endorsed where the EU acts to the outside as a single unified bloc .
This new energy unity will promote economic growth and limit the vulnerability of the Union to Oil and Gas imports .
Such policy will mean , in the Commission words , “ the EU taking global leadership in catalyzing a new industrial revolution ” , defining the following lines of action :
Energy efficiency ;
raising the share of renewable energy in the energy mix ;
reinforcing solidarity among Member States ;
a renewed focus on nuclear safety and security ;
determined efforts for the EU to " speak with one voice " with its international partners
Although lacking more objective measures ( which might not belong to such communications ) these simple five items show that the Commission has the compass showing the correct direction .
All of these lines of action move towards independence from foreign fossil fuel sources , and this time the optimistic views on Coal and biofuels are left out .
The sense that the European Commission is correctly acknowledging the current European energy scenario is materialized in one of the most important sentences in these Communications :
The concern is not only about climate change , it is also about Europe 's security of energy supply , economy and the wellbeing of its citizens .
Even without climate change , there is every reason to take the steps proposed by the European Commission .
Final Comments
“ Too little too late ” is a sentence that comes to mind when considering this whole set of Communications .
The real problem of internal and foreign peaks in fossil fuel production is only indirectly admitted and the lines of action put forward rely either on other fossil fuels ( Coal for electricity generation ) or on low EROEI renewable sources ( biofuels for transportation ) .
Market Liberalization , although positive in a privatized model , is presented as a factor of securing energy supply – something it simply can not do .
Still , having an Energy Policy is better than having none , and the final tone stressing Energy Efficiency and the role of Renewable and Nuclear Energy sources on a New Industrial Revolution towards energy independency and sustainability leaves some hope .
Finally is worth stressing that none of these initiatives are effective , for they lack the approval of the European Council .
Early next March the Council will reunite for the Spring Summit and analyze these proposals .
The 27 member states will be at the table and the obstacle put to such measures are already unfolding , with larger countries opposing the Market Liberalization issues and smaller polluting countries opposing the CO2 emission targets for 2020 .
On this last subject the fact that Italy , Spain and Portugal ( three of the countries farther from meeting Kyoto targets ) are being governed by Socialist executives might be a point in favor , but at the Council ’s table much is different .
This in turn stresses that beyond a new Energy Policy the EU still needs a new Political Model .
Either in the form of the European Constitution or in other form , only with clearer effective powers can the European Commission correctly achieve “ one voice ” Energy Policy for the EU .
Here 's something worth thinking about , from today 's WaPo :
Deep inside the Library of Congress , 500 researchers pound out the secret intelligence Congress uses to make law .
Legislators request 6,000 Congressional Research Service reports a year , on weapons systems and farm subsidies , prescription prices and energy use .
Together , they offer what lobbyists and industry want most : clues to what 's next on the Hill .
For years , open - government groups have fought to make the reports public , and for years , many lawmakers have kept them under wraps .
Or so they thought .
CRS is a vital tool for Members and staff , and consistently produces some of the most reliable , non-partisan research products available , on a dizzying array of subjects .
Their task , essentially , is finding the answers to anything Members want to know about .
And with an army of skilled researchers and the incredible resources of the Library of Congress , they 're not only turning out the best " intelligence " around , but they 're also creating a secondary market for the stuff .
By insisting on secrecy , Congress instead created a bootleg market for the research .
Every day , a small Texas company compiles the reports and sells them to lobbyists , lawyers and others who pay thousands of dollars for a peek at the reports and what they say about the congressional agenda .
And it 's all legal .
Why ?
Because CRS produces these reports for Congress , as their employees .
That makes their reports essentially work for hire , and that means that they 're the property of Congress , and the Congress can dispose of them as they see fit .
In practice , that means that most Members will happily supply constituents with copies of prepared reports ( though they 're not supposed to commission such reports on anyone else 's behalf ) .
But in order to request a copy , you 've got to know it exists .
That 's the information that 's most jealously guarded , as the full Post article notes , because it 's a rich source of " intelligence " on what Members of Congress are asking questions about ( and therefore a hint about what legislation they may be pondering ) .
But there 's another reason , too .
As Walt Seager , the researcher whose company sells subscriptions to compilations of the reports , explains :
For one thing , he said , " incumbents like to provide them to their constituents [ saying ] ' glad to be of service , hint , hint , remember me at election time . ' " Second , he said , CRS is " a think tank working for [ members ] exclusively and not for the people running against them .
They 've got all this brainpower behind them making them look very knowledgeable . "
So how can you , Mr. or Ms. Lowly Citizen , get a peek into " Congress ' Brain " the way denizens of " Gucci Gulch " do ?
Well , for a cool four grand a year , you can subscribe to Seager 's " Gallery Watch . "
The next best option ?
Thank your lucky stars for the dedication of the Federation of American Scientists ' Steven Aftergood , and add their Secrecy News to your blogroll , as I have .
Aftergood has made it his mission -- or at least one of them -- to compile and disseminate the newest and most notable CRS reports he can get his hands on .
According to the Post , the free stuff lags considerably behind the pay services , with about 10 % of the CRS output available , but it 's a good start and a great idea .
So go ahead and poke around .
It just may be that a community like Daily Kos can take the Secrecy News ' work to the next level , providing another collaborative forum for analysis and discussion of what Aftergood turns up for us .
Shop around .
It 's your money paying for it , after all .
The Latin American Clock
The number one faux - pas that you can commit in Peru , as in many other Latin American countries , is to show up on time for a social invitation .
For lunch they will probably invite you at 1:30 pm but you are not expected until 2:30 – 3 pm .
Dinner guests will usually start arriving around 9 pm even though the invitation may have called for 8 pm .
If you are like me and have your moods determined by your hunger levels , then I recommend that you eat a snack before attending a lunch or dinner party in Peru or fill up on the ' bocaditos ' ( appetizers ) .
Not only is it a given that everyone will arrive one or two hours past the invited time but you can count on the food being served well past the time when your stomach has finished growling , you 've felt faint and are probably past a comfortable state of inebriation from the Pisco sours being served .
Peruvians not only have a tendency to start things late but when socializing they also love extending gatherings for as long as is physically possible .
I suppose tardiness is acceptable when you do it among friends but recently Peruvian authorities decided that this behaviour of showing up late for everything , including business meetings , has to change .
As this article in the Guardian indicates , a government - led council is working on an initiative called ' La Hora sin Demora ' , or ' Time without Delay ' .
On March 1 at noon , sharp , sirens will sound and church bells will ring with the hope that 27 million Peruvians will synchronize their watches , and an opening ceremony will be televised .
The idea is that one should be ashamed about arriving late after a nation - wide effort of that magnitude .
Old habits will likely die hard , however , as many people feel that ' Peruvian time ' is part of the culture of being Peruvian .
The issue will also be a matter of perception - according to the article , a recent poll indicates that 80 % of Peruvians think that they are punctual .
That 's likely because in Peru most people will consider being less than an hour late to be ' on time ' .
Keep in mind that when in Peru , better late than early , or you may be helping to set up the table !
Stay tuned for our upcoming coverage of Peru for other cultural tips !

Travel Advice & Recommendations From Local Experts
The outspoken President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran has challenged President Bush to debate U.S. - Iran relations .
Bush has dismissed the offer and declined .
Debate is not good - faith negotiation between the opposing parties , but it is better than nothing .
And it might not be as one - sided as most Americans think .
We could certainly fantasize about how such a debate might play out .
President Bush , of course , would begin by accusing Iran of support for the “ Islamo - fascist ” group Hezbollah , which is attacking Israel .
Ahmadinejad might respond that the president should quit using the term “ fascism ” in a Goebbels - like attempt to associate every U.S. rival , no matter how small , with the massively rich and well - armed Nazis of World War II .
After all , “ fascism ” merely means the government intertwining itself with business , with a little ultra-nationalism thrown in .
Ahmadinejad might also note that Hezbollah , al - Qaeda , and most other radical Islamic organizations do n’t even control governments ( Hamas in Palestine being the exception ) , and that all are pushing mainly Sunni or Shi’ite Islamic agendas , rather than fierce nationalism per se .
Ahmadinejad might then ask Bush why the United States , all the way across the world from Iran , is more threatened by a relatively poor country garnering nuclear weapons than are the nations of Europe .
Bush would have to answer that the United States is the world ’s only superpower and that it has to be worried by every adverse development anywhere in the world , or its allies might decide that they need to obtain nuclear weapons or bigger armed forces to defend themselves  thus challenging U.S. supremacy .
Bush might then ask Ahmadinejad why Iran has decided to defy the United Nations , which has ordered Iran to stop enriching uranium .
The Iranian president might answer that the United States regularly defies the UN when things do not go its way .
Furthermore , Ahmadinejad would likely ask whether Iran should follow the United Nations or the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , of which Iran is a signatory .
The treaty allows Iran to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes .
Ahmadinejad might demand that , after the U.S. intelligence fiasco on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , the United States produce compelling and conclusive evidence  which a new International Atomic Energy Agency report does not provide  that Iran is enriching uranium at high enough levels to make nuclear bombs .
Then the Iranian president might ask Bush how he thinks countries out of favor with the United States will have any incentive to refrain from pursuing nuclear weapons , when these armaments seem to be the only deterrent to a U.S. attack .
After all , one need only compare U.S. actions toward a non-nuclear Iraq under Saddam Hussein with those vis-à - vis a nuclear North Korea .
Ahmadinejad might then ask Bush why , if Iran would offer to end its nuclear program , he will not guarantee that he wo n’t attack the Persian state .
Bush would have to reply that the United States needs to reserve the right to attack any enemy of its Israeli ally .
The Iranian leader might wonder aloud why the United States is so slavish in its support for Israel  noting that it reaps little in return for all the billions in military and economic aid donated , except blowback anti-U.S. terrorism .
He might add that Israel is now a wealthy country with 200 or more nuclear weapons , and should be able to defend itself adequately without being on the U.S. dole .
To close , Bush might ask Iran why it continues to support such terrorism .
Ahmadinejad would reply that the United States should be less concerned than it is about Iran ’s support for Islamic groups , because the groups supported do n’t focus their attacks on the United States .
In closing , Ahmadinejad might ask Bush whether he thinks the U.S. government is living up to its primary responsibility of ensuring the security of its citizens against the greatest threat they face  attacks from al - Qaeda  rather than getting sidetracked by fretting about poor countries , such as Saddam ’s Iraq , Iran , and North Korea , getting nuclear weapons .
The Iranian president might point out that , unlike al - Qaeda , all of these countries have “ home addresses , ” and ultimately could be deterred from imposing nuclear attacks on the United States by the retaliatory threat of massive incineration by the world ’s most potent nuclear arsenal .
Bush would then probably lamely reply in cliché that a superpower has global interests and that you ca n’t deter crazy foreign leaders whose customs and ways of doing things do n’t resemble those of the U.S. government .
In conclusion , the foregoing mock debate in no way suggests that the authoritarian , theocratic regime in Iran is superior to the American republic .
But even autocratic states sometimes have legitimate security concerns .
And even admirable republics sometimes can swerve off the path of common sense in foreign policy .
A 12 - year - old self - taught driver out looking for boys in her grandmother 's car led police on a brief chase that reached 110 k mh in a 60 k mh zone early today .
Police were shocked to find the driver of a car they were pursuing early this morning was a 12 - year - old girl .
Police from Reservoir noticed the Mitsubishi wagon driving without headlights along Mahoneys Road , Thomastown about 1.45 am but when they attempted to pull the car over it accelerated away and a short pursuit ensued .
Associate Professor Michael King of the University of Rochester Biomedical Engineering Department has invented a device that filters the blood for cancer and stem cells .
When he captures cancer cells , he kills them .
When he captures stem cells , he harvests them for later use in tissue engineering , bone marrow transplants , and other applications that treat human disease and improve health .
With Nichola Charles , Jared Kanofsky , and Jane L. Liesveld of the University of Rochester , King wrote about his discoveries in " Using Protein - Functionalized Microchannels for Stem Cell Separation , " Paper No. ICNMM2006 -96228 , Proceedings of the ASME , June 2006 .
King 's team includes scientists at StemCapture , Inc. , a Rochester company that bought the University patent for King 's technique in November 2005 to build the cancer - killing and stem cell - harvesting devices .
The technique can be used in vivo , meaning a device is inserted in the body , or in vitro , in which case the device resides outside of the body – either way , the device kills cancer cells and captures stem cells , which grow into blood cells , bone , cartilage , and fat .
When King was working at the University of Pennsylvania from 1999 to 2001 , one of his labmates discovered that bone marrow stem cells stick to adhesive proteins called selectins more strongly than other cells -- including blood cells -- stick to selectins .
When King came to the University of Rochester in early 2002 , he started studying the adhesion of blood cells to the vascular wall , the inner lining of the blood vessels .
During inflammation , the vascular wall presents surface selectins that adhere specifically to white blood cells .
These selectins cause the white blood cells to roll slowly along the vascular wall , seeking signals that tell them to crawl out of the bloodstream .
This is how white blood cells migrate to bacterial infections and tissue injuries .
King set out to find a way to duplicate this natural process .
First , he noted that the selectins form bonds with the white blood cells within fractions of a second , then immediately release the cells back into the bloodstream .
He also realized that selectin is the adhesive mechanism by which bone marrow stem cells leave the bloodstream and find their way back into bone marrow .
This is how bone marrow transplantation works .
Finally , he learned that when a cancer cell breaks free of a primary tumor and enters circulation , it flow through the bloodstream to a remote organ , then leaves the bloodstream and forms a secondary tumor .
This is how cancer spreads .
He put these facts together with one more , very important fact : the selectins grab onto a specific carbohydrate on the surfaces of white blood cells , stem cells , and cancer cells .
Associate Professor King decided to capture stem and cancer cells before the selectins release them .
Harvesting Stem Cells
Because bone marrow stem cells stick to selectin surfaces more strongly than other cells , King 's group coated a slender plastic tube with selectin .
They then did a series of lab experiments , both in vitro and in vivo using rats , with this selectin - coated tube to filter the bloodstream for stem cells .
It worked , and the King Lab discovered that they could attract a large number of cells to the wall of their selectin - coated device , and that 38 % of these captured cells were stem cells .
King envisioned a system by which doctors could remove stem cells from the bloodstream by flowing the cells through a device , and make a more concentrated mixture containing , say , 20 - 40 percent stem cells .
These stem cells could then be used for tissue engineering or bone marrow transplantation .
This is a non-controversial way of obtaining stem cells that can be differentiated into other , useful cells .
King 's team can capture significant amounts of cells of the lymphatic and circulatory systems , and potentially mesenchymal stem cells , which are unspecialized cells that form tissue , bone , and cartilage .
Current procedures enable the specific capture of hematopoietic stem cells , which grow ( or differentiate ) over time into all of the different blood cells , and the specific capture of stem cells that differentiate into bone marrow cells .
The device itself uses a combination of microfluidics , or fluid flow properties , and specialized selectin coatings .
Killing Cancer Cells
Another exciting application of King 's invention is filtering the blood for cancer cells and triggering their death , an innovative , new method to prevent the spread of cancer .
When someone has a primary cancer tumor , a small number of cancer cells circulates through the bloodstream .
In a process called metastasis , these cells are transmitted from the primary tumor to other locations in the body , where they form secondary , cancerous growths .
As a cancer cell flows along the implanted surface , King 's device captures it and delivers an apoptosis signal , a biochemical way of telling the cancer cell to kill itself .
Within two days , that cancer cell is dead .
Normal cells are left totally unharmed because the device selectively targets cancer cells .
The apoptosis signal is delivered by a molecule called TRAIL that coats the cancer - killing device .
Cancer cells have five types of proteins that recognize and bind to TRAIL , but only two trigger cell death .
The other three are called decoy receptors .
Healthy cells contain a lot of decoy receptors , giving them a natural protection against TRAIL , whereas cancer cells mainly express the two receptors that signal cell death .
During the death of the cancer cells , TRAIL is not depleted or used up in any way , and in fact , it stays active for many weeks or months .
The same TRAIL molecules can kill enormous numbers of cancer cells .
A possible way to use the cancer - killing invention is to implant the device in the body before primary tumor surgery or chemotherapy .
When doctors remove a primary tumor , the procedure itself can release cancer cells into the bloodstream .
King 's device would grab those cancer cells and kill them , greatly reducing the possibility of metastasis .
Associate Professor King envisions that the device would use a shunt similar to the type used in hospitals today .
This shunt would reside on the exterior of the arm or be implanted beneath the skin .
Some of the blood flow would bypass the capillary bed and instead go into the shunt , which could remain implanted for many weeks , continually removing and killing cancer cells .
King 's first targets are colorectal cancer and blood malignancies such as leukemia .

Why has autism gone up so much ?
Has autism gone up so much ?
Of all the questions that readers of Freakonomics ask me to explore , understanding the explosion in autism is at or near the top of the list .
I have n’t read the original study , but this news report offers an interesting hypothesis about the rise in autism : older fathers .
Do n’t tell Dubner I ’m citing Wikipedia , but there is a nice entry there devoted to the frequency of autism .
Because the term autism covers such a wide spectrum of diagnoses , even pinning down the simplest questions like “ how much has autism risen ? ” or “ what fraction of the rise is due to changing standards of diagnosis ? ” are hard to answer .
I ’ve been asking myself lately whether an economist could bring anything useful to the study of these questions ?
So far I ’m not sure what the answer is to that question .
Princess Eugenie wo n't accept a royal title for her baby if offered by the Queen because it's a ' curse ' and she wants her child to have 'an ordinary life '
So , the models are the latest to feel the squeeze .
In the February 3 - 4 edition of the Wall Street Journal Weekend Edition Strike a Pose , Count Your Pennies , models are being hurt by reduced fees and foreign models coming to the US to take " their " work .
The chance of becoming successful as a model was already slim - to - none , and Slim just left town it seems .
Models from the former Eastern Bloc are being imported , much to the chagrin of the locals .
During the 2006 Fall Fashion Week , Calvin Klein had all foreign models , and over half were from the former Soviet Union and environs .
The article cites industry experts that say " it 's a client 's market " and that NYC fashion houses are no longer paying at all , instead , you ( might be , but not always be able to ) " work for trade " , meaning you get to keep a dress ( or two ) you 've worn .
This a far cry from when models were paid $ 10 k ( or more ) per show .
Now , Milanese houses are paying about $ 650 , and ply the girls with " think of the exposure you 'll get " ; , which is something that many a still photographer has heard over and over and over again .
The article follows the travails of 18 - year - old Bianca Gomez ( above , right ) in New York , who , among other things , footed her own $ 4 k bill to fly to Milan for auditions .
" After four days and no bookings , Ms. Gomez sat outside the Milan office of her agency 's partner firm , and cried .
' I hate it here , ' she said .
' They do n't treat models as humans . "
This is similar to the treatment that photographers have had to endure for years , by many unapologetic clients who have been known to say , on more than one occasion " If they 'll work for peanuts , then that 's all we 'll pay them . "
To save money elsewhere , " Ms. Gomez takes the subway , cooks macaroni and hot dogs for dinner " .
All this while the fashion houses and media conglomerates make their millions , Ms. Gomez works for a trade for next seasons ' frocks , and unknowing photographers make their images " for photo credit and exposure . "
Worse , the WSJ reports that the coveted cosmetic ad contracts are going to celebrities and not models , for the most part , and the fashion houses fear that big name supermodels will overshadow their lines , so they prefer the unknowns .
Further , the model pays all her expenses for auditions overseas , the agency does not participate , yet when they do get jobs , the agency takes their 20 % off the gross pay , not the net pay , before the model even gets her portion .
Gone are the days when an agency signs a girl and then nurtured their careers , and yet there are no shortages of girls .
For Klein 's show their casting folks looked at between 700 and 1,000 girls for their 22 spots , according to the WSJ .

Adil Najam
Speaking at inaugural ceremony of the Bagh Ibne Qasim in Karachi , General Musharraf announced that one of the tallest buildings in the world is planned to be built in Karachi .
How tall , you ask ?
Well , the word from the top is all of 1947 feet .
One assumes that this number is no coincidence .
I guess there will be something special on the 14th floor and somehow August will also be commemorated .
According to the Daily Times ( Feburary 28 , 2007 ) :
One of the tallest buildings of the world will be constructed in Karachi , President Pervez Musharraf told a ceremony in connection with the inauguration of Bagh Ibn - e - Qasim here on Tuesday night .
The president referred to a project pertaining to a beach and islandÃƒÂ ¢ Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€ žÂ¢s development , and said this would be a mega project of international standard .
He said that land for the project would be reclaimed from the sea and added that the centre of the project would be a 1,947 - foot high building .
ÃƒÂ ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ ¬Ã…â€ œInshallah we will make it .
We must show the world that this is an emerging , progressive and dynamic country and we are second to none .
We know how to handle ourselves .
We know what progress and prosperity means and that is what we need to show to everyone , ÃƒÂ ¢ Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã‚ ?
Musharraf said .
The project would not affect the environment , he added .
There has been , of course , much fanfare about the Centaurus 7 - star Hotel project in Islamabad , and I remain skeptical about the hyperbole accompanying these projects until I actually see them completed .
I will reserve my comments on the trumpeted building itself until I see actual plans and designs for it and until it actually materializes in reality .
One has heard of too many such grandiose projects that never transpired to get all excited about them just yet .
In this case , the legality and appropriateness of the sale of the island where this is to be built remains in question .
However , I find the logic presented by General Musharraf to be rather confusing , even disturbing .
I certainly share his desire to be seen as “ an emerging , progressive and dynamic country ” that is “ second to none . ”
However , it escapes me how building a huge tower will make as any of the above .
Moreover , I have absolutely no idea what he means by “ we know how to handle ourselves ” or how constructing such a building will demonstrate that we do .
Most importantly , I do know that “ progress and prosperity ” is to be measured by means other than the height of one ’s buildings .
I do not wish to sound cynical .
I really do not .
If this actually happens , and if it is well designed and well executed , I will join with my fellow - Pakistanis in a collective bhangra .
But , until then , I remain skeptical mostly because the motivation to build this seems misplaced .
There could be many good reasons to build such a grand project .
And there are many good ways to achieve the objective of demonstrating that Pakistan is “ an emerging , progressive and dynamic country ” that is “ second to none . ”
But neither is the best match for the other .
To be fair , I think the other things that Gen.
Musharraf said in the speech – which were not reported in the story about the tall building – were more on the mark on how to demonstrate that “ we know what progress and prosperity means . ”
For example , according to The News story on the same event the President did show a deeper understanding of the city ’s challenges and priorities :
President Musharraf listed a lack of clean drinking water , the electricity shortage , and a lack of cleanliness as KarachiÃ ƒÂ ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€ žÂ¢s current problems .
He said the electricity problem would also be resolved , and that the city had required 2200 megawatts of electricity per year but now with a population of 15 million its power requirement has risen to 3300 megawatts .
KarachiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€
žÂ¢s demand has increased by 50 percent , he added .
But he said
We will resolve this problem .
Referring to the cityÃƒÂ ¢Ã¢â€ šÂ¬Ã¢â€ žÂ¢s water problem , he said he had provided K - III for 100 mgd water and now he would back up the K - IV water project .
President Musharraf said that Karachi city should also be cleaned and for this purpose negotiations were be held with a private firm for a solid waste management project which would resolve the cleanliness problem .
However , the same story also points out that the President “ directed environmental experts not to create hurdles in the development of the city ” and went on to say :
If we have to make roads for the development of the city and for this if we have to chop the trees , we will do it but then we will also plant more trees .
He was obviously referring to environmental objections to the development of the islands off Karachi .
This attitude of seeing environmental concerns as ‘ hurdles ’ to development does not bode well and is at least two decades outdated in the policy thinking on sustainable development .
Having environment and development go together is not only possible ; it is absolutely necessary for countries like Pakistan and cities like Karachi .
So , President sahab , have your tall building if it pleases you ; but , please , do not pit environment versus development in this way .
It serves neither the interests of development , nor of the environment , and certainly not of Karachi or of Pakistan .

News
When I started [ GAS ] 10 months ago , I had no idea about how popular my little initiative would become .
The first month barely brought me more then 100 unique hits , but this did n't really matter to me because I was only doing this for myself .
Things really started to pick up in January 2006 when I wrote something that got promoted to Digg 's front page .
Since then [ GAS ] has known its ups and downs and , unsurprisingly , these ups have always coincided with the time when I ( or any of my contributors ) get my ' pencil ' out and start writing some original content .
Getting ideas out of your head to provide fresh content to your readers is not always easy , but when you succeed in publishing a good piece of work , the rewards are definitely worth all the headaches in the world .
Here are our tips for successful blogging , many of which have helped put [ GAS ] on the map , and should do the same for you too .
Tip # 1 : As a system administrator , the range of topics I really know about is somewhat specialized .
I can't really go out and post about the reproduction cycle of lemmings and expect people to take me seriously or link to me as a credible source .
With this in mind , here is tip # 1 : Write about what you really know .
The idea is to let people profit from your expertise and wisdom and let others do the job of writing about the things you are not completely comfortable with .
Tip # 2 : Quote your sources .
If you 're directly referring to something written on another site be clear about this .
Link back to the site you 're quoting and ensure that you 're not attempting to take the credit for something written or said by someone else .
Chances are they wo n't be amused .
Tip # 3 : Do n't be afraid to express your opinion on a subject when writing a post .
Be clear though that what you are saying is not necessarily gospel but just your humble opinion , this could save you from a potential torrent of criticism and correction .
Of course , while your opinion may be considered right or wrong by many readers , if you 've hit on an interesting topic just expressing that opinion can result in an fascinating and diverse conversational thread .
Tip # 4 : Your readers are human beings , treat them with respect .
When they ask a question or give you feedback about one of your articles always answer them and show your appreciation , even if what they say is negative .
Sometimes even negative comments can be a good thing if you learn something from them .
Tip # 5 : Use your stat engine extensively to track referrers and outbound clicks .
Your stat engine is your best friend , never forget that .
It will help you determine which of your posts are the most popular ones , and where your traffic is coming from .
This will allow you to learn about the preferences of your readers , and also help you focus the content of your future posts for maximum impact .
Personally , I use the Performancing Metrics engine .
If you 've never tried it out , do yourself a favor and set it up on your blog for a test run .
I can guarantee that you will not regret it .
Tip # 6 : If you want other bloggers to link to you , never hesitate and link back to them as often as you can .
If you never send traffic to anyone , no one will send traffic to you .
Tip # 7 : When you publish a particularly good piece of work , do n't hesitate and submit it to sites that post content related to your specific niche of expertise .
I was able to get some of my articles posted on major sites this way , resulting in a lot of traffic and additional link backs as a collateral effect .
Submitting your content to social networking sites such as Digg , Reddit and Shoutwire is also highly recommended .
Tip # 8 : Read and participate in conversations related to your niche of expertise on other blogs .
Be careful about what you write though - double check your facts and always write relevant and informative comments , using the occasion to leave your link through your name in the header of the comments you 're posting .
Tip # 9 : Try to diversify your posts within the many spheres of knowledge you have .
Even if your blog is geared towards a specific theme , it can't hurt to be a little bit fluid with the concept from time to time .
By doing this your blog stands more chance of appealing to a wider audience .
Combined with tip # 5 you 'll be able to see what impact these forays into a different territory are actually worth to your blog .
Tip # 10 : Looks sometimes really do matter .
A simple , uncluttered design should focus the reader to your post content first and foremost .
Make graphic content relevant and unobtrusive ; use a simple color palette but be visual : a page of text on its own will make less visual impact at first glance than one lightly scattered with interesting images .
Unless you are trying to showcase your web design expertise keep it simple .
Think of the times you may have been turned off a site you 've stumbled upon purely because the design overwhelmed the content .
Tip # 11 : Make your site easy to navigate .
Try to cross - link and , unlike us , tag your posts appropriately : not only does this allow readers to easily navigate to any associated additional articles but it'll increase your visibility via the many blog - tracking engines .
Highlight those posts that may be of significant interest ; make them easy to find .
Tip #12 .
Find a name that will have the effect of a nuke on your audience , and do n't forget to buy a domain that can be associated with it .
Your blog name is like a brand : it can stick in people 's head or just go in one ear and out the other .
Just take us for instance , can you honestly say that our name is easily forgettable ?
Implementing a few , or all , of these tips on your blog should help it gain both respect and visibility .
Unfortunately for you , the blogosphere is a crowded place , so only the best among you will succeed in punching through the walls of anonymity into the world of fame and success .
Good luck to all of you .

The Interior Ministry of the nation of Georgia said Sunday that a surface - to - air missile was fired at a helicopter last week , as it escorted an American delegation led by Senator McCain , a Republican of Arizona .
The aircraft was not damaged .
A spokeswoman for the Department of State , Joanne Moore , said she had no information about the incident .
In a similar attack , Georgia 's defense minister said a helicopter in which he was riding also came under fire Sunday as it flew over South Ossetia , but it landed safely , and nobody was hurt .

In appearances across the US , President Bush has been campaigning against withdrawing troops from Iraq , arguing that to leave now would hand a historic victory to Al Qaeda and inspire new generations of jihadists to attack the US .
But a letter that has been translated and released by the US military indicates that Al Qaeda itself sees the continued American presence in Iraq as a boon for the terror network , which has recently shown signs of expanding into the Palestinian territories and North Africa .
" The most important thing is that the jihad continues with steadfastness ... indeed , prolonging the war is in our interest , " says the writer , who goes by the name Atiyah .
The letter , released last week , was recovered in the rubble of the Iraqi house where Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , former leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq , was killed by a US bomb in June .
If the letter is accurate , it provides a window into the group 's strategic thinking on Iraq that differs starkly from the one the Bush administration has been expressing publicly – a view the president reiterated Wednesday when he said that Al Qaeda believes that " America is weak , and if they can kill enough innocent people we 'll retreat .
That 's precisely what they want . "
While the letter was released only recently , Atiyah , thought to be a senior Al Qaeda leader whose full name Atiyah Abd al - Rahman , apparently wrote it last December from the Pakistani region of Waziristan .
It has surfaced among a flurry of other communiqués from Al Qaeda .
Al Qaeda 's No. 2 , Ayman al - Zawahiri , released a videotape this week in which he lashed out at Mr. Bush and Pope Benedict XVI .
On Sept. 28 , Abu Hamza al - Muhajir , believed to have replaced Mr. Zarqawi as the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq , published an Internet statement in which he reached out to Sunni tribal leaders who have been in conflict with Al Qaeda .
And a new group claiming to be Al Qaeda in Palestine issued a video attacking Palestinian political leaders .
But the Atiyah letter , reflecting as it does the candid opinions of Al Qaeda , rather than the group 's propaganda statement crafted for public consumption , appears to offer the most insight .
It is largely focused on the fact that Zarqawi's tactics were alienating Iraqi Sunni leaders , and urges him to move with more caution .
He strongly warned Zarqawi against assassinating Sunni leaders .
Al Qaeda is a Sunni organization that has been trying to use minority Sunni anxiety in Iraq to build support .
The letter also called the Zarqawi - organized bombing of three hotels in Jordan in 2005 a " mistake , " arguing that expanding Iraq 's jihad beyond its borders too soon will cost them public support .
At one point , Atiyah muses that perhaps Zarqawi should step down from his leadership role , " if you find at some point someone who is better and more suitable than you . "
Since Zarqawi's death , a " more suitable " figure from Al Qaeda 's standpoint has indeed emerged .
" In order to understand this letter one has to see the circumstances of when this letter was released , '' says Rita Katz , the director of the SITE Institute , which is devoted to tracking Islamist militant groups .
" This followed after Zarqawi had an audio message ... in which he threatened the tribes of the Sunnis who would n't cooperate with him .
That was a real turning point .
" The letter from Atiyah is basically his response to this .
He 's telling him that instead of fighting Sunni opponents , you should reach out with more peaceful solutions . "
Ms. Katz says Mr. Muhajir's Sept. 28 statement shows he has taken that advice to heart .
She points out that a number of Sunni tribes in Iraq 's turbulent Anbar Province have turned against Al Qaeda 's main umbrella group in Iraq , the Mujahideen Shura Council ( MSC ) , in recent months .
" Al - Muhajir 's latest speech was quite interesting , because he basically said sorry to the heads of the Sunni tribes .
' We need you .
We 'll work together to defeat the enemy . ' "
The day before his speech , Al Jazeera reported a statement it said was delivered by Ahmad Naji al - Juburi , head of the tribal council in Salahuddin Province north of Baghdad , in which he lashed out at Al Qaeda for killing " civilians , defenseless people , police and security men ...
Al Qaeda said it came to Iraq for jihad and to liberate it from occupation [ but ] what Al Qaeda is doing is utterly at odds with what it announced . "
Katz and others say Muhajir is eager to mend fences with Sunni leaders , because he knows that if Al Qaeda loses the support of Sunni tribes , it will be in a very tenuous position .
" Al - Muhajir took another step toward undoing some of the alienation Abu Musab al - Zarqawi had created in Iraq 's Sunni community , " Michael Scheuer , who ran the CIA 's bin Laden unit from 1996 to 1999 and is now a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation in Washington wrote in a commentary on Muhajir 's and other recent Al Qaeda communications .
How long Muhajir will be in charge of Al Qaeda in Iraq is unclear .
Earlier this week , Iraqi National Security Adviser Mowaffak al - Rubaie said security forces are close to catching him .
On Sept. 28 , the US military caught a man it described as his driver .
But given the ease with which Al Qaeda in Iraq weathered the killing of Zarqawi , analysts are skeptical that killing Muhajir will have much impact on Iraq 's war .
" When Zarqawi was killed , people said that was the end of the insurgency and the end of the mass killings .
But in fact we 've seen mass killings increase dramatically since , " says Katz .
" Al Qaeda in Iraq played an important role at the beginning of the war .
Zarqawi set up something that had n't existed before , but at this stage the infrastructure is set up very nicely . "
Orbital Debris Program Office
Orbital Debris Recovered Objects
On average , one non-functional spacecraft , launch vehicle orbital stage , or other piece of cataloged debris has fallen back to Earth every day for more than 40 years .
The majority of these objects do not survive the intense reentry environment .
For the minority which do survive in whole or in part , most fall harmlessly into the oceans or onto sparsely populated regions such as Siberia , the Australian Outback , or the Canadian Tundra .
Occasionally , components of spacecraft and launch vehicles are found .
Shown below are examples of objects recovered since 1997 in Texas , Saudi Arabia , and South Africa .
So , what happened ?
Was it a lack of Java - trained engineers back then that made selection of Java for real projects a non-starter for project managers ?
Or was it just that there was too much hype , too soon ?
Java standards were early in the cycle back then .
There has been significant progress in addressing many of the negative perceptions of early Java solutions .
Maybe it 's time to take a fresh look at recent Java trends that could invalidate the early tire - kicker 's negative impressions about Java .
A usage trends survey published in IEEE Software in 2005 indicated that Java development had eclipsed C as language - of - choice in the desktop space around 2001 and C++ in 2004 .
While embedded systems developers tend to be more conservative and loath change in comparison to their desktop systems counterparts , the fact stands that as desktop trends go , so typically go embedded systems trends within 5 - 7 years .
No doubt , this historical trend explains much of the current renewed interest in real - time Java .
For example , in recent months , Lockheed Martin has adopted Java to handle the predictable performance aspects of the Aegis Weapons System , National Oilwell Varco is using Java to manage automated robotic drilling , L - 3 Communication 's Telemetry - West division selected Java for their real - time data acquisition system , and Boeing is using Java for the Joint Unmanned Combat Air Systems ' ( J - UCAS ) X" 45C program .
Standards have arisen in line with the various implementations now in place .
Both Java hard real - time ( JSR - 000001 : Real - time Specification for Java ) and safety - critical ( JSR 302 : Safety Critical Java Technology ) standards are now in the works , and products are almost ready to hit the street that bring life to these emerging standards .
Some of these products boast performance comparable to C/C++ , with low - level device access and small footprint .
Still others bring the high productivity of vast Java Standard Edition libraries into the realm of embedded development .
All of them avoid the high error incidence that is the bugaboo of C/ C++ programming .
In the meantime , Java has become the dominant language in university computer science curricula , providing a flood of new - hire talent .
Sun estimates there are over 4 million Java - savvy developers today , while market studies indicate that over one billion worldwide shipments of embedded virtual machines have been made , with a combined annual growth rate of 24.5 % .
It appears that finally  approximately 5 - 7 years after Java 's initial foray into embedded space  that Java products for hard real - time and deeply - embedded systems have come alive .
It may be that Java is ready for embedded systems prime time .
Gary Cato is manager of strategic alliances at Aonix North America Inc .
I remember asking a western intelligence officer in Baghdad , six months after the American invasion , what he would advise the Iranians to do .
" Wait , " he said with a smile .
Iran has done just that .
If I were Tehran I would still wait .
I would sit back , fold my arms and watch my tormentors sweat .
I would watch the panic in Washington and London as body bags pile up , generals mutter mutiny , alliances fall apart and electors cut and run .
As Blair 's emissary , Sir Nigel Sheinwald , comes to me cap in hand , I would pour him tea and roar with laughter .
I would ask him to repeat to my face the insults and bile his American taskmasters hurl at me daily .
I would say with Shylock : " Hath a dog money ?
Is it possible a cur can lend three thousand ducats ?
Fair Sir , you spat on me Wednesday last ; you spurned me such a day ; you called me dog ; and for these courtesies I 'll lend you thus much moneys ? "
As we approach the beginning of the end in Iraq there will be much throat - clearing and breast - beating before reality replaces denial .
For the moment , denial still rules .
In America last week I was shocked at how unaware even anti-war Americans are ( like many Britons ) of the depth of the predicament in Iraq .
They compare it with Vietnam or the Balkans - but it is not the same .
It is total anarchy .
All sentences beginning , " What we should now do in Iraq ... " are devoid of meaning .
We are in no position to do anything .
We have no potency ; that is the definition of anarchy .
From all available reports , Iraq south of the Kurdistan border is beyond central authority , a patchwork of ganglands , sheikhdoms and lawlessness .
Anbar province and most of the Sunni triangle is controlled by independent Sunni militias .
The only safe movement for outsiders is by helicopter at night .
Baghdad is like Beirut in 1983 , with nightly massacres , roadblocks everywhere and mixed neighbourhoods emptying into safe ones .
As yesterday 's awful kidnapping shows , even a uniform is a death certificate .
As for the cities of the south , control depends on which Shia militia has been able to seize the local police station .
The Iraqi army , such as it is , cannot be deployed outside its local area and is therefore useless for counter - insurgency .
There is no central police force .
There is no public administration .
The Maliki government barely rules the Green Zone in which it is entombed .
American troops guard it as they might an outpost of the French Legion in the Sahara .
There is no point in patrolling a landscape one cannot control .
It merely alienates the population and turns soldiers into targets .
To talk of a collapse into civil war if " we leave " Iraq is to completely misread the chaos into which that country has descended under our rule .
It implies a model of order wholly absent on the ground .
Foreign soldiers can stay in their bases , but they will no more " prevent civil war " than they can " import democracy " .
They are relevant only as target practice for insurgents and recruiting sergeants for al - Qaida .
The occupation of Iraq has passed from brutality to mere idiocy .
It is possible that a shrewd proconsul , such as America 's Zelmay Khalilzad , might induce the warring factions to agree a provisional boundary between their spheres of influence and assign militias to protect it .
But my impression is that Iraq has passed beyond even the power of the centre to impose partition .
If civil war means armies invading territory , there is no need for that in Iraq .
If it means ethnic massacres and refugees fleeing into enclaves , it is there already and in abundance .
The form of the western retreat from Iraq is already taking shape .
If all politics is local , none is more local than the politics of anarchy .
Britain is already withdrawing from towns such as Amara and bases in Basra , leaving local militias to fight over the territory left behind and regional leaders to try to discipline them .
This can not begin until the troops leave .
American withdrawal will take the same form in the north and west .
The chief cause of British and American casualties at present is incoming commanders going on unnecessary patrols to show they can " kick ass " .
Next month 's Baker / Hamilton inquiry - surely the strangest way an army has ever negotiated its own retreat - will call for a hastening of such " redeployment " away from centres of population to giant bases in the desert .
They can stay there to save face as Iraq 's factions and provinces reorder themselves messily in the towns and cities .
Units can then slip quietly away to Qatar by the month .
It would clearly help Bush and Blair were such a redeployment to be covered by some international conference .
But the idea that Ba'athist , Sunni Damascus and clerical , Shia Tehran would jointly guarantee the safety of a power - sharing regime in Baghdad is beyond credence .
They might gain regional kudos by attending such a conference , and even by pretending to rein in their co-religionist militias .
But any idea that they will stop sponsoring Hizbullah or stop enriching uranium as part of some deal is bizarre .
As for Bush promising to " do something " about Israel and Palestine , he promised that in 2003 to no effect .
Yes , these leaders would like good relations with the west , but they can survive without them .
The axis of evil has done them no harm .
Bush and Blair are men in a hurry , and such men lose wars .
If there is a game plan in Tehran it will be to play Iraq long .
Why stop the Great Satan when he is driving himself to hell in a handcart ?
If London and Washington really want help in this part of the world they must start from diplomatic ground zero .
They will have to stop the holier - than - thou name - calling and the pretence that they hold any cards .
They will have to realise that this war has lost them all leverage in the region .
They can insult and sanction and threaten .
But there is nothing left for them to " do " but leave .
They are no longer the subject of that mighty verb , only its painful object .

[ On Monday last week we reprinted a leader deploring criticism of scholarships for poor children to secondary schools .
These are two reactions . ]
Sir -
The real difficulty is not the social or pecuniary inferiority of the elementary boy , but his enormous moral inferiority .
Most of the other boys that come to us have a very definite idea that certain actions and thoughts are " caddish " or " bad form " or " blackguardly . "
The knowledge of such terms help a master immensely .
Their reasoning may be defective , but it is an incalculable advantage to feel that , if once you can convince a small boy that a certain action is a " blackguard " thing to do , that only a " hopeless cad " would think a certain thing , more than half your battle is over .
Now I have been dealing with a certain proportion of elementary boys for some years , and I have failed to find any parallel idea or word .
I have to begin de novo .
Your readers may hold up their hands in righteous indignation , but the sad truth is there for me and others that I know of my profession .
The virtues of the elementary boy are industry and obedience , which are , in our opinion , secondary virtues for a boy .
For cribbing , meanness , cowardice , cruelty he has just as much feeling of abhorrence as for unpunctuality - perhaps rather less .
Yours &c. ,
Head Master
Sir -
I gather that it is with regret that you have noted the exclusion of Board School Boys from the University College at Hampstead - this is with no regard to the feelings of the paying boys in question .
I wonder whether you have ever considered the matter from the side of a gentleman forced to come into daily contact with the innate vulgarity of the lower orders .
Is it not more probable that the sons of gentlemen will be levelled down rather than the sons of Pork Butchers levelled up by continual daily contact .
The lessons of the gutter are more easily learnt than the traditions of caste .
The fact that by keeping particular secondary and Public Schools a reserve for a particular class keeps the higher walks of life in the professions and public services a preserve for the same class , is surely a great argument in its favour .
The lower classes never were a Governing class and why should the master sit side by side with the servant .
Yours faithfully ,
Public School Boy , Kensington , London
( Most people will be inclined to think that if his state of mind were to be taken as exemplifying the results of the system , nobody need regret not having passed through it .

Why Didn't They Call Me ?
What my concern was , is that there were concerns expressed by other government officials .
And to this day , I wish my phone had rung , or I had access to them .
Today ’s business landscape is extremely competitive – not only has the internet allowed almost anyone with access the ability to source information on almost every topic , but the barriers to entry of doing business globally have been all but brought down .
We are seeing businesses from the UK to Central Africa offering products and services online to countries in the Americas and Asia without ever having to set foot there .
Modern businesses understand how essential technology is in this current landscape , and are usually the quickest to take up new technology , putting them at an advantage compared to businesses with slower uptake .
They understand how continuous investment in improving their technology can lead to improved efficiency , and ultimately increased profits .
Below we take a look at three ways that investing in technology can help improve a business ’ efficiency .
1 ) Faster and more accurate in almost every aspect , especially compared to humans
Can you imagine the state of the world if e-commerce was only supplemented by cheques ?
The demise of the paper cheque is thanks to banks and businesses investing in technology to provide online payments that take seconds rather than days or weeks .
By automating processes that were once carried out by humans , we see much faster transactions with almost minimal errors .
For example , where one once had to go through a time - consuming process of organising meetings , booking rooms and greeting clients ; this can now all be done via a mobile app linked to Pronestor booking systems in only a matter of minutes .
2 ) Increased productivity
Following on from the last reason , by decreasing the time spent on any process , the productivity will increase .
Employees will be able to get on with more pressing work , rather than wait for simple tasks and processes to be completed .
Increasing productivity directly correlates to an improvement in an organisation ’s efficiency , because whether it be a human or a machine , being able to maximise the use of your capacity allows for this .
Technology can also help increase productivity by improving organisation .
For example , the proliferation of cloud storage users has helped businesses focus on their core competencies , and leave the IT solutions to the professionals .
For a business to be able to focus on their expertise rather than on tasks that they do n’t specialise in , means that they can be more productive with their time .
3 ) Better communication
Rapid globalisation means that we are interacting with others far and wide now on a daily basis .
E - commerce companies that once sold only locally are fulfilling orders from the other side of the world thanks to the internet , improved logistics , and such .
Communication has also improved thanks to this and we are seeing businesses with multiple offices worldwide having seamless video conferences thanks to new , efficient technology .
Data and information can be shared just as quickly between a UK and Australian office as it could be between colleagues metres apart !
Businesses now benefit as they can react quicker to changes and there is not always a need to physically travel to get your point across .
Similar to Namco ’s neGcon for the original PlayStation , the DualShock Vortex features an “ unusual design in that the left and right halves of the controller [ are ] connected by a swivel joint and thus the halves can be twisted relative to each other . ”

You twist the controller , the dude on the screen twists the throttle , things like that .
But it seems like it would have pretty limited uses , and would probably get on my nerves quickly .
A trumpet 's size , shape and material composition determine its resonant frequency .

Household devices produce relatively small magnetic fields .
For this reason , chargers hold devices at the distance necessary to induce a current , which can only happen if the coils are close together .
A larger , stronger field could induce current from farther away , but the process would be extremely inefficient .
Since a magnetic field spreads in all directions , making a larger one would waste a lot of energy .
In November 2006 , however , researchers at MIT reported that they had discovered an efficient way to transfer power between coils separated by a few meters .
The team , led by Marin Soljacic , theorized that they could extend the distance between the coils by adding resonance to the equation .

­ A good way to understand resonance is to think of it in terms of sound .
An object 's physical structure -- like the size and shape of a trumpet -- determines the frequency at which it naturally vibrates .
This is its resonant frequency .
It 's easy to get objects to vibrate at their resonant frequency and difficult to get them to vibrate at other frequencies .
This is why playing a trumpet can cause a nearby trumpet to begin to vibrate .
Both trumpets have the same resonant frequency .
Research at MIT indicates that induction can take place a little differently if the electromagnetic fields around the coils resonate at the same frequency .
The theory uses a curved coil of wire as an inductor .
A capacitance plate , which can hold a charge , attaches to each end of the coil .
As electricity travels through this coil , the coil begins to resonate .
Its resonant frequency is a product of the inductance of the coil and the capacitance of the plates .
" " The MIT wireless power project uses a curved coil and capacitive plates .
As with an electric toothbrush , this system relies on two coils .
Electricity , traveling along an electromagnetic wave , can tunnel from one coil to the other as long as they both have the same resonant frequency .
The effect is similar to the way one vibrating trumpet can cause another to vibrate .
As long as both coils are out of range of one another , nothing will happen , since the fields around the coils are n't strong enough to affect much around them .
Similarly , if the two coils resonate at different frequencies , nothing will happen .
But if two resonating coils with the same frequency get within a few meters of each other , streams of energy move from the transmitting coil to the receiving coil .
According to the theory , one coil can even send electricity to several receiving coils , as long as they all resonate at the same frequency .
The researchers have named this non-radiative energy transfer since it involves stationary fields around the coils rather than fields that spread in all directions .
" " According to the theory , one coil can recharge any device that is in range , as long as the coils have the same resonant frequency .
The MIT team 's preliminary work suggests that this kind of setup could power or recharge all the devices in one room .
Some modifications would be necessary to send power over long distances , like the length of a building or a city .
The team is making progress -- in June 2007 , the MIT team published a paper detailing a successful demonstration of their prototype .
They used resonating coils to power a light bulb over a distance of about seven feet ( two meters ) [ Source : PhysOrg ] .
Other wireless power theories involve enormous distances -- like from space to the Earth .
We 'll look at those next .
Oct. 8 , 2006  --
The latest headline to grip Capitol Hill comes from the Los Angeles Times : A former House page tells the paper anonymously that former Rep. Mark Foley 's online flirtation led to sex in the lawmaker 's Washington townhouse when the young man was 21 .
And a Florida congresswoman says she 's learned Foley was turned away from the page dorm late one night in 2002 or 2003 .
The reports are the latest revelations in a scandal that initially centered on lewd electronic messages exchanged between Foley and underage pages .
Each successive revelation has been seen deepening the troubles for Republicans , who are trying to retain control of Congress in November 's mid-term elections .
Before Foley resigned in disgrace more than a week ago , about 40 GOP seats were thought to be in play .
Now , eight more may be competitive , including one held by the man charged with keeping Republicans in power , Rep. Tom Reynolds , R - N.Y .
Top Republicans acknowledge they 'd probably lose the House if the election were held today .
They only have a month to try to turn things around .
" This is going to be the most difficult 30 days in the last 12 years that we 've been in the majority , " said Rep. Ray LaHood , R - Ill. , on CBS ' " Face the Nation . "
But on ABC News ' " This Week , " Rep. Adam Putnam , R - Fla. , chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee , called a month " an eternity in politics . "
Still , Time and Newsweek both published polls Sunday showing that a majority of Americans now want Democrats to win control of Congress in November .
In the Newsweek poll , 53 percent of those questioned said they want the Democrats to win Congress , including 10 percent of the Republicans in the poll .
Fifty - two percent of those questioned said they believe House Speaker Dennis Hastert knew about Foley 's inappropriate behavior and tried to cover it up .
To win in November , Democrats need to knock off 15 Republicans , and they are increasingly optimistic that Reynolds will be one of them .
After eight years representing upstate New York , Reynolds was thought to be so safe that he was put in charge of raising money for other GOP candidates , but now Democrats have hit the airwaves with ads accusing him of not doing enough to stop Foley from harassing pages .
" Reynolds not only failed to act ; he actually urged the Florida congressman to run for office again , possibly putting more kids at risk , " one ad states .
In the wake of the Foley scandal , independent handicappers have changed their assessment of the Reynolds ' race against Democrat Jack Davis from solid Republican to a toss - up .
Polls show Reynolds trailing .
Reynolds this weekend released a new ad in which he apologized for not acting more aggressively on the Foley matter .
" I trusted that others had investigated , " Reynolds said in the ad .
" Looking back , more should have been done and for that , I am sorry . "
On " This Week , " Putnam argued that Iraq , the economy and the Republican record will withstand fallout from the Foley scandal .
" Americans are talking about Iraq , " Putnam said .
" Americans are talking about the war on terrorism . "
If Democrats win a majority in the House , " That would mean a Speaker Pelosi , " he said .
" Elections are about choices , and choices have consequences . "
But another " This Week " guest , Rep. Rahm Emanuel , D - Ill. , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , disagreed .
" Six years of a Republican majority in the White House , in the House , and in the Senate and all you 've got is fear , " Emanuel told Putnam .
The villagers in Dongzhou said their dispute with the authorities had begun with a conflict over plans by a power company to build a coal - fired generator in their area , which they feared would cause heavy pollution .
Farmers said they had not been compensated for the use of the land for the plant .
Others said plans to reclaim land by filling in a local bay as part of the power plant project were unacceptable because people have made their livelihoods there as fishermen for generations .
Already , villagers complained , work crews have been blasting a nearby mountainside for rubble for the landfill .
A small group of villagers was delegated to complain to the authorities about the plant in July , but they were arrested , infuriating other residents and encouraging others to join the protest movement .
On Dec. 6 , while villagers were mounting a sit - in demonstration , police made a number of arrests , bringing lots of people out into the streets , where they managed to detain several officers .
In response , hundreds of law enforcement agents were rushed to the scene .
Everybody , young and old , " went out to watch , " said one man who claimed his cousin had been killed by a police officer 's bullet in the forehead .
" We did n't expect they were so evil .
The farmers had no means to resist them . "
Early reports from the village said the police opened fire only after villagers began throwing homemade bombs and other missiles , but villagers reached by telephone today denied this , saying that a few farmers had launched ordinary fireworks at the police as part of their protest .
" Those were not bombs , they were fireworks , the kind that fly up into the sky , " said one witness reached by telephone .
" The organizers did n't have any money , so someone bought fireworks and placed them there .
At the moment the trouble started many of the demonstrators were holding them , and of those who held fireworks , almost everyone was killed . "
Other witnesses estimated that 10 people were killed immediately in the first volley of automatic gunfire .
" I live not far from the scene , and I was running as fast as I could , " said one witness , who declined to give his name .
" I dragged one of the people they killed , a man in his 30's who was shot in his chest .
Initially I thought he might survive , because he was still breathing , but he was panting heavily , and as soon as I pulled him aside , he died . "
The witness said that he , too , had come under fire when the police saw him coming to the aid of the dying man .
The Chinese government has yet to issue a statement about the incident , nor has it been reported in the state media .
Reached by telephone , an official in the city of Shanwei , which has jurisdiction over the village , said , " Yes , there was an incident , but we do n't know the details . "
The official said an official announcement would be made on Saturday .
Dick Cheney said al - Qaeda was working in Iraq before the 2003 war
Mr Cheney told a US radio show : " They were present before we invaded Iraq . "
Hours earlier , a declassified Pentagon report said information obtained from Iraq 's former leader Saddam Hussein had confirmed they had no strong ties .
Its publication followed pressure from Democrats who suggest intelligence was twisted in the run-up to the war .
The belief that Saddam Hussein 's regime and al - Qaeda were working together was an important element in the Bush administration 's case for invading Iraq .
Critics have since suggested the administration " cherry - picked " from available intelligence to bolster that case .
' Inappropriate ' intelligence
Mr Cheney , in an interview with conservative talk - show host Rush Limbaugh , insisted there had been a link between Saddam Hussein 's regime and the al - Qaeda terror group .
He said former al - Qaeda in Iraq leader Abu Musab al - Zarqawi had been leading the network 's operations in the country before the 2003 US - led invasion .
The US still does not know where al - Qaeda head Osama bin Laden is
The newly declassified Pentagon report was based on interrogations of Saddam Hussein and two of his aides , as well as documents seized in Iraq .
The Democratic chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , Carl Levin , had pushed for its full release after it was released in summary form in February .
In a statement on Thursday , he said the document showed why a defence department investigation had concluded that some Pentagon pre-war intelligence work had been " inappropriate " .
The report into former Pentagon policy chief Douglas Feith 's handling of intelligence on Iraq was prepared by the defence department 's top watchdog , Inspector General Thomas Gimble .
Under repeated questioning by Mr Levin in February , Mr Gimble said the conclusions reached in reports by Mr Feith were not fully supported by the available intelligence .
In particular , his conclusion there was a " mature and symbiotic relationship " between Iraq and al - Qaeda could not be justified on the basis of the available intelligence .
In addition , an alleged meeting between an Iraqi intelligence officer and a leader of the 9/11 attacks , Mohamed Atta , never took place .
Mr Feith 's supporters stress that the inspector general found no evidence of illegal or unauthorised activity .
Valentine Strasser
Country Ruled : Sierra Leone
Years Ruled : 1992 - 1996
Current Residence : Freetown , Sierra Leone
Biography :
Losing your job , quitting school , going broke and moving back home with your mother after living abroad for years would be tough on anyone .
It 's even tougher when you 're a former military dictator who once had the power to execute opponents at will .
Valentine Strasser became the world 's youngest head of state when he seized power in 1992 at the age of 25 .
But the limelight did n't last - four years later he was ousted in another coup .
" I 'm basically living off my mother now , " Strasser later remarked .
" She 's been very supportive . "
The human rights group Amnesty International in May called for the British government to investigate allegations of torture against the former NPRC leader , and accused his troops of " torture , ill treatment and arbitrary killings of unarmed civilians " while passing themselves off as RUF fighters .
" Strasser 's people were responsible for , among other things , torture of political opponents , " an Amnesty International spokesman said .
" The government has a responsibility to investigate because torture committed anywhere is a crime under U.K. law . "
Strasser , however , dismissed the allegations .
" How can you say the claims Amnesty International is making are justified ? , " he asked .
" They know it is the Revolutionary United Front that has been responsible for those abuses and violations . "
He also rejected criticism of the NPRC 's execution of 26 political opponents , eight months after he took power .
" They were tried , they were prosecuted , they were convicted , they were sentenced , " he told the Sunday Times .
Strasser , who told the newspaper he is unemployed and dependent on his family and friends for financial support , showed scars above his eye and on his leg , and said he was recently attacked outside a London Underground station .
" I was going to an off - licence , and then this guy just turned around and came at me with a knife - something like a Swiss Army penknife , " he said .
" I was stabbed and I had to be taken to hospital .
I could n't put it down to anything other than racial motivation . "

While looking at some contemporary rugs on the Home Depot website I came across a few comments that looked suspicious .
Let me preface this quickly — having communication features like comments and reviews on e-commerce sites is great .
I often look at the reviews and ratings before digging into product details , because there may be some wisdom in the crowds worth picking up on .
If 400 people say one wireless router is better than another , there has to be some value there .
Same holds true for all kinds of products , including books .
Amazon.com gets lots of people leaving detailed , valuable reviews .
So what about rugs ?
Well , here are the 3 comments that stood out for me , and you can decide :

“ I was looking everywhere for a multi- coloured rug for a small budget–and saw this one online , went to home depot the next day to look at it and it is better in real life–love the fact that there is matching smaller rugs too . ”

“ My husband and I were searching for a new area rug , and we could not find anything we liked for a smaller budget .
But then I found this rug online .
I went to the Home Depot the next day to see it , and it was better than the picture !
This rug is nice and dark , with lots of great patterns .
We get compliments on it all the time !
To find an area rug this size for this price is extremly hard , but we could not be happier with our purchase ! ” – Great rug , great price ! , November 28 , 2006 / By Small town gal from Saskatchewan

I suppose it could be the same person who made all three comments .
It ’s not uncommon for people to move three times in the span of three months right ?
So she was in Saskatchewan , then hopped over to Toronto , decided that was n’t for her and moved to Sudbury …
And of course she only identified herself as “ Sally ” while living in Toronto .
Something is amiss .
My first reaction was , “ Someone at Home Depot is putting in bogus comments . ”
Is that possible ?
Would they bother ?
I noticed very few comments in the rugs section ; maybe someone at Home Depot decided to fill in a few holes and make the site look less dead .
My next thought was that it was an overzealous manufacturer trying to pimp their own carpets – but all three of the carpets are made by different companies .
So I ’m back to wondering about Home Depot and whether they ’d try and scam people by posting fake comments .
Maybe its a coincidence or someone being stupid , but it ’s definitely a mystery , and something smells distinctly fishy .
What do you guys think ?
Lost any CSS lately ?
If your Internet connection happens to lose a bit of CSS data , you get a mess on your screen .
John Allsop has already responded sensibly to John C. Dvorak 's hilarious article , Why CSS Bugs Me , over at PCMag.com .
Far be if from me to contradict the respected CSS authority Mr. Dvorak , but I do have a question for you folks stemming from his insightful article .
For me Mr. Dvorak 's most salient point is that ,
If your Internet connection happens to lose a bit of CSS data , you get a mess on your screen .
Fortunately this has not happened to me on a regular basis , but it has seemingly happened to one BritPacker who reported on the BritPack scooter club mailing list only today that ,
It 's happened to me .
Only this evening I lost some ( CSS ) but it turned out that it was down the back of the sofa all along .
No wait , that was bacon crisps .
The last time I lost some CSS , I found that I had left it in that tiny pocket in my jeans and washed it without knowing .
Fortunately it dried out OK , albeit a bit wrinkly , and I was able to use it again on another project .
I 'm just glad no one noticed .
After all , if it had made a mess on my screen , things could have taken a real turn for the worse .
Imagine having to admit to a client , I 'm sorry your project is late , I washed the CSS in my trousers and it kinda went all , err , funny .
Have you lost any CSS ?
If you have ever lost any CSS , where were you and what were you doing when you lost it ?
Did you find it again and where , and if not , what were the consequences for your screen , underpants or anything else that might be so badly affected by its loss as Mr. Dvorak suggests ?

The new feature mentioned is the " Note this " button spotted by bloggers , namely at the SeRoundTable ( i.e. here ) .
No one is yet sure about the meaning of this button , and it is actually like the Loch Ness creature : everyone knows about it but no one has yet seen it .
Although it is probably almost no one .
It is , however , not really known what it does , and when it appears .
Some bloggers said that they did n't see the button even when logged in into Google 's services .
Actually we could always see the button , when logged in .
One more thing that is being discussed by bloggers is that the ' Note this ' button appears with certain searches , but our team had it always in nearly 100 different queries , as , for example vacation , politics , science , service , however and so on .
One could actually ' note ' the ' click here ' query .
Here is a picture of a logged in search for the query ' vacation ' :
And here is a picture of the same query , though in the signed - out state :
When we press the ' Note this ' button , we see that Google has ' Duly noted ' the query for you and it opens a small floating window in the bottom left corner of the display :
With only two days remaining until the final , the World Cup Death Count stands at 63 , almost as many people as have died worldwide of Avian Bird Flu .
But the Chinese do n't have a monopoly on World Cup Myocardial Infarctions by any stretch of the imagination .
In Bangladesh , an Argentinian fan died of a heart attack after his team lost .
Likewise , in Malaysia , a heart attack claimed the life of a man who was watching the Argentina - Mexico match .
Good old fashioned hooliganism has not completely disappeared from the World Cup scene , the efforts of German and British police notwithstanding .
In Kenya , a fan of Brazil was savagely attacked and beaten to death by two supporters of France after the French victory over Brazil in the Quarter Finals .
In Lagos , Nigeria , a man was shot to death by two bandits who had just raided a cyber cafe which was crowded with people watching the World Cup during a local power outage .
And finally , the carnage ends , for now , with the first bona fide World Cup Death in the UK , where an eighteen year old man was stabbed following England 's defeat .
At least no one has died from the fake soccer balls of death .
Yet .

Ocaml : Exception Backtraces .
There 's a paper dated December 2002 by Kevin Murphy where he explains why he was looking at Ocaml .
That article was recently linked on programming .
reddit.com and there was a comment complaining that Ocaml could n't print out backtraces on exceptions .
Someone posted later that this was not right , but I 've heard this complaint often enough that I thought I should blog about how to do it .
First off , Ocaml has two compilers , one which produces bytecode and one which produces native binaries .
The native code compiler is not currently able to produce exception backtraces and this is where the Reddit commenter got the idea .
However , there is a patch in the Ocaml bug tracker which adds backtrace capabilities .
I 'm hoping that this goes into the compiler proper in the next release or two .
For a project that is currently compiling with ocamlopt ( the native code compiler ) , changing the to bytecode compiler is as simple as editing the Makefile and replacing all invocations of " ocamlopt " with " ocamlc - g " where the " - g " turns on exception backtraces .
You can then rebuild the application .
The final step is to turn on backtraces in the bytecode run time environment which is done by setting an environment variable :
export OCAMLRUNPARAM = " b1 "
Once compiled to bytecode and with the environment variable set , the application can be run and should produce the required backtrace .
The following is an example of a backtrace from something I 'm working on at the moment ( I hacked the code to make sure I could get one ) .
Fatal error : exception Invalid_argument ( " index out of bounds " )
Raised by primitive operation at unknown location Called from file " meyers_diff.ml " , line 93 , characters 1 - 31 Called from file " meyers_diff.ml " , line 200 , characters 10 - 52 Called from file " meyers_diff.ml " , line 221 , characters 16 - 60 Called from file " meyers_diff.ml " , line 264 , characters 11 - 148 Called from file " meyers_diff.ml " , line 305 , characters 17 - 50 Called from file " array.ml " , line 130 , characters 31 - 51 Called from file " meyers_diff.ml " , line 323 , characters 1-316
Obviously it would be nicer if function names were included here , but this is more than sufficient for debugging purposes .

Ed : Day # 3 of the Deconstructing Managers week .
If you have n’t a clue what is going , I ’d suggest starting with Day # 1 .
How are they compensating for their blind spots ?
Now we ’re going to pick on your favorite manager .
Tell me about him .
Probably a great communicator , funny guy , charismatic , you say ?
He probably inspired you .
You can probably quote a few of his more infamous sayings .
“ Better is the enemy of done . ”
The question is , what were his blind spots ?
Each manager , good or bad , is going to have a glaring deficiency .
Maybe he did escape from QA and now he ’s the Director of Engineering .
Perhaps he ’s a stunning technologist with absolutely no sense of humor .
The question is , does he recognize they have a blind spot ?
I ask the same question in every interview I have : “ Where do you need help ? ”
Whether it ’s an individual contributor , a manager , or my new boss , I ’m always curious where a person sees their weaknesses .
A flippant “ I ’m solid across the board ” response is a terrifying red flag .
I ’m a fan of pride ; I want you to sell yourself in a interview , but if you suggest that you ’re flawless , all I ’m thinking is that your flaws are so big that you ca n’t talk about them or you have no clue what they are .
A manager ’s job is to take what skills they have , the ones that got them promoted , and figure out how to make them scale .
They do this by building a team that accentuates their strengths and , more importantly , reinforces where they are weak .
Dry technologists need team members who are phenomenal communicators , folks who can tell a joke and socially glue the organization together .
Those vision guys with zero technology chops need you , the strong technologist , to tell them what is technically possible .
A manager ’s job is to transform their glaring deficiency into a strength by finding the best person to fill it and trusting him to do the job .
Does your manager speak the language ?
Ok , so , you ’re in a square room .
There are two clear windows in this room , one on each side .
In front of each window is a microphone which , when turned on , pipes whatever you say to whomever is on the other side of the window .
Now , your manager is on the other side of one window and your best work friend is behind the other .
It ’s Friday and I want you to give your weekly status report to your friend .
Something like :
“ Monday was a disaster .
I got in late because I whooped it on Sunday night .
Took a stab at the spec… but left a little early because I was hung over .
Tuesday and Wednesday were pretty good .
Finished the spec , closed some bugs , went to the cross-functional review , got some good feedback .
You should read the current version .
Thursday was meeting hell .
Got nothing done .
Three useless hours .
Friday , well , I had a beer at lunch and I ’m leaving early . ”
Now , spin around and give your status to your boss .
I do not care if you work for the worlds best manager .
I do not care if he was the best man in your wedding .
You are going to give a vastly different sequence of events because you are not talking to a person when you talk with your manager ; you are talking to the organization .
You instinctively know that telling your boss that you had a beer at lunch is a bad idea , not because he ’d know it , because the organization would .
The language you are speaking when you talk to your manager is a flavor of managementese .
Yeah , the language that Scott Adams has made millions of dollars exploiting .
It is a carefully constructed language which is designed to convey information across the organization .
Managementese allows managers from very different parts of the organization to communicate even though their respective jobs are chock full of different acronyms and proper names .
And yeah , managementese sounds funny .
An example :
“ Our key objective for this project is the schedule .
We need to keep our teams focused on the respective goals , but also keep them cross-pollinating so they can error correct on their own . ”
When you hear that , you think , “ Why ca n ’t he talk like a human ? ”
He ’s not talking to you .
He ’s talking to other managers and he ’s saying some very Rands - like - things like , “ Commitments matter ! ” and “ The team is smarter than the individual ! ”
It ’d be great if managers could speak with a little more art , but the job at hand is to spread information across the organization as efficiently as possible .
And a local dialect of managementese is the best way .
Besides , they still need to talk you , which leads us to …

Gonzales faces removal from office , Republicans say Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday March 21 , 2007 Print This Email This Republican sources are suggesting that Alberto Gonzales ' days as Attorney General in the Bush Administration may be numbered , according to a report in today 's edition of The Politico .
A Republican source told Politico reporters Mike Allen and John Bresnahan that after a call of support from President George W. Bush to Gonzales the process of searching for a replacement had been frozen , but the freeze was only temporary .
" We 're just waiting .
They 've reached out to everyone they need to reach out to and are waiting to get a ' yes ' from someone , " the source said .
An anonymous member of the House Republican Leadership also told the Politico reporters that Gonzales ' tenure would soon end .
" I can't imagine that he 's going to be around a whole lot longer , " they quoted the Member of Congress saying , adding , " There 's already Republicans on the Hill calling for him to quit and there 's certainly not a deep well of support on the Hill for him . "
The White House denied any plans were afoot to replace the Attorney General .
Subpoenas of White House officials loom After White House Counsel Fred Fielding rejected the call for sworn testimony by various White House officials , but offered unsworn private conversations with the officials in question , Democrats in Congress responded coolly .
Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , who chairs the House Judiciary Committee , called the White House offer " disappointing . "
He also promised a prompt response .
" The House Judiciary Committee will take whatever steps are necessary and within our Congressional authority to get to the bottom of what has become a horrible mess that is undermining American trust in our federal criminal justice system , " said Conyers in a statement sent to RAW STORY last night .
His committee 's Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law set a vote this morning to authorize subpoenas , but stopped short of immediate plans to issue subpoenas itself .
" We will not necessarily issue the subpoenas immediately , " said a spokesman for Rep. Linda Sanchez , who chairs the subcommittee , in an e-mail to RAW STORY .
" We are trying what we can to avoid doing that , but this vote will allow for the possibility that the White House will definitively choose to stonewall and slow - walk the investigation . "
The Senate 's leader on the subject , Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) also called the White House 's offer of unsworn statements unacceptable .
" Testimony should be on the record , and under oath .
That 's the formula for true accountability , " he said in a statement published at CNN 's Political Ticker .
On Sunday 's " 60 Minutes " former DCI George Tenet speaks out strongly about how his " slam dunk " remark was taken out of context and how he was made into the WMD scapegoat .
Tenet 's new book ,
At the Center of the Storm : My Years at the CIA , is due out on April 30 .
Hopefully sparks will fly -- it 's about time we re-examine the pre-war lies .

TENET : I remember picking up the phone and calling Andy Card , who is a terrific human being and somebody I 've always trusted ...[...]
Hi , Andy .
I said , you know , we believe -- I believed that he had weapons of mass destruction and now what 's happened here is , is you 've gone out and made me look stupid .
It 's the most despicable thing I 've ever heard in my life .
Men of honor do n't do this .
UPDATE : Oversight Committee Invites Former CIA Director to Testify ...
( transcript below the fold ... )
BLITZER : Former CIA Director George tenet is blasting the Bush administration .
He says it made him a scapegoat for the war in Iraq , ruined his reputation , and ended his career .
Tonight CBS
News is releasing more excerpts from the Tenet interview that will air on " 60 Minutes . "
At issue here a remark Tenet acknowledges he made in a reference to weapons of mass destruction in Iraq .
He said and I 'm quoting now -- " it 's a slam - dunk case " .
According to CBS , Tenet says he does n't believe that a slam - dunk comment influenced President Bush 's decision to go to war .
But he says that 's the message that was sent when his remarked was leaked to the journalist Bob Woodward .
Tenet says he was taking out of context and he complained to the White House .

GEORGE TENET , FORMER CIA DIRECTOR : I remember picking up the phone and calling Andy Card , who is a terrific human being and somebody I 've always trusted ...
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : President 's chief of staff at the time .
TENET : President 's chief of staff -- Hi , Andy .
I said , you know , we believe -- I believed that he had weapons of mass destruction and now what 's happened here is , is you 've gone out and made me look stupid .
It 's the most despicable thing I 've ever heard in my life .
Men of honor do n't do this .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Men of honor do n't do this .
TENET : You do n't do this .
You do n't throw people overboard .
You do n't call do this -- you do n't call somebody in .
You work your heart out .
You show up every day .
You 're going to throw somebody overboard just because it's a deflection .
Is that honorable ?
It 's not honorable to me .
OK and that 's how I feel .
Now had it happened and who orchestrated it and what happened , you know , at the end of the day the only thing that you have is trust and honor in this world .
It 's all you have .
All you have is your reputation built on trust and your personal honor .
When you do n't have that anymore , well you know there you go .
Trust was broken .
UNIDENTIFIED MALE : Between you and the White House .
TENET : You bet .
You bet .
For almost ten years now I have argued that digital rights management has little to do with piracy , but that is instead a carefully plotted ruse to undercut fair use and then create new revenue streams where there were previously none .
I will briefly repeat my argument here before relating a prime example of it in the wild .
The theory
Access control technologies such as DRM create " scarcity " where there is immeasurable abundance , that is , in a world of digital reproduction .
The early years saw tech such as CSS tapped to prevent the copying of DVDs , but DRM has become much more than that .
It 's now a behavioral modification scheme that permits this , prohibits that , monitors you , and auto - expires when .
Oh , and sometimes you can to watch a video or listen to some music .
The basic point is that access control technologies are becoming more and more refined .
To create new , desirable product markets ( e.g. , movies for portable digital devices ) , the studios have turned to DRM ( and the law ) to create the scarcity ( illegality of ripping DVDs ) needed to both create the need for it and sustain it .
Rather than admit that this is what they 're doing , they trot out bogus studies claiming that this is all caused by piracy .
It 's the classic nannying scheme : " Because some of you can't be trusted , everyone has to be treated this way . "
But everybody knows that this nanny is in it for her own interests .
Like all lies , there comes a point when the gig is up ; the ruse is busted .
For the movie studios , it 's the moment they have to admit that it's not the piracy that worries them , but business models which do n't squeeze every last cent out of customers .
In a nutshell : DRM 's sole purpose is to maximize revenues by minimizing your rights and selling them back to you .
The history
History repeats itself , especially the bad parts .
What I find most puzzling , however , is how history has n't taught the movie industry this lesson yet .
In 1982 , then - MPAA head Jack Valenti testified before the House of Representatives on the emerging phenomenon of VCR ownership .
He famously said , " I say to you that the VCR is to the American film producer and the American public as the Boston Strangler is to the woman home alone . "
Valenti said this in response to a claim that the VCR would be the greatest friend the American film producer ever had .
Valenti was vehement in his opposition to the idea that the VCR could be a good thing .
He , and many in the industry , believed that it was fundamentally wrong to allow the public to make decisions for themselves about how to use a VCR .
They even expressed worry that multiple people could watch the same movie on a VCR , but not all of them would have to pay .
The idea of Joe User buying a movie for a fixed price and then inviting friends over to see it was anathema to the industry .
Yet by the late 1990s , sales of VHS movies were generating more revenue than movie ticket sales .
DVD , the successor to VHS and Betamax , greatly widened the gap thanks to outstanding profit margins .
The " Boston Strangler " was nowhere in sight .
Of course , Hollywood lost the battle over the VCR , and its enemy became the best friend it ever had .
That is , until behavior - modifying DRM was born , and Hollywood saw another chance to take a crack at the holy grail .
The practice
As a quick aside , let 's put this piracy excuse to rest .
You can easily find almost any DVD online , for free , because CSS has long been cracked and the movies uploaded .
All of these new DRM schemes can't change that one simple fact : at least for the DVD market , a pirate 's lifestyle is a matter of downloading some easily obtainable software .
There is simply no evidence whatsoever that DRM slows piracy .
In fact , all of the evidence suggests the opposite , and arguments that DRM " keeps honest people honest " are frankly insulting .
If they 're already honest , they do n't need DRM .
So given the windfall generated by the VCR , which was followed by an even greater explosion in revenue thanks to DVD , why are n't popular services like the iTunes Store being embraced ?
At a time when TV networks are seeing ratings boosts and fattened profits thanks to downloadable video , how come Disney is still the only movie studio to release new releases on iTunes ?
If we believe Ronald Grover 's sources in his BusinessWeek article of last week , the problem is liberal DRM and not piracy , and this is a startling admission .
According to him , an unnamed studio executive said that a major reason why studios were n't jumping on board with the iTunes Store and other similar services is that their DRM is too lax .
" [ Apple 's ] user rules just scare the heck out of us . "
It 's not piracy that 's the concern , it 's their ability to control how you use the content you purchase .
As it turns out , five devices authorized for playback is too many , and the studios apparently believe that this is " just as bad " as piracy .
Hollywood believes that iTunes Store customers will add their buddies ' devices to their authorization list , and like evil communists , they 'll share what they have purchased .
This makes little sense , because the way iTunes works , you can only issue so many device authorizations at a time .
You could share with a friend , but then your friend would have to be authorized to play all of your purchased content , taking up an authorization .
Inconvenient , huh ?
But is it a big problem ?
I can walk in to Best Buy right now , buy a DVD , and lend it to every person I know .
Who has n't lent a DVD to a friend or colleague ?
This is perfectly legal behavior , but you can see that Hollywood hopes to stop this kind of thing via DRM .
Thanks to the DMCA , once copyrighted contents have been encrypted , your rights fly right out the window .
It sounds like a bad Hollywood tale : " In a world ... where DRM is liberal ... there 's only one fowl that 's not foul ...
Chicken Little .
And the Sky . Is. Falling . " </ movievoice >
The executions are carried out at dawn on Haqlania bridge , the entrance to Haditha .
A small crowd usually turns up to watch even though the killings are filmed and made available on DVD in the market the same afternoon .
One of last week 's victims was a young man in a black tracksuit .
Like the others he was left on his belly by the blue iron railings at the bridge 's southern end .
His severed head rested on his back , facing Baghdad .
Children cheered when they heard that the next day 's spectacle would be a double bill : two decapitations .
A man named Watban and his brother had been found guilty of spying .
With so many alleged American agents dying here Haqlania bridge was renamed Agents ' bridge .
Then a local wag dubbed it Agents ' fridge , evoking a mortuary , and that name has stuck .
A three - day visit by a reporter working for the Guardian last week established what neither the Iraqi government nor the US military has admitted : Haditha , a farming town of 90,000 people by the Euphrates river , is an insurgent citadel .
That Islamist guerrillas were active in the area was no secret but only now has the extent of their control been revealed .
They are the sole authority , running the town 's security , administration and communications .
A three - hour drive north from Baghdad , under the nose of an American base , it is a miniature Taliban - like state .
Insurgents decide who lives and dies , which salaries get paid , what people wear , what they watch and listen to .
Haditha exposes the limitations of the Iraqi state and US power on the day when the political process is supposed to make a great leap - a draft constitution finalised and approved by midnight tonight .
For politicians and diplomats in Baghdad 's fortified green zone the constitution is a means to stabilise Iraq and woo Sunni Arabs away from the rebellion .
For Haditha , 140 miles north - west of the capital , whether a draft is agreed is irrelevant .
Residents already have a set of laws and rules promulgated by insurgents .
Within minutes of driving into town the Guardian was stopped by a group of men and informed about rule number one : announce yourself .
The mujahideen , as they are known locally , must know who comes and goes .
The Guardian reporter did not say he worked for a British newspaper .
For their own protection interviewees cannot be named .
There is no fighting here because there is no one to challenge the Islamists .
The police station and municipal offices were destroyed last year and US marines make only fleeting visits every few months .
Two groups share power .
Ansar al - Sunna is a largely homegrown organisation , though its leader in Haditha is said to be foreign .
Al - Qaida in Iraq , known locally by its old name Tawhid al - Jihad , is led by the Jordanian - born Abu Musab al - Zarqawi .
There was a rumour that Zarqawi , Washington 's most wanted militant after Osama bin Laden , visited early last week .
True or not , residents wanted to believe they had hosted such a celebrity .
A year ago Haditha was just another sleepy town in western Anbar province , deep in the Sunni triangle and suspicious of the Shia - led government in Baghdad but no insurgent hotbed .
Then , say residents , arrived mostly Shia police with heavyhanded behaviour .
" That 's how it began , " said one man .
Attacks against the police escalated until they fled , creating a vacuum filled by insurgents .
Alcohol and music deemed unIslamic were banned , women were told to wear headscarves and relations between the sexes were closely monitored .
The mobile phone network was shut down but insurgents retained their walkie - talkies and satellite phones .
Right - hand lanes are reserved for their vehicles .
From attacks on US and Iraqi forces it is clear that other Anbar towns , such as Qaim , Rawa , Anna and Ramadi , are to varying degrees under the sway of rebels .
In Haditha hospital staff and teachers are allowed to collect government salaries in Ramadi , the capital of Anbar , but other civil servants have had to quit .
Last year the US trumpeted its rehabilitation of a nearby power plant : " The incredible progress at Haditha is just one example of the huge strides made by the US army corps of engineers . "
Now insurgents earn praise from residents for allegedly pressuring managers to supply electricity almost 24 hours a day , a luxury denied the rest of Iraq .
The court caters solely for divorces and marriages .
Alleged criminals are punished in the market .
The Guardian witnessed a headmaster accused of adultery whipped 190 times with cables .
Children laughed as he sobbed and his robe turned crimson .
Two men who robbed a foreign exchange shop were splayed on the ground .
Masked men stood on their hands while others broke their arms with rocks .
The shopkeeper offered the insurgents a reward but they declined .
DVDs of beheadings on the bridge are distributed free in the souk .
Children prefer them to cartoons .
" They should not watch such things , " said one grandfather , but parents appeared not to object .
One DVD features a young , blond muscular man who had been disembowelled .
He was said to have been a member of a six - strong US sniper team ambushed and killed on August 1 .
Residents said he had been paraded in town before being executed .
The US military denied that , saying six bodies were recovered and that all appeared to have died in combat .
Shortly after the ambush three landmines killed 14 marines in a convoy which ventured from their base outside the town .
Twice in recent months marines backed by aircraft and armour swept into Haditha to flush out the rebels .
In a pattern repeated across Anbar there were skirmishes , a few suspects killed or detained , and success was declared .
In reality , said residents , the insurgents withdrew for a few days and returned when the Americans left .
They have learned from last November 's battle in Falluja , when hundreds died fighting the marines and still lost the city .
Now their strategy appears to be to wait out the Americans , calculating they will leave within a few years , and then escalate what some consider the real war against a government led by Shias , a rival sect which Sunni extremists consider apostasy .
The US military declined to respond to questions detailing the extent of insurgent control in the town .
There was evidence of growing cooperation between rebels .
A group in Falluja , where the resistance is said to be regrouping , wrote to Haditha requesting background checks on two volunteers from the town .
One local man in his 40s told the Guardian he wanted to be a suicide bomber to atone for sins and secure a place in heaven .
" But the mujahideen will not let me .
They said I had eight children and it was my duty to look after them . "
Tribal elders said they feared but respected insurgents for keeping order and not turning the town into a battleground .
They appear to have been radicalised , and condemned Sunni groups , such as the Iraqi Islamic party and the Muslim Scholars ' Association , for engaging in the political process .
The constitution talks , the referendum due in October , the election due in December : all are deemed collaboration punishable by death .
The task now is to bleed the Americans and destabilise the government .

The Nazis hijacked the symbol from its Hindu origins
Ramesh Kallidai of the Hindu Forum of Britain said the swastika had been a symbol of peace for thousands of years before the Nazis adopted it .
He said a ban on the symbol would discriminate against Hindus .
Germany , holder of the EU presidency , wants to make Holocaust denial and the display of Nazi symbols a crime .
Mr Kallidai said his organisation was writing to European lawmakers to highlight the issue .
The swastika has been around for 5,000 years as a symbol of peace ,
Ramesh Kallidai
Origins of the swastika
Hindu groups in Holland , Belgium and Italy were also involved in the campaign , he said .
" The swastika has been around for 5,000 years as a symbol of peace , " he said .
" This is exactly the opposite of how it was used by Hitler . "
He said that while the Nazi implications of the symbol should be condemned , people should respect the Hindu use of the swastika .
" Just because Hitler misused the symbol , abused it and used it to propagate a reign of terror and racism and discrimination , it does not mean that its peaceful use should be banned . "
The group said banning the swastika was equivalent to banning the cross simply because the Ku Klux Klan had used burning crosses .
The swastika is already banned in Germany .
A previous attempt to ban it across the EU in early 2005 failed after objections from several governments , including the British .
Germany took over the six - month EU presidency on 1 January .

Introduction
The W32 . Evol virus was discovered around July 2000 .
Its name is derived from a string found in the virus , but much more can be implied from the name .
Up until then , most of the viruses were using Polymorphic engines in order to hide themselves from Anti-Virus scanners .
The engine would encrypt the virus with a different key on every generation , and would generate a small , variant decryptor that would consist of different operations but remain functionally equivalent .
This technique was beginning to wear out as AV scanners would trace virus - decryption until it was decrypted in memory , visible and clear .
Although Metamorphism , as a technique , appeared in several viruses in the DOS age , it got full attention from virus writers in the 32 - bit environment .
The idea is simple ; Transformation instead of Encryption .
Not just a small decryptor would be transformed , but the entire virus body .
A Metamorphic engine is used in order to transform executable ( binary ) code .
The behavior of such an engine varies from virus to virus , but many elements remain the same .
A metamorphic engine has to implement some sort of an internal disassembler in order to parse the input code .
After disassembly , the engine will transform the program code and will produce new code that will retain its functionality and yet will look different from the original code .
According to Symantec , Evol was the first virus to utilize a ' true ' 32 - bit Metamorphic Engine , and so it represents another step in the evolution of Anti-AV techniques .
Virus Author 's Note : " The only particularity of Evol is its evolution engine - meaning that the virus will mutate every 4 copy of itself .
The engine is not an usual polymorphic engine , but rather a metamorphic engine ( see Benny description in 29A # 4 ) , which means that there is no encrypted code : the whole code of the virus , engine included , is variable .
Furthermore , the engine inserts random code , so as to make detection by antivirus more difficult .
The virus contains no fixed data : it is only a massive piece of code . "
The research I performed over the Metamorphic engine includes a heavily - commented disassembly of the engine available here .
Information regarding the behavior of the virus itself is not included in this paper and is available on many Antivirus websites on the Internet , namely the Symantec website .
Legend
Examples in this paper include shortened naming of assembly language expressions :
Reg – Register ( i.e. EAX , EBX ) Mem – Memory address ( i.e. [ EAX ] ) r/m – Register or Memory imm – Immediate Value ( i.e. OP Reg , ACABh ) OP = { ADC , ADD , AND , CMP , OR , SBB , SUB , XOR} OP1 = { DIV , IDIV , IMUL , MUL , NEG , NOT , TEST} OP2 = {RCL , RCR , ROL , ROR , SAL , SAR , SHL , SHR}
Calling
The engine is called in the following standard - issue fashion :
push [ ebp+var_14 ] ; * outBuf ( EDI ) call GetSizeOfCode push eax ; sizeOfCode call SeekStartOfVirus push eax ; * inBuf ( ESI ) call MetaEngine cmp eax , 0 jz short EngineFailed
Or , in psuedo-C :
MetaEngine (* inBuf , sizeOfCode , * outBuf ) ;
Where , * inBuf is a pointer to the code , sizeOfCode is the size , * outBuf is the output to the destination buffer where the mutated code will be stored .
Code Analysis
The engine will perform a analysis over the given code .
Aside from on - the - fly disassembly , the virus will allocate 4 table entries for each instruction it analyzes .
Each of the entries is a double - word .
The structure is accessed in the following way :
+00 InputIP Pointer to Instruction in the Input Buffer +04 OutputIP Pointer to Mutated Instruction in Output Buffer +08 OffsetNewRelative Pointer to offset of New Relative Branch Value +0C NewRelative New Relative Value for a Branch Instruction
When the engine first loads , it will use allocate SizeOfCode * 16 bytes using VirtualAlloc for the purpose of the above - mentioned table .
In the end , theses bytes will be freed using VirtualFree .
The virus itself uses internal ' caller ' functions ( callVirtualAlloc / callVirtualFree ) , and does n't call the API 's directly .
Every time the engine loads a new instruction for analysis , the first two members of the structure are filled , and the 3rd member is zeroed for later use .
The 3rd and 4th fields will only be filled in case the engine analyzes a branch instruction ( JMP / Jcc / CALL ) , to be used when the relocations will be fixed , after the mutation process is complete .
The engine will disassemble only instructions that the author had included , meaning it would fail with unrecognized / unsupported instructions .
Sample Disassembly :
cmp al , 8 Ah ; MOV r8 , r/m8 ?
jz short _ Mutate ?
cmp al , 8Bh ; MOV r32 , r/m32 ? jz short _ Mutate ?
cmp al , 8Dh ; LEA r32 , mem ?
jz short _ Mutate ?
As you can see , the engine simply checks for the current opcode , and if it is recognized by the engine , it will take an action accordingly .
Code Transformations
I. Instruction Transformation
The engine supports several kinds of instruction mutations , meaning it will write different code with the same functionality .
The defined transformations are divided into two parts : Inter -Engine Transformations :
These transformations are inlined inside the engine , and are a part of the engine 's core .
Original Transformed - PUSH r/m8 - PUSH r/m32 MOV EAX , r/m PUSH EAX - MOV reg , imm a. MOV reg , Random ADD reg , imm-Random
b. MOV reg , Random SUB reg , -( imm- Random )
c. MOV reg , Random XOR reg , Random^imm
: These transformations are inlined inside the engine , and are a part of the engine 's core .
External Transformations :
These transformations are called like that due to the fact that their ' physical ' location is outside the main engine function .
Despite this fact , these routines act as if they are inside the engine itself , and when they are finished they jump back to the engine .
There is no visible point behind this , and my guess is that they were added after the initial coding process .
Original Transformed - MOV r/m , reg - MOV reg , r/m - TEST r/m , reg - LEA r32 , mem - OP r/m , reg - OP reg , r/m PUSH RandomReg MOV RandomReg , OriginalReg ADD RadnomReg , RandomImm8 OP r/m - RandomReg , OriginalReg POP RandomReg - MOV r/m , reg - TEST r/m , reg - OP r/m , reg PUSH RandomReg MOV RandomReg , OriginalReg OP OriginalR / M , RandomReg POP RandomReg - MOV reg , r/m - LEA reg , mem - OP reg , r/m PUSH RandomReg MOV RandomReg , OriginalReg OP RandomReg , OriginalR / M MOV OriginalReg , RandomReg POP RandomReg - OP r/m8 , imm8 - MOV r/m8 , imm8 - TEST r/m8 PUSH RandomReg MOV RandomReg8 , Imm8 OP OriginalR / M8 , RandomReg8 POP RandomReg
The engine 's decision whether to transform a given instruction or not is based upon a random factor .
The engine asks for a random number between 0 and 7 , and the transformation will be applied only if it is 0 – meaning a probability of 1/8 .
II .
Alternative Instruction Encoding
The Intel instruction format allows different binary encoding for the same action .
The engine supports the following alternative encodings :
Original Encoding Modified Encoding Mnemonics 7 x imm8 0 F 8 x imm32 Jcc short Jcc near EB imm8 E9 imm32 CALL short CALL near A8 imm8 F6 C0 imm8 TEST AL , imm8 TEST AL , imm8 A9 imm32 F7 C0 imm32 TEST EAX , imm32 TEST EAX , imm32 3 F imm8 80 ModRM imm8 OP AL , imm8 OP AL , imm8 3 F imm32 81 ModRM imm32 OP EAX , imm32 OP EAX , imm32 83 ModRM imm8 81 ModRM imm32 OP r/m32 , imm8 OP r/m32 , imm32
III .
Fixed Transformations
The engine will replace the following bytes with the corresponding sequences :
Original Encoding Modified Encoding Mnemonics A4 50 8A 06 83 C6 01 88 07 83 C7 01 58 MOVSB PUSH EAX MOV AL , [ ESI ] ADD ESI , 1 MOV [ EDI ] , AL ADD EDI , 1 POP EAX A5 50 8B 06 83 C6 04 89 07 83 C7 04 58 MOVSD PUSH EAX MOV [ EAX ] , ESI ADD ESI , 4 MOV [ EDI ] , EAX ADD EDI , 4 POP EAX AA 88 07 83 C7 01 STOSB MOV EDI , [ AL ] ADD EDI , 1 AB 88 07 83 C7 04 STOSD MOV EDI , [ EAX ] ADD EDI , 4 AC 8A 06 83 C6 01 LODSB MOV AL , [ ESI ] ADD ESI , 1 AD 8A 06 83 C6 04 LODSD MOV EAX , [ ESI ] ADD ESI , 4
As you can see , these instructions do not have any parameters passed onto them , thus simply being replaced with their corresponding functionality .
IV .
Junk - Code Insertion
The engine will generate instructions that are not reliant upon the original code , and their functionality is essentially " do - nothing " .
The junk instructions will only be added if the last written byte is between 50h to 52h ( PUSH EAX / ECX / EDX ) .
- MOV r32 , [ ebp+Random8 ] - MOV r32 , Random32 - OP r32 , Random32 ;ADC / ADD / AND /OR / SBB/SUB/XOR - MOV RandomReg8 , Random8
It may be noted , however , that these instructions actually do alter the original code flow as they are random and inserted in places in which they will be executed , but these instructions are inserted after PUSH instructions , so we assume the registers will be modified later on .
V. General Instructions
In any other case the engine will store the instruction as is , aside from exceptional opcodes :
Opcode Mnemonics Action 90 NOP
Do n't store 0 F xx
( 80 > xx > 90 ) Special Opcode 0F
Not supported by engine Abort Engine CC INT 3 ( Debugger Breakpoint ) Anti Debug 81 C4 ADD ESP , imm32 Store 81 EC SUB ESP , imm32 Store 83 C4 ADD ESP , imm8 Store 83 EC ADD ESP , imm8 Store C0 OP2 r/m8 , im m8 Store D0 OP2 r/m8 , im m8 Store CD INT Store 8B EC MOV EBP , ESP Store F3 REP Prefix Store C3 RET Store 50 – 5 F PUSH r32 / POP r32 Store
Relocation Fixups
After the mutation process is completed , the engine fixes instruction relocations .
Due to the fact that many times the transformation process results in growth of code , most ( if not all ) of the branch instructions will lead to an incorrect place in the destination buffer .
The engine will utilize the relocation - table it created during the mutation process , and it will patch the new address into place .
First , it will loop through the table .
For every instruction it will add the 1st and 4th fields ( InputIP + NewRelative ) , thus calculating a virtual original destination .
It will then set a second loop that will search for that destination , and patch the entry using the 3rd and 4th fields .
Other Features
I. Anti Debugging
If the engine will detect a breakpoint over the code it mutates , it will jump to the following routine :
AntiDebug : cmp byte ptr [ ebx+7 ] , 0 BFh ; are we in kernel mode ?
jnz short ret_AntiDebug mov ecx , 1000h ; counter = 1000h mov edi , 40000000h or edi , 80000000h add edi , ecx ; edi = C0001000h rep stosd ; copy bytes to [ edi ] ret_AntiDebug : retn ; this will result in a crash
The above routine can also be considered as ' external ' , as it is called from the main virus body as well as from the engine .
II . Internal Functions
The engine contains several functions that it uses for many actions : Random : Returns a random number in EAX .
: Returns a random number in EAX .
Rnd7 : Returns a random number between 0 - 7 and checks if it 's 0 .
: Returns a random number between 0 - 7 and checks if it's 0 .
CheckDisplacement : Returns the displacement of a given opcode in CL .
: Returns the displacement of a given opcode in CL .
InvertSign :
If necessary , the function inverts the sign (- / + ) of AL .
: If necessary , the function inverts the sign (- / + ) of AL .
GetRandomDword : Returns a random dword in EAX .
: Returns a random dword in EAX .
GetWBit : Extracts the W bit from the opcode into DL .
: Extracts the W bit from the opcode into DL .
ModifyDH : Modifies the DH according to the W bit .
: Modifies the DH according to the W bit .
GetRandomReg8 : Returns a random 8 bit register in BL .
: Returns a random 8 bit register in BL .
GetRandomReg32 : Returns a random 32 bit register in BL .
: Returns a random 32 bit register in BL .
MakePushRandomReg : Generates a PUSH RandomReg instruction .
: Generates a PUSH RandomReg instruction .
MakePopRandomReg : Generates a POP RandomReg instruction .
Sample Transformations
Presented below are the actual transformations performed by the engine on itself .
B9 00 10 00 00 mov ecx , 1000 h Transformed : B9 10 B2 00 3C mov ecx , 3C00B210h 81 C1 F0 5D FF C3 add ecx , 0C3FF5DF0h ; ecx = 1000h
Some of the " external " transformations :
Before After 8B 45 0C mov eax , [ ebp+0 Ch ] 56 push esi 89 EE mov esi , ebp 83 C6 56 add esi , 56h 8B 46 B6 mov eax , [ esi - 4Ah ] 5E pop esi 89 43 08 mov [ ebx+8 ] , eax 51 push ecx 8B C8 mov ecx , eax 89 4B 08 mov [ ebx+8 ] , ecx 59 pop ecx 33 C0 xor eax , eax 51 push ecx 89 C1 mov ecx , eax 33 C8 xor ecx , eax 8B C1 mov eax , ecx 59 pop ecx 80 F9 50 cmp cl , 50h 52 push edx B2 50 mov dl , 50h 38 D1 cmp cl , dl 5A pop edx
As you can see in the above examples , the mutated byte - sequences are entirely different then the original ones .
Conclusion
The analysis of the virus engine took me a lot of time , mainly due to the fact that it was done statically , without running the code .
I hope this paper helps to shed more light on the idea of how metamorphism is done , as well as the aspects involved in the design of such an engine .
Further , I 'd like to thank the author of this engine , for creating this piece of code that enhanced my interest in this particular field .
I encourage you to look over the reversed source - code of the engine , as it will probably make all things written above a little bit more clear .
Thanks for reading this .
As always , any feedback is always welcome .

Congressman Danny Davis ( D - IL ) , says that he firmly believes that President George Bush has committed serious impeachable crimes and abuses of power , but says that “ at this time ” he supports a decision by the House Democratic Caucus to put impeachment aside in the interest of helping to elect a Democratic Congress and a Democratic president in 2008 .
Although in late 2005 , Rep. Davis was an enthusiastic co-sponsor of a bill by Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) that called for an investigation into possible impeachable acts by the president , Davis now says , “ The Democratic Caucus has decided that impeachment would not be in the best interests of the country and I ’m following that decision . ”
At the same time , Rep. Davis , a former Chicago alderman , declares that his basic instinct is to follow the wishes of his constituents .
“ When I got elected to city council , I set up what I called the 29th Ward People ’s Assembly .
My pledge then was that on any issue of public policy , I would follow their position .
If the group decided on a direction , I had to take it .
And that approach has not changed . ” Â Davis insists that if the people of his congressional district were to make it clear , through a letter - writing campaign or a petition campaign or some other means , that they felt impeachment were a priority for them , he would feel bound to act on their views .

China 's first liquid condom went on sale today after the country 's health and drugs administration formally gave the hi-tech prophylactic the thumbs - up , the China Daily reports .
This is too interesting to pass up .
In this picture is supposedly a bottle of Iiquid condom .
Nanometer - silver Cryptomorphic Condom ( NCC ) , it 's designed for female rather than male usage .
The condom - in - a - can is essentially an antiseptic foam spray that the manufacturer claims forms a physical membrane inside the vagina , protecting it from infection , acting as a barrier to pregnancy and providing a lubricating effect .
What the heck is that ?
designed for ladies ’ use .
On the bottle , it says .
This world ’s first liquid condom went on sales this week in China , after China ’s health and drugs administration formally gave the manufacturer the green light .
The manufacturer claims that it forms a physical membrane inside the vagina , protecting it from infection , acting as a barrier to pregnancy and providing a lubricating effect .
Well , if it really is that good , it might just put Durex out of business .
But most often , if things appear too good to be true , it most likely is !
Give some feedback ?
Thilak
After reading all comments which follow up .
I think the debate is not about bandwidth , it all about pageload speed .
Visitors always want the page to load as quick as possible .
Eli Must automatically do it or something , I just checked all three of my WordPress installations and all the permalinks end in / , which is the way I like it anyway ! 😀
Good tip anyway ! 🙂
Piyal very good tip
Rene Some benchmarks are in order , coz i do n’t think a directory / file distinction will be noticably faster ..
I can perfectly imagine such data residing in RAM , meaning the distinction is made in nano - seconds ..
Julian
There ’s no reason for not using www .
URLs just look better with it and it gives more structure to websites .
jamjammo >> most of people are so used to typing www Actually , that ONLY people I ’ve ever witnessed typing in www are the non-geeks that I know .
hahaha .
I once showed a friend how , instead of always clicking in the address bar , just hit :
Alt + D , which focuses the cursor in the address bar .
man o man was he impressed !
He has now learned more keyboard commands to STOP using his mouse , unless he has to .
Daniel jamjammo , the no-www discussion is another interesting one hehe !
I apply it in some of my sites , but most of people are so used to typing www .
that it will be difficult to change it in the short term .
jamjammo
In a real world , every - day - web - development - environment , I feel that this is geared towards more consistency and uniformity .
True , web server issues are a matter than can not be ignored , but for the average web site owner / developer , a millisecond or two will not be noticed .
There is so much to consider when shaving a few seconds off a sites loading time : image optimization , serving a large JS file , many MySQL requests , etc. etc .
I recall the task a few years ago of optimizing ALL the GIF images from my site , redoing them as PNG , re-FTPing them back to the site , and rewriting the original pages to request the new PNG file instead of the GIF , and man o man , my pages loaded about 2 - 3 seconds faster .
I ’m not saying that using a slash in your links is n’t worth it – it IS .
I ’m just saying I use this method as more of a coding convention .
Like when I found out that www . is deprecated .
engtech ( I left a comment without self - promotion !!!)
Another reason to always be exact with URLs ( other than time savings and bandwidth ) is for when the URL gets saved to a social bookmarking site .
They can be * really * dumb when it comes to not checking to see what the real URL should be .
I wrote an article about it here :
engtech I had an inkling but I had never thought about it before .
Thanks Daniel .
maht lol , I take it all back Apache and IIS both issue 301 headers with a / added Which added around 500 bytes to the conversation and an extra round trip .
I should have got Wireshark out * before * my first post 🙂
Bes Z
Thanks for sharing Daniel .
I had always thought about using a trailing slash , but was not sure of the exact benefits .
If a site is getting a 1000 people to click on 5 links every minute , a site owner should do everything to make sure there is no or minimum lag for any of the users .
Also , saving even 1 byte of bandwidth for each request is good , as 1 byte of bandwidth saved for a thousand people clicking on hundreds of links everyday means you are optimizing your site and reducing server load .
Unless you are on a platform like Blogspot , you need all the juice you can get to make sure things run smoothly and efficiently .
Jack Really interesting stuff .
Thank you the insight , everyone .
Ashish Mohta
Thanks for the clarification guys .
Did n’t knew apache is doing it internally
Joe
This is not necessarily designed to reduce bandwidth ; however , it may reduce latency and possibly ( on a grand scale ) server load .
When a web browser goes to a link , the Web server controls how and where it ’s redirected .
In most cases when someone is directed to a the root of a directory without a trailing slash , then the web server performs a brief lookup of any subdirectories and performs a 301 redirect to the browser .
This process can take from 1 / 4 of a second , to even 2 seconds depending on your server .
Amanda the problem with slash links .. is if you pick it up in wordpress you have a hard time installing subdirectory programs with them .
Srijith
How does this save bandwidth ?
Apache does a ‘ stat ’ for ‘ about ’ and on realising that it is a dir , send back a HTTP 301 Moved Permanently with pointer to ‘ about / ’.
The browser then asks for ‘/ about / ’ .
So , yes it does save bandwidth .
rick
It ’s not so much that this technique is faster , but it saves you from doing another request .
If going to / about will just redirect you to / about / , then why not link to it directly ?
Daniel maht and james , the bandwidth part is minimal I agree with you both , so I removed it from the original post .
Regarding server response times though , you need to think that even if the improvement is very small it will be multiplied by the number of clients requesting the links , and this can be on the range of 100 ’s per minute for popular sites .
And even if the operation is “ server - side ” it will need to be processed before the page is served to the client .
Ashish Mohta
You have a point there James .
It might rather work where you have actual directories .
James Sounds great , but how do we know it ’s true ?
Do you have any actual metrics on this ?
How much “ time and bandwidth ” is spent when a server has to “ figure out what kind of file or webpage ” a url points to ?
If the request has already been passed in , the “ figuring out ” would be all server - side , and should n’t require any additional bandwidth , for example .
Details !
Thanks .
Ashish Mohta
I am little biased on that and agree with maht .
It does n’t matter as google or any bot knows what is a page and what is a directory .
maht >
When a server opens a link in the form of â€ œhttp://www.domain.com/aboutâ€ it will need to figure what kind of file or webpage is contained on that address , wasting time and bandwidth on the process .
How does this save bandwidth ?
if anything , it reduces it by 1 byte
Daniel Tassos , that is right , the “ / ” should be used with directory pages .
It appeared intuitive to me , but its better to clarify .
Do not use the “ / ” on file pages like domain.com /index.html / , this will not work .
Tassos Bassoukos
It actually depends on the backend .
If you are using apache and the URL is mapped to a file , a 404 will get served .
Some systems that do URL rewriting – such as most PHP CMSs – may get confused .
And it only works on URLs of actual folders /
Fanatyk I didn`t know that – thx 🙂
Ramanathan As Alex said , I had no idea about it as well .
Small but great tip .
Thanks .
Alex I had no idea that a simple ‘/’ speeds up server respons .
Thanks for the tip !
Daniel Manta , absolutely , thanks for complementing the tip !
In a world where every hair care product claims to be made for your individual hair type , it ’s easy to lose sight of the fact that there really are true scientific differences between hair types .
For example , a study published in the Journal of the Society of Cosmetic Chemists ( 57 , 327-338 July 2006 ) discovered that there are at least 5 basic differences between Asian and Caucasian hair .
1 ) Number of Cuticle Layers
Cuticles are the protective “ shingles ” that guard the inner protein structure of your hair .
Typical human hair has 5 to 10 layers of cuticles .
Asian hair has more ( closer to 10 ) than Caucasian ( which has closer to 5 ) .
Asian cuticles are also wider , thicker and more densely packed .
2 ) Flatness of Cuticles
On Asian hair , the cuticles are laid down with at a steeper angle .
Caucasian hair has flatter cuticles .
3 ) Distance Between Cuticles
The interval , or distance , between cuticle cells is narrower in Asian hair than in Caucasian hair .
4 ) How Hair Breaks
As Asian hair is stretched or pulled , the cuticles tend to break off in large pieces that keep their original shape .
On the other hand , the cuticles of Caucasian hair tend to break into smaller fragments and fall off .
In this sense , Caucasian cuticles are more fragile .
5 ) Why Hair Breaks
The cuticles of Asian hair tends to fall off because the adhesive that holds the cuticle cells together fails .
In Caucasian hair , the adhesive holds better but the cuticle cell itself starts to break first .
What does this all mean ?
For the first time , scientists have proven that Asian hair has a more solid structure than Caucasian hair .
This may account for the beautiful long , shiny look that so many Asian women are known for .
The Beauty Brains think it also suggests that Asians may need different hair care products than Caucasians .
One option is Phique hair care products .

THE REPUBLICAN NEMESIS
" FWIW , If the Democrats truly understood the information in this James Kroeger editorial , I have no doubt they would have taken both the White House and the Congress in 2004 .

December , 2004
W hen historians look back on the current era in American politics it will likely stand out as the period when Republican cunning & marketing savvy completely dominated the political landscape .
Obliging Democrats have thrown themselves into the fray with enthusiasm , armed with idealistic visions of civil ' discourse ' , only to be humbled repeatedly by their political masters .
Republican strategists have been able to blend their astute grasp of marketing principles , human nature , & social psychology into a formula that delivers almost guaranteed success at the polls .
While Democrats knock themselves out every election cycle trying to talk to Swing Voters about The Issues , Republicans have calmly focused their attention on winning The Image Campaign .
Quite simply : Democrats lose because they do n't understand what moves their target audience .
The Issues might actually be important to many Swing Voters early on in a political campaign , but when both sides start to pick apart each other 's facts and interpretations , the typical Swing Voter quickly becomes confused .
As the debate over The Issues drags on , Swing Voters realize that they do n't understand the details well enough to make an informed decision , so they end up relying on their impressions of the candidates .
Republican strategists see this clearly .
That is why they continuously try to create doubts in the minds of the Swing Voters about the character of the Democratic candidate .
They know that it does n't really matter if they can't find any real flaws in their Democratic opponents .
Accusations , insinuations , & innuendo will work just fine .
They hope to encourage voters to question the motivation and dependability of The Democrats .
They try to create the perception that Democrats are ' defective ' in a disturbing way .
By accusing , the Republicans implicitly suggest to Swing Voters that they are not defective like the people they are looking down on .
What was the non-existent ' defect ' in John Kerry 's character that Republicans alerted Swing Voters to this year ?
They claimed that he was an indecisive and shallow ' flip - flopper . '
Republican strategists know they would rarely win if election results were always determined by a logical discussion of The Issues and nothing more ( they know that most voters would benefit more from Democratic economic policies than from Republican policies ) .
They know they must win the Image Campaign to have any chance of winning .
That is why they are committed , now and forever , to negative campaigning .
Republicans have never forgotten a key stratagem they perfected during the Reagan Era : DEMONIZING YOUR OPPONENTS WORKS .
It works because Swing Voters are essentially ' headline readers ' and ' sound byte nibblers . '
When they see in the headlines that Candidate A accused Candidate B of having a certain personality defect , they tend to believe it .
( Unless it is effectively answered . )
The most important reason why negative campaigning has worked so well for the Republicans is because their negative attacks on the Democrats create a positive impression of Republican candidates , who appear --- in contrast --- to be individuals who do not possess the defects that they have accused others of having .
They define themselves [ positively ] by defining their Democratic opponents [ negatively ] .
On a visceral level , what the Republicans actually ' stand for ' in the minds of Swing Voters on election day is that they are not Democrats , those defective people who seem to have been born to ruin everything .
It 's simple , really .
By bashing Democrats , Republicans present themselves as the desirable alternative .
The negative character attacks also provide the Republicans with one more benefit .
They know that the media will give priority coverage to their personal attacks and that it will distract attention away from any of the " substance " blather that Democrats always like to talk about .
In order for Democrats to win back the Swing Voters they 've lost to the Republicans through these tactics , they are going to have to " define back . "
That does n't mean that we need to simply bash the Republicans at every opportunity ; that 's something we already do .
But for all of our arguing and complaining about the Republicans , we still tend to subordinate it to the ideals of " civil discourse . "
Unfortunately , that instinct is not enough to guide us ; not when the other side has become a master of The Image Campaign .
What Democrats need to do now is create an image of The Republican Politician that is threatening to Swing Voters , one that they will not ultimately want to identify with .
That kind of campaign strategy takes some sophistication of thought .
The Emotional Element
What is it that the Republicans do that enables them to manipulate the images of Republican vs. Democrats in the minds of Swing Voters ?
George Lakoff says that the Republicans are especially talented at choosing words & associations that work for them .
True as that may be , it becomes apparent with a little more reflection that it's not really the words or value - associations that matter so much ; it 's the emotions that are expressed when words are used .
How is it , after all , that the word liberal acquired the negative connotation that it has today ?
The Republicans created that negative connotation by repeatedly expressing scorn and derision whenever they used the word to describe their Democratic opponents .
They expressed disgust for anyone who would be foolish enough to be such a person .
( Whenever politicians express strongly felt emotions , Swing Voters tend to grant them a greater measure of authenticity .
After all , why else would they be so upset ? )
Think also of the times when Republicans laugh at Democrats .
They do n't just laugh in a way that shows they have a good sense of humor ; they laugh in a way that communicates their contempt for Democrats .
So it 's not the words we use , Democrats ; it 's the emotions we show when we use particular words .
Consider the phony outrage that Lynne & Dick Cheney expressed after the third debate .
At a time when it was crucial for Kerry to continue to build momentum after a solid debate performance , his advisors ended up losing the post - debate spin .
They lost it because they did n't understand how crucial Kerry 's response would be and they did n't understand how a candidate absolutely must respond to an Angry Outrage Performance if she wants to win .
The big story that Swing Voters saw on TV the next day ( those who did n't watch the debate ) was that the Cheneys were really angry that Kerry had called their daughter a lesbian on national TV .
What turned this into a home run for the Republicans was Kerry 's unfortunate response ; a written statement that sounded a lot like an apology .
The overall impression this gave to Swing Voters was that Kerry had apparently done some ' dirty politicking . '
Then , after the Cheneys apparently called him on it , he offered [ what sounded like ] a weak apology and then tried to change the subject .
Whenever Democratic candidates are the target of a Republican politician 's expressed anger , it is crucial that they respond properly if they want to win The Image Campaign .
Impressions formed during such confrontations are usually remembered on voting day .
John Kerry should have responded emotionally by calling for a televised press conference , and then using the spotlight to laugh at the Cheneys ' phony display of anger .
Laughter is the appropriate emotion for a candidate to feel and express when he is guilty of no wrongdoing whatsoever .
After laughing at the Cheneys , Kerry would then have been able to focus the media 's attention on the real story , which was / is the clever manipulations and deceptions that the Republicans always use to mislead voters .
Anyone remember what Karen Hughes did to Al Gore in 2000 with the same kind of expressions of emotion ( outrage , indignation ) ?
With this kind of response , Kerry would have told Swing Voters how they should respond to the reports they 're hearing .
( Human Nature 101 : people depend on you to tell them how to perceive you . )
Generating a ' rapid response ' does n't mean much if your response does n't communicate a message that will help your campaign .
Additionally , holding a press conference would have given Kerry an opportunity to enjoy the humor of the situation with the members of the media who were present ( it encourages the media to have a favorable impression of you as a candidate ) .
In his initial remarks to the press , he would have wanted to smile broadly , shake his head , and express mild but sincere amusement at the Cheneys ' performance .
Then , he would have wanted to review with good - humored stabs of ridicule the many times that the Cheneys had , themselves , mentioned their daughter 's lesbianism to the public .
After dismissing the phony outrage in this way , he should then have seized the opportunity to get on a soapbox and explain how this incident illustrates the great threat that The Cunning Republicans represent to the average American .
In a more serious tone , he could have taken the time to explain what the Cheneys were doing and why they were doing it ( & how it was a classic example of the conniving sort - of - thing that the Republicans always do to win elections ) .
He could have turned the whole episode into a complete disaster for the Republicans by focusing attention --- with first hand evidence --- on the characteristic duplicity of Republican politicians .
Swing Voters would have perceived that John Kerry appeared to be innocent of wrongdoing because he showed no fear in the face of the Cheneys ' anger .
They are then finally left with the image of Kerry earnestly warning them of a grave danger that they face .
Kerry &
The Democrats would have once again been presented to Swing Voters as their protectors & defenders from something that seriously threatens them .
Kerry 's advisors should have recognized that the overreaching Cheneys had actually given them a tremendous opportunity to further define the Republicans in the eyes of the Swing Voters as manipulative shysters whom they should fear .
There are other Image Campaign lessons to be learned from the 2004 election .
Consider the “ image bytes ” that swing voters saw when they watched nightly news reports on the President ’s campaign .
There was George Bush doing his standup comic routine , making jokes and laughing at Kerry & The Democrats , regaling his adoring fans .
This staging was intentional , meant to reinforce particular group images of The Democrats ( pathetic ) vs. The Republicans ( good ) .
On a subtle but important level , the Republicans are asking Swing Voters which group they ’d rather be associated with .
When people instinctively recognize that they have a choice of group affiliation , certain kinds of visuals begin to have an impact on them .
If they notice that one group is laughing at another group , their initial instinct is to disassociate themselves from the group that is being ridiculed .
The same kind of thing happens in politics .
Whenever Bush ’s hand - picked crowd applauded his ridicule of Kerry , it created an image of The Democrats in the minds of swing voters that was never effectively answered by the Kerry Campaign ( or by the Gore Campaign or by the Dukakis Campaign … ) .
In his own image - bytes , Kerry came across as something of a stern teacher .
This was actually not that bad of an idea , but it lacked some important emotional elements that would have established Kerry & The Democrats as the group that is superior to the Republican gang , the one that Swing Voters should want to be associated with .
Kerry could have presented himself as the wise teacher who has been forced to make fun of the smart - mouthed kid in front of the whole class because he proposed a truly foolish idea that , while superficially appealing , would have ended up hurting everyone in the long run .
Respect and Fear
Like it or not , the only way Democrats can win against the modern Republican Party is by defining them as a group that is [ morally ] defective and threatening .
( When the Bad Guys do this , we can accurately describe it as " demonizing " your opponent . )
Swing Voters will vote for the Democrat if they end up with an image of The Republican Politician that they find threatening .
Unlike the Republicans , we Democrats do not need to fabricate any Republican character flaws out of thin air in order to " define " them effectively .
We simply need to point out the truth .
Our goal should be to define The Republican Politician as a shrewd , cunning , deceiving , manipulative , mean - spirited , Con-Artist who willfully and gleefully assassinates the character of any innocent victim who stands in his way .
We need to describe them in this way with palpable emotion .
In terms of basic , overall strategy , Democrats need to constantly remind themselves that it's not the economy , stupid !
It 's the IMAGE CAMPAIGN !
Any time a Democratic candidate speaks out on an issue like the economy , or the environment , or foreign policy , final comments should be made that refer to the Republican politician as a scheming manipulator , a threatening deceiver .
We must make our logical points on the issues , but then we must always bring it back to the image of The Republicans that we are trying to establish , the scary image that reflects the truth of who they are .
From this perspective , we can see that Democrats have been showing far too much respect for Republican politicians .
If Democratic nominees always show respect for their Republican opponents , on some intuitive level voters will wonder why .
“ Well , if they really believe that Republican ideas & actions are worthy of respect , then why are the Democrats even running against them ?
Could it be that Democrats are actually not very authentic people ? ”
Swing Voters who have been voting Republican recently have come to see the Republicans as deserving respect partly because of the respect that Democratic politicians have shown them .
Of course , if you are meeting your opponent face - to - face at a debate , you will want to be courteous to show that you were “ brought up right . ”
But as soon as you find yourself addressing others again , you need to make it very clear — in moderate but detectable ways — that you do not respect your opponent because you do not respect her agenda or her methods .
Yes , show graciousness but feel condescension .
Be sure that you intently communicate your fear of the damage that these people can do to America .
In other words , Democratic nominees need to learn how to be openly “ two - faced . ”
It is a tactic that has worked well for the Republicans , one that we need to master , as well .
It is important that we model the disrespect that Swing Voters should be showing & feeling for Republican politicians .
Be superficially polite , but make sure that your fundamental lack of respect shows through .
Show your disrespect more conspicuously whenever you have an opportunity to address The Audience directly .
Yes , it ’s true that Swing Voters are likely to be turned off by a continuous exchange of angry charges and countercharges between the two parties , but the only other alternative for Democrats is to allow the Republicans to constantly savage them with impunity .
Democrats need to understand the importance of showing Swing Voters that they fear Republican rule .
The more apparent it is to Swing Voters that a lot of Americans are truly scared of George Bush & The Republicans , the more they ’re going to wonder if maybe they should also be afraid of him .
( Typically , we first learn to fear things that we did n’t fear previously after seeing fear in the faces of others . )
Some Democrats might think it would be better for us to emphasize our anger , but we need to be aware of the ways that this can backfire .
We do not want to be characterized as “ Angry People ” who are always angry [ in a threatening sort of way ] .
Voters need to see that behind our anger is a real fear for the well - being of the American People and for America ’s reputation around the world .
We should never be reluctant to show our fear of Bush , but we need to make it clear in our tone that our fear is appropriate and that our anger is controlled & justified .
Think of the many times when Republicans have accused Democrats of “ hating America ” or of “ hating George Bush . ”
They make this charge to evoke an image of people who are imagined to be inherently angry and who are therefore a threat to 'us normal people . '
Now think of how that image changes if — when we are accused of hating — we point out that people only hate that which they fear .
Whenever we are accused of hating the Republicans , we need to keep repeating to the media that no , it is fear that we feel .
It ’s our best defense .
We want the Swing Voters to see us as people who fear the Republicans , but we also want them to see that we are also brave enough to take on the threat .
Like the sergeant said to the private in the foxhole , “ Everyone ’s afraid , son .
But we ca n’t let that fear stop us .
We still have a mission to carry out . ”
We are afraid and angry .
We just know that we must oppose evil when we see it .
Verbalize fear .
Show courage .
In the final weeks of the 2004 campaign , many Democrats complained that the Republicans were using fear tactics to win the election .
It was kind of an odd criticism to be voicing , given that political campaigns have always been a contest between competing sets of fears throughout history .
Even when we are motivated by hope , the key emotion that inspires us to act with a sense of urgency is our fear of losing the thing we are hoping for .
Indeed , people are optimally motivated to support a political campaign when they are inspired by fear of a lost opportunity .
Yes , fear is the one emotion that is strong enough to motivate people to go out and vote who have never voted before .
( If your big thing is getting out the vote , keep this in mind . )
The ultimate truth of political competition is that Swing Voters always choose a particular candidate or party because they fear the consequences of having the other candidate / party in office , the one they did n’t vote for .
The problem with fear is not that politicians use it to inspire voters ; the problem is that some politicians create fears that are irrational or unjustified or exaggerated .
When such fears are used to intentionally mislead citizens into voting against their own best interests , then the use of fear is unethical .
In contrast , if the fear that politicians inspire is legitimate — and their intention is to alert voters to a danger that they can protect themselves from — then the use of fear is virtuous .
What Democrats need to understand clearly is that Swing Voters can be persuaded to fear either party .
Right now , too many of them fear The Democrats more than they fear The Republicans .
They will return to their identification with the Democratic Party only after they have been persuaded that it is The Republicans whom they ought to fear , not the Democrats .
It is the Republicans who are not like them , who are simply looking for yet another opportunity to play them for fools .

A lot of things mentioned here
By AltisThe Project ManagerRule # 1 : A project manager should visit everyone who is building anything for his project at least once , should know all the managers on his project ( both government and contractor ) , and know the integration team members .
People like to know that the project manager is interested in their work and the best proof is for the manager to visit them and see first hand what they are doing .
Rule # 2 : A project manager must know what motivates the project contractors ( i.e. , their award system , their fiscal system , their policies , and their company culture ) .
Rule # 3 : Management principles still are the same .
It is just that the tools have changed .
You still find the right people to do the work and get out of the way so they can do it .
Rule # 4 : Whoever you deal with , deal fairly .
Space is not a big playing field .
You may be surprised how often you have to work with the same people .
Better they respect you than carry a grudge .
Rule # 5 : Vicious , despicable , or thoroughly disliked persons , gentlemen , and ladies can be project managers .
Lost souls , procrastinators , and wishy - washies cannot .
Rule # 6 : A comfortable project manager is one waiting for his next assignment or one on the verge of failure .
Security is not normal to project management .
Rule # 7 : One problem new managers face is that everyone wants to solve their problems .
Old managers were told by senior management — " solve your own darn problems , that is what we hired you to do .
" Rule # 8 : Running fast does not take the place of thinking for yourself .
You must take time to smell the roses .
For your work , you must take time to understand the consequences of your actions .
Rule # 9 : The boss may not know how to do the work but he has to know what he wants .
The boss had better find out what he expects and wants if he does n't know .
A blind leader tends to go in circles .
Rule # 10 : Not all successful managers are competent and not all failed managers are incompetent .
Luck still plays a part in success or failure but luck favors the competent hard working manager .
Rule # 11 : Never try to get even for some slight by anyone on the project .
It is not good form and it puts you on the same level as the other person and , besides , probably ends up hurting the project getting done .
Rule # 12 : Do n't get too egotistical so that you can't change your position , especially if your personnel tell you that you are wrong .
You should cultivate an attitude on the project where your personnel know they can tell you of wrong decisions .
Rule # 13 : A manager who is his own systems engineer or financial manager is one who will probably try to do open heart surgery on himself .
Rule # 14 : Most managers succeed on the strength and skill of their staff .
Initial WorkRule # 15 :
The seeds of problems are laid down early .
Initial planning is the most vital part of a project .
The review of most failed projects or project problems indicate the disasters were well planned to happen from the start .
CommunicationsRule # 16 : Cooperative efforts require good communications and early warning systems .
A project manager should try to keep his partners aware of what is going on and should be the one who tells them first of any rumor or actual changes in plan .
The partners should be consulted before things are put in final form , even if they only have a small piece of the action .
A project manager who blindsides his partners will be treated in kind and will be considered a person of no integrity .
Rule # 17 : Talk is not cheap ; but the best way to understand a personnel or technical problem is to talk to the right people .
Lack of talk at the right levels is deadly .
Rule # 18 : Most international meetings are held in English .
This is a foreign language to most participants such as Americans , Germans , Italians , etc .
It is important to have adequate discussions so that there are no misinterpretations of what is said .
Rule # 19 :
You can not be ignorant of the language of the area you manage or with that of areas with which you interface .
Education is a must for the modern manager .
There are simple courses available to learn computerese , communicationese and all the rest of the modern " ese 's " of the world .
You can't manage if you do n't understand what is being said or written .
PeopleRule # 20 : You can not watch everything .
What you can watch is the people .
They have to know you will not accept a poor job .
Rule # 21 :
We have developed a set of people whose self interest is more paramount than the work or at least it appears so to older managers .
It appears to the older managers that the newer ones are more interested in form than in substance .
The question is are old managers right or just old ?
Consider both viewpoints .
Rule # 22 : A good technician , quality inspector , and straw boss are more important in obtaining a good product than all the paper and reviews .
Rule # 23 : The source of most problems is people , but darned if they will admit it .
Know the people working on your project to know what the real weak spots are .
Rule # 24 : One must pay close attention to workaholics — if they get going in the wrong direction , they can do a lot of damage in a short time .
It is possible to overload them and cause premature burnout but hard to determine if the load is too much , since much of it is self generated .
It is important to make sure such people take enough time off and that the workload does not exceed 1 1 / 4 to 1 1/2 times what is normal .
Rule # 25 : Always try to negotiate your internal support at the lowest level .
What you want is the support of the person doing the work , and the closer you can get to him in negotiations the better .
Rule # 26 :
If you have someone who does n't look , ask , and analyze ; ask them to transfer .
Rule # 27 : Personal time is very important .
You must be careful as a manager that you realize the value of other people 's time ( i.e. , the work you hand out and meetings should be necessary ) .
You must , where possible , shield your staff from unnecessary work ( i.e. , some requests should be ignored or a refusal sent to the requestor ) .
Rule # 28 : People who monitor work and do n't help get it done never seem to know exactly what is going on ( being involved is the key to excellence ) .
Rule # 29 :
There is no greater motivation than giving a good person his piece of the puzzle to control , but a pat on the back or an award helps .
Rule # 30 :
It is mainly the incompetent that do n't like to show off their work .
Rule # 31 :
There are rare times when only one man can do the job .
These are in technical areas that are more art and skill than normal .
Cherish these people , but get their work done as soon as possible .
Getting the work done by someone else takes two or three times longer and the product is normally below standard .
Rule # 32 : People have reasons for doing things the way they do them .
Most people want to do a good job and , if they do n't , the problem is they probably do n't know how or exactly what is expected .
Rule # 33 :
If you have a problem that requires additional people to solve , you should approach putting people on like a cook who has under - salted the food .
Reviews and ReportsRule # 34 : NASA has established a set of reviewers and a set of reviews .
Once firmly established , the system will fight to stay alive , so make the most of it .
Try to find a way for the reviews to work for you .
Rule # 35 : The number of reviews is increasing but the knowledge transfer remains the same ; therefore , all your charts and presentation material should be constructed with this fact in mind .
This means you should be able to construct a set of slides that only needs to be shuffled from presentation to presentation .
Rule # 36 : Hide nothing from the reviewers .
Their reputation and yours is on the line .
Expose all the warts and pimples .
Do n't offer excuses — just state facts .
Rule # 37 : External reviews are scheduled at the worst possible time , therefore , keep an up - to - date set of business and technical data so that you can rapidly respond .
Not having up - to - date data should be cause for dismissal .
Rule # 38 : Never undercut your staff in public ( i.e. , In public meetings , do n't reverse decisions on work that you have given them to do ) .
Even if you direct a change , never take the responsibility for implementing away from your staff .
Rule # 39 : Reviews are for the reviewed an not the reviewer .
The review is a failure if the reviewed learn nothing from it .
Rule # 40 : A working meeting has about six people attending .
Meetings larger than this are for information transfer ( management science has shown that , in a group greater than twelve , some are wasting their time ) .
Rule # 41 :
The amount of reviews and reports are proportional to management 's understanding ( i.e. , the less management knows or understands the activities , the more they require reviews and reports ) .
It is necessary in this type of environment to make sure that data is presented so that the average person , slightly familiar with activities , can understand it .
Keeping the data simple and clear never insults anyone 's intelligence .
Rule # 42 : Managers who rely only on the paperwork to do the reporting of activities are known failures .
Rule # 43 : Documentation does not take the place of knowledge .
There is a great difference in what is supposed to be , what is thought to have happened , and reality .
Documents are normally a static picture in time that get outdated rapidly .
Rule # 44 : Just because you give monthly reports , do n't think that you can abbreviate anything in a yearly report .
If management understood the monthlies , they would n't need a yearly .
Rule # 45 : Abbreviations are getting to be a pain .
Each project now has a few thousand .
This calls on senior management to know hundreds .
Use them sparingly in presentations unless your objective is to confuse .
Rule # 46 : Remember , it is often easier to do foolish paperwork that to fight the need for it .
Fight only if it is a global issue which will save much future work .
Contractors and ContractingRule # 47 : A project manager is not the monitor of the contractor 's work but is to be the driver .
In award fee situations , the government personnel should be making every effort possible to make sure the contractor gets a high score ( i.e. , be on schedule and produce good work ) .
Contractors do n't fail , NASA does and that is why one must be proactive in support .
This is also why a low score damages the government project manager as much as the contractor 's manager because it means that he is not getting the job done .
Rule # 48 : Award fee is a good tool that puts discipline both on the contractor and the government .
The score given represents the status of the project as well as the management skills of both parties .
The project management measurement system ( PMS ) should be used to verify the scores .
Consistent poor scores require senior management intervention to determine the reason .
Consistent good scores which are consistent with PMS reflect a well - run project , but if these scores are not consistent with the PMS , senior management must take action to find out why .
Rule # 49 : Morale of the contractor 's personnel is important to a government manager .
Just as you do n't want to buy a car built by disgruntled employees , you do n't want to buy flight hardware developed by under - motivated people .
You should take an active role in motivating all personnel on the project .
Rule # 50 : Being friendly with a contractor is fine — being a friend of a contractor is dangerous to your objectivity .
Rule # 51 : Remember , your contractor has a tendency to have a one - on - one interface with your staff .
Every member of your staff costs you at least one person on the contract per year .
Rule # 52 : Contractors tend to size up the government counterparts and staff their part of the project accordingly .
If they think yours are clunkers , they will take their poorer people to put on your project .
Rule # 53 : Contractors respond well to the customer that pays attention to what they are doing but not too well to the customer that continually second - guesses their activity .
The basic rule is a customer is always right but the cost will escalate if a customer always has things done his way instead of how the contractor planned on doing it .
The ground rule is : never change a contractor 's plans unless they are flawed or too costly ( i.e. , the old saying that better is the enemy of good ) .
Rule # 54 :
There is only one solution to a weak project manager in industry — get rid of him fast .
The main job of a project manager in industry is to keep the customer happy .
Make sure the one working with you knows that it is not flattery but on - schedule , on - cost , and a good product that makes you happy .
Engineers and ScientistsRule # 55 : Over-engineering is common .
Engineers like puzzles and mazes .
Try to make them keep their designs simple .
Rule # 56 : The first sign of trouble comes from the schedule or the cost curve .
Engineers are the last to know they are in trouble .
Engineers are born optimists .
Rule # 57 : The project has many resources within itself .
There probably are five or ten system engineers considering all the contractors and instrument developers .
This is a powerful resource that can be used to attack problems .
Rule # 58 : Many managers , just because they have the scientists under contract on their project , forget that the scientists are their customers and many times have easier access to top management than the managers do .
Rule # 59 : Most scientists are rational unless you endanger their chance to do their experiment .
They will work with you if they believe you are telling them the truth .
This includes reducing their own plans .
HardwareRule # 60 :
In the space business , there is no such thing as previously flown hardware .
The people who build the next unit probably never saw the previous unit .
There are probably minor changes ( perhaps even major changes ) ; the operational environment has probably changed ; the people who check the unit out in most cases will not understand the unit or the test equipment .
Rule # 61 : Most equipment works as built , not as the designer planned .
This is due to layout of the design , poor understanding on the designer 's part , or poor understanding of component specifications .
Computers and SoftwareRule # 62 :
Not using modern techniques , like computer systems , is a great mistake , but forgetting that the computer simulates thinking is a still greater mistake .
Rule # 63 : Software has now taken on all the parameters of hardware ( i.e. , requirement creep , high percentage of flight mission cost , need for quality control , need for validation procedures , etc. ) .
It has the added feature that it is hard as blazes to determine it is not flawed .
Get the basic system working first and then add the bells and whistles .
Never throw away a version that works even if you have all the confidence in the world that the newer version works .
It is necessary to have contingency plans for software .
Rule # 64 : Knowledge is often revised by simulations or testing , but computer models have hidden flaws not the least of which is poor input data .
Rule # 65 :
In olden times , engineers had hands - on experience , technicians understood how the electronics worked and what it was supposed to do , and layout technicians knew too — but today only the computer knows for sure and it's not talking .
Senior Management , Program Offices , and AboveRule # 66 : Do n't assume you know why senior management has done something .
If you feel you need to know , ask .
You get some amazing answers that will astonish you .
Rule # 67 : Know your management — some like a good joke , others only like a joke if they tell it .
Rule # 68 : Remember the boss has the right to make decisions .
Even if you think they are wrong , tell the boss what you think but if he still wants it done his way ; do it his way and do your best to make sure the outcome is successful .
Rule # 69 : Never ask management to make a decision that you can make .
Assume you have the authority to make decisions unless you know there is a document that states unequivocally that you can 't .
Rule # 70 : You and the Program Manager should work as a team .
The Program Manager is your advocate at NASA HQ and must be tied into the decision makers and should aid your efforts to be tied in also .
Rule # 71 : Know who the decision makers on the program are .
It may be someone outside who has the ear of Congress or the Administrator , or the Associate Administrator , or one of the scientists — someone in the chain of command — whoever they are .
Try to get a line of communication to them on a formal or informal basis .
Program Planning , Budgeting , and EstimatingRule # 72 : Today one must push the state of the art , be within budget , take risks , not fail , and be on time .
Strangely , all these are consistent as long as the ground rules such as funding profile and schedule are established up front and maintained .
Rule # 73 : Most of yesteryear 's projects overran because of poor estimates and not because of mistakes .
Getting better estimates will not lower costs but will improve NASA 's business reputation .
Actually , there is a high probability that getting better estimates will increase costs and assure a higher profit to industry unless the fee is reduced to reflect lower risk on the part of industry .
A better reputation is necessary in the present environment .
Rule # 74 :
All problems are solvable in time , so make sure you have enough schedule contingency — if you do n't , the next project manager that takes your place will .
Rule # 75 : The old NASA pushed the limits of technology and science ; therefore , it did not worry about requirements creep or overruns .
The new NASA has to work as if all projects are fixed price ; therefore , requirement creep has become a deadly sin .
Rule # 76 : Know the resources of your center and , if possible , other centers .
Other centers , if they have the resources , are normally happy to help .
It is always surprising how much good help one can get by just asking .
Rule # 77 : Other than budget information prior to the President 's submittal to Congress , there is probably no secret information on a project — so do n't treat anything like it is secret .
Everyone does better if they can see the whole picture so do n't hide any of it from anyone .
Rule # 78 : NASA programs compete for budget funds — they do not compete with each other ( i.e. , you never attack any other program or NASA work with the idea that you should get their funding ) .
Sell what you have on its own merit .
Rule # 79 : Next year is always the year with adequate funding and schedule .
Next year arrives on the 50th year of your career .
The CustomerRule # 80 : Remember who the customer is and what his objectives are ( i.e. , check with him when you go to change anything of significance ) .
NASA Management InstructionsRule # 81 : NASA Management Instructions were written by another NASA employee like you ; therefore , challenge them if they do n't make sense .
It is possible another NASA employee will rewrite them or waive them for you .
Decision MakingRule # 82 : Wrong decisions made early can be recovered from .
Right decisions made late cannot correct them .
Rule # 83 : Sometimes the best thing to do is nothing .
It is also occasionally the best help you can give .
Just listening is all that is needed on many occasions .
You may be the boss , but if you constantly have to solve someone 's problems , you are working for him .
Rule # 84 : Never make a decision from a cartoon .
Look at the actual hardware or what real information is available such as layouts .
Too much time is wasted by people trying to cure a cartoon whose function is to explain the principle .
Professional Ethics and IntegrityRule # 85 : Integrity means your subordinates trust you .
Rule # 86 : In the rush to get things done , it 's always important to remember who you work for .
Blindsiding the boss will not be to your benefit in the long run .
Project Management and TeamworkRule # 87 : Projects require teamwork to succeed .
Remember , most teams have a coach and not a boss , but the coach still has to call some of the plays .
Rule # 88 : Never assume someone knows something or has done something unless you have asked them ; even the obvious is overlooked or ignored on occasion , especially in a high stress activity .
Rule # 89 : Whoever said beggars can't be choosers does n't understand project management , although many times it is better to trust to luck than to get poor support .
Rule # 90 : A puzzle is hard to discern from just one piece ; so do n't be surprised if team members deprived of information reach the wrong conclusion .
Rule # 91 : Remember , the President , Congress , OMB , NASA HQ , senior center management , and your customers all have jobs to do .
All you have to do is keep them all happy .
Treating and Avoiding FailuresRule # 92 :
In case of a failure : a)
Make a timeline of events and include everything that is known .b)
Put down known facts .
Check every theory against them . c )
Do n't beat the data until it confesses ( i.e. , know when to stop trying to force - fit a scenario ) .d )
Do not arrive at a conclusion too fast .
Make sure any deviation from normal is explained .
Remember the wrong conclusion is prologue to the next failure .e)
Know when to stop .
Rule # 93 : Things that fail are lessons learned for the future .
Occasionally things go right : these are also lessons learned .
Try to duplicate that which works .
Rule # 94 : Mistakes are all right but failure is not .
Failure is just a mistake you can't recover from ; therefore , try to create contingency plans and alternate approaches for the items or plans that have high risk .
Rule # 95 : History is prologue .
There has not been a project yet that has not had a parts problem despite all the qualification and testing done on parts .
Time and being prepared to react are the only safeguards .
Rule # 96 : Experience may be fine but testing is better .
Knowing something will work never takes the place of proving that it will .
Rule # 97 : Do n't be afraid to fail or you will not succeed , but always work at your skill to recover .
Part of that skill is knowing who can help .
Rule # 98 : One of the advantages of NASA in the early days was the fact that everyone knew that the facts we were absolutely sure of could be wrong .
Rule # 99 : Redundancy in hardware can be a fiction .
We are adept at building things to be identical so that if one fails , the other will also fail .
Make sure all hardware is treated in a build as if it were one of a kind and needed for mission success .
Rule # 100 : Never make excuses ; instead , present plans of actions to be taken .
This is dedicated to all things I like or deem interesting , such as
As well as things I disagree with , distrust or just plain do n't like .
There is only one persons opinion that matters here .
That 's me , Goober McGee .
I 'm a Windows guy , I 've always been a Windows guy .
Windows today is more stable than ever .
Seems now would be the best time of all to be a Windows guy .
Slowly but surely though , I 'm becoming a Linux guy .
Truth is , I was always a Microsoft guy , and that simply included Windows along with all of their development products .
I used to be a hardware / network technician .
I 'd setup and maintain networks for medium to small businesses .
Windows was always the way to go here , it 's what the users were accustomed to and expected .
I 'd usually setup a Windows NT server and from a dozen to maybe 30 client computers running various version of Windows including NT workstation .
So Windows was just something I was always familiar with .
Even back then , I had the occasional urge to try other things .
One of my first experiences with Linux involved using it as a firewall for a windows network on some cheap throwaway hardware that was n't good for much else .
But it always seemed a pain to use , and I did n't really understand it , despite having it working quite well for what I intended .
I just did n't see the point of not having a nice GUI and using cryptic commands to do everything .
Later , I learned to program in VBScript and VB using ASP and SQL .
I became a web developer and abandoned the hardware gig .
Software was so much more interesting .
ASP became ASP.net , and VB became C# when I realized how crappy a language VB actually was .
What made me want to change was my discovery of the original Wiki .
I found a place where real programmers hung out and discussed anything and everything .
I realized the world was bigger than VB .
VB .
Net fixed many of the issues with VB and is pretty much equivalent to C# in all but one area ... culture .
What I really was abandoning was the VB culture .
I 'd outgrown it , I wanted to be involved in a culture that cared more about programming well .
The VB culture is dominated by amateur programmers that are just happy to get something working , they tend to care very little about things like architecture , or patterns , or the aesthetics of good code .
They do n't think of themselves as amateurs , many of them consider themselves experts , but start talking about object oriented programming or functional programming and the confused looks on their faces tells you they 've not really looked into such things very deeply .
Many think simply using classes makes code object oriented .
I was still firmly in the Microsoft camp at this point , though my change to C# had opened my eyes to Java , and more importantly object oriented programming .
It was the Wiki that introduced me to Smalltalk .
I just could n't help but notice how much Smalltalk was referenced whenever object oriented programming was discussed , nor how many famous authors credentials included a Smalltalk background .
I decided I had to check out this Smalltalk thing .
Now , at the same time , I was checking out the Lisp thing as well , but that 's not relevant to this story .
So I 'm a web developer , my seeking tends to be guided by the need to make my job easier , to find better ways to automate myself .
Obviously , I discovered Seaside .
Seaside got me into a non Microsoft language .
Around the same time , a buddy of mine who I 'd met on the Wiki suggested cygwin .
I 'd been talking about wanting to learn a little more about Linux and he said I could do so without leaving Windows by using a better shell .
Cygwin was the beginning of the end for Windows .
I started finding reasons to grep , cat , sed , sort , uniq .
This was pretty cool , I was still in Windows but had a Linux command line and the shell became a bigger part of my toolbox .
Now I find myself using a non Microsoft programming language , and having discovered PostgreSQL , a non Microsoft database .
And now bash for my shell .
Hmm ...
So now I 'm still hosting my apps on Windows servers , but I keep having problems crop up .
I recently did a write up on Scaling Seaside which included a bash script for making sure the Seaside services were always up and running .
Problem is , turns out the only thing making my Seaside services seem to die , was the bash script itself .
Somehow lynx gums up Windows after a certain period of time and Windows starts having random network errors .
I 've taken the script down and now have another one running that uses wget and simply notifies me should any site I 'm monitoring go down , or come back up .
So I find myself using all open source non Microsoft tools for everything except for the server 's operating system .
Having become quite comfortable on the command line , it finally hit me , stop screwing with all these problems on Windows and try Linux again .
Setting up new Seaside services on Windows is a multi step pain in the but .
I 'd thought I 'd give a Linux a try and see how far it 's come since the last time I tried it .
Boy was I surprised .
In the next post I 'll detail my experience setting up a Linux server for hosting Seaside .
Erlang and the Great Computer Language Shootout
Brief Adventures Optimizing Code in a Very High Level Language
James Hague October 23 - 28 , 2002 james.hague@gmail.com
Doug Bagley 's Great Computer Language Shootout is a neat idea : a collection of little benchmarks written in several dozen languages for the purposes of comparing speed , memory usage , and lines of code .
The concurrent functional language Erlang was n't doing well in the rankings , so I decided to try to improve the Erlang benchmark performance .
Now micro- benchmarks can be misleading or even worthless .
Why bother computing the primes between 2 and 8192 ?
We already know what they are !
And is n't the point to write clean code , and not to trade increased performance for complexity and obscurity ?
The " clean code " aspect is what made this interesting for me .
Some of the programs written in other very high level languages did n't look at all like they would if the author were presenting them in an introductory textbook .
A pretty version of the code might use higher order functions , for example , but the speed - is - everything code uses unchecked array types and a programming style that makes ML look like C .
To me , the point of higher level languages is to leave as much to the computer as possible .
Dynamic typing ?
You bet .
Garbage collection ?
Definitely .
No worrying about how to represent an integer , even if that integer is too large to fit in a 32 - bit word ?
Exactly .
So I do n't see it as a failing that Erlang is n't in the top spot .
I see it as an amazing achievement that such an expressive language fares so well .
The following notes are about how I approached some of the benchmarks .
Not all of these improvements have been submitted to the shootout yet .
Note that Doug stopped maintaining his version of the shootout , but new version lives on .
Array Access Benchmark
This program did n't exist in Erlang , so I wrote one .
Array handling is one of the weaker aspects of the current Erlang implementation .
Tuples can be indexed and updated like arrays , but the updating is not in place .
Changing element 50 of a 1,000,000 element tuple results in a new 1,000,000 element tuple .
I suspect this is why no one attempted the array access benchmark in Erlang .
My first attempt was to use the process dictionary , which is just a hash table .
The benchmark uses two arrays , x and y , so I chose to represent an array element as {x, 5} , for example .
This put the benchmark on the map , but unfortunately the performance was down at the bottom of the list with TCL .
The benchmark works like this : fill array x with integers , fill array y with zeroes , then add array x to array y one element at a time .
Using the process dictionary , the array addition step required three hashes per element : one to read a value from x , one to read a value from y , and one to write the sum back into y .
By switching from the process dictionary to an Erlang Term Storage ( ETS ) table , I was able to use the ets:update_counter function to reduce this to two hashes per element .
This resulted in a 30 % speedup , moving Erlang up past Ruby and a few other languages .
Finally , I noticed that the x array was never updated after being initialized .
If it were a tuple , then it could be indexed directly with element / 2 , dropping to only one hash per element .
This reduced the y = y + x loop to :
calc( X , 0 ) -> ok ; calc ( X , N ) -> ets:update_counter(y , N , element ( N , X ) ) , calc ( X , N - 1 ) .
I waffled a bit over whether or not this met the spirit of the benchmark , but I think it does .
The critical portion of the benchmark , the above loop , is implemented with indexing , not using lists .
This version took only 1/3 the execution time of the original , putting Erlang ahead of Guile , Perl , Icon , and Python , which is respectable for a language with poor array handling .
Hash Access Benchmark
This is an odd benchmark , in that half of the program is a format_hex function , and there are list_to_atom calls in both loops .
It took me a while realize that the list_to_atom calls were only there because an atom is presumably the closest analog to a hash key in languages like Perl .
But in Erlang you can use any data object as the key for an ETS table .
It 's faster to use a list like " 1234 " as a key directly , than it is to convert it to the atom ' 1234 ' first , at least in this benchmark .
Getting rid of all the atom construction sped up the program by 400 % !
Hashes , Part II
The key to this benchmark turned out to be , surprisingly , the following expression :
lists : append ( " foo_ " , integer_to_list ( I ) )
lists : append , if you peek into the lists module , is simply defined as :
append ( L1 , L2 ) -> L1 ++ L2 .
This is because the " ++ " operator was a later addition to the language .
The first expression above can be written directly as :
" foo_ " ++ integer_to_list ( I )
Though I would n't have guessed it , switching to the latter version significantly speeds up the program .
In addition to avoiding an inter - module function call , I can only assume that the compiler generates special code to handle appending to a constant list .
Sieve of Erathostenes
This is a particularly interesting benchmark in a functional language , because it is written using lists rather than an array of booleans .
Instead of marking all multiples of a number as not prime in an array , a new list is created which simply does not contain those multiples .
Not surprisingly , all of the heavy list rewriting makes this benchmark very dependent on the speed of memory management and garbage collection .
Other than removing a bit of unnecessary consing , I initially did n't make much progress on speeding this benchmark up .
Even some cheating , like just counting primes instead of building a list of them and getting the length of that list at the end , did n't make a noticeable difference .
Neither did caching the initial list of 8191 values between iterations .
Run times varied widely , too .
A neat realization , though , was that the six line sieve function which removes all multiples of a number from a list , can be replaced with a concise list comprehension :
The Bedlam Bards are Browncoats !
Recorded in a studio that resembles the bridge of Serenity -- right down to the plastic dinosaurs -- the Bedlam Bards ' third album , On the Drift , is a musical expression of our enthusiastic support of the Browncoat revolution .
Buy it now , from cdbaby !
For those who do n't know , a " Browncoat " is a fan of the short - lived but much - loved television show Firefly and the movie that grew out of it , Serenity , both created by Joss Whedon , the mind behind such media hits as Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Angel , and Toy Story .
Now , usually we do n’t get passionate about TV shows .
Not that passionate anyway .
But Firefly was different .
Never before has a show so witty , so insightful , so rich been mistreated so grossly by a network , and then cancelled out of hand .
As independent musicians , we got angry about it -- as did thousands of other fans around the world .
But in our case , something strange happened .
Cedric 's muse became a Browncoat .
Over the course of one summer , he started writing songs about the show , the fans , the phenomenon , and ultimately the movie .
These songs have been collected on an album titled On the Drift ( release date January 2006 ) .
One of the amazing things about Firefly and Serenity is the grassroots , guerrilla marketing efforts that the fans have undertaken .
To do our part in that effort , the Bedlam Bards released two of our Firefly songs as FREE MP3 - Postcards , which you can check out at the links below :
Both songs reached thousands of listeners on the Internet .
( " The Ballad of Joss " had two thousand in its first two weeks ; " Big Damn Trilogy " had ten thousand in the same amount of time . )
We 'd like to think that these songs were a part of the massive fan - based effort that brought Serenity in as the number two movie on its opening weekend , despite running in a relatively small number of theaters .
Hear more of On the Drift
Read the lyrics of these songs
As a result of having written these songs , the Bedlam Bards have traveled around the country , performing for Firefly fans ( also called " flans " ) at Dragon * Con and the Houston Browncoat Serenity Premier Shindig , to name a few spots .
We were interviewed about the album on The Signal , the world ’s top Firefly / Serenity podcast .
Also , our music is featured in Done the Impossible , a documentary about Firefly fans .
We 're looking forward to playing for many more Shindigs .
( To inquire about having the Bedlam Bards at your Shindig or sci - fi convention , click book the bards . )
One thing we 've found during our journeys is that Browncoats help each other out , and the cover of On the Drift is a good example .
Out of the blue , a BedHead named Joshua Horner designed it and sent it to us .
Ain't it shiny ?
Another great thing about Firefly fans is that around the world , they 've stepped up to raise money for various charities , especially those championed by the show 's creator and stars .
The Bedlam Bards have often contributed CDs to those fundraising efforts , but we also have decided to donate a portion of the proceeds from On the Drift to Equality Now , Joss Whedon 's favorite charity .
For those not familiar with it , Equality Now works on a global scale to combat gender discrimination ; it is a noble organization in the finest sense of the word .
We 're proud to do what we can to support it .

Finally , we 'd like to say thanks to all those Browncoats around the world who have encouraged us by posting our lyrics to their blogs and discussion groups , praising our songs online , forwarding the MP3s to their friends , playing the songs on their podcasts , organizing group - singing of " The Ballad of Joss " at advance Serenity screenings , emailing us with kind words , attending our performances , and holding riots on our account .
Thank you and xie-xie .

Waxman to former Bush Chief : You 'll talk on the Daily Show , but not to me ?
Michael Roston
Published : Friday April 20 , 2007 Print This Email This Rep. Henry Waxman announced today that he 'll consider issuing four subpoenas in a meeting this coming Wednesday , April 25 .
In a letter to one subpoena target , the Oversight Committee Chairman complained that a former White House Chief of Staff appeared on Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , but has so far refused to testify before his committee .
" On April 16,2007 , you appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and discussed the leak of [ former covert CIA Agent Valerie Plame ] Wilson 's identity , " Waxman ( D - CA ) wrote to Andrew Card , the former White House Chief of Staff .
" [ White House Counel Fred ]
Fielding 's position appears to be that it is appropriate for you to discuss these matters on The Daily Show , but not before a congressional committee .
You will not be surprised to learn that I take a different view of this matter . "
Card served as Bush 's chief of staff from the President 's inauguration until April 2006 .
In March , Waxman sought " an on - the - record interview regarding the disclosure of Ms. Wilson 's covert identity and the White House procedures for handling classified information , " with Card .
But the White House Counsel rejected the request because " former senior White House officials such as the Chief of Staff to the President have historically not been available to Congress to testify , or to be interviewed , about their activities in serving the President , " according to the Congressman 's letter .
The leak of Plame 's identity came up on Card 's show on Monday night .
" It was [ former Deputy Secretary of State Richard ]
Armitage who was the one gave Bob Novak the name , " Card told Stewart when asked about the Plame leak .
" I do n't think people at the White House knew the name , I do n't think we knew her name . "
Stewart then joked that Card was going back into " the mode " and suggested he should move away from " the dark side . "
Card insisted he was telling the truth .
[ Card 's full appearance can be watched below . ]
Waxman also intended to discuss three more subpoenas on Wednesday .
First , the chairman intended to once again mull a subpoena for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
The California Democrat had threatened to issue a subpoena on Wednesday , but delayed the meeting as he sought to secure a promise from Rice to testify before Memorial Day on the intelligence used to build the case for the Iraq War .
RAW STORY was still waiting to hear from committee staff on whether including Rice on the agenda for April 25 meant she had rejected the congressman 's request .
Waxman also was prepared to discuss two additional subpoenas .
One would be directed to the Republican National Committee for " documents relating to possible violations of the Presidential Records Act and the Hatch Act by White House officials , " relating to e-mail accounts supplied by the RNC and used by White House staff like Karl Rove .
The other subpoena would be directed to " the Executive Office of the President for contracts and contacts between the White House and MZM .
Inc. . " MZM was involved in the public corruption case against former Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham ( R - CA ) .
Waxman 's letters can be accessed at the Oversight and Government Reform Committee 's website .
A clip from Card 's appearance on The Daily Show available at Comedy Central 's Motherload website can be viewed below . #
Summary :
In most online communities , 90 % of users are lurkers who never contribute , 9 % of users contribute a little , and 1 % of users account for almost all the action .
All large - scale , multi-user communities and online social networks that rely on users to contribute content or build services share one property : most users do n't participate very much .
Often , they simply lurk in the background .
In contrast , a tiny minority of users usually accounts for a disproportionately large amount of the content and other system activity .
This phenomenon of participation inequality was first studied in depth by Will Hill in the early '90s , when he worked down the hall from me at Bell Communications Research .
When you plot the amount of activity for each user , the result is a Zipf curve , which shows as a straight line in a log - log diagram .
User participation often more or less follows a 90 – 9 – 1 rule :
90 % of users are lurkers ( i.e. , read or observe , but do n't contribute ) .
of users are ( i.e. , read or observe , but do n't contribute ) .
9 % of users contribute from time to time , but other priorities dominate their time .
of users contribute , but other priorities dominate their time .
1 % of users participate a lot and account for most contributions : it can seem as if they do n't have lives because they often post just minutes after whatever event they 're commenting on occurs .
Early Inequality Research
Before the web , researchers documented participation inequality in media such as Usenet newsgroups , CompuServe bulletin boards , Internet mailing lists , and internal discussion boards in big companies .
A study of more than 2 million messages on Usenet found that 27 % of the postings were from people who posted only a single message .
Conversely , the most active 3 % of posters contributed 25 % of the messages .
In Whittaker et al . 's Usenet study , a randomly selected posting was equally likely to come from one of the 580,000 low - frequency contributors or one of the 19,000 high - frequency contributors .
Obviously , if you want to assess the " feelings of the community " it 's highly unfair if one subgroup 's 19,000 members have the same representation as another subgroup 's 580,000 members .
More importantly , such inequities would give you a biased understanding of the community , because many differences almost certainly exist between people who post a lot and those who post a little .
And you would never hear from the silent majority of lurkers .
Inequality on the Web
There are about 1.1 billion Internet users , yet only 55 million users ( 5 % ) have weblogs according to Technorati .
Worse , in 2006 there are only 1.6 million postings per day ; because some people post multiple times per day , only 0.1 % of users post daily .
Blogs have even worse participation inequality than is evident in the 90 – 9 –1 rule that characterizes most online communities .
With blogs , the rule is more like 95 – 5 – 0.1 .
Inequalities are also found on Wikipedia , where more than 99 % of users are lurkers .
According to Wikipedia's " about " page , it has only 68,000 active contributors , which is 0.2 % of the 32 million unique visitors it has in the U.S. alone .
Wikipedia 's most active 1,000 people — 0.003 % of its users — contribute about two - thirds of the site 's edits .
Wikipedia is thus even more skewed than blogs , with a 99.8 –0.2–0.003 rule .
Participation inequality exists in many places on the web .
A quick glance at Amazon.com , for example , showed that the site had sold thousands of copies of a book that had only 12 reviews , meaning that less than 1 % of customers contribute reviews .
Furthermore , at the time I wrote this , 167,113 of Amazons book reviews were contributed by just a few " top - 100 " reviewers ; the most prolific reviewer had written 12,423 reviews .
How anybody can write that many reviews — let alone read that many books — is beyond me , but it 's a classic example of participation inequality .
Downsides of Participation Inequality
Participation inequality is not necessarily unfair because some users are more equal than others , to misquote Animal Farm .
If lurkers want to contribute , they are usually allowed to do so .
The problem is that the overall system is not representative of average web users .
On any given user - participation site , you almost always hear from the same 1 % of users , who almost certainly differ from the 90 % you never hear from .
This can cause trouble for several reasons :
Customer feedback .
If your company looks to Web postings for customer feedback on its products and services , you 're getting an unrepresentative sample .

Reviews .
Similarly , if you 're a consumer trying to find out which restaurant to patronize or what books to buy , online reviews represent only a tiny minority of the people who have experiences with those products and services .

Politics .
If a party nominates a candidate supported by the " netroots , " it will almost certainly lose because such candidates ' positions will be too extreme to appeal to mainstream voters .
Postings on political blogs come from less than 0.1 % of voters , most of whom are hardcore leftists ( for Democrats ) or rightists ( for Republicans ) .

Search .
Search engine results pages ( SERP ) are mainly sorted based on how many other sites link to each destination .
When 0.1 % of users do most of the linking , we risk having search relevance get ever more out of whack with what 's useful for the remaining 99.9 % of users .
Search engines need to rely more on behavioral data gathered across samples that better represent users , which is why they are building internet access services .

Skewed Lurker–Contributor Ratio for Non-Profit Social Network
( Update 2009 ) The " Causes " application on Facebook had 25 million users in April 2009 , but only 185,000 had given a donation , even though the application offers the ability to give to 179,000 different non-profit organizations .
( This according to the Washington Post . )
Thus , social networking for charity fundraising has a 99.3 % lurkers and 0.7 % contributors rule — even more skewed than the other participation inequalities we have seen .
The data does n't say how many of the 0.7 % of users who donated have been frequent contributors , but most likely it 's less than 1/10 , meaning that the full rule would look something like 99 – 1 –0 ( when rounded to the nearest integer ) .
This finding comes as no big surprise , for 3 reasons :
Despite the hype , Facebook is just another form of collaborative environment , meaning that long - established laws for online communities should hold .
Maybe with small modifications , but the basics are due to human nature and do n't change when moving to a new platform .
Donating money is a stronger form of action than simply writing user - contributed content , so it makes sense that this form of contribution would have extremely strong participation inequality .
If we measured the amount of money donated and not just a binary give / not - give distinction , the skew would likely be even more extreme .
Our research on the user experience of donating to charities online found that most non-profits do n't provide the information users want before they 're willing to be separated from their money .
( Or the info is n't shown in a sufficiently web - oriented manner . )
How to Overcome Participation Inequality
You can't .
The first step to dealing with participation inequality is to recognize that it will always be with us .
It 's existed in every online community and multi-user service that has ever been studied .
Your only real choice here is in how you shape the inequality curve 's angle .
Are you going to have the usual 90 – 9 – 1 distribution , or the more radical 99 – 1 – 0.1 distribution common in some social websites ?
Can you achieve a more equitable distribution of , say , 80 – 16 –4 ?
( That is , only 80 % lurkers , with 16 % contributing some and 4 % contributing the most . )
Although participation will always be somewhat unequal , there are ways to better equalize it , including :
Make it easier to contribute .
The lower the barrier , the more people will jump through the hoop .
For example , Netflix lets users rate movies by clicking a star rating , which is much easier than writing a natural - language review .

Make participation a side effect .
Even better , let users participate with zero effort by making their contributions a side effect of something else they 're doing .
For example , Amazon 's " people who bought this book , bought these other books " recommendations are a side effect of people buying books .
You do n't have to do anything special to have your book preferences entered into the system .

Hill coined the term read wear for this type of effect : the simple activity of reading ( or using ) something will " wear " it down and thus leave its marks — just like a cookbook will automatically fall open to the recipe you prepare the most .

Edit , do n't create .
Let users build their contributions by modifying existing templates rather than creating complete entities from scratch .
Editing a template is more enticing and has a gentler learning curve than facing the horror of a blank page .
In avatar - based systems like Second Life , for example , most users modify standard - issue avatars rather than create their own .

Reward — but do n't over - reward — participants .
Rewarding people for contributing will help motivate users who have lives outside the Internet , and thus will broaden your participant base .
Although money is always good , you can also give contributors preferential treatment ( such as discounts or advance notice of new stuff ) , or even just put gold stars on their profiles .
But do n't give too much to the most active participants , or you 'll simply encourage them to dominate the system even more .

Promote quality contributors .
If you display all contributions equally , then people who post only when they have something important to say will be drowned out by the torrent of material from the hyperactive 1 % .
Instead , give extra prominence to good contributions and to contributions from people who 've proven their value , as indicated by their reputation ranking .
Your website 's design undoubtedly influences participation inequality for better or worse .
Being aware of the problem is the first step to alleviating it , and finding ways to broaden participation will become even more important as the web 's social networking services continue to grow .

At a press conference at NATO Headquarters in Brussels in June 2002 , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously said : " Now what is the message there ?
The message is that there are no ' knowns . '
There are things we know that we know .
There are known unknowns .
That is to say there are things that we now know we do n't know .
But there are also unknown unknowns .
There are things we do n't know we do n't know .
So when we do the best we can and we pull all this information together , and we then say well that 's basically what we see as the situation , that is really only the known knowns and the known unknowns .
And each year , we discover a few more of those unknown unknowns . "
Strangely enough , Rumsfeld 's own career , which catches so much of the political history that has led us into our present catastrophe , qualifies -- or at least did until today -- as either a " known unknown " or even one of those mystifying " unknown unknowns . "
Every now and then , we need a little history to make sense of our world .
But perhaps , in this case , " little " is n't the most appropriate word .
Roger Morris , a member of the National Security Council under Presidents Johnson and Nixon ( he resigned in protest over the invasion of Cambodia ) and bestselling author of biographies of Richard Nixon , Henry Kissinger , and the Clintons , explores both the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns of Donald Rumsfeld 's emblematic history and legacy , of his long march to power , and what he did with that power once it was in his hands .
Morris ' two - parter on Rumsfeld 's legacy will be posted this week at Tomdispatch.com and , long as it is , it is actually a miracle of historical compression , packing into a relatively modest space an epic history none of us should avoid .
Call it a necessary reckoning with disaster .
Donald Rumsfeld himself may be front and center , but the supporting cast of rogues -- Dick Cheney , George Bush , Paul Wolfowitz , Douglas Feith , Robert Gates , and so many others -- makes this a summary meditation on some of the most costly lessons of our times .
As a prophet , Rumsfeld may not have been exactly Delphic .
" I can't tell you if the use of force in Iraq today would last five days , or five weeks , or five months , " he said in an interview on November 14 , 2002 , " but it certainly is n't going to last any longer than that . "
Nonetheless , he remains an emblematic figure of our age .
If you do n't understand him , you can't fully grasp the unprecedented ruin which is American foreign policy today .
It 's not something I often say , but this is simply a must - read .
Tom
On a farewell flight to Baghdad in early December 2006 , the departing Secretary of Defense reminisced about his start in politics more than forty years before .
Aides leaned in to listen intently , but came away with no memorable revelations .
It hardly mattered .
As usual with this man who dominated government as no cabinet officer before him -- including the power - ravenous Henry Kissinger he so despised and outdid in effect , if not celebrity -- authentic history and Don Rumsfeld 's version of it bore little resemblance .
There was portent in those beginnings .
He came out of an affluent Chicago suburb in the 1950s with brusque confidence and usable contacts at Princeton , among them Frank Carlucci , a future Defense Secretary of mediocre mind , yet the iron conceit and shrewd fealty far more effectual in government than intellect or sensibility .
After college and two years as a Navy pilot , Rumsfeld did politic stints as a Capitol Hill intern and Republican campaign aide , and by twenty - nine , back in Chicago in investment banking , was running for Congress .
As with much to come , a darker thread lay beneath the surface from the start .
In a Republican primary tantamount to election , he was outwardly the boyish , speak - no - evil , underfunded , underdog challenger of an old party stalwart set to inherit the open seat .
In fact , he was generously financed by wealthy friends , while his operatives -- including Jeb Stuart Magruder of later Watergate infamy -- furtively harried and smeared his opponent , using tactics never traced to Rumsfeld .
He went to Washington in December 1962 a handsome , square - jawed , safe - seat tribune from the North Shore 's lakeside preserves , epitomized by the leafy estates of Winnetka and high - end Evanston .
The old Thirteenth District of Illinois was one of the wealthiest in the nation and had been smoothly in Republican grip for most of a century .
In the House , Rumsfeld was soon seen by some as he always saw himself -- a prodigy in the dull ranks of his Party .
Then , as afterward , he had no authentic qualifications or independent achievements .
But that was always masked by the same muscular , aggressive style he took onto the mat as an Ivy League wrestler -- " sharp elbows , " a meeker , envious colleague called it -- as well as by the flaccid banality of most of the GOP in the 1960s .
The Republican Party Rumsfeld strode into was already caught between the wasting death of Eisenhower worldliness and moderation ( with Richard Nixon 's haunted succession in the wings ) and a fitful right - wing urge to seize control that , in little more than a decade , would deliver the Reagan Reaction .
Rumsfeld 's own rightist mentality , his New Deal - phobic corporatist cant and Cold War chauvinism , came dressed more in modish vigor than telltale substance -- and he was already attracted by a tough - minded layman 's zeal for the era's pre-micro - processing but grandly prospering military technology .
Like most of his generation born in the early 1930s , the scrap - drive , victory - bond children of World War II who came to govern the postwar world and would be the decisive elders of the post - 9/11 era , he had no doubt about the natural nobility of America 's sway or the invincibility of its arms ; all this made ever sleeker , ever more irresistible by the demonstrable twin deities of American capitalism -- technology and " modern " management .
That , after all , was the unquestioned , unquestioning faith of North Shore fathers and other successes like them across the nation .
That was the world , according to postwar Princeton , as well as Harvard Business School .
That was the supposed genius of future Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara 's duly quantified Ford Motor Company as well as his Vietnam - era " systems analysis " Pentagon , and so much more .
In the early 1960s , that received world ended just beyond the suites and suburbs .
Given America 's moral and material omnipotence , its exemplary excellence ( so evident on the North Shore ) , the remainder of the planet required no particular exploration , knowledge , or historical - political understanding , nor did such men need to have the slightest recognition of America 's own non-mythologized past .
Alert decision - makers , busy with the numbered bottom - line results , had no time for such " academic " ephemera .
When money or force needed to be applied to Asians , Arabs , Latins , or Africans , a crisp briefing by some underling who had read the necessary memos would always do .
Caught up as we all have been in Rumsfeld 's kinetic , churlish descent into the bloody chaos of his Iraq , it has been easy to neglect how richly cultural it all was from the beginning -- America 's haunted half - century of vast might and presumption set beside our still vaster ignorance and irresponsibility .
It was in 1963 , during Don Rumsfeld 's first months in Congress , that the Iraqi Ba'ath Party -- since 1959 recruited , funded , marshaled and directed by the CIA , and trailing a twenty - six - year - old Tikriti street thug named Saddam Hussein ( himself a CIA - paid assassin ) along with lists of hundreds of left - leaning Iraqi political figures and professionals to be murdered after the coup -- seized power in Baghdad .
On Capitol Hill , the spirited young Republican legislator was then absorbed in exhilarating new appropriations in aeronautics and weaponry .
His trademark clipped fervor and biting sarcasm in questions and speeches already held a hint of the Pentagon E - Ring canon four decades later : the superpower military as classic wrestler -- lithe , superbly equipped , swift to pin a dazed foe , dominant beyond doubt , and with garlands all around .
It was only a matter -- he began to learn early from helpful briefings and testimony by military - industrial executives -- of making the commanders ( the branch managers , after all ) change their sluggish old ways .
The by - word would be : Procure to prevail .
So superior was new technology and the management that went with it that it scarcely mattered who the competitor might be .
In those long - gone days , in obscure Washington hearings unheard , in colloquies before empty chambers , there were the first faint drums of distant disaster in the Hindu Kush , Mesopotamia , and beyond .
Of course , in the 1960s , Rumsfeld 's ardor for a high - tech military was only stirring , a minor dalliance compared to his preoccupation with advancement .
While few seemed to notice , the brash freshman made an extraordinary rush at the lumbering House .
In 1964 , before the end of his first term , he captained a revolt against GOP Leader Charles Halleck , a Dwight D. Eisenhower loyalist prone to bipartisanship and skepticism of both Pentagon budgets and foreign intervention .
By only six votes in the Republican Caucus , Rumsfeld managed to replace the folksy Indianan with Michigan 's Gerald Ford .
In the inner politics of the House , the likeable , agreeable , unoriginal Ford was always more right - wing than his benign post - Nixon , and now posthumous , presidential image would have it .
Richard Nixon called Ford " a wink and a nod guy , " whose artlessness and integrity left him no real match for the steelier , more cunning figures around him .
To push Ford was one of those darting Capitol Hill insider moves that seemed , at the time , to win Rumsfeld only limited , parochial prizes -- choice committee seats , a rung on the leadership ladder , useful allies .
Taken with Rumsfeld 's burly style that year was Kansas Congressman Robert Ellsworth , a wheat - field small - town lawyer of decidedly modest gifts but outsized ambitions and close connections to Nixon .
" Just another Young Turk thing , " one of their House cohorts casually called the toppling of Halleck .
It seems hard now to exaggerate the endless sequels to this small but decisive act .
The lifting of the honest but mediocre Ford higher into line for appointment as vice president amid the ruin of President Richard Nixon and his Vice President , Spiro Agnew ; Ford 's lackluster , if relatively harmless , interval in the Oval Office and later as Party leader with the abject passing of the GOP to Ronald Reagan in 1980 ; Ellsworth 's boosting of Rumsfeld into prominent but scandal - immune posts under Nixon ; and then , during Ford 's presidency , Rumsfeld 's reward , his elevation to White House Chief of Staff , and with him the rise of one of his aides from the Nixon era , a previously unnoticed young Wyoming reactionary named Dick Cheney ; next , in 1975 - 1976 , the first Rumsfeld tenure at a Vietnam - disgraced but impenitent Pentagon that would shape his fateful second term after 2001 ; and eventually , of course , the Rumsfeld - Cheney monopoly of power in a George W. Bush White House followed by their catastrophic policies after 9/11 -- all derived from making decent , diffident Gerry Ford Minority Leader that forgotten winter of 1964 .
Burial Party
They were Nixon men .
Rumsfeld and Cheney rose via the half - shunned political paternity of a cynical president who abided and used some he distrusted , even came to deplore .
Brought into Nixon 's 1968 presidential campaign through Ellsworth 's influence , Rumsfeld fell into an opportune role -- spying on the Democratic Convention in Chicago , which exploded in the infamous " police riot " against antiwar demonstrators that tore apart the Democrats and lent the spy 's reports unexpected gravity .
( Among faces in the crowd watching the mayhem was another onlooker out of a comfortable Republican suburb , a twenty - one - year - old Wellesley student from Park Ridge named Hillary Rodham . )
Though he gained attention in the Democrats ' disaster , Rumsfeld ran up against Nixon 's equally barbed campaign manager , Bob Haldeman and , despite their election victory , returned to Congress in 1969 without reward .
Bipartisan collusion rescued him .
By 1968 , President Lyndon Johnson 's four year - old Office of Economic Opportunity ( OEO ) , the heralded antipoverty program with its grassroots " Community Action " and its Legal Services for the poor , had become a potential success story -- and thus anathema for powerful Democrats as well as Republicans .
Denied a 1964 cigarette tax ( that would have funded it securely ) by the tobacco lobby , then starved by the sinking of resources into the maw of the Vietnam War , OEO was ultimately doomed when the nascent political , economic , and legal assertiveness it nurtured among the thirty to fifty million dispossessed threatened the hold of vested - interest donors and the mingled power bases of governors and mayors , congressmen and legislators of both parties .
As early as 1966 they began trooping in numbers through the Old Executive Office Building -- liberal and conservative but uniformly self - preserving , the single party of incumbent power -- to lobby Vice President Hubert Humphrey , who planned to cut the program when he himself became president .
With Nixon 's victory over Humphrey , OEO 's death became a certainty , though a tough infighter was needed as director to take out the agency 's life support systems .
Nixon first ignored the appointment ; then , later in 1969 , at the urging of ranking Senate and House Democrats as well as Ford and Ellsworth , named Rumsfeld to the post .
He , in turn , chose as his deputy Princeton pal Frank Carlucci , already off to a buccaneering start in the Foreign Service amid early 1960s CIA coups and assassinations in the Congo .
The writ was plain .
On Capitol Hill , they called Rumsfeld " the undertaker . "
So it was that a slight , already balding 28 year - old Republican Congressional intern , Richard Bruce Cheney , soon steered to the new OEO Director a 12 - page memo setting out how to run the agency in a way that would kill what they all deplored .
Cheney had failed at Yale .
Returning to his native Casper to work as a telephone lineman , he eventually went to college in Wyoming and , avoiding the Vietnam draft like the plague , on to graduate school and a DC internship meant to satisfy his ambitious fiancée Lynn and to retrieve a white - collar career .
Like so many in the neo-conservative swarm he came to head after 2001 , Cheney brought to public life no intellectual distinction or curiosity , and certainly no knowledge of the wider nation and world .
Washington in 1968 marked the first time he had lived in a town of more than 200,000 .
Over his glacial insularity , though , lay a reassuringly phlegmatic manner .
In Washington , he found he had an instinct for the quiet , diligent subordinate 's exploitation of institutional indolence , and he brought with him a clenched - teeth , right - wing animus that more visible Republicans judged impolitic to express but impressive in a backroom staff man .
" Dick said what they all thought but did n't say aloud , " a Hill aide ( and later Congressman ) recalled of often raw conversations about money , race , partisanship , and particularly Cheney 's angry , acid scorn for college antiwar protests that gave reassuring voice to the publicly muted abhorrence of Republican politicians .
Having earlier rejected him as a House intern , Rumsfeld now made the young right - winger his key personal assistant at OEO , where he proved devotedly efficient .
The hiring brought three future Secretaries of Defense -- Rumsfeld , Carlucci , and Cheney -- into the same office , toiling to abort the unwanted embryonic empowerment of the poor .
When they became celebrities , there would be much written about how the styles of Rumsfeld and Cheney meshed -- Rummy 's sheer brio , his relishing combat and the limelight , his free - wheeling way of sparking ideas and decisions helter - skelter ( his famous routine of dropping to the floor for one - arm push - ups , a tic that a bureaucrat - benumbed Washington media always found fetching ) ; and steady , backroom Dick , the methodical organizer , the modest detail man seeing to practical execution .
Close up , the bond was even deeper .
Across an age gap of almost a decade , despite the distance between charged and calm , North Shore and Casper , Princeton and Wyoming , country club Congressman and lumpen - proletarian repairman , they shared something rarely then so openly admitted on the right : an abhorrence of the liberations sweeping the 1960s , not just the right 's pet scourges of bureaucracy , crime , drugs , social fragmentation , and ( however suitably coded ) racial integration , but the unsettling ferment of newfound freedoms and honesty , the defiance of cultural and institutional oppressions -- especially by minorities and women .
They detested Lyndon Johnson 's Great Society , the way it seemed to advance beyond the New Deal and Progressivism at the expense of settled money and power .
Altogether it was a moment of hurtling change that many saw as ominous weakness and laxity , of new public programs for the long - excluded , which the world of Rumsfeld and Cheney imagined as " socialism . "
For them , the balancing regulation of long - dominant business power was nothing short of " tyranny " ; the new arrangements of race and class , the myriad threats of sheer liberty in a more equitable society and economy , were menacing .
Whatever their other ties , Rumsfeld and Cheney were two of the era 's visceral reactionaries in the classic sense of the term .
Musing with younger aides on one of his last days in the White House , Johnson came up with a telling term for their ilk .
" The haters , " he called them .
" They hate what they can't run any more " was the way he put it .
The calamity Rumsfeld and Cheney later wrought in American foreign policy traced not only to profound ignorance and immense , careless pretense about the world at large , but in some part to a four - decade - old kindred fear and loathing at home .
OEO began the Rumsfeld myths .
" He saved it , " Carlucci would blithely tell oblivious post - 9/11 reporters hardly apt to check the actual fate of the agency .
Carlucci would spin an image of an ever - energetic Rumsfeld taking up the cause of the needy , streamlining and fortifying the laggard agency despite the funeral that had been ordered .
It was a blasé postmortem lie .
Community Action , Head Start , VISTA , Job Corps , and most decisively Legal Services ( whose leadership Rumsfeld and Cheney together decapitated in 1970 ) -- one by one , each of these beleaguered efforts was stifled or sloughed off to political sterility .
This mission , at least , was accomplished .
By the time the burial was complete -- with the agency 's quiet extinction in 1973 , unmourned by the powers of either party -- the undertaker had moved on to higher office .
In 1971 , Nixon had been stymied in his plan to use Rumsfeld in a cabinet shakeup and so took him into the White House as a domestic affairs " counselor . "
The Rumsfeld White House interval over the next two years is captured on Nixon 's infamous secret tapes .
With his ever - aggressive , if not megalomaniacal , 40 year - old aide , the 60 year - old president adopts an avuncular tone , while Rumsfeld angles brazenly to supplant Henry Kissinger as a special envoy on Vietnam or even to replace Vice President Spiro Agnew on the 1972 ticket .
Patiently , yet with audible derision and occasional incredulity , Nixon suggests seasoning in more modest positions .
Thus , after the president 's 1972 reelection triumph , an eager Rummy would be made ambassador to NATO , spoils previously in the hands of their mutual friend Ellsworth , who urged Rumsfeld for the job .
It all yielded more myths , more confected history by a submissive , uninformed media profiling post - 9/11 power .
There would be the image of Rumsfeld as White House " dove " on Vietnam , when his bent was exactly the opposite ; or that Nixon , it would be claimed , saw him as uniquely in touch with the diversity of the country , especially the young -- when the reality was that Rumsfeld , having served an impatient three terms from his lavishly unrepresentative rotten borough of Winnetka wealth , with his generic contempt for the 1960s and his part at OEO suppressing the emergence of millions of the young poor , was anything but .
At the time , privately at least , his grasping shallowness led to withering -- now long - forgotten -- verdicts from knowing witnesses .
Even a jaded Nixon would eventually deplore him as " a man without idealism . "
His extensive experience with despots giving the judgment added weight , Henry Kissinger came to think Rumsfeld the " most ruthless " official he had ever known .
In a Washington that routinely hides its ugly inner truths of character and incompetence , none of it mattered .
Away at NATO in Brussels , frustrated by multinational diplomacy but expanding his own sense of political - military mastery , Rumsfeld managed to escape the Watergate incriminations of 1973 - 74 .
Instead , he seemed like a fresh face when Gerald Ford succeeded the disgraced Nixon in August 1974 .
Anxious to be rid of Nixon co-conspirators like then - White House Chief of Staff Alexander Haig , but facing a period of rule with inadequate crony aides , the earnest new president called back clean , hard - charging Don to be his chief of staff .
Rumsfeld promptly brought in Cheney , just on the verge of vanishing mercifully into private business -- and the rest is history .
Massacres
Barely a year after moving next to the Oval Office ( and contrary to Ford 's innocent , prideful recollection decades later that it was his own idea ) , Don and Dick characteristically engineered their " Halloween Massacre . "
Subtly exploiting Ford 's unease ( and Kissinger 's jealous rivalry ) with cerebral , acerbic Defense Secretary James Schlesinger , they managed to pass the Pentagon baton to Rumsfeld at only 43 , and slot Cheney , suddenly a wunderkind at 34 , in as presidential Chief of Staff .
In the process , they even maneuvered Ford into humbling Kissinger by stripping him of his long - held dual role as National Security Advisor as well as Secretary of State , giving a diffident Brent Scowcroft the National Security Council job and further enhancing both Cheney 's inherited power at the White House and Rumsfeld 's as Kissinger 's chief cabinet rival .
A master schemer himself , Super K , as an adoring media called him , would be so stunned by the Rumsfeld - Cheney coup that he would call an after - hours séance of cronies at a safe house in Chevy Chase to plot a petulant resignation as Secretary of State , only to relent , overcome as usual by the majesty of his own gifts .
With such past trophies on their shelves , it would never be a contest for Rumsfeld and Cheney after 2001 .
That fall of 1975 , 29 year - old George W. Bush , the lineage 's least fortunate son , was in Midland , Texas , partying heartily and scrounging for some role on the rusty fringes of the panhandle oil business .
By December 1975 having pushed aside Watergate - appointed Vice President Nelson Rockefeller , the longtime abomination of the Republican right , Rumsfeld was already positioning himself to be Ford 's 1976 running mate -- and eventual successor .
But that spring Ronald Reagan came so close to wresting the nomination from Ford , with primary victories in North Carolina and Texas , that the President 's other advisors , many of whom detested Rumsfeld anyway , sprang to appease the Reagan camp by persuading the President to put choleric right - wing Kansas Senator Bob Dole on the ticket instead .
Among those advisors was George H.W. Bush , then - CIA Director .
( He had gotten the job thanks to a cynical recommendation from Rumsfeld , calculating that to put Bush at the scandal - ridden agency would eliminate him as a potential rival ) .
Another was Bush 's onetime Texas campaign aide , a moneyed corporate lawyer and would - be power - broker from Houston , and now an obscure Commerce Department official who became Ford 's 1976 campaign manager , James Baker III .
It was an adroit back - corridor move , the sort Rumsfeld himself had been practicing so adeptly , and it embittered him for years toward his old patron Ford as well as Bush , Baker , and others -- one more wisp of a seamy , unseen history , of customary Republican cannibalism that wafted ironically over the last days of 2006 with Baker 's Iraq Study Group and the Ford funeral .
Designs on the Oval Office thwarted but by no means given up , Rumsfeld spent scarcely fifteen months at the Pentagon in 1975 - 1976 , but they were quietly , ominously historic .
It was an interval , however brief , that proved far more significant and premonitory than commonly portrayed .
In many ways , it both foreshadowed 9/11 and prepared the way for the fateful sequel to it .
At every turn , the new SecDef pulled policy to the right -- aligning Washington even more egregiously than usual with reactionary regimes in Asia and Latin America , smothering the nation 's only serious attempt at intelligence reform , beginning the demolition of détente with Russia that would climax in its extinction under Jimmy Carter .
At home and abroad , Rumsfeld seeded the Middle East for future crises and , even more insidiously , joined the military leadership in cravenly abandoning the post - Vietnam battlefield of historical understanding and institutional change .
In his first days in office , he quickly allied himself with the longtime ( but until then vain ) efforts of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to stall the pending Strategic Arms Control Agreement with Moscow .
He also pushed Kissinger and Ford into one of the more disgraceful acts of that presidency ( discreetly ignored in the recent Ford retrospectives ) -- the assuring of the Indonesian military junta that U.S. support and arms would continue to flow , despite the brutal suppression about to be unleashed on East Timor .
It was only a taste of the Rumsfeld preference for uniformed right - wing tyrants , indulged over the next year in an ever closer Defense Department liaison with military dictatorships in Latin America , most notably through Operation Condor , joint covert actions involving several regimes , among them Gen.
Augusto Pinochet 's Chile and the Argentine military dictatorship , with Pentagon attaches and intelligence advisors looking on approvingly .
The result was a plague of kidnappings , disappearances , and assassinations throughout the Hemisphere , including , in 1976 , the brazen car bomb murder of former Chilean Foreign Minister Orlando Letelier and an American colleague on Massachusetts Avenue in downtown Washington .
Unfailingly backed and expanded by Rumsfeld , the collusion with Indonesian and Latin American despots underwrote more than a decade of some of the most savage repressions of the second half of the twentieth century .
The customary Pentagon - State Department bureaucratic war Rumsfeld waged against Kissinger ( with a vengeance fired by the Defense Secretary 's presidential ambitions ) involved a furtive alliance with Capitol Hill 's über - hard - line Democrat , Armed Services Committee Chairman ( and Kissinger nemesis ) Henry " Scoop " Jackson .
A Washington State backwoods , shoreline - county prosecutor , he had become the " Senator from Boeing . "
Jackson 's Russophobia , demagoguery on arms control , and zealous backing of Israel ( especially on the then - charged issue of Jewish emigration from the USSR ) would land Rumsfeld in the milieu of the Israeli lobby , already formidable if only a kernel of the special interest colossus it would later become .
Jackson 's Cold War mania was fattening military budgets along with the requisite Puget Sound contracts , not to speak of the senator 's own war chest for a 1976 presidential run , and all this was being fomented by a bustling , pretentious , pear - shaped young Jackson aide named Richard Perle .
Perle 's somber , if oily , manner hid his own considerable lack of intellect or knowledge about either Russia or the Middle East , but his hard - line anti-Soviet and Zionist zeal gave him , as Jackson 's policy broker in the politics of the moment , a cachet and following far beyond his meager substance .
Rumsfeld 's collusion with Jackson would thus introduce him to some of the still marginal publicists , ideologues , and Washington hangers - on who would take the term neoconservative as the label for their career - plumping chauvinism and , less audibly , their tragically intermingled allegiances to right - wings in both the U.S. and Israel .
In Rumsfeld 's early tie to this wanna - be - establishment claque were omens of the history they would make together after 2001 .
It was his " sharp elbows " that were thrown to create the notorious " Team B , " a collection of incipient neocons and Russophobes in and out of government , including Paul Wolfowitz .
They were summoned to offer a fearsome analysis of Soviet capabilities and intentions that would be an alternative to comparatively unfrightening ( and accurate ) CIA assessments being attacked by Ronald Reagan and his right - wing minions in the 1976 campaign .
In this surrender to election - year demagoguery could be found the hands of the White House and the elder Bush at the CIA ( more Ford regime shame politely forgotten in the mournful , anxiety ridden , anyone - compared - to - George - W. fin de 2006 moment ) , but Rumsfeld 's role was crucial -- and the consequences historic .
The absurdity and ideological corruption of Team B's " analysis " of the Soviet bogeyman ( along with a desired future confrontation with China , a nakedly racist , essentially right - wing Israeli view of the Arab world , and a refusal to face the Vietnam defeat ) would be plain even then ; though decades later , the post - Soviet archives would definitively reveal it for the fraud it was .
As it was meant to , it fed the massive arms buildup of the Reagan 80s , and with it the engorging of the military - industrial colossus that , in turn , filled Republican campaign coffers .
And all of this , of course , including the ensuing distortions in domestic priorities , would pave the way for Rumsfeld 's eventual return to power .
The " Team B " scandal also foreshadowed an insidious post - 9/11 plague , the right - wing assault on relatively non-ideological national intelligence that was to lead to the blatant substitution of alternative " intelligence " operations in Rumsfeld 's Pentagon and Cheney 's vice - presidential office ( full - time versions of " Team B , " as it were ) , as well as the coercion and corruption of conventional CIA channels .
In 1976 , Rumsfeld worked assiduously to undercut any intelligence that challenged his right - wing bias and , with Cheney helpfully in the background at the White House , fought hard to drown any meaningful intelligence reforms after mid-1970s hearings chaired by Senator Frank Church and Congressman Otis Pike offered shocking revelations of CIA covert - operations abuses .
The resulting half - measures and truncated accountability sent unmistakable signals through Washington , setting the stage for various CIA rampages of the 1980s under Reagan campaign manager William Casey ( and one of Casey 's ambitious , agreeable aides named Robert Gates ) .
The direct consequences in blowback and loss of professional integrity would be felt for decades to come .
Then , there was the Middle East .
In mid-1976 , exiled Palestinians allied with a Lebanese nationalist coalition to politically and economically challenge the traditional privileged rule of the West 's Christian - dominated client regime in Beirut .
Faced with this , the Secretary of Defense was decisive in the secret US - Israeli instigation of a Syrian military intervention meant to thwart both the Palestinians and the Lebanese rebels .
Rumsfeld muscled the covert action through , despite Kissinger 's initial hesitation .
It ushered in a three - decade - long Syrian occupation of Lebanon , with relentless machinations in the Levant involving the Israeli intelligence service , the Mossad , the CIA and , beginning under Rumsfeld as never before , the Pentagon 's Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .
Already significant in the 1950s , the CIA - Mossad collaboration in Lebanon and elsewhere certainly pre-dated Rumsfeld , and crucial decisions in the deepening collusion would come after him .
But the 1976 intervention , which he backed so strongly , would take the complicity to a new level , with a twisting sequel of tumult and intrigue that directly paved the way for the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon , and thus for the eventual rise of Hizbullah .
At the same time , Rumsfeld avidly stepped up ongoing U.S. arms shipments to the Shah of Iran 's corrupt , U.S. - installed oligarchic tyranny -- its torture - ready SAVAK secret police intimately allied with the Mossad , the CIA and the DIA .
In 1976 , Rumsfeld also pressed the sale to the waning Shah of up to eight nuclear reactors with fuel and lasers capable of enriching uranium to weapons grade levels .
Ford was prudently uneasy at first , but relented under unanimous pressure from his men .
Cheney backed Rumsfeld from the start in urging an Iranian nuclear capability ; and , in this at least , they were joined by their arch- rival Kissinger , ever solicitous of his admirer the Shah , ever oblivious to internal Islamic politics -- he himself primed by an obscure but vocal thirty - three - year - old State Department aide named Paul Wolfowitz .
At its Rumsfeldian peak in 1976 , U.S. weapons and intelligence trafficking with the rotting Iranian imperial regime took up the time of some eight hundred Pentagon officers .
Barely two years later , the Shah 's regime would fall to the Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic Revolution , in part under the sheer weight and waste of the Pentagon 's patronage .
Like CIA - DIA connivance with SAVAK -- which included coordinated assassinations of Iranian opposition political figures or clerics and , in 1977 , even Khomeini 's son -- Pentagon complicity with the hated old order made all but inevitable the widespread anti-American sentiment in Iran that would in the future be so effectively exploited by the Islamic regime 's propaganda .
Detonating in the 1979 seizure of U.S. embassy hostages in Tehran , popular Iranian hostility would burn out of a history of intervention and intrigue few Americans ever knew the slightest thing about .
In this way , Rumsfeld and others , including Gates and his slightly mad patron Casey at the CIA , would all , in some degree , become policy godfathers of the mullahs ' regime in Tehran as well as of Hizbullah .
" The Dark Ages "
Even more costly would be the toll the Rumsfeld interregnum would exact deep inside the American military .
However brief , Rumsfeld 's mid-1970s rule over the Defense Department proved , in certain respects , the most crucial moment at the Pentagon since World War II .
In seven tumultuous years from Johnson 's fall to Nixon 's , spanned by defeat and de facto mutiny in Vietnam , four secretaries would troop through Defense , each consumed by war or politics , none engaging the institution 's historic plight .
Taking office six months after the fall of Saigon , Rumsfeld would inherit the first truly post -Vietnam military .
Fittingly , the institutional crisis he faced had come into being over the full two decades of his adult life since the 1950s .
By the time he settled in at the Pentagon , that crisis had already been extensively studied and well documented .
Conclusions were available for the asking -- or hearing or reading -- in any Pentagon ring , at any military post at home or abroad as well as in Congress , the White House , and the press , not to speak of the American public .
It was unmistakable in the searing experiences of a war whose dark - soil graves at nearby Arlington were still fresh .
By any measure , Rumsfeld arrived at a rare , and exceedingly fleeting moment when the enormous U.S. war machine might have come to terms with its past , and so the future .
The failure to do so -- hardly Rumsfeld 's alone , but his role was decisive -- would haunt America and the world into the twenty - first century .
Vietnam had laid bare the malignant decaying of America 's armed forces that began in the wake of their first unwon war in Korea .
There was " no substitute for victory , " General Douglas MacArthur had written a Congressman in the letter that finally prodded President Harry Truman to fire him as commander of U.S. - U.N. forces in Korea in 1951 .
The services nonetheless promptly found a perfectly reasonable substitute -- for a while -- in the warm bath of a careerist managerial ethic .
Ruled in World War II by an ever - growing bureaucracy , ever more inhospitable to the officer as individual , America 's superpower military was , as the Korean War began in 1950 , already a sclerotic giant .
" A glandular thing " was how Secretary of Defense Robert Lovett would describe it a decade later to John Kennedy .
The brutal Korean stalemate , following on the early rout of a billet - flabby , semi- demobilized occupation army from Japan , and later the frozen , bloody retreat from a heedless , MacArthur - led advance to conquer North Korea right up to the Chinese border , added to the curse .
Faced with the demanding , unnerving politics of a nuclear - armed peace , a supposedly matchless force met its match in Korea not just on the battlefield , but in the murky realms of political sophistication .
In response , grappling to redefine its place ( and reassure itself at the same time ) , the military in the 1950s came to produce a preponderance of what one critic called the " formlessly ambitious " officer ; one who saw climbing the military ladder like ascent in any other corporate culture .
To a blight that Charles de Gaulle once deplored in his French Army as " solely careerism , " the post - Korea U.S. military added the fetish and pseudoscience of " management " -- warriors astride desks , commanding paper flow and brandishing the numerology of budgets with ever - more expensive weapons systems .
Procurement plunder and corruption , the venal revolving door between senior officers and corporate contractors , the inveterate lack of authentic accounting and accountability at almost every level -- all the old Pentagon scourges now ran rampant .
The good staff life rather than active command , " ticket punching , " the right job at the right time -- all of this fostered an officer corps overwhelmingly pursuing rank as an end itself , at pains to do no more than what one embittered combat colonel recalled as " a necessary but minimal amount of field duty . "
As credentials merely accumulated , as efficiency reports inflated and grew meaningless , there was the inevitable atrophy of ethics and the military art .
Oddly enough , management itself , the faith and practice of the new creed , was the first casualty of institutional shallowness and self - protection .
Winners emerged compromised and cynical ; losers , alienated and contemptuous of superiors .
General morale , credible command authority , and old - fashioned élan as well as esprit de corps were decimated in the process .
Graduates and non-graduates alike trained their disillusion on institutions like West Point , which , by the early 1960s , many privately mocked as the South Hudson Institute of Technology -- SHIT .
The Academy 's sacred " duty , honor , country " now seemed eclipsed in practice by any mammoth organization 's immutable rule of survival : Cover your ass .
Despite the need to understand the history and politics of vast new arenas of American policy -- regions of potential military embroilment such as Asia or the Middle East -- once -elite service graduate schools like the War Colleges became what one study termed " usually superficial and vapid . "
There would be no twentieth - century American Clausewitz , wrote Ward Just , the best of the era 's military - affairs journalists , surveying the wreckage of a defense establishment driven by corporate inanity , " because the writing of Von Krieg ( On War ) took time and serious thought . "
Much of this bureaucratic decadence overtook other arms of government in the 1950s , not least the State Department .
As Vietnam soon would prove , however , a craven ethos and command mediocrity in a military -- whose business , as Korea savagely reminded everyone , is sometimes to fight wars -- would be catastrophic .
Within the system , there were predictable if vain attempts to hide the approaching disgrace .
When , in 1970 , a war - college study of " professionalism " in Vietnam was done with implications ( as a pair of reviewing experts described it ) " devastating to the officer corps , " the Joint Chiefs of Staff quickly classified and suppressed the findings .
Yet none of the inner withering was a secret , or even arcane knowledge , in government .
Before , during , and after Rumsfeld 's first regime at the Pentagon , Congressional hearings , journalism and memoirs exposed the reality for what it was ; while nationally noted , amply documented books , often written by veteran officers or based on their testimony , appeared under titles that spoke eloquently of the disaster still to come : Crisis in Command : Mismanagement in the Army , Defeated : Inside America 's Military Machine , Self - Destruction : The Disintegration and Decay of the United States Military , The Death of the Army .
Vietnam nearly made the figurative death literal .
Ironically , there had been a portent of the debacle ahead in Southeast Asia ( and of Iraq and Afghanistan 30 years later , for that matter ) in a book discussed in Washington to the point of fad just as Rumsfeld began his political career in the early 1960s .
General Maxwell Taylor was a handsome , much - decorated World War II airborne hero , a Missouri country boy who became a reputed military intellectual , albeit given to the pandemic provincialism yet gall typical of postwar American officialdom , whose nation 's new world power so outstripped its knowledge of the planet .
The general could thus unabashedly extol the Shah 's repressive Iranian troops as among the " armies of freedom , " and instruct a West Point class on the eve of Vietnam that they were entering a world in which " the ascendancy of American arms and American military concepts is accepted as [ a ] matter of course . "
More grandly , Taylor proposed to correct the errors of the key strategic doctrine of the Eisenhower presidency , the policy of " massive retaliation " in which America 's overwhelming nuclear superiority -- its bombers ringing the USSR and China , some within minutes of their targets -- was to deter any move by Soviet or Chinese forces across the Cold War 's post - Korea established boundaries .
That strategy might keep the Red Armies in their kennels , Taylor argued , but it was hardly a response to campaigns waged by proxy communists on the periphery in the Third World .
To meet that threat -- and , not incidentally , to rescue his beloved Army from the mission and budget predations of the nuclear - armed Air Force throughout the 1950s -- Taylor proposed a new orthodoxy of " limited wars , " adding to nuclear deterrence a " strategy of flexible response . "
He defined his breakthrough in a celebrated book , Uncertain Trumpet , as " the need for a capability to react across the entire spectrum of possible challenge for coping with anything from general atomic war to infiltration and aggressions "
On whether the United States could practically , or should politically , as a matter of national interest cope " with anything , " the confident paratrooper Taylor wisely did not elaborate .
His point , after all , was at heart a bigger , better army with bigger better budgets .
Properly selected " limited wars , " with newly created forces chafing to be used , would presumably take care of themselves .
But Taylor at least did warn that it would be necessary " to deter or win quickly , " dictating an overwhelming application of men and weaponry and a victory so swift and decisive that everyone , including the defeated enemy , would accept it .
" Otherwise , " he noted ominously in a passage the general as well as his admirers later tended to overlook , " the limited war which we cannot win quickly may result in our piecemeal attrition . "
Minus this gloomy caveat , Taylor 's theme enjoyed swift vogue in the early 1960s -- with both Republicans and Democrats eager to engage what were seen as ubiquitous Russians and native communists scavenging post - colonial turmoil in the Third World .
Among them were right - wingers like Rumsfeld , impatient with the aged caution of the Eisenhowers and Hallecks in their own Party , and among the Democrats , President John F. Kennedy himself .
He promptly made Taylor a ranking advisor on Southeast Asia and other matters .
Crippled by careerism , the military thus readied itself to fight in reassuring theory what in Vietnamese reality would be Maxwell Taylor 's oxymoronic nightmare -- a limited war of attrition .
That war , of course , had its men of courage and integrity .
More than ever , though , they were the exceptions to the prevailing system , and few of them made it as intact survivors to highest rank in the twenty - first century .
The machinery that in peacetime routinely ground out rhapsodic officer efficiency reports instantly applied the same practiced reflexes to the surreal paper work of Saigon and its offshore carrier groups , fattening Vietcong body counts , bombing damage assessments , and accounts of South Vietnamese client efficacy that seemed to prove victory ever on the way .
When intelligence reports discovered awkward enemy strength and resilience or detected unwanted signs of another losing war , they were simply falsified , destroyed , or buried .
The massively beribboned chests of commanders in Iraq and Afghanistan three decades later , many of whom had been junior officers in Southeast Asia , would be unintended reminders of how much the Vietnam fraud fed on even the old honor of citations .
Like a debased currency , ribbons for courage or exceptional service lost value as they accumulated , with awards snidely known as " gongs " and oak leaf clusters as " rat turds . "
Once - respected air medals ( 800,000 of them ) were handed out for almost any non -combat flight in that helicopter - swarming war , or even for hauling holiday frozen turkeys snugly behind the lines .
Decorations were heaped so bountifully on generals along with lesser staff officers that valor in such numbers , wrote one combat veteran , was " incomprehensible . "
To Vietnam's " grunts , " as they related again and again , the war was too often fought with their officers 2,000 feet up in the comparative safety of " eye in the sky " command helicopters rather than with their " ass in the grass " with their troops .
Casualty figures were telling .
In over a decade of fighting , with over 58,000 American dead , only four generals and eight colonels fell in combat .
Commissioned rank was a guarantee of survival as for no other modern military at war ( save perhaps in Iraq and Afghanistan in figures yet to come , but where we know high ranking officers were seldom at the front ) .
" The officer corps simply did not die in sufficient numbers or in the presence of their men often enough , " concluded two postwar analysts of the army 's resulting " crisis . "
With the corruption of standards came an inevitable loss of morale .
To soldiers of honor at every level the ignorance , self - protection , and widespread opportunism of so many superiors made Vietnam what one colonel called " the dark ages in the army 's history . "
Through the ranks , unprecedented , ran the unchecked contagion of disintegration -- refusal of orders amounting to mutiny ; desertions in the tens of thousands ; a drug epidemic and race riots ; uncounted , unaccountable atrocities ; and not least the assassination of officers and noncoms by their own men .
The American military 's internecine murder acquired its own ugly Vietnam name , " fragging . "
Among the officer corps , according to a war - college appraisal , there had been " a clear loss of military ethic , " not to be explained simply by a largely citizen - soldier , draft - dependent army .
Altogether , another study concluded still more clinically and bluntly , the Armed Forces in Vietnam bordered on " an undisciplined , ineffective , almost anomic mass , " its commanders high and low manifesting " severe pathologies . "
Added to the war 's vast profiteering and waste , all this spurred an exodus of disillusioned military professionals ( unprecedented and unmatched until the Iraq War ) , depriving the services of most of their most promising young leaders .
It also produced by 1975 - 1976 an unparalleled outpouring of public and internal criticism with often shocking revelations by officers , enlisted men , and other knowledgeable observers in and out of government .
The Great Evasion
Yet atop the Pentagon at the immediate postwar height of the now furious , anguished outcry -- what an admiral witnessing it called a " real rebellion of the heart " --
Rumsfeld took no meaningful part in the airing or soul - searching ; nor did he take control of , or cleanse , the pestilent contract and accounting scandals .
What he did was effectively ignore , dismiss , or on occasion repress and even punish critics and whistle - blowers .
Typically -- yet another grim foreshadowing of Iraq with its Abu Ghraib and Afghanistan with its Bagram prison in cavernous structures at the old Afghan and Soviet air base -- when new Congressional questions began to be asked about the involvement of the U.S. military as well as the CIA in the Saigon regime 's infamous " Tiger Cage " torture camps in South Vietnam , an issue that surfaced well before his tenure at the Pentagon but which arose anew in 1975 - 1976 after fresh revelations of US - aided torture and assassinations , Rumsfeld led the Ford Administration in blocking damaging disclosures until the issue eventually trailed off .
It was one more plot of buried history -- along with a seedy CIA front , the Office of Public Safety , implicated in advising and abetting the secret police " renditions " and torture practices of client regimes worldwide until its quiet disbanding by Congress in 1975 -- with echoes into the twenty - first century .
Officially , the crumbling of discipline and performance in Vietnam would be blamed not on the military 's long - festering venality and incompetence , but on the ready scapegoats of antiwar agitation and the larger social turbulence of the 1960s , a perfect fit with Rumsfeld - Cheney demonology .
To the relief of the Joint Chiefs , the Secretary of Defense scoffed at , or swiftly suppressed , any institutional self - examination ; yet the counterattack on critics was vicious .
" Overlong in battle and emotionally unbalanced , " was the way one Pentagon - kept military columnist smeared an officer of legendary heroism who publicly deplored service careerism .
As America gladly celebrated its Bicentennial under Gerald Ford 's calming , anodyne post - Watergate presidency , the tide of self - awareness in the Pentagon was " allowed to recede , " as a later study recorded , and officers " whose careers were deeply rooted in the policies and practices [ of the war ] finally prevailed . "
The latter included leaders of the 1991 Gulf War and 2003 Iraq debacle , most famously Colin Powell , who as a mid-grade careerist was personally involved in a whitewash of the My Lai massacre .
When a superintendent of West Point was earlier removed for his implication in the My Lai cover - up , he bid farewell to a dining hall full of sympathetic cadets with the old adage of General Joe Stillwell , " Do n't let the bastards grind you down . "
Who the Superintendent 's " bastards " were , the new Secretary of Defense and his unreconstructed high command had no doubt in 1975 - 1976 .
In the siege mentality of Rumsfeld 's post - Vietnam Pentagon , the besieging force was never a blindly misjudged nationalism , an intrepid insurgency , corrupt , untenable clients , or persistent myopia , folly , self - delusion , and ultimate self - betrayal of U.S. policy .
It was the curse of wavering civilian masters at home -- craven Washington politicians and the old foreign policy establishment , especially Democrats -- and a public too easily swayed by the treachery of a mythological " liberal media . "
Humiliation in Vietnam had come not from colossal blunder , but from homefront perfidy , from the hoary stab in the back .
" Do we get to win this time ? "
Rambo famously asks about his return to Vietnam , echoing in popular lore that denial of debacle .
It was Rumsfeld 's historic legacy to rubber stamp the Great Evasion performed by America 's military and sullen ideological right , as both fled headlong from the Vietnam reckoning .
In the process , they all jettisoned responsibility , much as Saigon 's American - bred profiteers cast cumbersome loot from their Mercedes sedans as they honked south through pitiful hordes of refugees just ahead of the final North Vietnamese offensive in the spring of 1975 .
While U.S. foreign policy -- in heedless covert action as well as an orgy of globalism begun even before the fall of the Soviet Union , and then the reactionary mania loosed by 9/11 -- broadcast the seeds of new insurgencies ( the prospects for what a handful of largely ignored theorists were calling " Fourth Generation Warfare " ) , serious study of counterinsurgency all but vanished from Pentagon planning and even from the service schools ' curricula .
The Iraq war would be years old and long lost by the time the Army revised , postmortem as it were , its little - read counterinsurgency manual written two decades before and anachronistic even then .
With Vietnam lessons unlearned and careerist blight as well as contract pillage uninterrupted , the military system 's answer -- already emerging as orthodoxy under Rumsfeld in 1976 -- would be the simplistic , foolproof dictum , claimed by Colin Powell but hardly his originally , of fighting only with overwhelming forces , crushing firepower , and uncontested air cover ( and even then having a precise " exit strategy " in place ) .
This was , in sum , a version of General Taylor 's " deter and win quickly . "
( As a " doctrine , " it was as if the Army or Navy football team would only go on the field with its own rules , its own referees , and a 33 - man team in the latest equipment to face an opposite 11 without helmets , pads , or the ability to pass . )
The so - called Powell Doctrine would soon be applied in settings allowing the post - Vietnam Pentagon 's ever costlier , ever more " managed " high - tech bludgeon to be wielded against suitably feeble foes , without troublesome duration of engagement or the need for political understanding .
Intelligence gaffes and the usual civilian carnage ( " collateral damage " ) aside , the results looked encouraging in Grenada in 1983 , Panama in 1990 , and most notably the 1991 " turkey shoot " of the First Gulf War , carefully conducted to keep American casualties to the level of industrial accidents .
Fastidious , blameless brevity and detachment tended , of course , to sacrifice controlling the political outcome in any geopolitically meaningful arena -- as in , for instance , allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power after his troops were expelled from Kuwait , and then , in defeat , to butcher Shiite rebels who , at the call of the first Bush administration in the persons of Baker , Cheney , Powell , and Scowcroft , thought the moment ripe to overthrow the tyrant themselves .
Regrettably , they misread Pentagon imperatives .
Chilled by a ghost they stoutly denied for decades , joint chiefs and defense secretaries would not repeat hot pursuit into North Korea or Vietnam 's limited war of attrition -- not until the undertaker 's fortuitous last chance at greatness arrived so explosively and irresistibly on September 11 , 2001 .

AUSTIN , Texas ( Reuters ) - A 27 - year - old Austin man was arrested on Friday and charged with placing an unexploded bomb containing some 2,000 nails outside an abortion clinic in the state ’s capital .
The explosive device also included a propane tank and a mechanism “ akin to a rocket , ” Austin Police Commander David Carter said .
The device was discovered on Wednesday in the parking lot of the Austin Women ’s Health Center , police said .
The Texas Joint Terrorism Task Force -- made up of federal , state and local law enforcement authorities -- arrested Paul Ross Evans , who authorities said was on parole for an unspecified crime .
Evans was charged with violating federal laws banning the manufacture of explosives and interfering with access to an abortion clinic .
He appeared before a federal magistrate , and was being held without bail .
No further arrests were anticipated in the case .
“ The threat is over , ” Carter said .
A robot was used to disarm the bomb after the unmarked clinic building and an apartment complex were evacuated , police said on Thursday .
This was the first bombing attempt this year at an abortion clinic , according to the National Abortion Federation , which tracks violence against abortion providers .
Four incidents of attempted bombing or arson were reported in 2006 , the NAF said .
More than 40 abortion clinic bombings have occurred since 1977 , with the last reported in 2001 .
When I wrote that article about how to set prices for software , I generally concluded that in many ways you were completely doomed :
“ The more you learn about pricing , the less you seem to know …
I ’ve been nattering on about this topic for well over 5000 words and I do n’t really feel like we ’re getting anywhere . ”
In particular , to set prices well , you need to be able to plot your customers ’ demand curves , and it ’s almost impossible to figure out what your demand curve is , because it ’s so hard to charge different customers different amounts and get any kind of reliable data .
Sometimes , though , you luck out .
If you ’ve been selling a product priced in US dollars to customers in Europe , you might actually have a bit of useful data .
You see , the US dollar has dropped a lot in the past year .
As the dollar falls , your product has become cheaper and cheaper for Europeans .
I looked back on the last year of FogBugz data , dividing the price by the pound sterling exchange rate , and discovered that our single - user license have fluctuated between 64 and 74 pounds , while our ten packs have fluctuated between 49 and 56 pounds , approximately .
That gives me just enough data to plot a segment of the demand curve for English UK customers .
The data is not very conclusive , but it does support some things that I might have believed anyway :
Large customers ( on the left , enjoying the volume discount ) are not price sensitive .
There does not appear to be any correlation between price and sales .
These are larger businesses that are used to spending money on things , and it ’s not their money , anyway .
Small customers ( on the right ) are price sensitive .
They ’re startups and small ISVs that are used to watching their budget .
They exhibit a classic downward - sloping demand curve as economics would predict , and they like prices that end in 9 a bit better than prices around it ( there ’s a small bump below £ 70 ) .
On this curve , demand is measured in units purchased per day in England the UK .
I ’ve left the Y - axis unlabeled because it ’s confidential sales data , but the shape is accurate .
There are a lot of reasons to be skeptical about this data :
Since the dollar has basically been marching downwards , lower prices ( in £ ) correspond to later dates .
I ’ve tried to adjust for this but there could be any number of other reasons why sales are increasing in England the United Kingdom .
.
The data are only based on sales in England the UK , where different economic factors may be in effect that do n’t apply to US customers .
the UK , where different economic factors may be in effect that do n’t apply to US customers .
Many of our customers may not be looking at the actual exchange rate , but estimating based on their imperfect approximate knowledge of exchange rates ( just dividing by 2 , for example , is probably common ) , or thinking in $ .
Still , you may find this a useful technique to learn something about the demand curve for your product .
My friends in Cambridge and Berkeley like to complain that the U.S. is a rich man ’s world .
A trip out on the highway reveals that in fact it is not .
If the U.S. were a rich man ’s world , the rabble would be paid to ride public transit instead of clogging the highways and getting in the way of rich folks ’ monster SUVs .
Perhaps every Mercedes would come with an automatic device to fling subway tokens out the sides of the car .
In a rich man ’s world , as in London , an electronic toll of $ 20 would be collected from every driver wishing to enter an already - crowded highway or section of a city .
A lot of rich pilots whom I know do n’t own especially fancy cars .
They ca n’t be bothered to trade in their old Honda Accord for a new $ 100,000 BMW or Mercedes because the fancy new car wo n’t get them anywhere any faster than the existing car .
Plenty of rich folks in California , however , do spend more than $ 100,000 on a car .
And during this past week they get onto the highways blocked off by civil unrest and demonstrations against restrictions on illegal immigration .
What would be an intelligent way to spend serious $ $ on ground transportation ?
How about a $ 120,000 diesel - powered 40 ′ motorhome ?
It would n’t be as much fun to drive as a BMW M5 and it would certainly be difficult to park in the city .
You solve both problems by hiring an illegal immigrant to act as your driver .
You send him to schoolbus driver school for a few days and let him sleep on the fold - out dinette in the RV at night .
Now when you go to the beach , it will still take the same two hours at 5 mph on the clogged freeways that it always took , but you wo n’t care because you ’ll be at home .
You can read in an easy chair .
You can do some writing at the dinette table or refer to your files .
You can make phone calls and take notes .
You can watch TV .
With a mobile phone data connection , you can use the Internet .
You can take a nap in the bedroom in the back .
If you get hungry , you can fix yourself a grilled cheese sandwich in the kitchen .
You ’re at home in your second house , so waiting for friends or traffic jams is n’t anywhere near as annoying as it would be if you were in a car .
How about the environmental impact of getting around in 20,000 lb. buses instead of an SUV or a big German sedan ?
As it happens , the engineering of SUVs and big German sedans is so spectacularly inefficient that the gas mileage is about the same .
The monster diesel - powered SUVs get as much as 9 miles to the gallon .

I have frequently maintained that the key to wealth , health , fame , power , love , happiness , and personal fulfillment is simple .
All you have to do is do what you feel passionate about .
In fact , it seems to me that doing anything other than what you love is a total waste of time .
Whenever I write ( or say ) something like that I am deluged with questions and rebuttals .
Folks inevitably point to the innumerable starving artists , musicians , writers , and actors who are , well , starving , even though they are following their passions .
I also hear from guys who tell me the sole reason they were put on earth is to run an animal rescue operation or some such low - paying / no - paying occupation .
And then they challenge me by asking how are they going to get rich / famous / successful doing those things ?
On the other side of the bell curve , I hear from people who say they are passionate about a bazillion things .
They ask how can they possibly decide which one to pursue .
Here is what I tell all these folks :
I believe that it is not enough to begin your journey by following a path characterized by only one passion .
I have noticed that success comes when you incorporate several passions at once .
It seems that an activity that combines several passions is a more complete reflection of who you are .
Not only do the possibilities seem greater when more passions intersect , but the joy of doing is fuller .
For example , I love sports ( playing them , watching them , reading about them and talking about them ) .
I love to see the mystical / spiritual side of stuff .
I love to meditate .
I love paradigm shifting ideas .
I love to write ( or more accurately , I love having written ) .
I love starting businesses .
I love promoting them and growing them .
I love to collaborate with other people .
All these passions ( and probably many more ) are intersecting in my latest project .
I could n’t be more stoked .
But the key question is how does one get there in the first place ?
Here is what I do to identify my next project when I am in a lull :
I just start playing around with lots of small projects and ideas – whatever strikes my fancy .
The vast majority do n’t amount to a hill of beans .
But every now and then , one shows a glimmer of liveliness .
When that happens , I go by the following maxim – where there ’s smoke , pour gasoline .
I feed those little glimmers with more of my energy , attention , and enthusiasm .
If the glimmer gets brighter and the idea starts to sprout into something viable , I know I am on the right path .
This way I do n’t have to go through any intellectual gymnastics trying to analyze which is the best opportunity or which will be most lucrative or which is the best fit for me .
I let nature decide .
I just go with the projects that grab me .
If they take flight , I hop on board and enjoy the ride for as long and as high as it takes me .
The operative word , however , throughout the whole process is PLAY .

No Need For Government - Run Media When You Have The History Channel
This week the History Channel is running something called " Iran : The Next Iraq ? " :
For over 25 years , " Death to America " has been the rallying cry of the Iranian government , but it 's only recently that the threat has become chillingly real and the Islamic Republic of Iran has emerged as perhaps the most clear and present danger to American security .
This special will explore the once proud military tradition of Iran , its recent decline in power , and the country 's struggle to gain a place among the world 's super powers .
We will also examine evidence that shows Iran is secretly pursuing a nuclear weapon and just may intend to use on the United States or its allies .
I really appreciate the title .
Is Iran the next Iraq ?
Is it a country that poses zero threat to the United States that we 'll attack anyway ?
Will Americans be persuaded to support such an attack by crappy Soviet - style propaganda on the History Channel ?
( Thanks to Sam for the tip . )
RAMADI , Iraq —
Gazing through the telescopic sight of his M - 24 rifle , Army Staff Sgt. Jim Gilliland , leader of Shadow sniper team , fixed his eye on the Iraqi insurgent who had just killed an American soldier .
His quarry stood nonchalantly in the fourth - floor bay window of a hospital in battle - torn Ramadi , still clasping a long - barreled Kalashnikov .
Instinctively allowing for wind speed and bullet drop , Shadow ’s commander aimed 12 feet high .
A single shot hit the Iraqi in the chest and killed him instantly .
It had been fired from a range of more than three - quarters of a mile , well beyond the capacity of the powerful Leupold sight , accurate to 3,300 feet .
“ I believe it is the longest confirmed kill in Iraq with a 7.62 mm rifle , ” said Sgt. Gilliland , 28 , who hunted squirrels in Double Springs , Ala. , from the age of 5 before progressing to deer — and then to insurgents and terrorists .
“ He was visible only from the waist up .
It was a one - in - a - million shot .
I could probably shoot a whole box of ammunition and never hit him again . ”
Later that day , Sgt. Gilliland found out that the American soldier who had been killed by the Iraqi was Staff Sgt. Jason Benford , 30 , a good friend .
The insurgent was one of between 55 and 65 Sgt. Gilliland estimates that he has shot dead in less than five months , putting him within striking distance of sniper legends such as Carlos Hathcock , a Marine who recorded 93 confirmed kills in Vietnam .
One of his men , Spc. Aaron Arnold , 22 , of Medway , Ohio , has chalked up a similar tally .
“ It was elating , but only afterwards , ” said Sgt. Gilliland , recalling the Sept. 27 shot .
“ At the time , there was no high - fiving .
You ’ve got troops under fire , taking casualties , and you ’re not thinking about anything other than finding a target and putting it down .
Every shot is for the betterment of our cause . ”
All told , the 10 - strong Shadow sniper team , attached to Task Force 2 - 69 , has killed just under 200 in the same period and emerged as the U.S. Army ’s secret weapon in Ramadi against the threat of hidden improvised explosive devices or roadside bombs .
Above the spot from which Sgt. Gilliland took his record shot , in a room at the top of a bombed - out observation post that is code - named Hotel and known jokingly to soldiers as the Ramadi Inn , are painted the words , “ Kill Them All ” and “ Kill Like You Mean It . ”
On another wall are scrawled the words of Sen. John McCain , Arizona Republican and a former prisoner of war in Vietnam :
“ America is great not because of what she has done for herself , but because of what she has done for others . ”
The juxtaposition of macho slogans and noble political ideals encapsulates the dirty , dangerous and often callous job the sniper has to carry out as an integral part of a campaign ultimately being waged to help the Iraqi people .
With masterful understatement , Lt. Col. Robert Roggeman , the Task Force 2-69 commander , conceded : “ The romantic in me is disappointed with the reception we ’ve received in Ramadi , ” a city of 400,000 on the banks of the Euphrates , where graffiti boasts , with more than a degree of accuracy : “ This is the graveyard of the Americans . ”
“ We ’re the outsiders , the infidels , ” Col. Roggeman said .
“ Every time somebody goes out that main gate , he might not come back .
It ’s still a running gunbattle . ”
Highly effective though they are , he worries about the burden his snipers have to bear .
“ It ’s a very godlike role .
They have the power of life and death that , if not held in check , can run out of control .
Absolute power corrupts absolutely .
“ Every shot has to be measured against the rules of engagement , positive identification and proportionality , ” Col. Roggeman said .
Sgt. Gilliland explains that his Shadow team operates at the “ borderlines ” of the rules of engagement , making snap judgments about whether a figure in the cross hairs is an insurgent or not .
“ Hunters give their animals respect , ” he said , spitting out a mouthful of chewing tobacco .
“ If you have no respect for what you do , you ’re not going to be very good , or you ’re going to make a mistake .
We try to give the benefit of the doubt .
“ You ’ve got to live with it .
It ’s on your conscience , ” he said .
“ It ’s something you ’ve got to carry away with you . ”

Wilderness survival :
The rule of threes
A SWAT officer is lowered by helicopter to the remote spot where James Kim 's body was found .
I 've discussed it with my colleagues .
I 've discussed it with my wife .
So now I 'm heading into the Rocky Mountains to find out what it is really like to be in the kinds of unbelievable conditions James and his family faced -- the freezing cold , the snow , the wilderness .
To prepare for this story , I 've been interviewing experts about how to survive brutally cold conditions .
They 've told me about something call the rule of threes :
You can survive for three hours without shelter
You can survive for three days without water
You can survive for three weeks without food So now I know .
And now the rest of us know .
If you have to make a choice between food , water and shelter from the cold , then shelter wins out in a big way .
But what happens when you become desperate ?
When you look into your wife 's or kids ' eyes and see desperation equal to or greater than your own ?
The last thing I want to do is judge James Kim 's actions .
After all , none of us could ever imagine what must have been going through his mind after being in caught with his family in the Oregon snow , with nothing but wilderness around and seemingly no hope for rescue .
I now know he should have stayed .
Tonight , in my report , as I trek into the Rocky Mountains and meet with some survival experts , I hope to show what we 're all supposed to do if faced with similar conditions .
Probably every one of us who has seen the tragic story out of Oregon has wondered what they would do if faced with same situation as James Kim and his family .
I 'm no different .
I 've discussed it with my colleagues .
I 've discussed it with my wife .

So Monica Goodling does n't want to answer questions on Capitol Hill , eh ?
This top official in the Justice Department , who serves as its liaison to the White House , is now refusing to answer any congressional questions about the US attorneys scandal .
You know , the one in which George and Dick and Karl and Alberto have been hiring and firing federal prosecutors based on their willingness to politicize the legal system .
That scandal ( it 's so hard to keep track of them these days ) .
Her lawyer says that Goodling does n't actually have anything to hide , but rather that - just like the judicial travesty that recently took down Scooter Libby - a " hostile and questionable environment " has surrounded the case .
As opposed to the good kind of investigations , you see , where the White House does n't bother to answer the friendly questions that Congress and the press do n't bother to ask .
You know , like the last six years or so .
So Goodling 's lawyer has just announced that his client will be invoking her Fifth Amendment right against self - incrimination - even though , mind you , she did n't do anything wrong !
- rather than testifying to Congress .
Fifth Amendment ?
Fifth Amendment ?
You mean like , the Bill of Rights ?
That Fifth Amendment ?
Does n't she know that the Fifth Amendment has been suspended ?
Does n't she know that all those amendments have been suspended ?
Does n't she know that the president considers that whole document that these amendments amend to be " just a goddamed piece of paper " ?
She 's joking here , right ?
I thought she worked for the Justice Department in the Bush administration ?
Has n't she heard ?
Or maybe she 's still waiting for her interoffice mail from the last five years to clear NSA .
Boy , is she gonna be surprised .
We all know how committed the Bush people are to protecting the country from evildoers .
Next thing you know , little Miss Monica Goodling is going to find herself bound and gagged , and on a short but very uncomfortable flight to Guantánamo .
And that 's if she 's lucky .
If not , she 'll be getting a wee taste of extraordinary rendition to some place like Egypt or Syria .
Those fellas know how to make a gal sing !
Lemme tell ya , brother , there are n't any pesky amendments in Syria , and there never were .
I hope Ms. Goodling does n't think that her attorney will get the charges dropped for her .
In fact , she wo n't be having an attorney .
I hope she does n't think that the evidence she presents will exonerate her .
In fact , she wo n't be presenting any .
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat .
Get our best delivered to your inbox .
I hope she does n't think there will be a fair trial before a jury of her peers .
In fact , she 's gonna be rotting away in a dank cell somewhere , never even charged with any actual offense .
And she can forget about making a habeas corpus appeal , too .
Even though it was considered for centuries to be one of the great traditions of Western jurisprudence , Dear Leader knew better than that and had the foresight to eliminate it , so that evildoers could n't get away on some minor legal technicality like unlawful imprisonment .
Habeas corpus ?
Ancient history .
Just like all the rest of that Latin mumbo- jumbo .
Bag 'em and tag 'em are the legal lyrics we sing these days .
This president 's a ( nearly real ) Texan !
Do n't mess with Texas !
Squeamish lily - livered liberals and their bleeding - heart fellow travelers might not like it , but I 'm sure the president wants to get to the bottom of this just as much as he's wanted to solve the puzzle of who outed Valerie Plame ( which he will , I assure you , as soon as he can locate that scrap of paper with Dick Cheney 's phone number on it ) .
That 's bad news for Ms. Goodling , because that whole annoying Geneva Protocol thing has now been determined to be both " quaint " and " obsolete " ( did n't Alberto tell you ? ) .
Uh - Oh .
That means the t-word , I 'm afraid .
But , look , you gotta do what you gotta do to win the war on evildoers .
So I say , torture her !
Hell yes .
If I know anything about this president , I know he wo n't be afraid to attach electrodes to her genitals and make her scream a little .
I know that he 'll waterboard her until she gives up the guilty parties ( though certain names may have to be redacted , of course , but we have people for that ) .
I know that nothing so quaint and obsolete as mere international treaties or constitutional provisions will stop our unfaltering crusader for justice from getting to the bottom of this obvious threat to our way of life .
And I know that once he has everything he needs from her forced confession , he 'll have just the people in place as US attorneys to prosecute this evildoer .
( But , of course , why bother at that point ? )
Fifth Amendment rights .
That 's rich .
We have n't had that around these parts since nigh about the twentieth century .
Next I suppose she 'll be claiming that her preordained death sentence is cruel and unusual punishment !
Talk about quaint and obsolete .
Fifth Amendment rights .
Hah .
What does she think this is , the old United States of America ?

In their Report on the Surveillance Society , the authors now warn : " The call for everyone to be implanted is now being seriously debated . "
Yesterday a spokesman for civil liberties campaigners Liberty said : " We have got nothing about these surveillance technologies in themselves , but it is their potential uses about which there are legitimate fears .
Unless their uses are regulated properly , people really could find themselves living in a surveillance society .
" There is a rather scary underlying feeling that people may worry that these microchips are less about being a human being than becoming a barcoded product . "
we MUST be controlled
we MUST be ordered
we MUST be spied on
Ok enough with the sarcasm .
I 'd honestly rather die than have a chip inside of me .
You may think I am being extremist but this is something I feel very strongly about .
You may think this wo n't happen and I 'm being paranoid .
Fair enough .
But I 'm sure the brave troops coming back from WW2 would of laughed that cameras watched our every move .
Hell they fought yes they FOUGHT for our freedom YET we 've done nothing but GIVE IT AWAY .
Where is our SPIRIT ?
Where is our HEART ?
Britons ' could be microchipped like dogs in a decade '
Human beings may be forced to be ' microchipped ' like pet dogs , a shocking official report into the rise of the Big Brother state has warned .
The microchips - which are implanted under the skin - allow the wearer 's movements to be tracked and store personal information about them .
They could be used by companies who want to keep tabs on an employee 's movements or by Governments who want a foolproof way of identifying their citizens - and storing information about them .
The prospect of ' chip - citizens ' - with its terrifying echoes of George Orwell 's ' Big Brother ' police state in the book 1984 - was raised in an official report for Britain 's Information Commissioner Richard Thomas into the spread of surveillance technology .
The report , drawn up by a team of respected academics , claims that Britain is a world - leader in the use of surveillance technology and its citizens the most spied - upon in the free world .
It paints a frightening picture of what Britain might be like in ten years time unless steps are taken to regulate the use of CCTV and other spy technologies .
The reports editors Dr David Murakami Wood , managing editor of the journal Surveillance and Society and Dr Kirstie Ball , an Open University lecturer in Organisation Studies , claim that by 2016 our almost every movement , purchase and communication could be monitored by a complex network of interlinking surveillance technologies .
The most contentious prediction is the spread in the use of Radio Frequency Identification ( RFID ) technology .
The RFID chips - which can be detected and read by radio waves - are already used in new UK passports and are also used the Oyster card system to access the London Transport network .
For the past six years European countries have been using RFID chips to identify pet animals .
Already used in America
However , its use in humans has already been trialled in America , where the chips were implanted in 70 mentally - ill elderly people in order to track their movements .
And earlier this year a security company in Ohio chipped two of its employees to allow them to enter a secure area .
The glass - encased chips were planted in the recipients ' upper right arms and ' read ' by a device similar to a credit card reader .
In their Report on the Surveillance Society , the authors now warn : " The call for everyone to be implanted is now being seriously debated . "
The authors also highlight the Government 's huge enthusiasm for CCTV , pointing out that during the 1990s the Home Office spent 78 per cent of its crime prevention budget - a total of £ 500 million - on installing the cameras .
There are now 4.2 million CCTV cameras in Britain and the average Briton is caught on camera an astonishing 300 times every day .
This huge enthusiasm comes despite official Home Office statistics showing that CCTV cameras have ' little effect on crime levels ' .
They write : " The surveillance society has come about us without us realising " , adding : " Some of it is essential for providing the services we need : health , benefits , education .
Some of it is more questionable .
Some of it may be unjustified , intrusive and oppressive . "
Yesterday Information Commissioner Richard Thomas , whose office is investigating the Post Office , HSBC , NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland over claims they dumped sensitive customer details in the street , said : " Many of these schemes are public sector driven , and the individual has no choice over whether or not to take part . "
" People are being scrutinised and having their lives tracked , and are not even aware of it . "
He has also voiced his concern about the consequences of companies , or Government agencies , building up too much personal information about someone .
He said : " It can stigmatise people .
I have worries about technology being used to identify classes of people who present some kind of risk to society .
And I think there are real anxieties about that . "
Yesterday a spokesman for civil liberties campaigners Liberty said : " We have got nothing about these surveillance technologies in themselves , but it is their potential uses about which there are legitimate fears .
Unless their uses are regulated properly , people really could find themselves living in a surveillance society .
" There is a rather scary underlying feeling that people may worry that these microchips are less about being a human being than becoming a barcoded product . "
Superb !
Now I 'll feel so much safer .
With all the cameras spying , I mean looking after me I will feel invincible .
No criminal or terrorist will dare mess with the UK again .CCTV obviously stops crime , anti-social behavior and terrorism AND they make good trash TV .
Well we 'll ignore that like the ignorant humans we have turned into .
I feel much safer honest .
Hell I feel like a contestant on Big Brother !
I hope the fascist spies sorry camera operators do n't laugh when I 'm in the shower .
Its totally uplifting that the government have wa .. err spent 500 million on CCTV .
Super dooper - stop complaining you people on the NHS 's waiting list especially my uncle who is still waiting for a back operation ( 5 years and counting ) .
Now uncle you will have people watching you uncomfortably walking around , now that is progress !
Still its78 % of the crime prevention budget .
Its definitely a positive .
There is still one thing nagging me .
I 'm still working out how CCTV actually prevents crime , but being a sheep I 'll agree with CCTV and not look at it logically .
Maybe they 'll shoot lasers or maybe they 'll get people shouting at you to stop being so naughty ( Hmmm I 'm getting a deju-vu moment - see here - scroll to 25th September )
Now there are serious plans in place to have us all micro-chipped quite literally like sheep .
Does n't the bible warn us against this - the mark of the beast ?
666 and all that ?
It 's not like the UPC barcode has 666 in every barcode .. hang on ...
Blimey 666 is on every UPC barcode ( it 's on me beer can , its on me recently bought DVD ) !
Still that does n't mean anything , it is just one of them silly little coincidences .
Anyway that is beside the point .
Which sheep I mean human would not want to be chipped ?
The state would be able to track our every moment and correlate your chip with CCTV and know exactlyand what Great .
I will be definitely safe from terrorism and crime because they 'll be able to erm stop them somehow .
But it works honest .
We 've seen a massive reduction in crime in the UK .
Really we have .
Maybe if I keep saying it I can convince myself .
I bet they 'll debate it with us Joe Public like they did with us say like going into War with Iraq / Afghanistan .
Phew good job we agreed with Mr Bliar , I 'm sure we'd be microwaved right now with all their nasty Weapons of MASS DESTRUCTION .
Oh looking forward to the trial of Bin Laden .
Should be good TV.I 'm also totally sure that these RFID chips will be totally hack proof .
It 's mega advanced technology .
So I feel safe that my personal data will be secure and the state wo n't use the info for their own agenda .
SHUT UP - Stop using logical and well thought out arguments !
Do n't you realise in order to obtain liberty and freedom :
Fed up with using up so many batteries ?
Rechargeables giving you poor mileage ?
Then why not try a couple of sweet potatoes instead .
In this “ video tutorial ” , you ’ll learn how to use a couple of galvanized ( zinc coated ) nails , some bare copper wire , a pair of mini crocodile clips , AND two sweet potatoes , to power up your mp3 player with not a conventional battery in sight .
Great video and the music ’s sweet too .

This appliance is , of course , closely related to the lemon battery ( or more formally lemon cell ) familiar to anyone who ’s searched for a high school science project .
Two different metallic objects dipped into a conduction solution ( an electrolyte ) will produce an electrochemical reaction the byproduct of which is electricity .
A single lemon is usually enough to illuminate a flashlight bulb , but two sweet potatoes are apparently required for an mp3 player .
Yes , it reduces the portability of your player , but just think … no more buying batteries !
Of course , things might get a bit smelly as those sweet potatoes ( Ipomoea batatas ) start to go off .

The regular Coca - Cola recipie sold in the U.S. uses high - fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) as its sweetener .
And being soda , there 's quite a lot of it .
According to Wikipedia on Coke 's HFCS use
Since 1985 in the U.S. , Coke has been made with high fructose corn syrup instead of sucrose to reduce costs . [...]
Though the Coca - Cola company claims that there is no difference in taste , many people claim to prefer Coke made with sugar . [...]
Kosher for Passover Coke is also made with sugar , rather than corn syrup , due to the special dietary restrictions for observant Jews ( Orthodox Jews are prohibited from consuming corn during this period ) during the holiday .
Here 's a more detailed explanation of Passover Coke .
HFCS , like most corn products , is very cheap in the U.S. because of corn-farming subsidies and very high supply .
Most packaged foods and drinks in the U.S. use HFCS instead of sucrose ( regular " sugar " ) only because it 's significantly cheaper , despite some preliminary research that may indicate that it 's unhealthy and leads to obesity and diabetes .
( I think this is ignoring the obvious : overconsumption of any sugar leads to obesity and diabetes . )
Many die - hard Coke fans are convinced that its reformulation with HFCS damaged the taste , claiming that the sucrose version was less " sticky " or had a better aftertaste .
To test this assertion , I purchased Passover Coke and did a blind test ( good idea , Tiff , and thanks for conducting it ) to determine which tasted better .
My verdict :
I could tell there was a difference when I was looking for one .
It 's pretty obvious once you pin down exactly what the difference is .
( But that 's not easy . )
But it 's not such an extreme difference that I 'd notice which one I was drinking if I was casually drinking one of them while doing something else .
I preferred the Passover Coke , even before the identities were revealed .
The Passover Coke was less sweet when it first hit my tongue , and the sweetness faded more quickly .
Regular ( HFCS )
Coke had a lingering too - sweet aftertaste , as if I had n't brushed my teeth in a while .
Passover Coke distinctly lacked this .
That 's about it .
If I was a die - hard Coke fanatic ( I 'm not , and I rarely drink soda ) , it would certainly be worth trying to find some Passover Coke for curiosity 's sake .
But it 's not worth driving to a different state or mail - ordering it .
Yesterday I was flying across the country .
My biggest fear when flying is n’t that the jet might crash ; it ’s that I might end up sitting next to the World ’s Most Annoying Man for five hours .
Theoretically , such a person exists .
I mean , SOMEONE has to be the most annoying man in the world .
And there ’s a good chance that he flies .
After yesterday , I ’m reasonably sure that he looks like Mr. Clean on crack , and he was sitting next to me in seat 3D .
As you know , when people use headphones , they talk too loudly because they can’t hear themselves .
I learned that this phenomenon extends to nasal sounds in the sniff - snort category .
Mr. Clean on crack was rocking out to his iPod and sniff - snorting so loudly every few seconds that the flight crew kept looking out the window to see if a pterodactyl was attacking the fuselage .
Oh , I ’m just getting started .
The World ’s Most Annoying Man enjoyed whatever was on the little airplane TV after the feature film .
He displayed his happiness by rocking back and forth and making a sound like a horse with his ‘ nads caught on a barbed wire fence .
It went something like EEYOOOREE - SNORT - SNIFF -EEEEYOOOREEE !
If you have ever tried to take a nap when Mr. Clean on crack is gelding himself next to you , then you know it is n’t easy .
The World ’s Most Annoying Man ordered a beer before takeoff .
And another every half hour .
Add to this picture his bladder that was the size of a mosquito ’s pancreas , and you can imagine how many times I had to unbuckle and rebuckle .
Several times he had to go see his “ assistant ” in the back of the plane , which turned out to be a failed mission twice because of a beverage cart and once because she was either asleep or pretending to be dead to avoid him .
I have n’t even gotten to the good part yet .
He was a tall , lanky guy with , with fingers like breadsticks .
Every few minutes he would grab some note paper and a pen , assume the “ brilliant idea ” pose , and then , I ’m guessing , realizing he was more drunk than inspired , write a few words and …God help me …drum his fingers .
Now when I say “ drum his fingers , ” I do not mean softly or just a few times .
I mean every few seconds for an hour he would go into a drum solo on his tray table that was apparently intended to jumpstart his brain and squeeze out that nugget of brilliance that was drowning in Heineken somewhere in his cerebellum .
I glanced over at his notes a few times just to see if he was writing a solution to string theory or the first chapter of a great novel .
But I think it was a cross between gibberish and whatever aspires to be gibberish .
The finger drumming , like his snort - sniffing , was extra loud because he still had on the headphones .
Those breadstick - fingers were banging louder than Paris Hilton locked in a steel drum with a hot robot .
It bothered me so much that I lost my ability to make good analogies .
He tried once to make conversation with me .
“ Going home ? ” he asked .
I avoided that trap like a hamster avoids a Richard Gere film festival .
( See ? I ’m damaged . )
“ Going to work , ” I answered .
Had he asked what kind of work , I was ready to explain my career as an actuary .
No one can survive that for more than five minutes without slipping into a coma .
It ’s a drastic measure , but at that point it was either him or me .
And my level of self - loathing did n’t even come close to my desire to kill him .
So it would have been him .
Luckily for him , he went back to his nonverbal methods of being annoying , and thus inadvertently saved his life .
Next time I need to cross the country , I ’m walking .
SEOUL ( Reuters ) - A faster , quieter laptop has arrived , with cool , lightweight flash chips where the hot - and - heavy hard drive once sat , but limited capacity and high prices mean the technology is not yet ready for the mass market .

A faster , quieter laptop has arrived , with cool , lightweight flash chips where the hot - and - heavy hard drive once sat , but limited capacity and high prices mean the technology is not yet ready for the mass market .
REUTERS / Hannibal Hanschke
It wo n’t take too long .
Prices of flash memory , used currently in cameras , phones and iPods , are falling by half each year and analysts expect around 20 percent of new laptops to be running on flash drives by 2010 .
Fujitsu Ltd has begun selling a 32 GB flash - drive laptop to corporate users willing to pay $ 1,399 extra , and there is speculation that Apple Inc. and Sony Corp. will be next to launch machines with solid - state drives ( SSDs ) , as they are known in the sector .
“ Once the SSD wave is launched , the pace of change could be extremely fast , ” said An Sung - ho , a Hannuri Securities analyst .
That would bring a welcome new boost to flash memory chip makers such as Hynix Semiconductor , Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Toshiba Corp , analysts say , who are always looking for new markets they can make money in before others catch up and prices slide .
“ Chip makers will be the key beneficiary , ” An said .
“ Card makers like SanDisk have also invested in this and should be able to get a piece in the growing market . ”
For consumers , flash drives promise laptops that are lighter , faster and wo n’t burn their knees .
Flash drives are half the weight of hard disks .
With no moving parts , they are more sturdy and they can process data much faster , while the lack of a noisy motor or spinning disk means they consume less than half the power and generate less heat .
READY AND WAITING
Tech - savvy university student Shin Dong - hoon , in Seoul , has bought a new LG laptop computer for 2.4 million won ( $ 2,600 ) but he is already frustrated with it .
The battery -- working hard to keep the hard disk whirring -- can not last a day of class note - taking , report writing , Internet browsing and emailing .
“ The hard disk consumes too much power and it ’s too heavy , ” Shin complained , adding he would have been willing to pay an extra $ 200 for a flash drive model , although that is still well short of the current cost .
Sentiments like that offer a less - than - rosy outlook for hard disk makers such as Seagate Technology
Analysts say hard disks will be around for a long time and they are still around one - eighth of the price of an equivalent flash drive , but they say falling flash prices could lead to a damaging price war .
Similarly , any extra margin PC makers enjoy from the new product will be limited as they will have to buy in the technology from specialist flash chip makers .
The first generation of flash drive laptop buyers are likely to be heavy - duty users in the military or on construction sites , where laptops face bumps , drops and vibration , companies say .
COST , CAPACITY
Fujitsu ’s 32 GB flash drive LifeBook model is on offer to U.S. corporate customers but , at something approaching double the price of a hard - disk model , it is not yet ready for everyone .
“ The price gap is still there , ” said Michael Wang , the president of Quanta Computer Inc. , the world ’s biggest contract maker of laptops .
“ I do n’t see it going mainstream in the next three years . ”
Storage capacity is another issue , as 128 GB is the maximum flash drive capacity currently available , making it hard to compete with hard drives for desktop computers .
But analysts say these problems may be solved sooner than the industry thinks .
By 2010 , 32 million new laptops a year could be powered by flash drives , up from just 4 million now , research firm Gartner said in a recent report .
By then , it forecasts , one in six laptops sold to business customers will use a flash drive instead of a hard disk drive , despite reduced storage space .
Others say flash drives could account for a fifth of all laptop sales by then but Nam Kim , principal analyst at research firm iSuppli , says such forecasts may understate the progress of NAND flash drives .
“ By the end of 2008 , flash memory prices could become very competitive for PC makers , ” he said .
Apple , which changed the way the world listens to music with its iPods and is a big user of flash memory , may crack the mass market first .
It may launch a flash - based sub - notebook the size of a paper - back book later this year , research house American Technology Research says .
Another stepping stone could be drives with both an old - fashioned hard disk and a flash new one .
Samsung sells a notebook with such a hybrid drive for $ 1,900 in South Korea , about $ 400 more than a previous hard - disk model with similar power .
Of course , if price is no object , almost anything is possible .
UK luxury firm Luvaglio reportedly offers a 128 GB flash - based laptop for the modest sum of $ 1 million , complete with diamond - encrusted power switch .

And I suspect that 's something Sanchez might like .
Anyway , Alan Colmes of Hannity & Colmes was kind enough to send me a clip of his interview yesterday with Sanchez on his radio show .
Sanchez claims , among other things , that he's not gay , and that his male prostitution clients were n't gay either .
He also said that he had n't done gay porn or prostitution in 15 years .
Holmes corrected him , pointing out a " massage " ad for Sanchez ' services placed only 3 years ago .
I 'd also point out that IMDB says that Sanchez ' last movie was 1999 , that 's 8 years ago , not 15 .
You can listen to Sanchez twist himself in knots here ( no video , just audio ) :
In order to understand how civilizations have evolved over time , it 's useful to look at population growth and decline in different geographic areas .
Tertius Chandler 's compilation of the population of cities throughout history , Four Thousand Years of Urban Growth : An Historical Census uses a wide variety of historical sources to locate approximate populations for the world 's largest cities since 3100 BCE .
It 's a daunting task to try to calculate how many people lived in urban centers prior to recorded history .
Even though the Romans were the first to conduct a census , requiring every Roman man to register every five years , other societies were not as diligent about tracking their populations .
Widespread plagues , natural disasters with a large loss of life and wars that decimated societies ( from both the aggressor and the conquered points of view ) often provide unfortunate clues to historians for a given population 's size .
But with few written records , and very little uniformity among societies that may be hundreds of miles apart , trying to determine whether China 's pre-modern era cities were more populous than India 's , for instance , is no easy task .
Counting Pre-Census Population Growth
The challenge for Chandler and other historians is the lack of formal census - taking before the 18th century .
His approach was to look at smaller pieces of data to try to create a clear picture of populations .
This included examining travelers ' estimates , data on the numbers of households within cities , the numbers of food wagons arriving in cities and the size of each city or state 's military .
He looked at church records and the loss of lives in disasters .
Many of the figures Chandler presented can only be considered rough approximations of the urban population , but most include the city and surrounding suburban or urbanized area .
What follows is a list of the largest city at each point in history since 3100 BCE .
It lacks population data for many cities but does provide a list of the largest cities throughout time .
By looking at the first and second lines of the table , we see that Memphis remained the largest city in the world from at least 3100 BCE to 2240 BCE when Akkad claimed the title .
SENATOR JOHN GRUBESIC PRESS RELEASE - ” …
Very few of us want to deal with the unpleasant political mess that impeachment could become .
Our actions today showed where our priorities are , we forgot that the Constitution was not designed to serve government , but to protect the people .
There should have been a debate , argument , uproar .

Senator slams ex-general , but she was in the audience Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday February 13 , 2007 Print This Email This During an event last night , a prominent Republican senator took a swipe at the conduct of the general who oversaw the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , only to learn that she was sitting in the audience , and ready to fire back at his statement , according to an item at last night 's Wall Street Journal website .
In the Journal 's Washington Wire blog , reporter Jess Bravin reports that former Brigadier - General Janis Karpinski and Senator Lindsey Graham were both in attendance at an event in Washington Monday night , following the screening of an HBO documentary by Rory Kennedy called Ghosts of Abu Ghraib .
However , Graham , a former Air Force lawyer , arrived after some brief introductory remarks , and did n't know Karpinski had already been introduced .
As Graham spoke , according to Bravin , he proceeded to declare that Karpinski , who commanded a military police unit that included the soldiers in the infamous Abu Ghraib photos , " got off easy with a demotion to colonel .
She should have faced a court - martial . "
The moderator of the event offered Karpinski a chance to respond to the senator .
 Sen. Graham I consider you as cowardly as Rumsfeld , as Sanchez , and Miller and all of them ,  she said , referring to her superiors in the military and Defense Department .
Karpinski claims she took the blame for a situation they created at Abu Ghraib .
Graham stood by his statement , saying that Karpinski was responsible for what happened on the ground .
He also noted " Ive probably lost your vote , " as the former highest - ranking female officer in Iraq lives in his state .
Bravin's item can be read at the Washington Wire blog 's website .
With not even twenty - four hours passed since the tragedy at Virginia Tech , and already the New York Times has taken the lead in turning it into a political issue :
Yesterdayâ€™s mass shooting at Virginia Tech â€ ” the worst in American history â€ ” is another horrifying reminder that some of the gravest dangers Americans face come from killers at home armed with guns that are frighteningly easy to obtain .
Not much is known about the gunman , who killed himself , or about his motives or how he got his weapons , so it is premature to draw too many lessons from this tragedy .
But it seems a safe bet that in one way or another , this will turn out to be another instance in which an unstable or criminally minded individual had no trouble arming himself and harming defenseless people .
Here ’s a memo to the editors at the Times .
Guns have been widely available for a long time .
Fifty years ago , they were more widely available than they are now and gun control laws were unheard of .
And yet things like this did not happen , at least not as frequently as they seem to now .
This is n’t about the guns , it ’s about people .
It ’s about the failure of law enforcement to protect citizens .
And it ’s about laws that prevent people from even having the opportunity to defend themselves .
And , most importantly , it ’s about one man who was on a mission to kill .
Gun control laws wo n’t stop a person like that , as events in Europe have confirmed more than once .
No , this is n’t about the guns at all .

For the past week I 've been tracking my girlfriend through her mobile phone .
I can see exactly where she is , at any time of day or night , within 150 yards , as long as her phone is on .
It has been very interesting to find out about her day .
Now I 'm going to tell you how I did it .
First , though , I ought to point out , that my girlfriend is a journalist , that I had her permission ( " in principle ... " ) and that this was all in the name of science , bagging a Pulitzer and paying the school fees .
You have nothing to worry about , or at least not from me .
But back to business .
First I had to get hold of her phone .
It was n't difficult .
We live together and she has no reason not to trust me , so she often leaves it lying around .
And , after all , I only needed it for five minutes .
I unplugged her phone and took it upstairs to register it on a website I had been told about .
It looks as if the service is mainly for tracking stock and staff movements : the Guardian , rather sensibly , does n't want me to tell you any more than that .
I ticked the website 's terms and conditions without reading them , put in my debit card details , and bought 25 GSM Credits for £ 5 plus vat .
Almost immediately , my girlfriend 's phone vibrated with a new text message .
" Ben Goldacre has requested to add you to their Buddy List !
To accept , simply reply to this message with ' LOCATE ' " .
I sent the requested reply .
The phone vibrated again .
A second text arrived : " WARNING : [ this service ] allows other people to know where you are .
For your own safety make sure that you know who is locating you . "
I deleted both these text messages .
On the website , I see the familiar number in my list of " GSM devices " and I click " locate " .
A map appears of the area in which we live , with a person - shaped blob in the middle , roughly 100 yards from our home .
The phone does n't go off at all .
There is no trace of what I 'm doing on her phone .
I can't quite believe my eyes : I knew that the police could do this , and telecommunications companies , but not any old random person with five minutes access to someone else 's phone .
I can't find anything in her mobile that could possibly let her know that I 'm checking her location .
As devious systems go , it 's foolproof .
I set up the website to track her at regular intervals , take a snapshot of her whereabouts automatically , every half hour , and plot her path on the map , so that I can view it at my leisure .
It felt , I have to say , exceedingly wrong .
By the time my better half got home , I was so childishly over - excited that I managed to keep all of this secret for precisely 30 seconds .
And to my disappointment , she was n't even slightly freaked out .
I do n't know if that says good or bad things about our relationship and I would n't want you to come away thinking it's all a bit " Mr & Mrs Smith " around here .
Having said that , we came up with at least five new uses for this technology between us in a few minutes , all far more sinister than anything I had managed to concoct on my own .
And that , for me , was the clincher .
Your mobile phone company could make money from selling information about your location to the companies that offer this service .
If you have any reason to suspect that your phone might have been out of your sight , even for five minutes , and there is anyone who might want to track you : call your phone company and ask it to find out if there is a trace on your phone .
Anybody could be watching you .
It could be me .

American Idol runner - up Katharine McPhee has a movie career to look forward to after finding a fan in director Steven Spielberg .
The California girl lost out to Taylor Hicks on Wednesday night , but she might become a winner after movie mogul Spielberg requested a private audience with the stunning brunette .
Backstage after the Idol final , McPhee told news show Extra , “ Steven Spielberg would like to have a meeting with me .
That , for me I think , was the thing that really made this last week calming for me .
“ I just was like , ‘ Wow , Steven Spielberg would like to have a meeting with me . ’
That ’s incredible !
I think that was the moment where I turned to a couple of my close friends , who have been through this competition , and I was like , ‘ I do n’t know if winning is the best thing for me . ' ”

Corewar
What Exactly is Corewar ?
Corewar is a game in which players attempt to seize control of a virtual computer by writing programs in a minimal assembly language .
Programs are written using basic instructions like MOV to copy an instruction , ADD to add the numbers in one instruction to another and JMP to transfer control to a different instruction .
If you think you can handle Corewar , the Beginner 's Guide to Redcode comes highly recommended .
New players should take a look at the top 10 links for Corewar Newbies !
Next Steps in Corewar
Once you 've learnt the basics of Redcode programming , the next step is to read about the most effective strategies .
Introduction to Art in ' 88 presents a good overview .

In a massive three - year study by the UN on climate change , to be release this coming Friday , the U.S. appeals for the world ’s scientists to develop technology to block sunlight as a last - ditch way to halt global warming .
I kid you not .
Stop laughing .
The report is being prepared by the the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , and “ will underpin international negotiations to devise a new emissions treaty to succeed Kyoto , the first phase of which expires in 2012 .
World governments were given a draft of the report last year and invited to comment . ”
The US response , which was obtained by the UK newspaper , The Guardian , says , “ the idea of interfering with sunlight should be included in the summary for policymakers , the prominent chapter at the front of each IPCC report .
It says : “ Modifying solar radiance may be an important strategy if mitigation of emissions fails .
Doing the R&D to estimate the consequences of applying such a strategy is important insurance that should be taken out .
This is a very important possibility that should be considered . ”
Now , get ready for the real clincher : Possible techniques for reducing sunlight include : A giant screen ( to keep the aliens out .
Bush hates aliens ) , thousands of tiny , shiny balloons , or “ or microscopic sulphate droplets pumped into the high atmosphere to mimic the cooling effects of a volcanic eruption . ”
The IPCC , of course , said that most of these ideas were “ ” speculative , uncosted and with potential unknown side - effects ” . ”
Can January 2009 come any sooner ?
Can the U.S. stop looking like asses and actually become a leader on not just global emissions , but also world - wide pollution and energy innovation ?
Balloons ?
Space mirrors ?
This is what we come up with instead of reforming our energy infrastructure or regulating our emissions ?
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Five - and - a- half years after the September 11 attacks , President George W. Bush ’s war on terrorism has emerged as a wasteful , misguided exercise that poses its own threat to U.S. national security , experts say .
U.S. soldiers secure the area at the site of a local council during their session with U.S. forces to discuss local affairs in Baghdad 's northwest Sunni neighbourhood of Ghazaliya March 27 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Fabrizio Bensch
A growing number of analysts and former U.S. officials say the global war on terrorism has undermined U.S. influence abroad , forced onerous costs in American lives and money in Iraq , and unleashed a huge government spending spree that has often funded projects unrelated to national security .
It has also produced a climate of fear in the United States that helped justify the war in Iraq and the curtailment of civil liberties at home , they said .
“ The atmosphere of anxiety and uncertainty , and the vagueness of the definition of the enemy , makes the country more fearful and more susceptible to being steered in irrational directions , ” said Zbigniew Brzezinski , who was U.S. national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter in the 1970s .
Unlike the muted response to attacks by Britain and Spain , experts say the U.S. has overreacted to the September 11 attacks that killed 3,000 people in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania in 2001 .
Congress has spent nearly $ 271.5 billion on homeland security since September 11 , with money often going to projects that have nothing to do with security but that are important to politicians and their constituents , according to a survey by the conservative American Enterprise Institute .
At the same time , the number of potential terrorism targets identified by Congress has exploded from 160 in 2003 to 80,000 , allowing such unlikely sites as a Midwestern apple festival and a roadside theme park in Florida to bid for funds .
Meanwhile , the private sector -- lobbyists , interest groups , industries , the media and even universities -- has also used the national security label aggressively to sell its own agendas , experts say .
“ What ’s clear is that there is no focus whatsoever in the way we are fighting terrorism , ” said Veronique de Rugy , author of the AEI study .
Department of Homeland Security spokesman Russ Knocke dismissed the criticism as old and inaccurate , saying the Bush administration had never viewed sites such as small theme parks to be critical national assets deserving of funds .
“ This has no basis in fact , ” he said .
Knocke ’s boss , Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , has also taken issue with the assertion that the U.S. response to September 11 is exaggerated .
“ If we begin to heed arguments that somehow our concern about security is overblown ... then I feel we ’re going to feel consequences in the loss of lives , ” Chertoff said in a speech outlining his priorities for 2007 .
But terrorism experts say the United States has yet to develop a clear understanding of the threat posed by al Qaeda and other Islamist militant groups , despite the war on terrorism and a total of $ 500 billion spent on wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The most pernicious effect of the war on terrorism has been the Iraq war , which has claimed the lives of more than 3,200 U.S. troops and tens of thousands of Iraqi civilians and damaged U.S. standing in the Muslim world for generation , experts say .
“ Iraq has been vastly worse than anything terrorism ’s ever done , ” said Ohio State University political science professor John Mueller , author of a book about the war on terrorism titled , “ Overblown . ”
While both Democrats and Republicans have acknowledged the shortcomings of U.S. policy in Iraq , experts say politicians have not questioned the war on terrorism mainly because it remains a vote - getter .
“ Politicians are acting this way because they think they ’ll lose votes if they do n’t .
Basically , it ’s a big pork - barrel , so the pork - barrel leaders are there in five seconds , ” said Mueller , using American vernacular for the politics of self - enrichment .
It 's true that rules are made to be broken , but here are the rules that you never break .
Ever .
Follow every rule you do n't understand .
Only break rules you fully understand and have good reason to break .
There 's a real temptation amongst creative types that they should be mavericks and rule breakers .
That 's creative innit ?
Well , of course it is … up to a point .
Creative rule breaking is what separates the good from the really good , the mundane from the sublime .
It 's also what turns the good into the terrible .
Novices involve themselves in all sorts of rule breaking .
Often they do n't know that the rule is there , but often they break it because they do n't think it applies or they do n't understand it .
If you 're doing this then feel free on your own private projects , but do n't to it to one of your customers ' .
Your creative approach amounts to this :
Ignore rules you do n't understand .
Any excuse to break a rule is fine .
When put like this it seems obvious why we should follow those rules we do n't understand : if we understood it properly then somebody else would n't have felt the need to make a rule about it !
It 's Ok ( up to a point ) if you 're : learning ; and the project is a throw - away one ; and you 're breaking the rule in order to better understand its nature , but it really is n't good if you 're trying to do something to a deadline that actually has to work .
It is under pressure that the rules have the best utility and when breaking them is most dangerous .
We can only allow ourselves to break rules when we 're absolutely sure it'll work because we understand exactly why the rule is as it is .
And whilst there are still rules we do n't understand we still have a lot of learning to do .
When you examine somebody else 's code you 'll notice that they break all sorts of rules about how software should be written .
You should ask yourself if it is a stroke of genius or a stroke of something a lot less appealing .
Did the person truly understand what they were doing or did they just think they did ?
When we program there is a well of knowledge for us to draw upon which represents many wasted hours spent solving problems that should never have been .
The lessons learned from all these hours have then been condensed into a few good rules .
Following the rules wo n't stop us from doing stupid things , but they will make it more likely that we 'll do the right thing .
Some of the rules we all know ( and break at our peril )
As I publish articles about each of these in more depth they 'll move down to the section below .
If you have any good rules not covered then please login or register and start a new thread describing them .
Goto considered harmful .
Use small functions .
Loose coupling good , tight coupling bad .
Use meaningful variable and function names .
Comment what the code leaves out , not what the code already says .
There are lots more .
Man … is successful not because he knows why he ought to observe the rules which he does observe , or is even capable of stating all these rules in words , but because his thinking and acting are governed by rules which have by a process of selection been evolved in the society in which he lives , and which are thus the product of the experience of generations .

Israel is conducting a series of air strikes throughout Gaza .
CNN reports as many as eight air strikes in rapid succession , but the Jerusalem Post reports more than a dozen .
The attacks began at approximately 19:00 Eastern time , 02:00 local time .
IAF aircraft struck the Palestinian Interior Ministry in Gaza City .
There was no word of casualties as smoke and flames rose from the building .
The IDF called the site " a meeting place to plan and direct terror activity . "
The IAF also struck Gaza City offices belonging to Fatah and an arms factory used by Hamas to store and manufacture weapons , the army reported .
Other earlier reports indicate hitting a Hamas facility in Gaza City as well as roads and open fields in southern Gaza used by terror cells .
IDF officials reported that the strike was carried out following rocket fire at Israeli communities .

Millions were killed by the virus
The lungs of infected monkeys were destroyed in just days as their immune systems went into overdrive after a Canadian laboratory rebuilt the virus .
The reason for the lethal nature of the 1918 flu was never fully understood .
But the experts behind this test say they have found a human gene which may help explain its unusual virulence .
This research provides an important piece in the puzzle of the 1918 virus
Darwyn Kobasa
Public Health Agency of Canada
They are hoping to help control any future pandemic and believe that the strain may hold clues that will help them .
Despite the large number of casualties at the time , doctors had no way to preserve tissue samples taken from infected patients , so researchers used an ingenious method to overcome this .
Frozen body
The preserved body of a flu victim buried in Arctic permafrost was exhumed , and they painstakingly extracted the genetic material needed to work out the structure of the H1N1 virus .
Then , in a maximum " biosafety " facility at Canada 's National Microbiology Laboratory they reconstructed a fully functioning virus , and infected macaque monkeys to see what would happen .
Writing in the journal Nature , they reported that the results were startling .
Symptoms appeared within 24 hours of exposure to the virus , and the subsequent destruction of lung tissue was so widespread that , had the monkeys not been killed a few days later , they would literally have drowned in their own blood .
The results match those seen when mice were infected in an earlier study and are very similar to those described in human patients at the time the virus was at its height .
Dangerous virus
Darwyn Kobasa , a research scientist with the Public Health Agency of Canada , and lead author of the research , defended the decision to recreate one of the most dangerous viruses in history .
He said : " This research provides an important piece in the puzzle of the 1918 virus , helping us to better understand influenza viruses and their potential to cause pandemics . "
However , it is not the virus that is directly causing the damage to the lungs - it is the body 's own response to infection .
Immune system proteins that can damage infected tissue were found at much higher levels following H1N1 infection compared with other viral infections .
Analysis at the University of Wisconsin at Madison ( UW ) revealed that a key component of the immune system , a gene called RIG - 1 appeared to be involved .
Levels of the protein produced by the gene were lower in tissue infected with the 1918 virus , suggesting it had a method of switching it off , causing immune defences to run wild .
Many influenza virologists remain nervous about creating and experimenting with a reconstructed 1918 Spanish flu virus
Dr Jim Robertson
National Institute of Biological Standards and Control
This ability to alter the body 's immune response is shared with the most recent candidate for mutation into a pandemic strain , the H5N1 avian flu .
Experts are worried that if the virus changes so that it can infect humans easily , it could again be far more lethal than normal seasonal flu .
" What we see with the 1918 virus in infected monkeys is also what we see with H5N1 viruses , " said Yoshihiro Kawaoka , who led the analysis at UW .
" Things may be happening at an early time point ( in infection ) , but we may be able to step in and stop that reaction . "
Preparing for pandemic
Dr Ronald Cutler , an infectious diseases researcher at the University of East London , said : " Knowing how that over stimulation takes place could lead to the development of new methods to treat these diseases so we are better prepared for any future pandemic . "
Dr Jim Robertson from the UK's National Institute for Biological Standards and Control , said the decision to recreate the virus was justified .
" Many influenza virologists remain nervous about creating and experimenting with a reconstructed 1918 Spanish flu virus , an extremely dangerous virus which disappeared from the world long ago .
" However , it can not be denied that the information that has been derived from this experiment is exciting and represents an important milestone in understanding the severity of these highly pathogenic types of influenza viruses . "
Once the most iconic recluse in the music business , Dylan will spring a surprise on fans next month by broadcasting a weekly music show across America .
His debut behind the mic , due to be broadcast on 3 May , has been heard exclusively in advance by The Observer .
As the quaint title , Theme Time Radio Hour , implies , it is a simple format , even old - fashioned .
Taking a different theme each week , Dylan introduces his favourite records with a wry line or pithy anecdote , then lets the music do the talking .
First is ' weather ' .
Sounding utterly imperturbable in his new role , he drawls in characteristically rhythmic tones : ' Today 's show , all about the weather .
Curious about what the weather looks like ?
Just look out your window , take a walk outside .
We 're gonna start out with the great Muddy Waters , one of the ancients by now , who all moderns prize . '
He has been provided with a digital recording kit so that he can present the hour - long programme from home , studio or tour bus .
He sends a playlist to XM Satellite Radio 's researchers , who then assemble the music around his narration .
Future shows will be built around themes such as ' cars ' , ' dance ' , ' police ' and ' whisky ' and also feature special guests including songwriter Elvis Costello , film star Charlie Sheen , Penn Jillette , the TV illusionist , and comedians Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Kimmel .
Dylan will read and answer selected emails sent by listeners - a thrill for fans who have regarded him as a Messiah - like figure of unreachable mystique .
The playlist for the first show ranges from Muddy Waters 's ' Blow , Wind , Blow ' to Dean Martin's ' I Don't Care if the Sun Don't Shine ' , from Jimi Hendrix 's ' The Wind Cries Mary ' to Judy Garland 's ' Come Rain or Come Shine ' .
The list , much of it from the Fifties , offers a fascinating insight into the sources of Dylan 's musical inspiration .
But there is no place for the counter - culture hero's own nod to meteorological mischief , ' Blowin ' In The Wind ' .
Radio is a natural return to Dylan 's roots .
In his youth , Robert Zimmerman , as he was then called , was an avid listener , first to blues and country music stations broadcasting from New Orleans , then to the first stirrings of rock 'n'roll .
It took three years for XM 's chief creative programming officer , Lee Abrams , to persuade Dylan , 65 next month , to do the show .
He said : ' With Theme Time Radio Hour , Bob redefines " cool radio " by combining a sense of intellect with edginess in a way that has n't been on radio before .
Bob has put a lot of work into his XM show , and it 's clear that he 's having a good time behind the mic . '
XM , whose presenters include Dylan 's friend and fellow musician Tom Petty , is America 's biggest satellite radio service with more than 6.5 m subscribers and 170 digital channels .
As subscription - based , ad - free satellite radio grows rapidly in popularity , the Washington - based service is battling for listeners with Sirius , which poached ' shock jock ' Howard Stern from terrestrial radio in a £ 282 m five - year deal .
The Observer asked Charlie Gillett , the musicologist and BBC World Service DJ , to listen to Dylan 's debut .
He said : ' The programme is seamless and natural - it 's how radio should be .
His growly commentary is charming .
It draws you in and you never for a moment think he 's playing games , which he 's supposedly notorious for doing .
' In each case he 's got something to say and it all hangs beautifully together .
To put Jimi Hendrix and Judy Garland together and not make it sound weird is an impressive achievement .
The lack of adverts is also a big boon .
For his audience it 's absolutely perfect . '
Another Dylan devotee , poet laureate Andrew Motion , says of the playlist : ' It has a good mixture ; it may not enhance the legend , but it very engagingly confirms a good many things we know - about the eclecticism of his taste , and about his skill in combining light - heartedness with seriousness . '
The bad news for British fans is that , although the show can be heard online , it is available only to people with a US billing address .
So few here will hear Dylan sign off his first outing with the words : ' Well , the old clock on the wall says it 's time to go .
Until next week , you are all my sunshine .
If you think the summer sun is too hot , just remember , at least you do n't have to shovel it . '

Subject : DUDE !
Just got out of a 1 hour phone conference between Jeff Arnold and his VP ; the creators of WebMD ... not only was it a cool opportunity to just talk with these guys , but they 're extremely interested in the project and feel that the strategies in place are ideal !
Investors started calling and Ben had his funding secured within a couple weeks .
Now we had to start looking at everybody 's schedules and decide on a good time to converge on LA and get this thing started .
But hang on , why LA ?
We'd be pulling in the whole Expat Software team for this job , and we were sort of scattered at that point .
And besides , Los Angeles sucks .
How about we just pick a spot on the globe where we'd all like to spend some time , and then find a cheap rental house with fast internet access ?
All in favor ?
All opposed ?
Sorted .
At the top of the list was Antalya , Turkey .
A couple of us had been there before and we knew that there was good rock climbing nearby .
Oh yeah , did I forget to mention that that 's a priority ?
Here 's the list of requirements :
Good climbing ( and / or surfing ) , cheap accommodation , fast internet access .
Turkey met the first two but we never found a big enough place with DSL installed .
Kalymnos , Greece and Currumbin , Australia failed for similar reasons , and the island nation of Niue ( with its free WiFi coverage of the entire country ) was just too far off the map to get any good information about .
In the end , we fell back on the South of France .
Besides having the best climbing in the world , the Rhone Alps are a major ski destination during the winter .
That means that you can pick up a giant chalet for next to nothing if you show up in July .
Our six bedroom rental house in Chamonix ended up costing less than a comparably sized cube farm in LA , including airfare to fly everybody out and back .
Something worth thinking about next time you have a major project that needs doing in a hurry !
The two months we spent in Chamonix were among the most productive I 've ever known .
Each morning I 'd wake up to blue skies over the most amazing view of Mont Blanc .
I 'd brew up an espresso and take my croissants onto the balcony to enjoy another perfect summer morning .
I 'd boot up and slip into the zone , flowing smoothly and uninterrupted until dinner was served hours later .
In the evenings , we'd get the entire team together in the great room ; founder , developers , strategists and even a few hangers on to discuss the direction of the project , triage bugs , and flesh out designs for new features .
Wine would flow and brie would , uh , smear , and the creative process was let loose to do its thing .
I can't get over how good it was to have the whole team together in one house , cut off from the details of life and left with no choice but to focus on the task at hand .
Communication was a simple as dragging the client over to a couch .
" Issue 381 , what are you trying to accomplish with this ? "
" Could you draw me a quick sketch of how you want that to look ? "
Draw up a quick data model for the feature in question , and back to the table to code it up .
A couple hours later that new feature would be pushed to the QA server ( a laptop nestled amongst the bottles of the wine rack ) and ready to hit from anybody 's machine .
Weeks flew by , friends came and went , and we got to watch France and Italy battle it out in the world cup , while sitting astride the border between the two countries .
Eventually we had to pack up and go our separate ways , finally pushing Continuous Build 310 live as
That was six months ago , and we 've just finished a big planning session for the next year of operations .
It looks like this thing is actually going to start bringing in revenue earlier than anybody expected .
Finances are in place , and soon we 'll need to start thinking about another big development push .
I 'm already talking to real estate agents in Spain .
You 're never going to find good clients on the internet .
Pay attention , aspiring consultants out there because it 's true .
You can spend all the time you want at guru.com or scouring craigslist , and you 'll never once bag a client that will keep you fed for more than a month at a time .
You 're going to meet your clients the same way you met everybody else you know , through friends and by going out and doing things .
You 'll buy outrageously overpriced tickets to the Ballet for your girlfriend and the guy sitting next to you will ask what you do for a living .
" Hey , what a coincidence !
I 've got this great idea for a website . "
And you know this guy is squared away enough to see the project through because he 's spending his time ( and money ) at the Ballet and not on some free classified ad service on the web .
Seriously , if you want to completely overload yourself with work , just spend a week flying first class between Los Angeles and New York .

Blog advertising company Chitika has conducted an interesting analysis that compares the value of Digg traffic versus Google traffic .
Chitika ’s Co-Founder and CTO , Alden DoRosario , logged data over a 31 - day period in which he claims over a billion ad impressions occurred .
DoRosario ’s results ?
“ Digg traffic is more than 3 times less likely to click on an Ad than Google traffic .
Publishers who talk about Diggable topics like Apple , Games , Linux , etc. seemed to get Dugg a lot .
This indirectly confirms the demographic profile of the classic Digg user ( think college - going Internet power user ) . ”
Translation : Reputation management within the Google index trumps paying lackeys to furiously Digg throughout the day .

Transformation
I keep hearing people say they could n’t possibly use Ruby because it lacks automatic refactoring tools .
And although it will eventually have some of them , there ’s a class of automated refactorings that are automatable in Java but not in Ruby .
This , people say , is a show - stopper .
I wonder .
What exactly is refactoring ?
I mean , it ’s not a word in the dictionary .
Fowler tells us that it ’s the art and science of turning smelly code into good code , in small , incremental steps .
Provably correct , by construction .
Algorithms for giving your code a makeover without breaking it in the process .
He gives us a nice taxonomy .
He presents some good techniques , especially geared for Java programmers .
Some are things we had already figured out and are habitual , and some of them are new .
Some of these “ refactoring ” techniques are automatable .
And many of them are useful in languages other than Java .
It seems Fowler and friends have stumbled on something real , something as big as OOP , almost .
Or at least they were the first to market it and package it properly .
Either way , we know about it now .
Thank you , Fowler and friends !
Refactoring is one of the first programming books I ’ve seen that talks about the almost mystical act of writing code .
It takes the process , exposes all the insides , revels in it , walks you line by line through oh so many little decisions that affect code quality .
These are things most people never talk about .
They take them for granted .
Most people talk about “ architecture ” .
Refactoring talks about the idioms in the code we write every day .
Real now - code , not planned someday - code .
It ’s remarkable , really , that nobody talks about this .
They leave all the so - called style choices to the programmer .
Refactoring rubs our noses in the implications of our line - by - line style choices .
Beautiful .
Discovering Refactoring
Refactoring caught my eye in the bookstore one day in 2002 , years after it was published .
I had n’t read it because it was published by those UML weenies .
I ’ve just never been a fan .
It has its uses in database modeling ( maybe ) , but I ’ve never found it useful in class modeling .
And I ’ve never cared for the Booch / Jacobsen / etc. crowd ’s books .
Refactoring is right there , smack in the middle of that weenie series .
Every time I see it , my eyes sweep across the cover without a second glance .
You know the old saying !
But one wintery day in 2002 , I ’m in the bookstore , and I pick it up .
No real reason .
I ’m curious .
Do n’t know why .
Maybe I ’d finally heard the word “ refactoring ” somewhere .
What did it mean ?
It ’s not a word in the dictionary .
“ Factoring ” , sure , that ’s a dictionary word .
You can factor numbers , or polynomials .
Factoring I know .
Do n’t know why you ’d re-do it , though .
What ’s “ re ” -factoring ?
I open the book .
It says local variables are the root of all evil .
Perhaps not exactly those words , but it ’s the first discussion I stumble across .
Local variables !?
I plop down in a squashy armchair , outraged , to read more .
I want to know if this guy is actually insane , or merely an idiot .
Horror sets in : he ’s right .
His explanation makes chilling sense .
One of my cherished programming practices — caching intermediate values in local variables , as an inline performance optimization — is clearly demonstrated , before my very eyes in the squashy armchair , to be Evil .
It explains why I have certain methods in my code base that keep growing and growing , and for reasons I ’ve never been quite able to grok , the methods are unsplittable .
These big methods , they ’re the Bad Places .
The areas of the code base where I loathe to tread .
Dark caves that grow more evil every time I visit them .
Because add functionality I must , but the locals have threaded their way impenetrably through each function , spiderwebs that catch me and hold me .
The book shows me why they ’re unsplittable , then gives me axes to split them .
Sharp and precise tools .
And the techniques make sense , right then and there .
Some even appear to be automatable .
Wow .
I move on .
Turning pages faster , now .
Interested .
The book next tells me : do n’t comment my code .
Insanity again !
But once again , his explanation makes sense .
I resolve to stop writing one - line comments , and to start making more descriptive function and parameter names .
I buy the book , take it home , read it over and over .
I marvel .
It appears to be pure genius .
To this day , I still feel that way , although perhaps not so greatly as I did on that day .
But the book is a landmark , and it made me a better programmer overnight .
How often does that happen ?
Sudden embarrassment .
How could I not have read this back in 1998 ?
I ’m awash with a horrid cold feeling , as if I ’ve just learned I ’ve been coming to work for years with my pants down around my ankles .
Has everyone else at work already read this book ?
Am I the only one who did n’t know ?
I ask around the next day .
Casual .
Cool .
Not tipping my hand .
You ’ve read Refactoring , right ?
Nope .
Everyone I ask says No . Most have n’t heard of it .
Out of 20 developers I survey , only one guy has read it .
No surprise there , since he reads everything .
His vote ?
“ Yeah , that ’s a great book ! ”
I feel a rush of relief .
Most people do n’t know about it , then .
I ’m safe .
I can study it , use it , not worry that everyone will know how foolish my code has been .
My code had only been bad along a few dimensions .
Most of it was well - engineered .
I used design patterns , unit testing , source control , all the usual software engineering discipline .
It just smelled a little bad , and now I could fix it .
Refactoring Today
Everyone knows about Refactoring nowadays , because IDEs now have all of the automatable refactorings from the book , and a few extras to boot .
But despite its overnight popularity , I doubt most engineers have read Fowler ’s book , not even a few chapters of it .
I suspect most engineers today do n’t realize there are still many refactorings that are not automatable , even in Java .
Most of them , even .
Although that ’s a topic for another day .
Today , I still do n’t know exactly why they called it Refactoring .
Catchy , I guess .
It feels distantly related to factoring , in the math sense .
Reorganization ?
Too broad .
Refactoring seems fine .
Sometimes a good name is all that lies between a great idea and mass acceptance .
Refactoring today is an entire industry .
It ’s a banner .
It ’s the battle cry of Java - IDE lovers everywhere .
Refactoring tools are Productivity in a Bottle .
You browse a menu of refactorings , choose one , and the earth moves .
Why is automated refactoring so popular in the Java camp , and nowhere near as popular in other languages ?
Java people say it ’s because only Java allows you to accomplish this level of automation of code transformations .
Reprise
I keep hearing people say they could n’t possibly use Ruby because it lacks automatic refactoring tools .
And although it will eventually have some of them , there ’s a class of automated refactorings that are automatable in Java but not in Ruby .
This , people say , is a show - stopper .
I wonder .
I read Fowler .
I absorbed it .
It ’s the art and science of taking smelly code and turning it into better code , in small provable steps .
But he taught us something else , did n’t he ?
Oh , but you would n’t know what that thing is , if you have n’t read his book .
Have you ?
All of it ?
No skimming ?
C’mon now .
Admit it .
You skimmed .
Here ’s the deal : to show us the paths from bad code to good , Fowler had to show us bad code .
He showed us examples of what it looks like , and explained why it ’s bad .
He gave us a set of warning indicators and even called them “ Code Smells ” .
More clever marketing ?
Perhaps .
But they ’re right on the mark .
How did that code get smelly in the first place ?
Well , we optimized prematurely .
We stored too many intermediate values , for fear of recomputing them .
We did n’t write small functions , for fear of virtual method - call overhead .
We made bloated class heirarchies for the imagined benefits of reuse .
We made huge parameter lists to avoid allocating a container object .
We used null everywhere as a semantic token .
We allowed boolean - logic expressions to grow into unreadable thickets .
We failed to encapsulate data and data structures with accessor methods .
And many more bad things besides .
We were making dozens , hundreds of little mistakes that added up to some pretty smelly code .
The book catalogued our mistakes , gave them names , elevated them to First - Class Mistakes .
Then , presumably , we stopped making them ?
Well , maybe those of us who read the book .
Even if we read it late .
Better late than never .
After reading it , you know what bad code smells like , and you know how it got that way .
You ’ve learned how to avoid writing it .
At what point did automated refactoring tools become the focus ?
The book ’s original focus was about design , with tools for recovery .
Now the focus is all on recovery , and specifically on the automatable subset of recovery techniques .
The implicit assumption here is that bad code just happens , inevitably .
Even though we know all about its characteristics , and we know how to spot it instantly .
Heck , if you read the book , you know it was n’t just a catalog of 100 - odd specific refactorings .
It also presented themes .
Once you get the core ideas , you can invent your own refactorings , and identify new code smells .
And now you know better how to write the code correctly the first time around .
Oh , you disagree ?
Because code is a living thing , and requirements change constantly ?
Yes .
Code needs to change .
But Refactoring is n’t the whole story on code change ; it ’s a relatively small part .
There ’s data modeling , and architecture , and design patterns , all the high - level astronautics .
And of course the custom code - pattern transformations you apply almost daily that are n’t general enough to give first - class names .
Changing any of these things requires techniques that I assure you do not have entries in the Refactoring menu of your IDE .
Refactoring is zoomed waaay in .
It ’s focused on how you personally wrote this or that class or method , down at the level where you were making choices about local variables , control - flow constructs , and other micro-design decisions .
You now know how to avoid doing the wrong things , at that level .
Well — you know if you read the book , that is .
Without skimming .
And also , I suppose , only if you were already experienced enough for the book to stab at you like a blade , mocking you for not noticing every one of these things yourself , so that you will remember its lessons in your bones for the rest of your days .
Did Refactoring make us lazy ?
Maybe so .
Especially if we skimmed it , or just read the tools - half without reading the explanation - half .
Then maybe we think the whole story is about recovery from code that inevitably goes sour .
And even if you read the book , maybe those siren - song automatic refactorings have made you forget what the book was really about .
Namely , fixing your code and then never again writing so amateurishly .
Is this the whole story ?
No .
Do I sometimes still need to refactor my code ?
Yes .
Are there subtleties I ’m punting on for now ?
Yes .
Refactoring can’t really be discussed in a vacuum ; it ’s interdependent with other modern development ideas , including “ do n’t repeat yourself ” , “ once and only once ” , unit testing , and others .
I may revisit refactoring again in that context .
Today , though I ’m just interested in why Java programmers are saying that the ability to “ program ” by pushing buttons is so critically important to them that they ’re unwilling to consider using another language .
Even a language that ’s gaining rapid worldwide recognition as a step - function in productivity at least as great as Java was over C++ , with almost none of the downsides or friction of similar - looking predecessors like Perl and Python .
I mean , they wo n’t even consider trying Ruby ?
Gosh .
Pushing buttons must be… wonderful .
I close my eyes , envisioning that kind of power …
Pushbutton Productivity
Ah , those automated refactorings .
Such programming power — instant productivity with the click of a button .
Programming by Menu Selection .
Choose your automated attack , and the very earth moves .
Mechanical muscles moving mountains of code .
It ’s almost as if you ’re superhuman .
Programming never felt so much like a video game .
It must feel like piloting an earth - mover : a John Deere , a Komatsu , a Caterpillar — one of those huge yellow mechanical dinosaurs with the world ’s largest tires , the ones that held us in awe when we were children .
The driver pulls a lever , a hill of dirt moves aside .
The work of a hundred men in a day , accomplished with the bored flick of a wrist .
A lifeless yellow behemoth at your beck and call .
Now that ’s productivity .
If my job were moving mountains of dirt around , then I agree : I would not possibly be able to work effectively without an earth - mover , some tractors , a dump truck , maybe a crane or a backhoe .
My personal tools for refactoring the surface of the earth .
You could n’t pry my fingers from their hundred - ton hulks .
Caterpillar .
Such an odd name for a motorized Colossus .
Or is it ?
They named it after a little segmented bug .
All the segments look alike , repeating themselves .
Each segment has two identical tiny legs .
The legs have to move in coordinated waves to propel the bug forward .
So much computational processing devoted entirely to crawling around in the mud !
Yes , I see it now .
Caterpillars are long , machine - like insects .
Earth - movers are huge , insect - like machines .
It begins to make sense .
Automated code - refactoring tools work on caterpillar - like code .
You have some big set of entities — objects , methods , names , anything patterned .
All nearly identical .
You have to change them all in a coordinated way , like a caterpillar ’s crawl , moving all the legs or lines this way or that .
How did our code get that way to begin with ?
We wrote it badly .
Refactoring to the rescue .
Good design may be a lost cause , but we can recover , because we have automated servants to go fix all those little segments for us .
They never get tired , and all we have to do is push buttons .
Well then .
How could you possibly live without automated refactoring tools ?
How else could you coordinate the caterpillar - like motions of all Java ’s identical tiny legs , its thousands of similar parts ?
I ’ll tell you how :
Ruby is a butterfly .
The Dutch prosecutor 's office is considering legal actions to test the law against child porn in the popular virtual game Second Life .
With no clear litigation , it is difficult to act against perpetrators .
Kitty Nooij , who is in charge of the sex offences portfolio at the prosecutor 's office in the Netherlands , told Dutch news show Netwerk that she will try to bring cases to court so precedents can be set .
Linden Lab's Second Life is an online digital world with almost three million " residents " claimed by the company .
Some areas of Second Life allow adult members to have virtual sex with others who pretend to be children .
Experts , such as psychologist Jos Buschman of the Van Mesdag clinic in Groningen , say Second Life is " by definition a school for paedophiles " , despite the fact that adult members like to roleplay as children .
Second Life requires all players to be adults .
Virtual child pornography has been a criminal offence in the Netherlands since 2002 .
However , there is no litigation related to virtual sex with virtual children .
Today , at least four political parties in the Netherlands demanded a ban on virtual child porn roleplay .
Discussions about virtual child porn in Second Life already started three years ago with the introduction of an avatar called Sasami Wishbringer , who has the body of an eight year - old .
Lately , there are more serious reports about adult players with child avatars soliciting ( paid ) sex .
Last year , Robin Harper , Linden Lab vice president of community development , wrote in a posting on the official Second Life forum , that " if Second Life has evidence of child pornography or abuse that involves children in the real world , it will act to protect the child and notify the authorities " .
However , virtual roleplay is allowed . ®
Background
I have been arguing recently that , since about the middle of 2004 , Saudi Arabian oil production has been supply constrained , and that in particular the production declines since the middle of 2005 are not voluntary .
See Saudi Arabian Oil Declines 8 % in 2006 and A Nosedive Toward the Desert .
Also see , for a contrasting view , Euan Mearn 's posts Saudi Arabia and that $ 1000 Bet , and Saudi Production Laid Bare .
Behind the scenes , Euan and I have exchanged a lot of email trying to figure out the points of agreement between us , as well as the remaining areas of disagreement .
I see that Cambridge Energy Research Associates continues to have a radically different view of future ( 2015 ) oil supply :
Saudi Arabia was ranked No. 1 .
Its output was forecast by Cambridge to grow to 14.3 million barrels per day from 2005 output of 12.7 million bpd .
I suppose if one thinks they produced 12.7 mbpd in 2005 , then one is in fantasy land about the past , never mind the future .
I 'd like to start out this analysis by creating a lettering system for regions of interest in the Saudi production curve .
The hope is to give us a common terminology for what we are referring to .
I have lettered each separate feature ( as I see it - we could always subdivide later if needed ) , so that we can debate what is going on at each phase .
Here 's my scheme , superimposed on a graph that shows Saudi production at the bottom , oil rig count in the middle , and sales weighted price of OPEC exports at the top :
Top : Sales - weighted average crude price for OPEC exports from Jan 2004 - Dec 2006 ( from EIA ) .
Center : Baker Hughes oil rig count in Saudi Arabia in same period .
Bottom : Saudi Arabian oil production over the same period , average of four different sources ( discussion here ) .
Graphs are not zero - scaled to better show changes .
Click to enlarge .
I am focussing now on the period since the beginning of 2004 , since there is no controversy about what was happening prior to that .
Everyone agrees that , before the second quarter of 2004 , Saudi Arabia had at least some spare capacity and was acting as the swing producer .
The regions I have labelled , and a brief description of discussion so far are as follows .
A : This is the rapid rise in Saudi production from April 2004 to August 2004 .
I have suggested , based on analyzing the extensive discussion in OPEC Monthly Oil Market Reports , that this was a deliberate effort to moderate prices in the face of increasing demand and prices rising far above the agreed OPEC price band at the time .
I 'm not aware of any serious dissent on this explanation .
Saudi Arabia has increased production to accomodate rising demand many times in the past , so this behavior was " in character " .
B : From August 2004 to November 2004 , Saudi production goes flat despite the fact that prices have not been brought under control and are still rising .
My interpretation is that this level of production was the maximum possible at the time .
Others seem to believe that in general perhaps the Saudis changed their approach and decided higher prices were fine and they 'd prefer to make more money by voluntarily reining in production .
I 'm not sure if anyone thinks this decision was taken as early as August 2004 , but I think to explain the data in B as voluntary holding back , one would have to make that assumption ( which is fairly problematic since the Saudis would have no basis for changing their view of the effect of these prices on the world economy yet ) .
I believe Euan may agree with me that this is likely the maximum plateau production at the time .
It 's also potentially significant that the rise in rig counts begins at the end of this period B . Given the lead time to get a rig to Saudi Arabia , it 's likely that the decision to start building up the rig fleet was taken sometime during period B ( or possibly earlier ) .
C : From November 2004 to January 2005 , there is a sudden and fairly sharp decline in production by about 350 kbd .
This coincides with a sharp price break down from $ 45 to $ 35 ( in this series which is generally a little lower the the oft quoted NYMEX front month , or West Texas Intermediate spot price )
I think at this point Euan and I are in relatively close agreement that this is probably something along the lines of " Phew , prices are dropping , let 's rest some of our more tired / problematic wells . "
D : From January 2005 to July 2005 , there is a gradual and slowing rise in production that roughly restores the November 2004 level .
This occurs as prices are rising from $ 35 to $ 55 .
A mystery is why some of the 690kbd of additional production capacity from the Qatif megaproject does not allow for higher production during this period .
I lean to the explanation that something else declined , but specific attribution is not possible at present ( see discussion below ) .
People who believe in voluntary restraint could argue that the Saudi's had by now decided the world could cope with $ 45 oil and wanted to see what $ 55 oil would do .
However , the specific pattern of production rise seems very problematic for this explanation .
As prices rise from $ 35 , the Saudis increase production at the fastest rate we have seen since ( suggesting an attempt to respond to demand and moderate prices ) , but then as prices continue to rise , they respond less and less .
Why increase production at all if they just wanted prices to go up ?
And given that they decided to increase production , what are the implications of the gradual creep up , from a country that in the past could jump production by 1 - 2 mbpd in a month or two ?
Rig count rises slowly but steadily through this period .
( As an aside , the Oil Drum is founded in March during this interval as people everywhere start to wonder what is going on with oil markets .
Twilight in the Desert is published in June ) .
E : From July 2005 to Dec 2005 , production is flat and then begins gently declining ( continuing the deceleration trend of period D ) .
This starts to occur in the face of sharp price increases to the 2005 peak of around $ 62 in September , and there is no noticeable break in the trend line as prices then fall back to to around $ 50 by December .
I will argue below that the likeliest hypothesis for this decline is the beginning of the cresting of the flood front in North Ghawar .
I am unclear how the voluntary restraint hypothesis can explain both the decision to push prices up to $ 62 by dropping production , and then allowing it to fall to $ 50 by not dropping production faster as price falls .
Rig counts rise more rapidly through this period .
F : There is a very slight production hike from Dec 2005 to February 2006 .
I now have ascertained that the Qatif redevelopment megaproject was not actually completed in all respects until December 2005 .
So it is possible that this represents a boost from some last portion of the Qatif redevelopment .
Rig counts continue to rise .
G : Production resumes declining , more rapidly now , from Feb to May 2006 .
This is occurring in the face of prices increasing sharply .
I believe this is likely due to worsening problems in North Ghawar , though that can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt .
The voluntary restraint hypothesis would require that the Saudi's are deliberately dropping production to drive prices from the upper $ 50s to the upper $ 60s .
H : Production increases again from May 2006 to July 2006 , as prices first drop , and then crest in the $ 70s on fear of war with Iran or hurricanes in the Gulf .
I interpret this as most likely the onset of the Haradh megaproject .
The voluntary restraint hypothesis requires that the Saudis now change their minds and make a ( very modest ) production increase to try to ameliorate the price increases they have just been driving a few months ago .
Rig counts continue to increase rapidly .
I : Production and prices both continue to decrease .
There may be scope for both explanations here , as problems continue in North Ghawar , but is also true that OPEC begins to talk of , and then carry out , small production cuts to prevent the price going too much lower than the levels they have now got used to ( ie around $ 60 ) .
A few hundred kbd of Saudi production cuts might be accounted for this way .
Rig counts have plateaued for the moment .
Overall , we are in need of about 2mbd of explanation - 1 mbpd of net reduced production , 690 kbd of additional C&C production from the Qatif / Abu Safar redevelopment that did n't show up in the top line , and 300 kbpd of Haradh III redevelopment that also must have been offset .
The possible classes of explanation are declines in existing production , failures of megaprojects to meet plans , inaccurate or misleading data , and voluntary production restraint .
Let me now turn to documenting some of the things I alluded to above .
Ghawar
In response to Euan 's latest post , we received a flying visit from Fractional_Flow , an experienced reservoir engineer , who provided a link to a very interesting paper as well as a few key insights .
This led me to dig further into the recent petroleum engineering literature on the Ghawar field since the publication of Matt Simmon 's book Twilight in the Desert .
This exercise has helped a lot in fleshing out what I think is happening and I 'd like to discuss what I found .
The papers themselves are copyrighted and behind a paywall , but I will link to the abstracts and make some fair - use excerpts .
It 's also probably worth stressing here that I am not and never have been a reservoir engineer .
I was academically trained in physics and computer science , and have mainly worked in the latter field .
I am able to understand reservoir engineering textbooks and papers , but it 's possible that lack of deep knowledge and operational experience may lead to errors .
Unfortunately it seems that the world 's reservoir engineers mostly work for someplace that does n't want them discussing sensitive topics in public - but I encourage any of them to point out any errors in interpretation I might have made , and I 'll do my best to fix them .
Let 's start though by reminding ourselves of the basic facts about Ghawar ( also see Greg Croft 's summary ) .
Summary of Ghawar operating areas and geology .
Source : Figure 1 of Okasha et al , Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 105114 , March 2007 .
The whole structure is about 175 miles long , and around 20 miles wide at the widest - by far the largest field in the world .
The oil in Ghawar is almost all in the pores of the Arab D carbonate rock shown in the Figure above ( on which more in a moment ) .
There are five major operating areas of Ghawar : ' Ain Dar , Shedgum , Uthmaniyah , Hawiyah , and Haradh .
' Ain Dar and Shedgum were the highest quality ( highly permeable reservoir rock and sweeter crude ) , while the quality of both rock and crude tends to decrease from north to south .
Accordingly , development of the field started at the north end , and each wave of new technology has tended to be applied at the top end first and then work south .
Let 's look at ' Ain Dar and Shedgum first .
This next picture is believed to show the permeability of the two regions .
Ain Dar is the narrower longer ridge to the top ( west ) of the picture , while Shedgum is the broader shorter lump lower in the picture ( ie to the east ) :
Reservoir simulation visualization of reservoir permeability in ' Ain Dar and Shedgum regions at northern end of Ghawar Field , probably as of mid 2005 .
Scale runs from 0 ( blue ) to 1500 Millidarcies ( red ) ..
Inferred approximate locations of reservoir simulation cross sections shown also .
Source : Figure 12 of Hussain et al , International Petroleum Technology Conference Paper # 10395 , November 2005 .
The two regions together are almost 45 miles from north to south , and around 20 miles east to west .
The variable we are looking at , permeability ( often denoted K ) is related to how easy it is to push fluid through the reservoir rock .
The more pressure drop across a given volume of rock , the more fluid is going to flow through it ( just as when you suck harder on a straw , you get more to drink ) .
Part of the constant of proportionality between the pressure and the flow is called the permeability of the rock ( the other part is the viscosity of the fluid ) .
It is measured in Darcies ( after the French scientist who developed the most widely used equation of motion for fluids in porous media ) .
Rock with a permeability of one Darcy ( equivalently 1000 Millidarcies ) will allow for a flow of 1 cm/s of a fluid with viscosity 1 centiPoise under a pressure gradient of 1 atm / cm .
To make sense of the " 1 centiPoise part " , note that water has a viscosity of 1 centiPoise at 20 oC .
Ghawar oil is a little less viscous than water - varying from 0.62 centipoise in ' Ain Dar to 0.89 in Haradh .
Highly permeable rock allows much more rapid production of oil ( and of water ) .
As you can see , much of North Ain'Dar and Shedgum have very high permeabilities in the range of 750 mD .
South ' Ain Dar has much lower permeability and is presumably far less productive in consequence .
Also note the red and black regions in the picture .
These are areas of very high permeability which likely allowed for the very high oil production early in the life of some Saudi wells , but also can channel large volumes of water later in the life of the field .
Data for the production history of ' Ain Dar and Shedgum together were given by Baqi and Saleri in their presentation to CSIS in February 2004 ( the presentation that was essentially trying to refute Matt Simmons ' concerns ) .
Those data look as follows :
Saudi Aramco summary of production history for ' Ain Dar and Shedgum together .
Source : Fifty - Year Crude Oil Supply Scenarios : Saudi Aramco's Perspective , Presentation to CSIS , Feb 24th , 2004 .
As you can see , production has recently been running at around 2mbd .
This graph shows annual data through 2002 .
If we look at the Water Management in North ' Ain Dar paper , we get an annual production series just for North ' Ain Dar , which suggests that region was about one quarter of the total production of the whole ' Ain Dar / Shedgum north end :
Production and water - cut history in the North ' Ain Dar region of Ghawar .
Source : Figure 1 of Alhuthali et al , Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 93439 , March 2005 .
Here the production data represent annual data through 2004 .
Assuming this data is accurate , production fluctuations in North ' Ain Dar cannot have contributed in a large way to changes in overall Saudi output through 2004 ( though it is perhaps useful to note that 2004 is slightly down on 2003 , whereas Saudi Arabia as a whole was up from 2003 to 2004 on an annual basis ) .
At any rate , there is no evidence here of major trouble in North Ghawar production as of the end of 2004 .
However , there are other indications in the paper suggesting that trouble cannot be far off at all .
Let 's look at this picture of the state of the reservoir in ' Ain Dar .
This is taken from a paper titled Water Management In North ' Ain Dar , Saudi Arabia by Alhuthali et al and published by the Society of Petroleum Engineers as Paper # 93439 in March 2005 .
Fractional_Flow pointed us to a bootleg copy that somebody put up , but if that disappears , you can get the official version behind the paywall .
Two cross sections of a reservoir simulation of the northern portion of the ' Ain Dar region of Ghawar at various years .
Color represents volumetric water saturation in the rock pores .
Source : Figure 9 of Alhuthali et al , Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 93439 , March 2005 .
This is from a numerical simulation of the development of the reservoir over time .
However , Saudi Aramco history - matches their reservoir models with extensive amounts of well log data , so it is probably a reasonably accurate picture of the history of the field .
The variable being plotted is water saturation - that is the percentage of the pore volume in the rock that is filled with water , rather than oil .
In Ghawar , the reservoir pressure has been maintained such that there is no gas cap ( the gas is dissolved in the oil ) , and so the pores are filled with oil , water , or a mixture .
You can get the general idea of the figure - at the beginning ( in 1940 ) the crest of the reservoir was almost all filled with pink ( ie oil with less than 5 % water ) and red ( less than 25 % ) .
As time has gone on and more water has been injected at the periphery , there is less and less dry oil like that , and instead there are green and pale blue areas which are 50 % - 80 % water by volume .
Now , your first thought might be this : if there is 10 % water and 90 % oil in a particular volume of rock ( pink areas in the figure above ) , then a well into that part of the rock would be receiving 10 % water and 90 % oil .
Similarly , an area with 60 % water and 40 % oil might be producing at 60 % water cut into a well into that area .
However , this is not so : the difference is much more dramatic than that .
The reason has to do with the physics of two phase flow in a permeable medium .
If you want a mathematical treatment , try this , but let me try to illustrate the basic idea .
In a set of interconnected pores through which oil and water are being forced at pressure , the flow is too turbulent for large areas of the two fluids to separate out from one another .
And yet , oil and water do not like to mix , and will tend to bead up in the presence of the other .
If there is only a little water and a lot of oil , then the oil will form an interconnected network of fluid throughout the rock pores , whereas the water will tend to make small beads within the oil .
Conversely , a little oil in a lot of water will result in a network of water throughout the rock , and small beads of oil within that network .
Now , in either situation , the fluid that is interconnected can flow through the rock without making any change in the arrangement of beads and surfaces between oil and water .
However , the fluid that is beaded up can only move by the beads physically moving around , and they are going to tend to get trapped by the rock pores .
So for this reason , in a mixture of almost all oil , the water cannot flow at all .
Conversely , once there is almost all water , the oil cannot flow at all ( which sets an upper limit on the amount of oil that can ever be recovered by a water flood ) .
In between , there is a changeover in which the proportion of oil flowing to water flowing changes much more rapidly than the changeover of the actual mixing ratio .
The curve that describes this is called the fractional flow curve .
For example , the tutorial I referenced earlier shows this picture for a typical fractional flow curve :
" Typical " fractional flow curve ( from this tutorial ) .
So the way to read this is that when we are below 20 % on the X - axis ( less than 20 % water in the oil ) , there is zero on the y - axis ( the water will not flow through the rock at all ) .
As we get above 20 % water saturation , the flow of water increases rapidly , until above 80 % water , there is no flow of oil at all .
In the linear region at the center of the curve , the slope is about 3.6 .
That is , each 1 percentage point increase in water saturation results in a 3.6 percentage point increase in water flow in the rock .
So that implies that the difference between the red regions ( 20 % water saturation ) in the simulation picture above and the green regions ( 60 % water saturation ) could be very large .
That might be the difference between hardly any water flowing , and almost all water flowing .
But does this abstract " typical " fractional flow curve really apply to Ghawar ?
Or might things be very different there ?
Well , I have managed to find in another SPE paper some actual data from which I was able to infer the fractional flow curve for three regions of Southern and Central Ghawar .
In a different references , I found a carbonate fractional flow curve from the United Arab Emirates .
Fractional flow curve for three regions of Ghawar , with background of a fractional flow curve for carbonate rock in the United Arab Emirates .
Source for Ghawar : Author 's calculations1 based on Figure 10 of Okasha et al , Fifty Years of Wettability Measurements in the Arab - D Carbonate Reservoir , Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 105114 , March 2007 .
UAE source , Slide 15 of this Powerpoint lecture .
Clearly , these have the same general character as the " typical curve " above , and again there is going to be a dramatic difference between red regions and green regions in the cross sections above .
Now , we do not have quantitative fractional flow curves for ' Ain Dar and Shedgum at the moment .
However , we know one point on the curve for ' Ain Dar from Alhuthali et al ( Paper # 93439 ) , which reports on measurements of rock right next to an abandoned water injector well .
The pores of that rock had 21 % oil , 79 % water .
Rock next to a water injection well is bound to contain only that oil which is never going to move under any further waterflooding , and so tells us that the fractional flow curve must reach the top of the graph ( y - axis of 100 % ) when the x -axis is at 79 % water saturation .
This appears to be roughly consistent with the other curves on the graph .
Thus , we can conclude that as long as there is red / pink in the simulations above , it will be possible to produce oil at very low water cuts by drilling horizontally into those oil layers .
The overall water cut of the field can be somewhat controlled by making decisions about how much to produce out of the red - pink zone , and how much to produce from the watery green areas .
Once the red / pink zone is gone , then there will be no way to produce oil except out of those green areas , which probably correspond to water cuts in excess of 70 % ( perhaps much higher depending on the exact shape of the fractional flow curve in this part of Ghawar ) .
Now , how long before the red zone is gone ?
Let me remind you of the simulation picture again , to save on scrolling :
Two cross sections of a reservoir simulation of the northern portion of the ' Ain Dar region of Ghawar at various years .
Source : Figure 9 of Alhuthali et al , Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 93439 , March 2005 .
Now , after staring at the bumps in these figures , I think I have figured out roughly where in North ' Ain Dar these two cross sections -- a ) and b ) -- are .
I have indicated them on the permeability visualization I showed before :
Reservoir simulation visualization of water saturation level in ' Ain Dar and Shedgum regions at northern end of Ghawar Field , probably as of mid 2005 .
Inferred approximate locations of reservoir simulation cross sections shown also .
Source : Figure 12 of Hussain et al , International Petroleum Technology Conference Paper # 10395 , November 2005 .
These placements are not exact - they could easily be a few miles north or south of where I have shown them , but I am pretty confident that I am in the right general region .
Now , the conclusion I draw from this placement is as follows : the cross sections are reasonably representative of the crest of North ' Ain Dar .
As the cross sections show only a reasonably thin layer of red / pink oil that , in two dimensions , is hugging the top of the reservoir , it seems very likely that , in three dimensions , we only have a layer of roughly that thickness throughout the entire crest of North ' Ain Dar .
So how long is that layer going to last ?
Well , if we blow up just the 1990 and 2004 pictures for the ( a ) cross section , that is the western flank , we get this picture :
West flank cross section in reservoir simulation of the northern portion of the ' Ain Dar region of Ghawar .
Blow - up of 1990 and 2004 only .
Source : Figure 9 of Alhuthali et al , Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 93439 , March 2005 .
So my layer counting says that over 14 years we went from 10 layers of red / pink in the crest to 2 layers of red in the crest .
And if we do the same for the ( b ) cross section on the eastern flank , we get this :
East flank cross section in reservoir simulation of the northern portion of the ' Ain Dar region of Ghawar .
Blow - up of 1990 and 2004 only .
Source : Figure 9 of Alhuthali et al , Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 93439 , March 2005 .
Layer counting here says that 6 - 9 layers of red / pink have been reduced to 1 layer over the same 14 years , suggesting a similar pace .
So , overall , we lose a layer about every 21 months , and there were 1 - 2 layers left at the time of the 2004 simulation .
Now , we do not know for sure whether this simulation means by " 2004 " , " 2004.0 " -- the beginning of the year , or the end of the year .
However , labels on simulation visualizations in other papers shows annual data with a " .0 " , suggesting that is the convention .
If so , then we would expect the green area to reach the top of the reservoir in some places in North ' Ain Dar in mid-late 2005 , and in most places there by the middle of 2007 .
Thus in timing , this phenomenon would be consistent with the decline in output across production zones E - I ( mid 2005 through the present ) .
It does not appear to me that , from a timing perspective , this phenomenon is well placed to explain any declines that offset whatever fraction of the 690kbd of Qatif megaproject production came on in late 2004 and early 2005 ( zones B - D ) .
We have production data for North ' Ain Dar which do not show more than a very small decline in 2004 on an annual basis , so any sizeable decline here could not have occurred before 2005 .
Euan has questioned whether an increase in water cut like this could have a large enough impact on production to explain all the declines we see .
Let me try to make an estimate on how large it could be .
We cannot do this with any precision from the fractional flow curve because we do n't have an exact fractional flow curve for this part of Ghawar .
However , there is other data in Paper # 93439 which allows us estimate this .
In particular , the paper contains a discussion of what fraction of production comes from behind the flood front , versus in front of the flood front .
They discuss the desirability of trying to produce from behind the flood front as much as possible in order to maximize overall recovery of the oil .
However , it is clear from Figure 10 , that they have been obliged to produce more and more oil from above the flood front in order to maintain production .
Specifically , the fraction of production below / behind the flood front is shown as follows :
Fraction of oil produced from behind the flood front in North ' Ain Dar .
Source : Figure 10 of Alhuthali et al , Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 93439 , March 2005 .
Orange line is my addition .
Now , this is dropping , presumably because the water behind the flood front has higher and higher water cut over time , and the water handling facilities are limited .
If we extrapolate out the orange line to today , only 55 % of production would be coming from behind the flood front .
However , once the flood front has reached the crest ( which I argue must already have happened already in most places ) , then there can be no production from above the flood front .
This line of reasoning suggests that the flood front reaching the crest would produce around a 45 % reduction in production over a period of a couple of years .
Now , we only have enough data to make a convincing case for when this will occur in North ' Ain Dar , which represented only 500 kbpd of production in 2004 .
However , it is at least plausible , though not proven , that the same thing could be happening in approximately the same time frame in the whole ' Ain Dar / Shedgum region .
' Ain Dar and Shedgum have very similar reservoir properties , very similar oil qualities , almost identical thickness of original oil layer , and were brought onto production at the same time .
So it is plausible that they have been produced in parallel , and will be reaching the end of their production plateaus at around the same time .
If this were so , a 45 % reduction in 2 mbpd of production ( as of 2002 ) would represent about 900kbd ( with a large , say 50 % , uncertainty in that number for a SWAG at the error bar ) .
This might be enough to explain most of the decline in production from June 2005 to the present ( though we would still require some other field in decline earlier in order to offset Qatif and Haradh III ) .
and make up the rest of the overall production decline .
Some further circumstantial evidence for this point of view comes from Hussain et al , International Petroleum Technology Conference Paper # 10395 , November 2005 .
This paper is titled Optimizing Maximum - Reservoir - Contact Wells : Application to Saudi Arabian Reservoirs and covers the process of selecting locations in ' Ain Dar and Shedgum in which infill Maximum Reservoir Contact wells ( MRCs ) would produce incremental recovery over what could be recovered via the existing wells .
For each potential MRC ( basically a horizontal multilateral ) , a detailed reservoir engineering simulation is done on a fine scale grid to assess the impact on recovery and the economics of the proposed well .
What is interesting is that these wells ( which presumably represent the best remaining opportunities in the field where there is still some localized piece of the oil layer left to go after ) are anticipated to begin declining very quickly .
The new well studied in ' Ain Dar , which was " planned to be spudded early 2006 " is simulated to begin declining sharply almost immediately :
Simulated oil production profile for proposed horizontal multilateral well spudded early 2006 in ' Ain Dar .
Source : Figure 22 of Hussain et al , International Petroleum Technology Conference Paper # 10395 , November 2005 .
My interpretation of this is as follows : there is nowhere left that one could put an MRC into a reasonably dry oil layer anywhere in ' Ain Dar .
If there was , Saudi Aramco would have illustrated their paper with that well , instead of this one , and that hypothetical well would have had a longer plateau .
Similarly , the new MRC studied in Shedgum was " spudded in late 2004 " , and was anticipated to be on plateau through the end of 2008 , before beginning to decline rapidly :
Simulated oil production profile for proposed horizontal multilateral well spudded late 2004 in Shedgum .
Source : Figure 22 of Hussain et al , International Petroleum Technology Conference Paper # 10395 , November 2005 .
My interpretation of this is that the last remaining spots of dry oil layer in Shedgum will be gone by the end of 2008 , implying that there are probably some places in Shedgum where the oil layer is gone already .
Uthmaniyah
The situation in Uthmaniyah is less clear .
There is a paper Water Production Management Strategies in North Uthmaniyah Area , Saudi Arabia , which covers some of the same ground as the North ' Ain Dar paper .
However , what it particularly lacks is any production data , so we cannot estimate either how much Uthmaniyah has produced , or any trend in that production .
The paper does have some interesting hints of trouble .
For example , " In August 2004 , additional twenty - seven high water cut wells were put on cyclic production . "
Cyclic production means taking wells in wetter zones of the field off line for six months at a time to allow water to settle away from the well bores , and then running them again .
It 's interesting that this was happening right at the start of zone B , when Saudi production stopped rising even as OPEC was losing control of prices .
However , 27 wells , which were presumably below the Saudi average at the time of 6kbd each , can only represent a number not much larger than 100kbd , and perhaps significantly smaller .
So this is not evidence of much unless it were a harbinger of larger problems .
The paper does show cross-sections of a reservoir simulation again :
Two cross sections of a reservoir simulation of the northern portion of the Uthmaniyah region of Ghawar at various years .
Source : Figure 12 of Al - Mutairi et al , Water Production Management Strategies in North Uthmaniyah Area , Saudi Arabia , SPE 98847 , June 2006 .
Several features are interesting .
It looks as though there is more dry oil left in Uthmaniyah than in ' Ain Dar .
However , it also looks like it is harder to flood uniformly : the simulation shows some streaking of water breaking through the oil layers that was not evident in the Ain Dar simulation .
Some explanation for this is found in the fractional flow curve , which we actually have for Uthmaniyah :
Fractional flow curve for three regions of Ghawar , with background of a fractional flow curve for carbonate rock in the United Arab Emirates .
Source for Ghawar : Author 's calculations1 based on Figure 10 of Okasha et al , Fifty Years of Wettability Measurements in the Arab - D Carbonate Reservoir , Society of Petroleum Engineers Paper # 105114 , March 2007 .
UAE source , Slide 15 of this Powerpoint lecture .
As you can see , the fractional flow curve for Uthmaniyah is not too nice .
Once we get out of the pink ( ie above 15 % water saturation ) , water movement starts , and by the time we are into green ( above 50 % water saturation ) water cut is up to 90 % .
Thus production outside of the dry oil will be a slow business in Uthmaniyah , and ultimate recoveries are bound to be lower .
If we blow up just the 1980 and 2004 pictures , we can try to estimate how much oil is left :
Blow up of two cross sections of a reservoir simulation of the northern portion of the Uthmaniyah region of Ghawar for 1980 and 2004 .
Source : Figure 12 of Al - Mutairi et al , Water Production Management Strategies in North Uthmaniyah Area , Saudi Arabia , SPE 98847 , June 2006 .
Eyeballing this , and assuming these profiles are representative , it looks like about a quarter of the pink oil there in 1980 was still there in 2004 , suggesting plateau might be maintained for another 8 years give or take a year or two ( and modulo periodic breakthroughs from those streaks ) .
After that , it appears that water cuts will start to rise rapidly and within another five years production will inevitably decline greatly as there are only yellow and green regions to try and produce from with very high water cuts .
A Note on Well Productivity
Finally , I wanted to comment briefly on Euan 's piece on well productivity , which I think might have been overly persuasive to some people .
The first thing to note is that the main reason for the high well productivity of Saudi wells is that the rock is exceptionally permable by global standards .
This allows a relatively small number of wells to drain a large volume of rock .
It does not mean that once that rock has no dry oil in , production cannot decline rapidly , or that lots of further drilling into the depleted reservoir will necessarily do a great deal of good ( it is noteworthy that the Saudis are putting in a fairly small number of very carefully planned wells in North Ghawar to extract the last oil they consider worth going after , rather than putting in large numbers of wells which would do little good ) .
The second thing to note is that the OPEC data Euan used is annual .
Not only that , it ends right as the alleged problem is just getting going .
This conceals any signal of the problem in the data .
I did an exercise to infer what the monthly well productivity would look like through the end of monthly data .
I did this by assuming that well retirements occur at the same rate in the monthly data as they did on average in the OPEC annual data from 2001 - 2005 .
I further assume that the rigs Baker Hughes counted in Saudi Arabia drill wells each month at the same average rig productivity as the OPEC annual data show from 2001 - 2005 .
I linearly extrapolate the ratio of oil to NGLs to continue as it has been going .
I applied this procedure from the beginning of 2004 on , and its reasonableness is attested to by the fact that it predicts the OPEC reported number of producing wells at the end of 2004 and 2005 to better than 1 % .
( Further interpolation into the next year is based on the OPEC actual , rather than the monthly interpolated estimate from the prior year ) .
With those assumptions , the well productivity graph looks like this :
Estimate of well productivity .
Annual through 2002 and monthly afterwards , according to the procedure described in the text .
As you can see , the well productivity shows evidence of an alarming decline starting in mid 2005 , and accelerating through 2006 .
This is consistent with my overall hypothesis that declines in Saudi production are in significant measure forced , rather than voluntary .
The Future
Does this allow us any greater confidence in predicting the future ?
Probably not too much .
On the one hand , it appears that Uthmaniyah may not imminently follow ' Ain Dar and Shedgum , and that the worst of the rapid damage in north Ghawaralready have occurred .
On the other hand , the data appear to me to suggest that ' Ain Dar and Shedgum declines are not likely to be sufficient to fully explain the declines ( net of megaprojects ) that we have observed in total production .
One possibility is that some other fields or regions of Ghawar are also declining ( eg we know next to nothing about Hawiyah ) .
Another possible explanation is that the redevelopment of Qatif and Abu Safah was largely a failure .
A third possibility is a hybrid explanation in which some of the late 2006 / early 2007 decline is voluntary as price has sagged below $ 60 , over and above the forced decline .
That might allow for a partial recovery of production this summer .
However , this last would be somewhat inconsistent with the fact that Saudi Arabia 's Asian customers have been put on allocation .
Time and further investigation are required .
Footnotes
DRM in Windows Vista
Windows Vista includes an array of “ features ” that you do n’t want .
These features will make your computer less reliable and less secure .
They ’ll make your computer less stable and run slower .
They will cause technical support problems .
They may even require you to upgrade some of your peripheral hardware and existing software .
And these features wo n’t do anything useful .
In fact , they ’re working against you .
They ’re digital rights management ( DRM ) features built into Vista at the behest of the entertainment industry .
And you do n’t get to refuse them .
The details are pretty geeky , but basically Microsoft has reworked a lot of the core operating system to add copy protection technology for new media formats like HD DVD and Blu-ray disks .
Certain high - quality output paths — audio and video — are reserved for protected peripheral devices .
Sometimes output quality is artificially degraded ; sometimes output is prevented entirely .
And Vista continuously spends CPU time monitoring itself , trying to figure out if you ’re doing something that it thinks you should n’t .
If it does , it limits functionality and in extreme cases restarts just the video subsystem .
We still do n’t know the exact details of all this , and how far - reaching it is , but it does n’t look good .
Microsoft put all those functionality - crippling features into Vista because it wants to own the entertainment industry .
This is n’t how Microsoft spins it , of course .
It maintains that it has no choice , that it ’s Hollywood that is demanding DRM in Windows in order to allow “ premium content ” — meaning , new movies that are still earning revenue — onto your computer .
If Microsoft did n’t play along , it ’d be relegated to second - class status as Hollywood pulled its support for the platform .
It ’s all complete nonsense .
Microsoft could have easily told the entertainment industry that it was not going to deliberately cripple its operating system , take it or leave it .
With 95 % of the operating system market , where else would Hollywood go ?
Sure , Big Media has been pushing DRM , but recently some —
Sony after their 2005 debacle and now EMI Group — are having second thoughts .
What the entertainment companies are finally realizing is that DRM does n’t work , and just annoys their customers .
Like every other DRM system ever invented , Microsoft ’s wo n’t keep the professional pirates from making copies of whatever they want .
The DRM security in Vista was broken the day it was released .
Sure , Microsoft will patch it , but the patched system will get broken as well .
It ’s an arms race , and the defenders ca n’t possibly win .
I believe that Microsoft knows this and also knows that it does n’t matter .
This is n’t about stopping pirates and the small percentage of people who download free movies from the Internet .
This is n’t even about Microsoft satisfying its Hollywood customers at the expense of those of us paying for the privilege of using Vista .
This is about the overwhelming majority of honest users and who owns the distribution channels to them .
And while it may have started as a partnership , in the end Microsoft is going to end up locking the movie companies into selling content in its proprietary formats .
We saw this trick before ; Apple pulled it on the recording industry .
First iTunes worked in partnership with the major record labels to distribute content , but soon Warner Music ’s CEO Edgar Bronfman Jr. found that he was n’t able to dictate a pricing model to Steve Jobs .
The same thing will happen here ; after Vista is firmly entrenched in the marketplace , Sony ’s Howard Stringer wo n’t be able to dictate pricing or terms to Bill Gates .
This is a war for 21st - century movie distribution and , when the dust settles , Hollywood wo n’t know what hit them .
To be fair , just last week Steve Jobs publicly came out against DRM for music .
It ’s a reasonable business position , now that Apple controls the online music distribution market .
But Jobs never mentioned movies , and he is the largest single shareholder in Disney .
Talk is cheap .
The real question is would he actually allow iTunes Music Store purchases to play on Microsoft or Sony players , or is this just a clever way of deflecting blame to the — already hated — music labels .
Microsoft is reaching for a much bigger prize than Apple : not just Hollywood , but also peripheral hardware vendors .
Vista ’s DRM will require driver developers to comply with all kinds of rules and be certified ; otherwise , they wo n’t work .
And Microsoft talks about expanding this to independent software vendors as well .
It ’s another war for control of the computer market .
Unfortunately , we users are caught in the crossfire .
We are not only stuck with DRM systems that interfere with our legitimate fair - use rights for the content we buy , we ’re stuck with DRM systems that interfere with all of our computer use — even the uses that have nothing to do with copyright .
I do n’t see the market righting this wrong , because Microsoft ’s monopoly position gives it much more power than we consumers can hope to have .
It might not be as obvious as Microsoft using its operating system monopoly to kill Netscape and own the browser market , but it ’s really no different .
Microsoft ’s entertainment market grab might further entrench its monopoly position , but it will cause serious damage to both the computer and entertainment industries .
DRM is bad , both for consumers and for the entertainment industry : something the entertainment industry is just starting to realize , but Microsoft is still fighting .
Some researchers think that this is the final straw that will drive Windows users to the competition , but I think the courts are necessary .
In the meantime , the only advice I can offer you is to not upgrade to Vista .
It will be hard .
Microsoft ’s bundling deals with computer manufacturers mean that it will be increasingly hard not to get the new operating system with new computers .
And Microsoft has some pretty deep pockets and can wait us all out if it wants to .
Yes , some people will shift to Macintosh and some fewer number to Linux , but most of us are stuck on Windows .
Still , if enough customers say no to Vista , the company might actually listen .

EDITED TO ADD ( 2/23 ) : Some commentary .
Posted on February 12 , 2007 at 10:37 AM • 241 Comments
In a new report published today , the human rights group criticised the US - led multinational force for interning some 14,000 people .
Around 3,800 people have been held for over a year , while another 200 have been detained for more than two years , the report - Beyond Abu Ghraib : detention and torture in Iraq - said .
" It is a dangerous precedent for the world that the US and UK think it completely defensible to hold thousands of people without charge or trial , " Amnesty spokesman Neil Durkin said .
The detainee situation in Iraq was comparable to Guantánamo Bay , he added , but on a much larger scale , and the detentions appeared to be " arbitrary and indefinite " .
" It sends a very worrying message to the people of Iraq that the multinational force does not think normal human rights standards apply , " he said .
Amnesty said there was no fresh evidence of US - led troops abusing detainees in ways similar to Abu Ghraib prison , but it warned that the US practice of denying detainees access to lawyers or visits by relatives for their first 60 days in custody left the door open to mistreatment .
" The worry is that people will suffer abuse during that period and it is less likely to be checked if there is no form of external oversight , " Mr Durkin said .
The Amnesty report also claimed Iraqi security forces were systematically violating the rights of detainees .
Many cases of torture , including electric shocks or beatings with plastic cables , have been reported since US - led forces handed power to Iraqi officials in June 2004 , the document said .
Several detainees reportedly died in Iraqi custody last year , and some of their bodies bore injuries consistent with torture , Amnesty said .
The report expressed particular concern about the activities of the Wolf brigade , a unit that reports to the Iraqi interior ministry .
Mr Durkin insisted it was feasible for the Iraqi authorities to implement international human rights standards despite the country 's extremely volatile security situation .
" We do not see what is unreasonable about abiding by human rights standards in attempts to police Iraq , " he said .
" And you are not going to fuel resentment to the same degree as if you imprison people without charge , that is a recipe for disaster . "
Amnesty acknowledged that armed groups opposed to the US - led force were responsible for many of the abuses being committed in Iraq , including attacks targeting civilians .
But the group said it had addressed that issue in earlier reports , and that it was not the focus of its latest publication .
The vast majority of the 14,000 people held in Iraq are in US custody .
British troops are holding 43 detainees at a facility in Shaiba , southern Iraq , a spokesman for the Foreign Office said .
Their detention is subject to regular review by an internment panel , but lawyers can only make written submissions .
Amnesty said it was concerned the lawyers do not have access to any substantive evidence against their clients .
One man , Hillal " Abdul Razzaq " Ali al - Jedda , has been in British custody since his arrest in October 2004 .
The 48 - year - old dual Iraqi and UK national has not been charged with any offence , and a court of appeal judgment on his detention is awaited following a hearing in January .
The Foreign Office said the UK followed UN guidelines for detaining suspects .
" We believe that the detention is legal and fair and subject to review , " a spokesman said .

When was the moment when our youth become self - aware of their charms , as well as its desperation ?
It seems younger now , although that could just be my mother talking .
But look at our 21st century culture .
Every teenager knows the time to launch a career as a porn star is in the weeks following high school graduation .
Celebrity journalism shows us that Hercules and Aphrodite will both be toppled in their early 20s without massive intervention .
It 's no wonder the commodification of good looks and muscles has wrought an erotic backlash .
Virginity .
Authenticity .
The natural pearl .
This is what is idealized today , as well as commercialized beyond all recognition .
Fake sex — titillation — is for sale ; real sex is elusive and underground .
Take this state of affairs , and couple it with a pox of unprecedented meddling in people 's personal lives by the religious right , and we have a toxic brew .
Privacy , freedom , and nature are gasping for breath .
Hypocrites alone have something to crow about .
In my fifteen years of editing BAE , I have never seen such a yowling , lustful , spitting breach between young and old .
Of course , such observations are taboo .
Lower your voice !
Young people are n't supposed to have a sexual bone in their bodies , right ?
And their elders , if they are immune to beauty , and make all the rules , should be able to keep it in their pants .
What a squawk .
There is so much guilt and fear about the obvious — that young people do have hormones , and old people are n't altogether blind — that helpful discussion in the public sphere has shriveled .
It is left to fiction for the truth to come out .
The truth looks like this : any conflict has the potential to become erotic .
That might get complicated , tragic , or unpredictable .
Eros is kissing cousins with aggravation .
The conscience of our society drives us to protect our young , to provide for them , to cheer and cherish their independence .
But we would n't need any conscience if it was n't a challenge , if it did n't demand sacrifice .
The temptations include neglect , exploitation , coercion , and dependence .

" the avatar of American Erotica . "
She was co-founder and editor of the first Women 's sex magazine , On Our Backs : Entertainment for the Adventurous Lesbian , from 1984 - 1991 .
Since then , she 's written and edited about a zillion books , and taught many courses on sexuality .
Currently , she posts regularly on her own blog .
Her audio show , In Bed With Susie Bright , is distributed by Audible.com .
She was a sex - scene choreographer and consultant for the Wachowski Brothers ' first film , Bound , in which she also had a cameo role .
Susie appeared on two consecutive episodes of The RU Sirius Show , primarily to discuss the anthology , The Best American Erotica 2007 , which includes stories by Dennis Cooper and the late Octavia Butler , among many others .
( She 's been editing the Erotica series since 1993 . )
We did , of course , digress quite a bit from the main topic .
As with the audio interview , we are running these text edits in two segments , so click here for the second half RU Sirius Show co-host Diana Brown joined me in interviewing Susie Bright about her " Ted Haggard Betting Pool , " teen sex , and other illicit thoughts .
The introduction to The Best American Erotica 2007 is quite an intense little piece .
Would you please read a segment from it ?
Sure .
I called it " The Lolita Backlash . "
Every year , the stories in the book tend to magnetize to a certain theme .
And this year , it had to do with a rather vicious generation gap .
So the introduction to your book — and much of the fiction in the book — broaches the highly taboo subject of adolescent sex ; and adolescent sex as it relates to adults .
We had Tim Cavanaugh on the show — he was the editor of Reason magazine 's blog at the time .
I asked him if they 'd ever dealt with the age of consent .
And he admitted they had n't .
It was clear that this is kind of the third rail for some libertarians .
Do you worry about Fox News noticing your book ?
I think this is probably a bigger taboo than murder in America now .
How interesting .
When I was in my twenties , I was invited on the Phil Donahue Show .
He was sort of Oprah before Oprah .
So I was brought in with a bisexual male friend of mine to represent bisexuality .
We were told we'd talk about what we noticed sexually about the differences between sleeping with men and sleeping with women .
And they made it sound like it was not pejorative or prejudiced or trying to start a fire — just , you know , " What do you notice ? "
And we thought that would be a lot of fun .
So we got picked up in one of those big limos and taken to the studio .
And inside the limo was this very pink , perspiring couple from Florida .
And I said , " You 're going to be on the show too ? "
And they said , " Yes .
We 're from Exodus . "
Now Exodus , at the time , was the premier gay conversion group .
So it was one of those " gotcha " shows .
( Mockingly ) Woo - hoo !
Gay conversion — it 's coming back !
It 's coming back stronger than ever .
They 've got it down to three weeks now — a three week spa .
Does it come with a French manicure ?
So on Donahue 's show , he basically tried to get the bible couple to freak out on us — about how we 're heathens — and vice versa .
It was so humiliating .
We did n't talk about anything that I had planned to talk about .
And at one point , I just opened my big mouth and said , " I came of age in the seventies , and I lost my virginity shortly before my 16th birthday with an unemployed soap opera actor .
" Like you were supposed to in America in the seventies !
Yes !
It 's a banal story .
Exactly .
Everybody did that .... Since the seventies .
I think it's in the handbook !
So , all of the sudden Phil turns .
He 's thrilled .
And he says , " So you were a victim of child abuse !
" Did he cut to a commercial at that moment ?
I just thought , " You son of a bitch . "
What a gratuitous dig .
And , you know , neither I nor anybody in my family feels any regrets or fears .
It 's not like , " Gee , Susie was in an awful lot of trouble or panic or danger . "
I was n't .
Of course , this is a tricky subject and there has to be sensitivity to the psychological and physical development of young people .
And some people are such old souls so young .
And other people are just crawling out of their egg at age twenty - five .
You also have quite a noticeable difference in terms of adolescent girls and boys .
I see my daughter and her friends , and some kind of look ten and some kind of look twenty - something — and they 're all around sixteen .
They are so different .
The ones who suffer the most are the ones who look ten , but emotionally and mentally they want to do everything .
And then you 'll hear about a girl who had breasts when she was ten , and everyone was sexualizing her .
And she just wanted to climb a tree and be left alone .
There are so many misunderstandings .
And adults are constantly projecting their notions of what they want on them .
In my case — and in a lot of cases , I was the one who was interested and curious and seeking sex .
You hear that story all the time .
Yeah .
Problems come from older people who do n't have empathy and compassion and respect .
You get someone who decides ; " Yeah !
Girls want me ! " ( Laughter ) " That teenaged girl over there ?
She digs me . "
That kind of narcissism is the problem .
We do n't even talk about whether the sex in these scenarios is consensual .
Is there coercion involved ?
What is the power relationship between these people ?
We fixate on stereotypes and miss the big picture .
And another thing that does n't get brought up is that , overwhelmingly , sexual abuse and that type of violence happens within families .
If you could stop that , it would really be remarkable .
We have this idea , fostered by J. Edgar Hoover , that there are these monsters out there — strangers are going to come up and offer your child a lollipop .
We 're seeing that replayed now around the internet .
There 's a wonderful social scientist , Michael Males , who just had an opinion article in the New York Times .
He 's proved that your kid is safer alone on MySpace than in any shopping mall in America .
I just loved reading his facts and figures , because it all makes sense to me .
It seems so obvious , if you think about it .
Yeah , it sure does .
And of course , the guy who was running the predator arrest campaign for Homeland Security was exposing himself to 16 - year - old girls at the mall .
I 'm not making this shit up !
With all the fuss about Scooter Libby and Cheney , other things have been glossed over .
Were they caught together ? : ( Laughs )
It fascinated me how it came out that officials who are supposedly in charge of protecting children turn out to be really creepy , totally non-consensual predators .
Well , they 're the ones who are attracted to that .
I mean , just like a certain percentage of criminal sadists are attracted to law enforcement .
The mice are guarding the cheese .
That 's a good way of putting it .
So when people ask me about public policy , I think about the big picture .
If this country had more active democracy ; if we had decent health care and universal sex education , things would be better for young people .
Anything you can do to give them power is going to work out .
Anything you can do to foster good family relationships and support education is going to help .
None of this is on the agenda for the United States right now .
Well , you 're doing something for young people on your web site — the Ted Haggard Betting Pool .
And it 's not just a snarky little jab at this fool Ted Haggard , who is all over the media .
Proceeds of this Betting Pool are going to benefit a San Francisco youth group called LYRIC .
Yes .
LYRIC is a youth group .
They do community support and activism for young people who realize that they 're sexually different , whatever that might mean to them .
And nobody makes you fill out a form to explain yourself .
If you know that you 're sexually different and you want a place where you do n't have to be alone — and where you do n't have to be stigmatized and shamed — you can go to them .
And you might get support in terms of work and family that you wo n't get elsewhere .
They 're role models for young people getting together and doing it for themselves , while having adult advocates who have a lot of integrity .
So I love them .
And when this whole mess with Reverend Ted Haggard happened ...
I mean , there you have the evangelical minister to end all evangelical ministers — the guy who could tell George Bush what to do — and he gets caught sucking cock on a regular basis .
On crank .
On crank .
It 's the only way to do it .
No one wants to do it without meth anymore , apparently .
" Cock on crank . "
I like the alliteration of it .
And instead of copping to it , he said , " Hey .
I was always heterosexual .
It was just stress " — or whatever it was .
And his church gave him a huge check , since they 're hemorrhaging money .
He signed a confidentiality agreement and was given a plane ticket to get out of town .
And , of course , now the headlines are " Ted Haggard says he 's 100 % heterosexual .
" Did n't he go to a three - week spa ?
He went to a three - week spa to get over his homosexuality ( which he was n't really anyway . )
I mean , the contradictions are endless .
I love that .
I mean , who 's going into rehab today ?
It 's become a daily thing now .
So everyone I know was saying , " When do you think he 'll slip ? "
So I said , " Let 's do a betting pool . "
So some of us have started a site called " Bet on Ted . "
You just pick your date .
We 're going to give it a year .
Any time this year .
And to win , something has to happen with Ted that gets into the news or into the courts .
We 've come up with a list of things — all of them involve Ted cracking , and it hitting a news report .
If you have the lucky date , then you win half the pot and the other half goes to our worthy cause : LYRIC .
If nobody gets the right date — or Ted sneaks by all year and nothing comes out — then the whole pot will go to LYRIC too .
So bet on Ted !
I 'm hoping we get somewhere with it .
One of my friends who wanted to bet said , " Can we send in a ringer ? "
And I said , " Yeah !
Make it happen !
" A hooker with a heart of gold that will bring him across .
Exactly !
I bet a lot of people are trying to reel him in , at this point .
It 's his lucky year , now !
We 're Ted fishing , now !
Ted 's going to get a lot of action this year ... thanks to Susie Bright .
( Makes a fly - casting sound . )
What are we using for bait ?
One thing that 's interesting : remember I told you about those founders of Exodus that I met at the " Donahue Show . "
The founders of Exodus finally did do the right thing .
They fled Exodus , so to speak .
They exited Exodus and said , " We are gay , God damn it !
We 're sorry we just did this to everybody . "
Virtually all the founders of all these horrible conversion therapies have recanted after a certain amount of time .
It seems , in the thesis and antithesis of sexual revolution and then backlash ; we 've ended up in an incredibly tangled state of how we — as a culture — think about sexuality .
We almost embrace the most intense kinds of sexual sophistication , and there 's all this pornography around , and then there 's the most intense kinds of Puritanism .
And it 's like it's all converged into one confused human being .
Well , a lot of that porn is really about titillation and guilt .
There 's this , " Taste me !
Taste me ! " factor where you never really get to taste me .
You know ?
" Come closer !
I 'll give you this little bit . "
But then once you get there , you 're going to need to get a little bit more ... and a little bit more .
And you 're always going to have to shell out .
That 's how they sell it .
And it's also how they inspire political fear .
It 's a come -on !
It 's a con job .
What you do n't get is sexual honesty and real candor , where you really come through .
They 're creating people who behave that way !
The relationship between the stripper and the paying customer — a lot of people relate to each other that way .
I suppose so , except with real strippers , real love lives — it does n't work like that .
Even if you try to live in a fake persona , you can't maintain it all the time .
It 's impossible .
There is a lovely story towards the end of the book — " The Wish Girls " — that gets underneath the emptiness behind those images .
Yeah , that was a great story by a new author — Matthew Addison .
His character is about thirty .
When he was a teenager , he had an " I Dream of Jeannie " moment where he wished there were two hot , bouncy , magazine -y babes who would appear and be his love slaves .
And he got his wish !
They 're the wish girls !
Now , they 've been around for fifteen years , and they do the same exact positions .
And he was naive when he ordered them .
And now he thinks , " Why did I make them identical except for their hair color ?
I wish one was 5 ' 2 " and one was 5 ' 9 " ! "
It drives him nuts that they 're so limited .
He yearns for more , but on the other hand — they bend over and get in position # 19 and position # 32 just like clockwork .
And he feels guilty for his boredom and ennui with them .
So what 's in store for him next ?
Read the story .
On the other hand , there 's another story in there involving some porn stars and they 're having a pretty interesting time , and their sex is pretty hot and so forth .
Do you feel like there 's a clear dividing line ?
Can you say , " This is bad porn ; and this is good porn ? "
I 'm suspicious of people judging what gets other people off .
Well , I never walk into a room and say " ( gasp ) What !?
That turns you on ?
You 're gross . "
I mean , that would be the infantile ... " Ewwwww .
" When it comes to " good porn " and " bad porn , " you 'll frequently see something that has obviously been made with the sloppiest intentions : " Fuck it .
Let 's get this done and get a quick buck . "
But as you watch it , there will be one 10 - minute scene where the people in front of the camera actually had a moment .
And it 's caught there , because that 's what the camera lens does .
Other times , you 'll be watching something that has been made with such high ideals , and you 'll be , like : " I ca n't even keep my eyes open .
" There is this kind of a superior attitude of people who are sort of into underground sexuality ... " More kinkier than thou .
" Yeah , but you have the same kind of conversations in every part of the art world — in music and painting and everything else .
You have your little factions .
You have auteurs .
You have people who put a signature on the work they do and the moment you see it , you can tell it 's one of their films .
I 'll tell you an interesting story about this : one of the most important pornographers in history died recently — Gary Graver .
He worked on some of the most influential films , including Bound .
He inspired my choreography of the sex scenes for Bound .
And his obit was in the New York Times , Variety , and every place else .
But they did n't mention that he was a pornographer !
His porn name was Robert McCallum .
So they focused largely on the fact that he was Orson Welles ' cameraman for thirty years .
And he helped fund a lot of Orson 's projects when Orson did n't have a dime coming in .
It was the porn that let him do that !
So I wrote a bunch of letters ...
" Why are you not saying ...
I mean , you talked about all of his exploitation work , his horror flicks , his slasher films .
None of those are going to get any rave reviews .
" It 's laughable .
He shot Steven Spielberg 's first movie — he worked with everybody .
His family certainly knows what he was doing .
So why did n't they include that ?
And I got responses that showed the double standard that rules the land .
It was like , " Well , we would n't do that .
Why would we besmirch him ? "
Besmirch ?
They 're the New York Times !
If somebody murdered someone , but later discovered the cure for cancer , they would still mention that they served time for that murder .
I mean , they dig up dirt !
It 's not all : " He had a wonderful life , and everything went swell !
" Like Larry King interviewing Adolf Hilter ...
" You were a vegetarian , right ?
" Exactly !
So why would they report on people 's immorality , gambling , criminality , lawsuits — but they would n't mention that Gary Gravers did some of the most significant porn films of all time — films that are still for sale and have sold in every format .
Before we wrap up , has it been a good life , being a " sexpert " for thirty years ?
Is it a big responsibility ?
Is it a lot of fun ?
Do you wish you were a fucking fishermen — like John Lennon used to say about being in The Beatles ?
On a personal level , sometimes I wish to be unknown .
Having some celebrity around my sexuality can be weird .
When it comes to sexual and personal attention , you 're always afraid of people 's agendas .
I locked myself in the bathroom of the last sex party I went to , because somebody who I thought was interested in me really wanted me to read their manuscript .
Well , that 's scary for anybody — when somebody approaches you with a manuscript !
It 's like : " I do n't want to see a manuscript , I want to fuck ! "
But in terms of having social influence — and I bet John Lennon would have said the same thing — you never get sick of influencing a conversation .
Do you ever think it would 've been cool to become famous as a writer about a different topic , like television or quantum physics or something like that ?
I do write about all kinds of subjects .
And I have a few readers who know that part of me .
I wrote for political publications for many years before my writing about sex started becoming commercially successful .
Do you go off on many topics on your audio show ?
I certainly do .
In fact ...... You get complaints ?
People like their narrowcasting !
Sometimes I get complaints .
I 've got this one Republican listener .
He writes me over and over again .
He wants to discuss his marital situation at length .
I keep quoting my favorite dominatrix to him : " We 're not spanking Republicans any more .
We 're not servicing you with sex tips until you realize that this stuff that you 're doing in bed , and your voting / political behavior are at odds .
You 're hurting people . "
Ow !
We can't spank Ann Coulter ?
God , no !
I would n't touch her with a 10 - foot pole !
Michelle Malkin ?
I do have my fantasies .

as told to Martin Catilian
Some say that , as a parent , Beth Christian was less than perfect .
Some say that as a moralist , she left something to be desired .
But everyone agrees that she knew how to take the Bible 's advice -- very , very literally
All True Bible Stories for Children is a record of Biblical lessons , passed from Beth Christian to her daughter .
Atheists may find them humorous , some Christians may find them confusing , but it is devoutly hoped that all will find enlightenment therein .

Maybe it was just a Freudian slip .
Or a case of hiding in plain sight .
Either way , Sigmund Freud , scribbling in the pages of a Swiss hotel register , appears to have left the answer to a question that has titillated scholars for much of the last century :
Did he have an affair with his wife ’s younger sister , Minna Bernays ?
Rumors of a romantic liaison between Freud and his sister - in - law , who lived with the Freuds , have long persisted , despite staunch denials by Freud loyalists .
The Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung , Freud ’s disciple and later his archrival , claimed that Miss Bernays had confessed to an affair to him .
( The claim was dismissed by Freudians as malice on Jung ’s part . )
And some researchers have even theorized that she may have become pregnant by Freud and have had an abortion .
What was lacking was any proof .
But a German sociologist now says he has found evidence that on Aug. 13 , 1898 , during a two - week vacation in the Swiss Alps , Freud , then 42 , and Miss Bernays , then 33 , put up at the Schweizerhaus , an inn in Maloja , and registered as a married couple , a finding that may cause historians to re-evaluate their understanding of Freud ’s own psychology .
A yellowing page of the leather - bound ledger shows that they occupied Room 11 .
Freud signed the book , in his distinctive Germanic scrawl , “ Dr Sigm Freud u frau , ” abbreviated German for “ Dr. Sigmund Freud and wife . ”
I learned lots of things this week , but the most important thing I learned is that coding by dogma is a widely followed practice .
Who knew ?
I did n't .
And it really took me by surprise .
It all started with my post , " Who Needs a Database ? " which despite its provocative title was not anti database in nature .
Rather , it was a post about shirking convention and building something that works by using simple techniques and simple code .
The end result was a two page website that works exactly the way it was designed to .
The sticking point for many people was that it did n't use a database but used a few flat files instead .
There were a few things about the reactions that took me by surprise .
The first was that many readers left comments insinuating that my post was " anti database " .
The second was that the subject of not using a database utterly , completely and totally ( I know , those adjectives are redundant - I 'm trying to make a point here ) polarized people .
People either thought it was the most stupid thing in the world or they thought it was great .
In fact , some of the backlash was so vehement that JimboJones took it upon himself to post a link to the article on http://www.thedailywtf.com/.
Link is here .
For those of you who have n't been to thedailywtf , it 's like the kiss of death .
To see a reference to your code on thedailywtf is one of the most shameful things that can happen to a developer .
A curious thing happened when I saw the link to my code on thedailywtf and the laugh fest that followed .
I entered a state of deep calm when I saw that there are developers who code by dogma .
I understood then , what made people so angry .
Coding By Dogma
Even though I had clearly written that databases are standard pieces of any architecture for good reasons , nobody seemed to care .
They could n't see past the fact that I WASN'T USING A DATABASE !
Even though I clearly explained that based on the requirements for my site ( requirements that I came up with , for a site that was all mine , not a client ) , there was no need for a database and I could accomplish exactly what I set out to do with just a few flat files , they still shouted " BUT YOU AREN'T USING A DATABASE ! " .
Even after I wrote in a follow up post explaining that people were missing the point which was essentially , if the site does exactly what it 's designed to do , if the site is lean , simple and took me just a few hours to put together then what 's the problem with using a few flat files ?
But they still shouted , " THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU DIDN'T USE A DATABASE AND BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T YOU MADE SOMETHING TERRIBLE ! "
Ok , so nobody actually shouted at me , but it sure felt like it .
So , why did my responses make those guys so angry , even angrier ?
I think it 's because many of us code by dogma .
When presented with a problem ( say , building a simple site exactly like mine ) we automatically say : " ok , first , we know we 're going to need a database , so let 's do that " .
In the vast majority of the cases we'd be right .
What I tried to do was challenge that convention .
I did n't do it senselessly however , I did it in the context where not using a database was a fine choice .
But context does n't matter to us when we code by dogma .
We can't see past not using a database .
There is no situation that might warrant using a flat file over a database .
That 's coding by dogma .
This discussion is by no means new .
I 'd like to wrap up here with a few examples .
Example 1 :
radar.oreilly.com
Gabe ( of memeorandum.com ) wrote : " I did n't bother with databases because I did n't need the added complexity ...
I maintain the full text and metadata for thousands of articles and blog posts in core .
Tech .memeorandum occupies about 600 M of core .
Not huge . "
Mark ( of bloglines.com ) wrote : " The 1.4 billion blog posts we 've archived since we went on - line are stored in a data storage system that we wrote ourselves .
This system is based on flat files that are replicated across multiple machines , somewhat like the system outlined in the Google File System paper . "
In most deployed servers today , the lowest common denominators are VBScript ( on Windows ) , PHP4 , and PHP5 ( on Unix ) .
If we try to require anything fancier on the server , we increase our tech support costs dramatically .
Even though PHP is available for Windows , it 's not preinstalled , and I do n't want to pay engineers to help all of our Windows customers install PHP .
We could use .NET , but then I 'd have to pay engineers to install Mono for all our Unix customers , and the .NET runtime is n't quite ubiquitous on Windows servers .
Since we do n't want to program in VBScript or PHP4 or even PHP5 and we certainly do n't want to have to port everything to three target platforms , the best solution for us is a custom language that compiles to our target platforms .
WROTE HIS OWN LANGUAGE
My goodness , these are fairly well known companies .
I mean , Google uses databases AND flatfiles ... Make sure you read some of the comments .
You 'll hear a lot of the same rhetoric there that you 'll see in the comments left here and on thedailywtf.comExample 2Joel
Spolsky got massive backlash when he wrote about Wasabi , the custom language his company developed .
When I first heard about it I thought it was the most stupid thing in the world .
The more I thought about it though , the more I realized why he did what he did .
Joel says :
When we do n't pay attention to the context - to the real problem we 're trying to solve we fail to see that what Joel did was smart .
Hard , but smart .
What made some people angry was that Joel !
To most people , that 's just a programming excercise , something you 'd do in college , not something you 'd ever want to do in " real life " .
Well , that 's just code dogma .
Thanks for reading !
A company president in her 50s remembered when her first manager told her she was n’t finishing her work .
“ I was surprised , because I thought I was finishing , ” she said .
“ He explained what he meant by ‘ complete . ’
As I listened , I realized he was describing a pattern that I ’d had all through school .
I ’d get to a certain point with a project , and then I ’d lose interest and move on to something else .
Somehow , my ‘ not - quite - done ’ work was enough for me to make good grades throughout college .
When I entered the work world it was a liability .
Once I started really finishing my work , I could see the difference in quality and how it affected our team ’s product . ”
She made a wry face .
“ I still get bored and want to move on to something new , ” the company president continued .
“ If that manager had n’t taken time to give me feedback , I might not be where I am today ; certainly it would have taken longer .
And I ’d be wondering why I was n’t getting ahead . ”
Feedback — when it ’s done well — can improve results and strengthen working relationships .
When it helps people see their blind spots and understand the impact of their behavior , feedback can change the trajectory of a career .
Unfortunately , many managers I talk to confess that they put off giving feedback because they are uncomfortable .
Others tell me that their feedback attempts go awry .
The conversation ends up in an argument , the recipient rejects their feedback , or they feel put on the spot when the other person asks for examples .
When I talk to the receivers of feedback , I hear horror stories of mysterious hints , vague announcements , arguments , blame and humiliation .
A VP of development told me this story .
“ I had a habit of joking and teasing my staff , ” he said .
“ I thought I was being informal — you know , showing the team I was n’t a stuffy suit .
My boss explained that what seemed like friendly ribbing to me felt like intimidation to people lower on the totem pole . ”
The VP ’s eyes unfocused as he remembered the conversation .
“ It was uncomfortable .
But you know , none of my other managers had the guts to tell me my teasing was holding me back .
Once I understood the damage I was doing — both to my staff and my own career — I changed my ways . ”
If feedback is so important , why is it seldom done well ?
It does n’t have to be this way .
Let ’s look at some of the facts of feedback , what gets in the way and how to do it well .
What Is Feedback ?
In a work context , feedback is information about past behavior , given in the present , with the hope of influencing future behavior .
( See What Did You Say ?
The Art of Giving and Receiving Feedback by Charles Seashore , Edith Seashore and Gerald M. Weinberg ; Bingham House , 1992 . )
Giving feedback on work performance and work results is part of every manager ’s job .
Most people want to do well at work .
And most people need information about what they are doing well , and where they may need to adapt to be successful .
There ’s a difference between feedback and evaluation or judgment .
Feedback is information , not judgment or evaluation .
Labels , such as lazy , sloppy , careless or “ not a team player , ” signal judgment about a person ’s character .
Words such as good , bad or worse telegraph evaluation — assessing the quality of work or the rightness of behavior .
Most people do n’t like to be judged , and they ’ll turn off .
Feedback , on the other hand , is specific information about behavior or results that a person can choose to change .
As a manager , you do need to evaluate whether work results and interaction meet the needs of the business .
When you want people to hear your feedback and to make changes ( or to continue to do something ) , focus on information — and keep your judgments to yourself .
When people do n’t agree with the data , they wo n’t accept the feedback .
Take the case of a technical lead who was in the habit of putting senior managers on the spot in company meetings .
His manager wisely phrased his feedback this way : “ In our meeting this morning , you interrupted the VP three times to point out errors in his data . ”
The technical lead readily admitted that he had indeed done that .
Had his manager started with , “ You ’re undiplomatic ” ( a judgment ) , the likely response would be , “ No , I ’m not ; I have the courage to bring up tough questions . ”
Descriptions in neutral language lead to recognition .
When people recognize themselves in feedback they are more likely to keep listening .
When they do n’t agree with the data , they ’re likely to tune you out .
Elements of Effective Feedback
If judgments and labels are out of bounds for effective feedback , what ’s in ?
My experience is that effective feedback has three elements .
It starts with an opening that sets the stage , provides a clear description of behavior or results , and helps the person understand the impact his behavior has on others .
An opening lets people know that you have something important to say , that this is n’t a run -of - the - mill conversation .
It also gives people a chance to respond , “ This is n’t a good time .
Can we talk later ? ”
Giving feedback when someone is rushing to catch a bus or preparing for an important presentation wo n’t help get your message across .
( If the individual never has a good time for feedback , it ’s a different problem . )
Clear descriptive data and examples help people recognize themselves in your feedback .
Most of us are in the habit of making judgments , so providing descriptions of behavior takes a little practice .
Here are a few examples :
DESCRIPTION JUDGMENT OR EVALUATION
Your report uses subheads to help organize the material .
Great report !
I see your face is turning red and you are hitting the table .
You 're freaking out .
In our design meeting , you rolled your eyes after Trudy presented her ideas .
You were rude to Trudy in our design meeting .
I noticed that your questions in our strategy session helped us think about the issues more clearly .
You 're really smart .
Stick to what you know and what you ’ve observed .
Avoid labels , comparatives and absolutes such as always and never .
There ’s sure to be one exception for people to use to invalidate your “ always ” or “ never , ” allowing them to dismiss your feedback .
Notice that not all of these examples are about behavior that is n’t working .
People need specific descriptive information about what they are doing well , too .
If there ’s no impact to the behavior or result , there ’s no need to give feedback .
If the only impact is , “ I do n’t like it ” or , “ I think people should n’t act that way , ” it ’s time to hold off on giving feedback and to examine your own judgments and responses .
Describing the impact helps the feedback recipient understand the effect of his behavior , and why it would be useful to change .
Again , stick to what you know and what you ’ve observed .
Sometimes when I give feedback , I only get as far as describing the behavior or results .
Then the person says , “ Do I really do that ?
I guess I did n’t realize it was a problem . ”
And then they make a change .
Other times , people recognize the behavior , but do n’t realize it ’s a problem until I tell them about the impact .
Once in a while , I need to make a request .
My request may be for a specific change , for joint problem solving or for a proposal on how to address the matter .
Even more rarely , I need to talk about consequences — as in , if this does n’t change , you wo n’t work here anymore .
Feedback given at work should be about work — and only about work .
Once upon a time , a manager attending a night ball game noticed a member of his staff , Fred , sitting several rows in front of him .
He also noticed that Fred was drinking copious quantities of beer .
The next day , Fred nodded off during a meeting .
The manager wisely commented on Fred ’s inattention and said nothing about Fred ’s beer consumption .
Fred ’s attention in meetings is the manager ’s business .
How Fred spends his evenings is not .
There ’s a word for feedback that is n’t about the work results or work interactions ; it ’s called interference .
Secondhand feedback poisons the well .
Too many managers create problems for themselves by passing along feedback from other people .
There are two potential problems with secondhand feedback .
First , when the feedback receiver asks for examples and clarification , you wo n’t be able to give it .
If you have secondhand examples , you ’ll be in the middle of he - said - she - said .
Also , the person receiving feedback will wonder why he ’s hearing this from you , and not from the person who actually had the issue .
That ’s going to put him on the defensive .
Either coach the person who has the issue to give feedback directly , or use your own data .
Unless the situation involves sexual harassment , an ethical matter or bodily safety , stay out of the middle .
In spite of your best efforts , your feedback may not be well received , or may not be received at all .
Here ’s another place where judgments hinder feedback .
Most people have a hard time believing that someone who makes a negative judgment of them has his best interests at heart .
When people believe you have good intentions toward them , they are much more likely to consider your feedback .
You can do flawless job of describing behavior and stating its impact , and the other person may still not hear or accept it .
How people receive feedback depends on your relationship .
If you have a poor relationship , your feedback may be received as “ picking on ” the other person .
The power difference between managers and the people who report to them gets in the way of congruent feedback .
The paradox is that the less vested interest you have in changing someone else ’s behavior , the more likely she is to hear your perception .
Whether the other person hears your feedback also depends on how he is feeling at the moment , and on his own self - esteem .
Some people resist new information that conflicts with their self - image .
You can control only your part of the feedback equation .
Do your best , and know that you wo n’t always succeed .
Performance is a function of the person and the environment [ Performance = f ( p , e ) ] .
We like to believe that performance is all about the individual : his skills , motivation , talent .
Performance is actually a function of the person and the environment .
It ’s management ’s job to create an environment for people to succeed and to support them to reach their best performance .
Before you comment on some else ’s performance , consider the environment .
Are there policies and procedures that penalize people for doing their jobs ?
Have you communicated expectations ?
Are you setting clear priorities ?
Are you insulating the team from undue interference so they have the time and space to do their work ?
Are you micromanaging ?
The bottom line is that if you are n’t doing your job as a manager , the people who report to you wo n’t be able to do their jobs well , either .
Feedback is always about the giver .
We never see ourselves as other people see us .
That ’s one reason feedback is important .
It helps us gain a better picture of how our actions affect the people we work with .
Feedback is about our perceptions of another person , and reveals something about us : our behavior standards , what we consider important , what we value , what makes us uncomfortable .
What that means is that , on some level , feedback is always about the giver , and our perception of the other person , not The Truth about the other person .
The Upside of Discomfort
I hear many reasons not to give feedback .
“ He must know it ’s a problem , ” or , “ She ’s so sensitive ; it will just upset her . ”
Yes , sometimes people feel upset when they hear feedback , especially when it ’s new information and conflicts with their self - image .
If you assume that employees can’t handle these emotions , you relegate them to childlike status .
Most people in the workplace are adults , and do n’t need managers to protect them from their own emotions .
It can be uncomfortable to give feedback .
However , the discomfort is usually short - lived .
Withholding feedback — or substituting judgments for descriptive information — has long - term consequences in lower productivity and damaged relationships .
Feedback that describes behavior and explains impact can improve both results and relationships .

Each one amazing and now , thanks to these remarkable pictures , they can be seen for the first time .

Using an array of technology , the images reveal what until now has been a secret - exactly how animals develop in the womb .
They were created by the same team who in 2004 showed how human embryos " walk in the womb " .
Using a combination of three - dimensional ultrasound scans , computer graphics and tiny cameras , the team were able to show the entire process from conception to birth .
" These kind of images from inside animals have never been seen before , " said Jeremy Dear of Pioneer Productions , who made the film .
" We worked with dozens of zoos and animal sanctuaries across the world .
There were a lot of different challenges - recording a dolphin is very different from an elephant , for instance .
" Animals were trained to sit still near the scanners and we also inserted cameras into the womb via the elephant 's rectum - But it has been worth it .
It one sequence we follow an elephant developing .
When it is finally born , there is not a dry eye in the house .
" The images in the film are a testament to the ingenuity and patience of the production team led by Yavar Abbas and Dr David Barlow , who worked with some of the world 's leading vets to obtain these pictures . "
The images were created for the programme Animals In The Womb , a two - hour show to be broadcast on the National Geographic Channel in America next month and on Channel 4 and the National Geographic Channel in the UK next year .
Researchers used scans to track elephant calves developing for almost two years in the womb - the longest gestation period of all mammals .
It shows at 16 weeks the elephant foetus starting to look more like an elephant as the trunk develops .
At almost a year , the trunk is longer than the legs , and by 14 months , the characteristic elephant ears are visible .
They will eventually grow to almost two feet across to help regulate the body temperature of the fullymature - elephant .
At birth , he will weigh nearly 260 lb and be able to take his first steps in minutes .
Animals closer to home were also studied .
A golden retriever foetus is shown exhibiting some of the same behaviour as family pets , panting with its tongue out , while still in the womb .
Programme makers also reveal the moment at eight weeks when a baby dolphin learns to swim while in the womb .
During the next few weeks , it develops flippers , a tail and a blowhole before being born after a year , and must be able to quickly swim to the surface to take its first breath of air .
Experts also found that at 24 days , the dolphin embryo develops tiny leg - like buds , which then disappear over the next two weeks .
After 11 weeks , the dolphin embryo's fins display bone structures resembling human hands , which experts believe may show that dolphin ancestors were land dwellers .
The footage also shows how many animal embryos are like human ones .
" The incredible thing about the early images is how we all look very similar - it is obviously we humans share a common mammalian ancestry very early in life , " said Mr Dear .
I occasionally get emails from people who tell me that I hate America .
They tell me that I 'm destroying our country , and that the world would be better off if I would just go live in some Communist nation .
These people equate love of America with allegiance to the government , and patriotism with loyalty to their favorite politicians .
Sometimes people tell me that they wish I would be thrown out of the country , tried for treason , or even executed .
Here 's a common example ( spelling and all ) :
your a traitor and should be executed just like your friend sadaam
The words differ from email to email , but the overall theme stays the same .
Why do you hate America and the American people ?
Why do you love " the terrorists ? "
The most common , though , is what I call the " get out " email ; if you do n't like it , you should just leave .
To me , this type of position is one of weakness .
Do n't stand up for what you believe in .
When you do n't like things , do n't try to change them .
Instead of speaking out , run away .
Utter weakness .
Like this note from " Tom " :
Why do n't you go to some other country and live ?
You obviously do n't appreciate what you have here .
Or this short and sweet email from " FREE MAN "
MOVE TO CUBA
I often wonder if people like Tom or the free man would run away if they opposed the government 's foreign policy , or would they obediently fall in line the way they want other people to do .
America :
Love it or leave it ; that 's what this type of person says .
Does this mean that anyone who rises in opposition to any American war is a traitor and hates freedom ?
Or , is it just this war , or the last war , or the next one , or the one after that ?
Is everyone who does n't like this massive government a communist ?
Is it impossible for a person to love America and dissent at the same time ?
Or , are we supposed to accept that every single person under every single government ever to exist - including the victims of murderers like Stalin , Mussolini , Nero or Napoleon - hated their country because they hated the government that oppressed them ?
Unfortunately , some people identify with the methods of these dictators .
Take this love letter I received from " Kenneth " :
Your web site SUCKS .
You are all traders and if this was 1952 , You would all be shot .
Get real you pieces of shit .
To these people , being patriotic is nothing more than showing obedience to those in power .
Did Ken think the same way when other presidents were in office ?
As far as these government - lovers are concerned , to oppose the U.S. war machine is to hate America .
To stand up against politicians who press for more wars is traitorous .
But , on the other hand , to be a cheerleader for all the killing and torture is being a good , patriotic American .
They think that freedom is a nice idea , but government security is much more important .
For them , the military is America .
War is America .
The president is America .
The NSA is America .
Every politician that they love and worship is America .
And , if you do n't like it , you obviously hate America .
You must be some kind of terrorist , or communist , or whatever term they decide to label you with ; and you 'd rather be living in some foreign dictatorship .
It 's important to note , though , that most discussions on patriotism neglect the most important issue - what it really means to love America .
You see , I love America .
I love the liberty that still does exist here .
I refuse to live in a socialist dictatorship like Cuba .
But what is it that makes America great ?
Is it its two - trillion dollar government ?
Is it its role as world Superpower or its self - proclaimed status as spreader of democracy ?
Absolutely not .
I love liberty .
I love the Bill of Rights .
I love the freedom of speech and strictly limited government .
I love personal privacy and religious freedom .
I love habeas corpus and the jury trial .
These are just a few of the things that make America special ; one - of - a- kind in the history of the world .
It is liberty that is a direct cause of much of the prosperity this country has had .
It is liberty that has driven millions and millions of people around the world to give up everything to come here .
Unfortunately , too many people in this country appear to have very little love for that America .
They make is quite clear that they 're willing to abandon these ideals of liberty .
Arturo from Florida is one of those people :
dear idiot , sorry , mr idiot , here 's a little background info ; i've been in the car business for 9 years ; the middle eastern's are liars , cheats , and skates .
They will steal from you every chance they get ; unfortunately , are gov't does n't get it and does n't know history ; yes , we had the the right to invade iraq .
now we need to pull out ; why ?
b/c we do not know who we are dealing with and we do n't have the balls to slit their throats , b/c we are a civilized and the liberal media ; you have to kill all these people like they would kill you
Sadly , these people are weak and afraid .
They want the military - someone else - to go out and kill whoever they 're afraid of .
These bloodthirsty warmongers may claim that they 're patriotic , but they 're willing to throw away everything that 's good about America .
They 're willing to give up our beloved liberties .
They 're content to give the government the power to do whatever it wants .
They assume , with complete naÃ¯vetÃ© , that doing so will never affect them .
They berate free speech with the hope that they can shut up people who oppose war .
Take Kathie , for example :
Well , why do n't you just go live in Iraq then ?
Oh ... right .... you most likely would n't have the freedom over there to spout your nonsense about their government without repercussions .
You mock the very government that gives you the right to mouth off .
These people believe that freedom of speech is only good when it 's used in support of the government .
But , what 's the point of free speech at all if we are n't supposed to be using it to oppose what we see as wrong ?
Without dissent there can be no freedom !
Even Napoleon recognized this :
" I fear three newspapers more than a hundred thousand bayonets . "
Our own President Eisenhower was quite clear in his opposition to people like Kathie :
" May we never confuse honest dissent with disloyal subversion . "
People like Tom , Ken , Arturo and Kathie , whether out of fear or weakness , are willing to abandon the Bill of Rights and turn this country into a police state .
They 're willing to let innocent Americans die by supporting our government 's bombing of innocent foreigners - and almost guaranteeing that there will be more terrorist attacks against us in the future .
I 'll say it again .
I love America .
And - I 'm not leaving .
For many years , the federal government has done some terrible things .
I strongly oppose their supporters too ; but I 'll never insist that they leave the country .
The U.S. government seems to be preparing to invade the entire world , beginning with countries like Iran and Syria .
If it succeeds in doing so , it will kill hundreds of thousands more people on top of the millions it has killed in just the last sixty years alone .
I vehemently oppose this , not because I hate this country .
I oppose this because I love America , I love peace , I love my fellow man , and I love liberty .
What will make this country truly great is not what the government will do , but what it wo n't do .
This country will be great when it stops taxing us into oblivion , and no longer wages aggressive wars .
This country will be great when it never again takes people 's property without due process , spies on people , or tortures people .
This country will be great when it no longer interferes with personal choice and peaceful behavior , and when it no longer interferes with free speech .
This country will finally achieve true greatness when it respects life and liberty .
Love of , and hope for liberty , is what made America great .
I fear that hope is dying , but I still believe that We the People can someday break this system of power and create a truly free society .
The fact that I receive far more supportive emails than the negative examples above gives me hope .
I 'll leave you with this inspiring note from Peter in Australia :
Truth may not be forceful - it relies for its efficacy on a willing and free acceptance , but it can heal .
It can even repair a broken world .
Like sanity , truth is grounded in the soil of the real world , as we ourselves can be thought of as being derived from the soil of the real world .
Truth poses no threat to anyone save those who rely on untruth as the cornerstone of their foundations .
It is time to speak the truth - irrespective of who is listening or even has the ears to hear .
It is time to speak the truth , and clearly , I 'm not alone .

Worrying about the meaning of life seems like a popular activity .
People wonder what the meaning of life is , and if their lives have meaning .
And some cling to their religion because they think that their lives will be meaningless without it .
Of course as it is phrased the whole issue is nonsensical .
Meaning has to do with language , with how a word represents something or communicates something .
And a life is not the kind of thing that can represent or communicate , and so it does n’t make sense to inquire about its meaning .
So by these questions people must mean something else , if they mean anything at all .
One way of understanding worries about the meaning of life is as worries about the purpose of life .
And one way of understanding what it can mean for a life to have a purpose is to see a life with purpose as one that has a goal towards which it is working .
For the religious this usually means a place in the good afterlife instead of the bad afterlife .
But this is n’t the only possible goal .
A life could be lived with the purpose of doing the most good possible , or of collecting the most stamps possible .
As I see it , if a life has a goal it is self - assigned .
It is true that external agencies may try to influence people towards living their life with one goal or another ( society wants you to contribute , your boss wants you to work , ect ) , but I do n’t think it makes those goals more real or more valid unless the individual chooses to accept them .
And of course there is no obstacle to individuals deciding their own life ’s goal ; we can decide on smaller goals validly , such as to go to the store , to get a job , ect , so there seems to be no barrier in deciding to have a goal that requires an entire life to complete .
Another way of understanding what it can mean for a life to have a purpose is to see a life with purpose as one that is part of some greater process .
Obviously the religious interpret this as god ’s plan , but again there are many other possibilities .
For example , we could see a life as being part of cultural or intellectual progress .
And of course there are a number of human designed plans that a life could be part of ; you could dedicate your life to serving some organization , which surely has far reaching plans of its own .
And again there is n’t a factor that makes any one of these larger schemes more or less valid than another .
Obviously personal preference will determine which an individual chooses to be part of , if any , but the fact that individuals choose differently does n’t make their choices invalid .
A final way of understanding what it can mean for a life to have meaning , going back to the original form of the question , is as one that is important .
Of course if something is important it is important for a reason , because it is valuable to someone or something , or because it serves a purpose .
Since we have already investigated what it can mean for a life to have a purpose let us instead turn to the idea that it is valuable .
Now in my previous discussion of what was valuable I pointed out that value was always relative to someone or some system that can be said to have interests .
Again , the religious will say that it is god to whom we are valuable .
And again that is not the only possibility .
Our lives can be valuable to ourselves , to others , to society , ect .
And , as with the previous two possibilities , individuals may decide differently on which viewpoint they want their life to be value to , and there is no reason to say that one of these choices is less valid than any other .
But some may be unhappy with the number of possibilities in each of these ways of understanding what it can mean for a life to have a purpose .
It may seem like the number of possibilities devalues them all , making then essentially arbitrary , and thus unfulfilling in some way .
I think this is because we may all instinctively want an understanding of the “ meaning of life ” to be something that makes our lives easier .
If there was one simple answer then we could just follow it , and our worries about whether we were living the right way , or if our lives were important , could be set aside .
But just because a single answer may be desirable does n’t mean that there actually is one .
However , even though there is n’t a single answer of the kind we may have been looking for it does n’t mean that there is no answer either .
Instead we simply have to make a choice , instead of having that choice made for us .
And obviously we will make that choice based on our interests , based on what is important to us , and so the choice made will be different for different people , but that does n’t invalidate it .
Essentially then the meaning of life is what you make of it .
You can choose to live in a life that has no meaning , but you can also choose to live one that does , based on the standards that seem important to you ; the fact that not everyone else will agree with you has no bearing on the issue .

Basically the agency , snow by LG&F ; , came up with the idea of selling some items on eBay complete with pictures saying " Sorry , already sold on Hebbes.be " .
Check out the snowboard , the lamp or this motorbike .
Hurry up if you want to see the campaign in action , since eBay will be probably remove it sooooooon , no wonder why :-) .
Yes , the pages have been already removed , but here I 've saved a screenshot of a page : click on the image below to enlarge it .

Hourly wages for tech professionals hit a record high during the fourth quarter of 2005 , according to a report released Monday .
According to the Yoh Index of Technology Wages , hourly pay increased by 3.1 percent to an average of $ 30.27 per hour between October 10 , 2005 and November 6 , 2005 .
Since the fourth quarter of 2001 , wages for “ high - impact technology professionals ” have rise nearly 11 percent , the frm found .
The positions in the most demand include SAP functional consultants , who commanded an average of $ 75.09 pr hour .
Data warehouse architects , CRM managers , hardware / firmware engineers and a generic project manager classification rounded out the top five .
“ Ending 2005 with the highest wages for skilled technology professionals recorded in five years is a high water mark for the industry , ” said Jim Lanzalotto , vice president of strategy and marketing for Yoh , in a statement .
“ Despite major economic setbacks during the year , the technology industry has demonstrated its strength and confirmed its power to propel the employment market in a positive direction . ”
The Yoh data is culled from actual employment activity of over 5,000 technology professionals outsourced on short - and long - term projects by over 1,000 of the nation ’s top employers in aviation , engineering , information technology , manufacturing , scientific , telecommunications , and utility industries , according to the company .
It is used to determine salaries in Fortune 500 companies .
According to Yoh , the top ten jobs with the highest demand by employers in the fourth quarter of 2005 , together with their average hourly wages , were :
Thursday marks the fifth anniversary of the day the US military flew the first of some 700 battlefield detainees from Afghanistan to Guantánamo .
Some of those same men are among the 395 still held at Guantánamo today .
None of the detainees has ever had anything approaching a fair trial .
Only 10 have ever had formal charges laid against them .
Many are reportedly held in near - total isolation , and over the years both camp staff and released detainees have reported highly abusive treatment at the camp .
Guantánamo is a stain on America 's honor .
Like the episodes of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq , Guantánamo ( rightly ) affects the standing of the US around the world .
Even President Bush recognizes the problem :
He has expressed a desire eventually to shut Guantánamo down .
He and Congress should work speedily together to achieve this goal .
Lives in limbo
But meanwhile , the US military has constructed additional " supermax " cell blocks there .
It 's true , plans are also under way to build courtrooms that may one day help reduce the number of detainees , though officials admit that only a small number of detainees will ever be tried there .
And even these trials , held under the Military Commissions Act ( MCA ) that Congress passed last September , are the subject of court challenges that may take many months to resolve .
So the detainees ' lives remain in limbo .
They are still held in troubling conditions , unable to see a clear end to their situation and unable , for now , to see or challenge any of the US government 's evidence against them .
This is a real problem for a nation that considers itself a nation of laws and in the past has worked hard to uphold the rule of law in the international arena .
One fundamental principle of the rule of law is that a government may deprive a person of his liberty only under conditions regulated either by its own national legal system or ( in certain circumstances ) under the international laws of war , primarily , the Geneva Conventions .
Under national legal systems , prisoners should normally be entitled to a timely and fair trial , at which they can see and challenge the evidence against them .
Under the Geneva Conventions , combatants captured in war have no right to trial , but they must be kept in humane conditions and released to their home countries when the war ends .
After the US invaded Afghanistan in October 2001 , it found itself holding thousands of men captured on or near the battlefield .
The Bush administration declared that the " war on terror " it was fighting there was unlike all previous wars , and therefore these captives were not entitled to Geneva protections .
In Iraq in 2003 , by contrast , the administration said the Geneva Conventions did apply .
The men the US detained in Afghanistan fell into a legal black hole , and for many of them , the name of that black hole has been Guantánamo .
Administration lawyers argued for several years that US jurisdiction did not apply there .
Last June , the Supreme Court ruled that it does , but it also ruled that the detainees do n't have all the rights of US citizens .
When Congress passed the MCA last September , it tried to define what rights the detainees have and what kind of a trial they 're entitled to .
However , government lawyers say they 're unwilling to disclose the evidence they have against many detainees in a courtroom .
( This is why only a few detainees will be granted a trial . )
The US lawyers probably have some legitimate concerns about disclosing the sources of secret evidence .
But it 's also likely that they do n't want to disclose the circumstances of the interrogations from which most of their alleged evidence was acquired .
Facing the moral challenge
The government 's problems regarding Guantánamo remain unresolved .
The MCA courts promise no speedy closing for the prison camp there .
And the " war on terror " that has been used to justify those prisoners ' detention without trial will probably never have the kind of clear end that – if they were regular prisoners of war – would allow their release and repatriation .
Guantánamo is also a major moral challenge for the American people .
We need to find a way to close this camp of shame and shine a light on the abuses committed there so that they 're never repeated .
The detainees against whom there is solid evidence should be tried , and if found guilty , incarcerated .
Let 's see and fully examine all the evidence .
The rest should be released and given help for their rehabilitation after their years of dehumanizing detention .
Will the new Congress take up this task ?
I certainly hope so .

Haskell Records Considered Grungy April 24 , 2007
Ugly field selection syntax
OK , the most trivial complaint first .
If we have defined a record like this :
> data Bird =
Bird { name :: String , wings :: Integer }
How do we go about accessing the ‘ name ’ and ‘ wings ’ fields of a record instance ?
If you are used to a language like C , you might say it would look something like this :
> ( Bird { name = “ Fred ” , wings = 2 }) .name
Unfortunately , this is n’t the case .
Actually , declaring a record creates a named function which uses pattern matching to destroy a passed record and return the name .
So access actually looks like this :
> name ( Bird { name = “ Fred ” , wings = 2 } )
Prefix notation may please the Lisp fans , but for me at least it can get a bit confusing , especially when you are dealing with nested fields .
In this case , the code you write looks like :
> ( innerRecordField . outerRecordField ) record
Which ( when read left to right , as is natural ) is entirely the wrong order of accessors .
However , it is possible to argue this is just a bug in my brain from having spent too long staring at C code .. anyway , let ’s move onto more substantitive complaints !
Namespace pollution
Imagine you ’re writing a Haskell program to model poulty farmers who work as programmers in their spare time , so naturally you want to add to the Bird record above a Person record :
> data Person = Person { name :: String , knowsHaskell :: Boolean }
But I think you ’ll find the compiler has something to say about that ….
Records.hs:4:23 :
Multiple declarations of ` Main.name ’
Declared at : Records.hs:3:19
Records.hs:4:23
Ouch !
This is because of the automatic creation of the ‘ name ’ function I alluded to earlier .
Let ’s see what the Haskell compilers desugaring would look like :
> newtype Bird = Bird String Integer > name :: Bird ->
String
> name ( Bird value , _ ) = value > wings :: Bird ->
Integer
> wings ( Bird _ , value ) = value > newtype Person = Person String Boolean > name :: Person ->
String
> name ( Person value , _ ) = value > knowsHaskell :: Person ->
Boolean
> knowsHaskell ( Person _ , value ) = value
As you can see , we have two name functions in the same scope : that ’s no good !
In particular , this means you ca n’t have records which share field names .
However , using the magic of type classes we can hack up something approaching a solution .
Let ’s desugar the records as before , but instead of those name functions add this lot :
> class NameField a where
> name :: a ->
String > instance NameField Bird where
> name ( Bird value , _ ) = value > instance NameField Person where
> name ( Person value , _ ) = value
All we have done here is used the happy ( and not entirely accidental ) fact that the ‘ name ’ field is of type String in both records to create a type class with instances to let us extract it from both record types .
A use of this would look something like :
> showName :: ( NameField a ) => a ->
IO String
> showName hasNameField = print ( “ Name : ” ++ ( name hasNameField ) ) > showName ( Person { name = “ Simon Peyton - Jones ” , knowsHaskell = true })
> showName ( Bird { name = “ Clucker ” , wings = 2 } )
Great stuff !
Actually , we could use this hack to establish something like a subtype relationship on records , since any record with at least the fields of another could implement all of its field type classes ( like the Name Field type class , in this example ) .
Another way this could be extended is to make use of the multiparameter type classes and functional dependency extensions to GHC to let the field types differ .
Of course , this is all just one hack on top of another .
Actually , considerable brainpower has been expended on improving the Haskell record system , such as in a 2003 paper by the areforementioned Simon Peyton - Jones here .
This proposal would have let you write something like this :
> showName :: ( r < : { name :: String } ) ->
IO String
> showName { name = myName , .. } = print ( “ Name : ” ++ myName )
The “ r < : { name : String } ” indicates any record which contains at least a field called name with type String can be consumed .
The two dots “ .. ” in the pattern match likewise indicate that fields other than name may be present .
Note also the use of an anonymous record type : no data decleration was required in the code above .
This is obviously a lot more concise than having to create the type classes yourselves , as we did , but actually we can make it even more concise by using another of the proposed extensions :
> showName { name , .. } = print ( “ Name : ” ++ name )
Here , we omit the “ name = myName ” pattern match and make use of so - called “ punning ” to give us access to the name field : very nice !
Unfortunately , all of this record -y goodness is speculative at least until Haskell ’ gets off the ground .
Record update is not first class
Haskell gives us a conventient syntax for record update .
Lets say that one of our chickens strayed too close to the local nuclear reactor and sprouted an extra limb :
> exampleBird = Bird { name = “ Son Of Clucker ” , wings = 2 }
> exampleBird { wings = 3 }
The last line above will return a Bird identical in all respects except that the wings will have been changed to 3 .
The naïve amongst us at this point might then think we could write something like :
> changeWings :: Integer -> Bird ->
Bird
> changeWings x = { wings = x }
The intention here is to return a function that just sets a Bird records “ wings ” field to x .
Unfortunately , this is not even remotely legal , which does make some sense since if it was record update should , to follow normal function application convention , look more like this :
> { wings = 3 } exampleBird
Right , I think that ’s got everything that ’s wrong about Haskell records off my chest : do you know of any points I ’ve missed ?
Edit : Corrected my pattern match syntax ( whoops :-) .
Thanks , Saizan !

Starts of new homes plunged 14.6 % last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.486 million , the lowest level since July 2000 , the Commerce Department estimated Friday .
Building permits fell as well , down 6.3 % to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.535 million , the lowest in nine years .
It was the largest percentage decline in permits in seven years .
" The worst in the housing sector has not yet passed , " said Ray Stone , chief economist at Stone & McCarthy Research .
The data carry potential implications for policymakers at the Federal Reserve , economists said .
" Housing activity is falling more than the ' soft landing ' scenario , incorporated into the Fed 's forecast , and the forecasts of most private - sector forecasters , " Stone wrote clients .
" A swift reaction on the part of home builders to adjust supply to be more in line with weaker demand is not likely to unnerve the Federal Reserve , " wrote Joshua Shapiro , chief economist for MFR , in an e-mail .
But Stephen Stanley , chief economist for RBS Greenwich Capital , saw a silver lining in the October data .
" We see this as an unambiguously good thing , " he wrote .
" The faster builders address their bloated inventories and bring the pace of home construction down , the quicker the housing correction will play out and the economy can return to a more normal footing . "
Housing starts are now down 27.4 % from October 2005 levels , and building permits are down 28 % on a year - on - year basis .
So far in 2006 , starts are down 11.1 % compared with the first 10 months of 2005 .
Read the full government report .
October 's decline was much larger than expected by Wall Street economists , who had been forecasting a 4.5 % drop in starts to 1.69 million as well as a marginal decline in building permits to 1.62 million .
See Economic Calendar .
Moreover , September 's starts data were revised lower , to 1.74 million from 1.77 million .
Permits were revised higher , however , to 1.638 million from 1.620 million .
Bonds rose following the report , while stocks were lower .
See Market Snapshot .
Details
The pullback in building was widespread .
October 's starts fell by 26.4 % in the South , marking the region 's largest decline in 22 years , and by 11.7 % in the Midwest and by 2.1 % in the West .
Starts rose 31 % in the comparatively small Northeast market .
Poor weather likely contributed to the large decline in the South , economists said .
Starts of single - family homes fell 15.9 % to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.177 million , also the lowest since July 2000 and the largest percentage decline since 1991 .
Starts of multifamily units fell 9.1 % to 309,000 .
The National Association of Home Builders reported on Thursday that its survey of builder sentiment rose for the second time in a row in November , on the heels of eight straight declines , and said that builders may be seeing " the light at the end of the tunnel . "
See full story .
The government 's housing data are subject to large sampling and other statistical errors .
It can take five months for a new trend in housing starts to emerge from the data .
In the past five months , housing starts have averaged 1.70 million annualized , down from 1.79 million in the five months ended in September and 2.12 million for the comparable period ended last January .

IT IS surely an American oddity that , after the worst mass shooting in the country 's history , some are already saying that such horrors would be less likely if only guns were easier to own and carry .
Americans love firearms .
The second item in the constitution 's bill of rights , just after freedom of speech , religion , assembly and the press , is the right to bear arms .
It is part of the national religion .
Mass killings remain rare events , whatever outsiders might think , and they also happen in other countries , including those with tight rules on gun ownership .
But life in modern America is punctuated frighteningly often by such attacks .
Making any sort of accurate international comparison is tricky , but some attempts have been tried .
The International Action Network on Small Arms ( IANSA ) , an activist group , counts 41 school shootings in America since 1996 , which have claimed 110 lives , including those in Virginia this week .
IANSA also looks at school shootings in 80 other countries .
Culling from media reports , they count only 14 school gun killings outside America in the same period .
Putting aside the Beslan massacre in Russia — committed by an organised terrorist group — school shootings in all those countries claimed just 59 victims .
As striking are the overall rates of violent death by handguns in America .
The country is filled with 200 m guns , half the world 's privately - owned total .
Residents of other countries may fret that criminals , gang - members and insane individuals are increasingly likely to use guns and knives .
But in comparison with America , few other developed countries have much to worry about .
The gun-murder rate in America is more than 30 times that of England and Wales , for example .
Canada — like America , a “ frontier ” country with high rates of gun ownership — sees far fewer victims shot down : the firearm murder - rate south of the Canadian border is vastly higher than the rate north of it .
America may not quite lead the world in gun murders ( South Africa probably holds that dubious title ) but it has a dismally prominent position .
What might be done to improve matters in America ?
The intuitive answer , at least for Europeans and those who live in countries where guns are less easily available , is that laws must be tightened to make it harder to obtain and use such weapons .
Not only might that reduce the frequency of criminal acts , goes the argument , but it may also cut the number of accidental deaths and suicides .
Yet some in America are reaching the opposite conclusion .
Within hours of the shootings in Virginia on Monday April 16th , a conservative blogger was quoting a Roman military historian , suggesting that “ if you want peace , prepare for war ” ( “ si vis pacem , para bellum ” ) .
Others put it more bluntly : “ an armed society is a polite society ” .
Virginia 's gun laws are generally permissive .
Any adult can buy a handgun after a brief background check ( as required by federal law ) , and anyone who legally owns a handgun and who asks for a permit to carry a concealed weapon must be granted such a permit .
Yet Virginia
Tech , like many schools and universities , is a gun- free zone .
Gun advocates are daring to say that if Virginia Tech allowed concealed weapons , someone might have stopped the rampaging killer .
To gun-control advocates , this is self - evident madness .
The issue remains one of America 's many culture wars , dominated by an uncompromising dialogue between two extreme camps .
Western and southern states , libertarians and American exceptionalists believe that guns are part of the national fabric .
They say the second amendment is plain : “ the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed . ”
Gun-control advocates note the introductory clause to that amendment , “ A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State ” , and say that the framers of the constitution never intended America to be packed with citizens bearing private weapons .
In recent years the right - to - arms camp has been getting stronger .
Even Democrats are shifting in favour .
The Democratic presidential candidates carried only one state in the south or mountain West in 2000 and 2004 , so the party has decided that , to win at the national level again , it must drop support for gun control .
That strategy seemed to work in the congressional elections of 2006 , when pro-gun Democrats did well .
The likes of Jon Tester , a new senator in Montana , and Heath Shuler , a North Carolina congressional freshman , did much bragging about their lifelong gun ownership and support for the second amendment .
This suggests that , though gun laws may be tweaked after the Virginia massacre , there will be little significant change to come .
The Columbine killings of 1999 failed to provoke any shift in Americans ' attitudes to guns .
There is no reason to believe that this massacre , or the next one , will do so either .
2,500 overtaking motorists in Salisbury and Bristol were recorded
The study found drivers tend to pass closer when overtaking cyclists wearing helmets than those who are bare - headed .
Dr Ian Walker was struck by a bus and a lorry during the experiment .
He was wearing a helmet both times .
But the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents said tests have shown helmets protect against injuries .
To carry out the research , Dr Walker used a bike fitted with a computer and an ultrasonic distance sensor to find drivers were twice as likely to get close to the bicycle , at an average of 8.5 cm , when he wore a helmet .
The experiment , which recorded 2,500 overtaking motorists in Salisbury and Bristol , was funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council .
Dr Walker , a traffic psychologist from the University 's Department of Psychology , said : " This study shows that when drivers overtake a cyclist , the margin for error they leave is affected by the cyclist 's appearance .
This study suggests wearing a helmet might make a collision more likely
Dr Ian Walker
" By leaving the cyclist less room , drivers reduce the safety margin that cyclists need to deal with obstacles in the road , such as drain covers and potholes , as well as the margin for error in their own judgements .
" We know helmets are useful in low - speed falls , and so definitely good for children , but whether they offer any real protection to somebody struck by a car is very controversial .
" Either way , this study suggests wearing a helmet might make a collision more likely in the first place , " he added .
Dr Walker thinks the reason drivers give less room to cyclists wearing helmets is because they see them as " Lycra - clad street warriors " and believe they are more predictable than those without .
He suggests different types of road users need to understand each other .
" Most adult cyclists know what it is like to drive a car , but relatively few motorists ride bicycles in traffic , and so do n't know the issues cyclists face .
" There should definitely be more information on the needs of other road users when people learn to drive and practical experience would be even better . "
Wig wearing
To test another theory , Dr Walker donned a long wig to see whether there was any difference in passing distance when drivers thought they were overtaking what appeared to be a female cyclist .
While wearing the wig , drivers gave him an average of 14 cm more space when passing .
In future research , Dr Walker hopes to discover whether this was because female riders are seen as less predictable than male riders or because women are not seen riding bicycles as often as men on the UK 's roads .
However , a spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents insisted : " We would n't recommend that people stop wearing helmets because of this research .
Helmets have been shown to reduce the likelihood of head and brain injuries in a crash .
" [ The research ] highlights a gain in vulnerability of cyclists on our roads and drivers of all types need to take more care when around them . "
The Christmas party offers pitfalls and opportunities , research says
The web chart firm says footage from office bashes posted on video share websites tripled in 2006 to 150,000 .
Clips included a woman complaining about her boss , who , unknown to her , was standing directly behind .
Another seasonal report says the Christmas party circuit is good for networking and career development .
Business coach John McKee says that the festive party circuit is perfect for ingratiating yourself with workplace superiors .
Be a ' stand out '
When the top brass appear , he says the extra effort expended on sucking up to the top man or woman could pay off in terms of promotion in the following year .
And adopting a tone of matey familiarity with the object of your schmoozing can only help the scheming to succeed , he advises .

Wage slavery ?
from what they teach me here at the university and from all i have read , it is not the wage itself ( nominal income ) but the purchase power that matters ( given by real income ) .
researches show that generally a multinational company offer a higher ammount in wages tahn national companies , for the same activities .
and they also offer more opportunities that actually did not exist before for the people there .
take child labour for example .
if the children are not allowed to work in a certain company they would not have the moeny to feed themselves and put themselves to school and many may resort to thievery , prostitution begging ...
so what 18 dollars can buy in us ... about 4 dollars can buy in mexico ... i dunno the exact currency parity .
you cannot ask a company to pay 18 bucks an hour if what he produces in that country is not worth 18 bucks ...

The World from Berlin What 's the Price of Life ?
Many Germans affected by recent changes in the country 's welfare system have been taking their cases to court .
Now Germany 's Federal Social Court has ruled that a monthly 345 plus rent and heating are enough to live on -- if you like the simple life .
Last month I described a program I wrote for a machine translation project in Perl and how it turned out to be much slower than I expected .
As you may recall , I rewrote the program in C++ , and it was a hundred times faster .
I suspected this was due to all the conversion in Perl back and forth from strings to floating point numbers in the program , and to all the string copying necessary for function calls .
Some people ( in person and in the comments ) suggested I should try rewriting it in Python , which has native floating point numbers , to see if it was any faster .
It was n't .
I 'd never written a Python program before , so I timed myself as I ported and debugged it — about an hour and a half .
When I finally had it working , it ran about as slow as the Perl version .
A full run of the Perl version takes 20 hours and I was n't feeling patient enough to let the Python version run to completion , but eyeballing the program 's progress indicator showed the Perl and Python versions were about the same speed , while the C++ version was much faster .
This implies it 's not actually all the string conversion and copying that are making the program slow , because Python does n't do those .
So what 's slowing Perl and Python down ?
I decided to find out .
I wrote little programs called add , mult , and func , in C++ , Python , and Perl — nine programs altogether .
Each consists of a single loop , and the names tell you what happens in that loop : add adds integers , mult multiplies floats , and func calls a dummy function .
( In fact , mult and func also do an integer add for the loop counter , so they 're really like add plus an additional operation . )
All of them take a single command - line argument which tells them how many times to loop .
I started running them , increasing the number of iterations by a factor of ten each time , until I got some nice , macroscopic timings that were big enough to swamp any fixed startup cost .
The magic number was 10,000,000 iterations .
I 've collated the timings , which are the " real " times reported by the Unix time command , in the table below .
The " Slowdown " column tells how many times slower than the fastest ( C++ ) version each program is :
Program Language time ( ms ) Slowdown add C++ 23
add Perl 1464 64 x add Python 3242 141 x mult C++ 99
mult Perl 2686 27 x mult Python 5285 53 x func C++ 43
func Perl 5143 120 x func Python 6413 149 x
As you can see , it 's not specifically the floating point operations or the function calls that are causing the trouble .
Even a tight loop containing nothing but integer operations is 64 times slower ( Perl ) or 141 times slower ( Python ) than the C++ version .
Doing floating point multiplications or function calls in the loop affects the timings a bit , but the results are still roughly proportional : C++ is fast , Perl is an order of magnitude or two slower , and Python is roughly another factor of two slower than that .
This leads me to think that the performance differences are due almost entirely to the fact that Python and Perl are interpreted languages .
I guess there 's a lot of overhead associated with compiling the code ( or the bytecode , in the case of Python ) repeatedly as it's executed .
At least , I 'm pretty sure that 's what 's going on in the interpreters — if anyone knows better , I 'd be curious to hear about it .
These results are pretty disappointing .
I like the high - level scripting languages , with all their built - in convenience , for doing quick - and - dirty programming .
As I said , this was my introduction to Python , which I 'm about to use for an unrelated project , and it's a pretty nice language — very terse , kind of like pseudo - code that actually runs .
Unfortunately , for any project that 's going to be computationally intensive — which is pretty much the definition of " computational linguistics " — a 25 - to -150 - times performance hit just is n't acceptable .
With Python ( and maybe Perl , I 'm not sure ) it 's possible to write the innermost loops in C or C++ , but I do n't really like that solution for two reasons .
First , as long as I 'm going to have to write some C++ for speed , I might as well write it all in C++ and have the whole program be fast .
Second , if I ever distribute the code , it narrows the potential audience if they have to know , and have installed , two computer languages to use it instead of just one .
Hmm , now I 'm wondering how Java would perform .
No !
Must ... resist !
Must ... finish ... generals paper ...
[ Note : This is actually the third version of this post .
The numbers reported in the original version were wrong — even though I 'd called g++ with the - O0 option , it still did some optimizations that threw the timings off , especially for mult .
After this was pointed out in the comments , I tried to do a quick fix and ended up screwing it up much worse .
Oops .
In particular , multiplying by - 1.0 was being compiled into an exclusive - or instruction instead of a floating point multiplication , so it ran too fast .
My quick fix was to multiply by - 1.1 instead , but raising - 1.1 to the ten millionth power overflowed repeatedly and wasted a bunch of time in floating point exception handling .
That made it run way too slow .
The real fix was to multiply twice in each loop , once by 10.0 and once by 0.1 ( and do the loop half as many times ) .
That correctly compiles to floating point multiplication instructions and never overflows .
I also had to make all the other programs increment their loop counters by two in order to get an addition instruction instead of a special - purpose increment instruction , but the performance difference there was very small .
I decided that having an update and an update to that update in this post would be hopelessly confusing , so I rewrote the whole thing instead .
Thanks to Joshua " Necro " Macy , Russell " Mimsy was the " Borogove , and the myserious KK for pointing this stuff out and keeping me honest .
I 've left all the original comments intact , so if you 're interested , you can probably reconstruct most of the sordid history of this post .
Oh , and greetings to any future hiring committes who might be reading this .
Now , you might be thinking that the initial errors in this post imply a certain sloppiness on my part , but I prefer to focus on how the final , corrected version demonstrates my committment to getting the details right ... eventually . ]

I spotted something that I found neat today .
A blogger named Wulf recently devised a system for tracking blog comments , without using any native comment system .
He uses the Blosxom blogging system that does n’t ( as far as I can tell ) natively support comments .
Additionally , any system for keeping track of comments is prone to being inundated with spammers .
So when Wulf decided that he wanted comments for his blog he decided to use a comment system that he already knew about : Flickr Photo Comments .
The way it works is rather simple :
You create a post for your blog .
You then pull down a list of your photos using the Flickr API .
You associate one photo with the particular post .
You then add each Flickr Photo URL to the bottom of your post , as a way of commenting .
For example , here ’s a post from his blog , and here ’s the associated comment page .
There are a couple things that I like about this technique in particular :
It completely kills the comment spam problem – leaving that to Flickr , it brings more views and comments to your Flickr photos , and it uses a system for an unintended purpose .
All in all , I really dig it .
I hope that he chooses to build a plugin out of it , as I think others would really enjoy using something like that .
Update : More discussion on reddit .
Yesterday , I wrote about research that debunked the notion that garlic supplements could lower LDL cholesterol .
Today it 's more bad news for the supplement industry with a report of a meta - analysis study that examines the effects of antioxidants on mortality .
A range of different vitamins and minerals have been identified as having antioxidant properties , including vitamins A and C , beta carotene and selenium .
Although a well - balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables contains ample amounts of these antioxidants , an army of talking heads and ' experts ' make their living by promoting the use of supplementary antioxidants at ever - increasing doses as cure - alls against cancer , aging , and any number of other ailments .
Even Linus Pauling , noted Nobel Laureate , spent the latter years of his career claiming that vitamin C was a panacea for just about every complaint he could think of .
However , a new meta - analysis of existing studies published in JAMA regarding the use of antioxidant supplements shows that far from prolonging longevity , beta carotene , vitamin A , and vitamin E usage were associated with increased mortality .
Dr Bjelakovic and his team at Copenhagen University Hospital identified 68 different trials , encompassing 232,606 patients in total .
These were sorted into high - bias risk and low - bias risk , based on the quality of the methods employed .
When all of these trials were pooled there was no significant finding , but when the 47 low - bias trials were examined , there was a five percent increased risk of mortality .
Individually , beta carotene increased risk of mortality by seven percent , vitamin A increased risk of mortality by 16 percent , and vitamin E increased risk of mortality by four percent .
Although this is contrary to common sense , the authors suggest a reason for this finding .
Although antioxidant production is associated with a number of diseases , many physiologic processes also involve free radical generation .
They propose that " eliminating free radicals from our organism , we interfere with some essential defensive mechanisms like apoptosis , phagocytosis , and detoxification . "
As ever , the best advice would seem to be to make sure you get those five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables a day , and lay off the pills .

Last week the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals heard arguments in the case against Union Pacific Railroad , which is being sued for failing to cover contraceptives in its health plans .
In July 2005 a U.S. District court ruled in favor of the two women who filed the suit along with Planned Parenthood .
The original ruling stating that Union Pacific , which employs about 49,000 workers nationwide , including 1,300 ( that ’s 2.6 % for those of you keeping track ) , illegally discriminates against female employees by not providing contraceptive coverage in its health plans .
The lower court went further , saying that Union Pacific ’s policy is in violation of the federal Civil Rights
Act of 1964 , which prohibits employers with 15 or more employees from discrimination based on gender or pregnancy .
The policy was deemed discriminatory because it covered many preventive health medications — including drugs for erectile dysfunction — but not contraception .
The company has argued that it did not need to provide contraceptive coverage “ because fertility is ‘ normal , ' ” and , therefore , birth control is not “ medically necessary . ”
Ah , and Viagra is sooo necessary .
Judge Pasco Bowman , who sits on the appeals court panel said Thursday that if the ruling holds it could mandate all companies to cover birth control in their plans .
Crikey !
I had n’t realised this .
We ’re most of us well - enough informed about the way the EU keeps on trying to impinge on national criminal law , what with proposals about holocaust denial and what have you .
But how about this :
British businessmen could find themselves in American jails after a crackdown by the US Department of Justice on trade with “ rogue states ” , leading lawyers say .
Ali Manzarpour , a Brighton - based businessman , is in jail in Poland awaiting extradition to the United States , despite never having visited the country .
He is charged with trying to export an experimental single - engine aircraft to Iran .
This is not believed to have contravened any British or European law , but because the aircraft originated in the US , the Americans are claiming jurisdiction .
The unfortunate Mr Manzarpour was apparently arrested in Poland two years ago and has been in prison there ever since , trying to avoid extradition to the USA — a country he ’s never visited , remember — because of a perfectly legal transaction he undertook from the UK , having obtained all necessary UK export licences .
As Lord Waddington asked , in a brief debate in the Lords , initiated by the Conservatives , this time last year
My Lords , is it not correct that , in exporting the goods to Iran from Britain , Mr Manzarpour broke no British law and , if he had remained in Britain , there would have been no question of his being extradited to the United States ?
If that be correct , why are we not protesting vigorously to the American authorities at their attempt to have Mr Manzarpour sent to America from Poland to stand trial for acts that took place in Britain and that were not contrary to our law ?
According to Michael Marinelli , an international trade lawyer with Cooley Godward Kronish in Washington ,
The US is asserting its juristiction over people in other countries …
If you resell goods that originate in the US , then no matter what UK law says , the US says : ‘ We can come after you . ’
Particularly , it seems , if you ’re small fry ;
The Times goes on to explain that
Cases being brought by the US Department of Commerce against companies breaching export rules indicate that , apart from rare cases , such as that of ITT [ the world ’s leading manufacturer of night - vision goggles , fined $ 100 million ( £ 51 million ) last month for sending classified material to China ] , nearly all involve small operations .
Companies such as Shell , which is planning a £ 5 billion liquid natural gas venture in Iran , and Halliburton , which had an office in Tehran for years , appear to be of less concern to authorities in Washington than an individual allegedly attempting to to sell a light aircraft .

Bangalore becoming too expensive for Startups ?
Apr. 26th , 2007 @ 05:21 pm
I guess it doesnt really work that well .
At least in Bangalore where folks dont care as much about stocks as they care about salaries .
From Munjal Shah's
He has a very well written post about the rising salaries in Bangalore , which led them to this decision .
Its become common knowledge that freshers now start at 8 - 12L pa salaries in Bangalore .
Given how difficult it is to hire experienced people , its not difficult to imagine salaries 3 - 4X higher than that ( Simplistically - someone who started at 6L , had a 25 % raise every year after 8 years would be at 6*( 1.25^8 ) = 35.7L ) , and suddenly you are talking of figures which are around $ 90 k pa - which is at par with what that person would be getting in the US as well .
( what with the Dollar now trading at about 41 Rs . )
Its going to become increasingly difficult for Startups based in Bangalore to survive for a reasonable amount of time even with a good amount of funding .
As larger companies continue to increase their salary levels , to meet the talent shortage .
As a result , we 'll probably see fewer startups , and even fewer funded startups ( because VCs would have burnt their hands ) .
And the people who work at the startup will work there for making the startup a success .
So hopefully we 'll see the success rate of startups in Bangalore going up ( passionate employees == > successful company )
The con is that , for a good engineer , taking the plunge of joining a startup will become even more difficult .
Disclaimer :
These are my views alone , and do not have any reflection of the hiring policy that the startup I work for follows .
For that matter , I dont even know about my companies recent hiring policies .
Startups have a tough time recruiting talent .
The only real benefit that they have to offer an engineer is stocks .
You would think that thats very good , and that should incentivize people enough to join startups , especially those who believe in what you are trying to do .
( This is what I believed in when I joined a startup ) I guess it doesnt really work that well .
At least in Bangalore where folks dont care as much about stocks as they care about salaries .
From Munjal Shah 's blog - Riya ( Like.com ) have closed their Bangalore centre and are moving key folks back to the US center .
He has a very well written post about the rising salaries in Bangalore , which led them to this decision .
Its become common knowledge that freshers now start at 8 - 12L pa salaries in Bangalore .
Given how difficult it is to hire experienced people , its not difficult to imagine salaries 3 - 4X higher than that ( Simplistically - someone who started at 6L , had a 25 % raise every year after 8 years would be at 6*( 1.25^8 ) = 35.7L ) , and suddenly you are talking of figures which are around $ 90 k pa - which is at par with what that person would be getting in the US as well .
( what with the Dollar now trading at about 41 Rs . )
Its going to become increasingly difficult for Startups based in Bangalore to survive for a reasonable amount of time even with a good amount of funding .
As larger companies continue to increase their salary levels , to meet the talent shortage .
As a result , we 'll probably see fewer startups , and even fewer funded startups ( because VCs would have burnt their hands ) .
And the people who work at the startup will work there for making the startup a success .
So hopefully we 'll see the success rate of startups in Bangalore going up ( passionate employees == > successful company ) The con is that , for a good engineer , taking the plunge of joining a startup will become even more difficult .

The last batch I remember that had reasonable placements was yours when even getting through Infy was considered big .
Nowadays when you go to the colleges for a company presentation or to organise an event , nobody seem to be interested in anything but the pay package being offered .
You are talking from the software perspective , just imagne the kind of beating the start - ups in the other fields of engg are facing .
Software salaries are a bench mark for all placements in progress and in other fields those salaries are unimagionable for highly experienced people .

There is good reason for it .
For a fresher , and I mean the average fresher , any work is good work and unless you really really know what you want to do and know the definition of " Good Work " and have a clear idea , any work you get is good .
Also , * MOST * work given to freshers in a mainstream company is very very average and the work by itself is no where close to being enough to tilt opinions .
Also , there is the promise of good work to come with time and that promise holds with every single company that you join .
There is * NO * company which says join us and your work will remain boring for ever ... there is always the promise of bigger things with time ...
So monetary compensation plays a very big role !

Call me pessimistic but I think that for a long time to come , as a country we will fail doing high end stuff due to the setup .
We need some sort of a mass purging and revisit how we do things as an industry .
The purging may not be direct , just the right corrections might result in many voulantary exits .

It all started as pure cheap labour , when it got a little less cheaper , people started noticing that a lot of real cheap labour was sub par in absolute terms but the cost befenit was making up for the talent deficit .
The talent deficit ( from a percentage perspective ) just keeps getting worse , the talent deficit cost benefit gap at the lower levels keeps narrowing which eventually bubbles up to the upper level .

But we need to remember that this salary is mostly to attract talent .
Freshers who are paid these amounts generally do not get any hike at least for first 2 years .
Also , personally I feel that 25 % hike per year , compounded , is a bit unrealistic .
Within a particular company a more reasonable figure would be 12 - 15 % yearly compounded .
Again if a person is hopping job every year and asking for 30 % hike for every switch ; the 3rd or 4th company to recruit that person can , at best , be called dumb .
As far as I know most companies do keep an eye on number of jobs changed in certain years .
Barring few MNCs which hire couple of thousand people , I think most guys in India / Bangalore are paid what is a minimum wage in the USA -- $ 8/hr !!!

Most startups are now hiring college students as temps to work on small projects .
The advantage is that its relatively cheaper to hire students .
Ofcourse they are no replacement for permenant employees , but it is a solution to get temp employees for a startup when you still can't afford permenant employees .

Update 5 - FBI and IRS raid offices of at least 6 legislators including Alaska Senate president Ben Stevens looking for ties to VECO
Juneau , Alaska
8/31/06
AlaskaReport.com has learned the the IRS and the FBI raided the offices of at least six Alaska lawmakers Thursday in a search for any ties between the legislators and oil field services company , VECO Corp. , an Anchorage - based oil field services and construction company whose executives are major contributors to political campaigns .
Two legislative aides , who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from federal agents who told them not to talk to reporters , said FBI agents were looking for any ties including financial information and gifts .
One aide said agents did not show him the warrant , but said officials described what was in it .
He said the warrant allowed for the search of computer files , personal diaries and other documentation : " It pretty much covered the gamut . "
The other aide said he demanded to read the warrant before allowing the search and that VECO officials Bill Allen , Rick Smith and Pete Leathard were named in the warrant .
As of 4:40 pm , FBI agents were still in the Juneau offices of Alaska Senate President Ben Stevens and Senate Rules Committee Chairman John Cowdery .
FBI spokesman Eric Gonzalez said search warrants were being served at those offices , but would n't say who is being targeted , what the investigation is about or when it began .
The IRS would not confirm or deny the story .
" It 's an ongoing investigation is all I can say , " Gonzalez said .
Cowdery was seen being questioned around noon by federal agents in a conference room .
Cowdery would n't say what the raid was about .
Asked by a reporter whether he was under criminal investigation , he said , " I do n't think so " .
At least a dozen agents were seen in the Anchorage offices early this afternoon , and also were seen in offices in Juneau .
Agents came and went from the offices of Stevens , Cowdery and a nearby conference room .
Around 1:30 p.m. , an agent wearing latex gloves could be seen through the blinds in Stevens ' office placing items in a box .
Sen . Kim Elton , D - Juneau said he had been told that FBI agents from out of state were searching several offices including Stevens , Cowdery and Rep. Vic Kohring , R - Wasilla .
Sen .
Tom Wagoner , R- Kenai , said he arrived for a meeting at the Anchorage office a little before noon and was n't allowed to enter the Senate offices .
" The place was crawling with FBI , " Wagoner said .
Parts of this story were from ADN.com and wire reports .

Oil revenues have boosted Angola 's economy and helped reduce poverty
Its annual study of the continent found that 16 African states had managed to maintain annual economic growth of more than 4.5 % since the 1990s .
This had enabled them to lift more of their citizens above the poverty line .
Meanwhile , the number of African conflicts had fallen from a peak of 16 in 2002 to five in 2005 .
Mixed results
" Africa today is a continent on the move , making tangible progress on delivering better health , education , growth , trade and poverty - reduction outcomes , " said Gobind Nankani , the World Bank vice - president for the Africa region .
The bank 's African Development Indicators report highlighted the extreme diversity of economic achievement in Africa .
On one hand , Zimbabwe 's economy shrunk by 2.4 % in 2004 - while Equatorial Guinea 's economy surged 20.9 % .
AFRICA FACTS
Highest per capita income - Seychelles ( $ 8,190 ) Biggest economy - South Africa ( GDP of $ 152bn ) Largest population - Nigeria ( 128.7 million )
Lowest total life expectancy - Botswana ( 35 years )
Greatest HIV prevalence - Swaziland ( 33 % of 15 - 49 year - olds ) Source : World Bank
Africa development quiz
But the report also noted that inflation on the continent was down to historic lows , and that the region had managed to weather the impact of higher oil prices in recent years .
On a more negative note , the bank said foreign investment in the continent was just $ 10.1 bn in 2004 - only 1.6 % of global foreign investment - and that more than 50 % of the funds were spent in Nigeria and Sudan .
The report also highlighted the difficulty of starting a business in many parts of Africa - taking , across the continent , an average of 64 days .
Millennium Development Goals
In more positive vein , the bank 's report said that countries including Senegal , Mozambique , Burkina Faso , Cameroon , Uganda and Ghana were on course to meet the target of halving poverty by 2010 - five years ahead of schedule .
The eradication of extreme poverty and hunger is one of the eight Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) agreed by 189 countries in New York in 2000 with a target date of 2015 .
Each MDG also includes a number of indicators designed to measure its progress , which are intended to be tracked and updated regularly by UN member governments and international governing bodies such as the World Bank .
The year 2005 saw a particular focus on Africa and the MDG's - it was a key focus of the G8 summit in Gleneagles and saw the publication of reports from the UN Millennium Project and UK's Commission for Africa .
Prospects
In its latest Africa report , the World Bank said that many countries had made good progress in meeting some of the other MDGs , such as getting more young children into primary education and improving child mortality .
THE EIGHT GOALS 1 : Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger 2 : Achieve universal primary education 3 : Promote gender equality and empower women 4 : Reduce child mortality 5 : Improve maternal health 6 : Combat HIV / Aids , malaria , and other diseases 7 : Ensure environmental sustainability 8 : Develop a global partnership for development
Looking forward , it said improved governance and management of natural resources was a key requirement , particularly with African nations due to receive a $ 200 bn windfall from oil revenues between 2000 and 2010 .
It said it was seeing signs that African leaders were taking more responsibility for improving governance and assisting the private sector in attracting foreign investment and boosting trade with growing markets like those in China and India .
“ Gazelles , ” she said last May , “ run faster than elephants . ”
Responding to voters ’ disillusionment with traditional elitist politics , she is promising more power to the people , giving local governments more authority , subsidizing small businesses , creating affordable housing and encouraging citizens to submit their ideas online , for example .
Even her opponents agree that her looks help .
Published photos of her in a bikini while on vacation underscored her youthfulness and glamour , while in poll after poll , her telegenic smile and elegant profile have appealed to a French public yearning for a new style of leadership .
Ms. Royal , president of the Poitou - Charentes region in the west , has also cultivated an image as a grass - roots nurturer , taking her campaign to the countryside to listen to concerns about social issues such as educational reform and youth crime .
With a portfolio that includes stops at three second - tier ministries — Environment , School Education and Family and Childhood — Ms. Royal has been criticized as lacking the experience and gravitas to lead a country that is a nuclear power .
Her inexperience in foreign policy issues surfaced last week when she said during the last campaign debate that Iran should never be allowed to have a civilian nuclear energy program .
As her opponents quickly pointed out , Iran enjoys that right as a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty .
But the party members ’ enthusiasm for Ms. Royal seemed to trump any slips on policy issues .
“ Her victory means that the Socialist Party is still under the shock of April 2002 and is looking above all for a candidate who can win , ” said Dominique Reynié , a professor of political science at the Institut d’Études Politiques in Paris .
“ Much more important than a doctrine or a program is the look of a champion . ”
In the April 2002 presidential election , the Socialist candidate , Prime Minister Lionel Jospin , was eliminated in the first round , trailing even the far - right National Front candidate , Jean - Marie Le Pen .

I 'm still at the O'Reilly Emerging Technologies conference in San Diego .
James Surowiecki's talk today , Independent Individuals and Wise Crowds , or Is It Possible to Be Too Connected ?
Was the highlight of the day , in my opinion .
I took near - verbatim notes , published below .
Note : by near - verbatim , I mean that I captured almost every thought Surowiecki expressed , using his language for the most part , with a few interpolations and omissions that do n't affect the meaning .
Surowiecki :
This talk wo n’t end in a coherent answer .
But I wanted to raise specific problems or issues around questions of collective intelligence , collaboration , collective action , a whole host of themes that you ’ve heard about here .
One of the major themes of the last decade : a lot of interest in various ideas about collective action and collaboration .
Slashdot , Google .
Prediction markets , flash mobs , Wikis , Linux , del.icio.us , are all examples of projects that bring together large groups of people to work together explicitly or implicitly .
Google , for example , harvests group intelligence about the Web .
All these things have something in common in the way we experience them .
In the same sense , there ’s been a lot of writing about network effects , emergent behavior ( Steven Johnson ) , smart mobs ( Howard Rheingold ) , the wisdom of crowds ( the title of my book ) and ewallet in this article .
There ’s an affinity between all these ideas .
But I want to talk about the differences between these things – it ’s useful to think about how these things are not alike .
The ontology may be overrated , but classification still has used , in particular , because different problems require different solutions .
Josh Schachter talked about this .
If you use the wrong kind of collective action , you can end up with worse problems than the ones you set out to solve .
There ’s been a lot of fuzzy thinking about what we mean when we talk about collective intelligence , network , and interaction .
I want to parse these distinctions .
In The Wisdom of Crowds , I wrote about the power of groups under certain circumstances to be remarkably intelligent .
A model of collective intelligence : a large group of people reflecting diverse opinions offering judgments independently with some mechanism to aggregate the judgments , collectively ending up with an intelligent outcome .
The crowd contained a lot were experts , but many were merchants , family members .
Galton collected guesses and took the average .
The group had guessed that the ox would way 1,197 pounds .
And in fact , it was 1,198 .
The group ’s judgment was virtually perfect .
The argument in the book is that this is not a coincidence , nor is it confined to livestock .
It can be seen at work in a far more complex phenomenon .
At the racetrack , the odds on horses predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win .
Horses with 3:1 odds win about a quarter of the time .
The favorite wins most often , the second favorite wins second most often , etc .
Odds are determined collectively through everyone ’s bets .
Probabilistic judgments , it turns out , are excellent .
Corporations have experimented with this model .
Eli Lilly has an internal stock market to predict which drug candidates are most likely to make it through Phase III clinical trials .
Their whole business is built on this question .
It ’s open to 100 “ semi- experts , ” and collectively they can recognize which candidates are viable and which are not , well in advance .
Contrast this to Linux .
It ’s a large group working on problems , but ultimately one individual writes the piece of code that gets incorporated .
The decision - making process is centralized .
In the end , just a few people or even only one person decides what goes into the kernel .
This is a different kind of collaboration from collective judgment .
Contrast this to the anthill , as the metaphor for human behavior ( Stephen Johnson uses this example in Emergence ) .
Ants do n’t know anything .
Remember the scene from Antz ( or maybe it was A Bug ’s Life ) : the leaf falls in the middle of the long line of ants and the ant panics , does n’t know what to do .
Though no individual ant knows much , their interactions produce quite stunningly exceptional results .
Ants are remarkably good at finding food with the least amount of energy .
The way they do this is by following straightforward rules , similar to the way birds flock , and they pay enormous attention to those around them .
The interaction is the essence of the intelligence .
Human beings are not ants .
We do n’t have the biological programming or tools that ants have .
The way ants find food has to do with their formic acid secretions ; the more trails , the more signals ; the entire colony can find its way to the food source .
We have no equivalent to this .
For us , interaction is incredibly problematic , especially when it comes to group behavior .
If there is too much interaction among human beings , groups end up being less intelligent than they would otherwise be .
The book has quite a bit about small groups .
Put a bunch of smart people into a room , and they emerge dumber than when they went in .
Why can interaction have such negative consequences ?
Firstly , human beings herd .
They tend to stick with what others are saying .
“ It is better to fail conventionally than to succeed unconventionally . ” – Keynes .
Humans like the comfort of the crowd .
Mutual fund managers herd , even though their whole business is predicated on doing better than those around them .
It ’s a way to appear reasonable .
If you want to look that you have a pretty good idea of what you ’re doing , do what those are around you are doing .
Second , humans imitate .
We are imitation machines .
The example I use in the book : social scientists put a few guys on a street corner and had them look up at the sky .
Pretty soon about a third of the people passing stopped and started looking up at the sky .
When the scientists had five or six guys looking at the sky , 60 percent of the passers - by looked .
When it was 10 or 12 people , 85 percent looked .
People do this because we assume that if a lot of people are doing something or think it ’s valuable , it very likely is valuable .
That ’s a tremendously useful assumption .
The problem is that when human beings imitate slavishly or without considering what they ’re doing , you get a bunch of people looking on the street corner looking up at an empty sky .
Scientists call this an information cascade .
You ’ve read The Tipping Point .
It ’s the notion that once an information cascade gets going , it becomes very hard for people making a decision later in the process not to do what everyone else has done .
Say you have two restaurants , both empty , and there ’s no reason to think that one is better than the other .
You go to the street corner , look in , and decide I ’ll go to this one .
The next couple comes along and has the same problem .
They see you ’re in one restaurant , and they say we ’ll go there .
Pretty soon everyone assumes there is some value to the fact that everybody is in one restaurant , even there was n’t .
It can be proved mathematically that after a certain point it becomes rational to do what everyone else is doing , also if you have information that suggests the opposite is true .
As long as you assume that everyone else is rational , that is .
That ’s what The Tipping Point is all about .
People no longer making decisions on their own , but only because those in front of them have done the same .
Quality has little to do with what ends up getting chosen .
Collective decisions may not be in any sense tied to class .
The result : the group as a whole becomes less intelligent .
On the web , the critical factor in a site getting more links is how many links it already has .
In that model , there is no guarantee that the group as a whole is intelligent .
The wisdom of crowds does not emerge .
Pascal said all problems in the world arise from one simple fact : a man cannot stay in his room and think quietly by himself .
That ’s not what I think we should do .
Interacting has enormous value , for a variety of reasons .
You may have information that would be valuable to me .
Our exchange may lead to a more diverse and intelligent group forecast .
Sometimes feedback is useful : Your judgment may sound crazy , but perhaps I ’ve overestimated the odds on my horse ?
Finally , some problems need to worked on collectively — for example , in team sports .
In computer science experiments at the University of Michigan , a researcher , Scott Page , had his agents compete until they differentiated into three groups , Dumb , Intelligent , and Random .
Then he had them solve the problem as groups .
The Intelligent group outperforms the Dumb group , but not by very much .
But the Random group almost always beats the Intelligent group .
Page ’s theory is that the reason for this is that even if the less intelligent groups know less , what they know is different .
This has significant implications for the way decision making works inside organizations .
Make groups that range across hierarchies .
The conclusion is that you actually can be too connected , if the connections are wrong and if they ’re reinforcing your existing prejudices rather than altering them .
You can pay to much attention to those around you , even if they ’re brilliant .
The flip side of Pascal ’s isolation is the cacophony you find on the net ; it bombards you with many voices .
Separation and dissonance , interestingly , allow you to arrive at the same place : independence .

Forget the multi-tasking Domestic Goddess .
New research proves what most men have suspected for years - women are messier than men
Here is a useful exercise for men who find themselves accused by their partners of being disorganised slobs — or for those generally sick of the stereotype that men are untidy and women are fastidious little angels .
Grab the nearest handbag — it might belong to your wife or to a friend at the office — dump the contents on a desk and ask them to convince you that all their stuff is necessary to get through the day .

My wife 's bag , for instance , contains the following : three packets of tissues ; two packets of chewing gum ; two sheets of Nurofen liquid capsules and two packets of antiseptic wipes ; one ( empty ) glasses case ; one monkey finger puppet ; a tube of lip salve ; mobile phone ; Clinique foundation makeup ; four used tickets to the Paris metro and four receipts ; a piece of paper with the code to her debit card written on it ; a button , a pen and four hairclips ; a wallet the size of a brick containing euros , Sterling , four credit cards and a Lego loyalty card ; a receipt for some shoes and a Euro Millions lottery ticket ; car keys ; and some drawings , executed in crayon , by our youngest .
Do you agree with Martin Newland ?
Tell him what you think in readers ' comments below ...
And this , she admitted to me , was after she had cleared her bag out .
And now for my wallet : driver 's licence , credit card and £ 65 in cash .
Now let 's move on to our cars .
My wife gains no exemptions here because she has to drive the children around more .
I work from home and ferry them around , too .
Her car is , basically , a skip .
I once removed nine empty bottles of water from it .
The clothes for the local charity shop are still in the boot , three weeks after I put them there .
There are crumbs everywhere , month - old sandwich crusts , hundreds of pieces of chewed gum wrapped in paper ( chucking it out of the window would harm the environment , apparently ) , shoes , DVDs and empty crisp packets .
My car , for its part , contains a few CDs and nothing else .
Research from the University of Arizona , released last week , revealed that women 's desks are dirtier than men's because they are more cluttered — with handbags , cosmetics , lotions , mobile phones and food .
And the research goes on to say that women have up to four times as many germs in , on and around their desks , personal items , computers and phones than men have .
The findings throw doubt on the universally held belief that women care more about cleanliness than men .
They make one wonder about the accuracy of surveys which present women as living in a permanent state of guilt about the messiness of the home .
And about the notion , commonly held , that men are less concerned about grime and thus capable of sitting on the sofa watching television while ' the little woman ' scurries about in her pinny , frantically dusting .
I , for one , have always believed that women generate more clutter and as the Arizona study points out , where there is clutter there is dirt .
Has anyone noticed women 's magpie - like obsession with pictures and memorabilia in the workplace , for instance ?
It is as though a little something from every chapter of their lives has to find its way onto their desk , from pictures of every member of their extended family to a coaster from that lovely little bistro on the Champs Elysees .
Then there 's the cute and cuddly toy animals gathered around , or even suspended from , the angle poise lamp .
The female desk also draws its clutter from a woman 's capacity for emergency planning .
Racks of clothes are to be found nearby , for that unforeseen evening event or accident with the gravy in the canteen .
Drawers are crammed with spare tights , medical equipment , shoe polish , diet aids , hair curlers , back massagers and gym clothes .
There used to be a programme on American television called MacGyver , in which the hero was capable of using everyday objects to make gadgets to get him out of trouble .
I reckon MacGyver would be able to fashion a small thermonuclear device from the contents of the average female 's desk drawers .
Just because the man tends to sometimes leave the seat up does not mean he is the house slob .
Just because , after a hard day and a little too much to drink , he sometimes goes to bed leaving his clothes strewn on the floor does not place him beyond the pale .
These are random transgressions that are easily matched or even surpassed by the general chaos of a woman 's life .
My sister - in - law , Pascale , is an unbelievably good cook .
But she is capable of turning the kitchen into a battle scene from the Somme .
It is as though the task at hand is not so much to feed people as to use absolutely every bit of crockery , every utensil right down to the last potato - peeler and garlic press , in the process .
When at the family place in France , where sometimes as many as 25 people are seated for dinner , I find myself praying that she will not call for a cheese course — because this means 25 more plates to clean .
How is it possible to use three separate colanders preparing one meal , or two cheese graters ?
I once , in a fit of washer - upper 's pique , counted the number of wooden spoons she had used — ten .
You could build a sizeable doll 's house with ten wooden spoons .
At the end of one of Pascale 's meals , the kitchen is not just messy .
It looks like Beirut in the bad old days .
It looks like it has been strafed by an F16 fighter plane .
A ND WALK into any family bathroom and inventory the products .
Man has razor , shaving foam , deodorant and toothbrush .
Woman has every conceivable unguent , cosmetic , conditioner and shampoo , usually sealed to the bathroom surface by spillage .
There are hundreds of cotton buds , and boxes and boxes of pointy things and brushy things that would look more at home on Torquemada 's torture rack than in a bathroom .
There are clothes draped over everything , slippers abandoned at the door , bathrobes hanging on towel rails and towels hanging over the banisters .
There are five blouses lying on the bed because it is impossible for a woman to simply choose a single item to wear before going out .
They have to stage a mini fashion show , trying on combinations of clothes and asking the husband , at each combination , how she looks ( as if he would ever , ever say anything other than ' wonderful ' ) .
A new school means my 16 - year - old daughter has recently come home to live with us .
She is like a tornado , capable of generating more mess than the three boys combined .
Every corner contains a discarded pair of her Converse shoes .
She always seems to be washing her hair , which is fine by me except that she then walks around the house unwinding wet towels from her head and draping them over the nearest upright object .
Much is made of a woman 's ability to multi-task .
Women , unlike men , the theory goes , can do several things at a time .
But doing several things at a time is only of use if those things are actually completed .
Otherwise the house is transformed into a series of half - finished ' projects ' , with airing cupboards unpacked , socks paired and sorted but not put away , and recycling abandoned halfway down the garden path .
But traditional roles in the home have become confused .
Lovely Gordon 's taxation policies , which force every household member capable of earning a wage to find work , mean that the natural rhythms of family life are disturbed .
Both parents have only a couple of hours in the evening to reacquaint themselves with the children , put them to bed , tidy up , cook ( or heat up a ready made meal ) and talk to each other .
I have friends who describe how depressed they are at coming home to find the detritus of the morning — breakfast utensils and hastily discarded pyjamas — still scattered around the house .
They describe the return from work as a ' housecoming ' rather than a ' homecoming ' .
In these situations there is no space for traditional role models .
Both sexes pitch in with dealing with the basics and leave the actual cleaning , where finances allow , to a cleaner .
WHEN I recently found myself unemployed , we dispensed with our au pair , a fantastically efficient robot who had the whole house sparkling by 10am .
Thrown together without help , I have to report that despite my comments about women and cleanliness , it was my wife who kept the house clean , while I kept it ordered .
I would deal with the drifts of laundry while she would make sure the loos did not turn into major biohazards .
I would lift the sofa up while she vacuumed underneath , and so on .
I have to add also that she does the family finances .
If she was to leave tomorrow I would not know how to access my own internet bank account .
But none of this leaves her any the less inclined towards messiness and personal chaos .
I was discussing this piece with my wife and mother - in - law a couple of days ago .
' Why do you need to carry so much stuff around with you ? '
I asked , citing the three packets of tissues I had found in her handbag .
' Because I have to think about the children , all of whom have runny noses , ' she answered .
' Women need more stuff than men and you would just tell them to use their sleeves . '
Fair enough , I suppose .
But mere contingency planning still does not account for the sheer amount of stuff a woman owns .
When I worked in an office , there were some women whose outfits and accessories — from shoes to skirts to blouses to bracelets to shades — never seemed to make a second appearance in any given week .
It is perfectly normal on the other hand to see a man wearing the same suit two or three times a week .
Even the most organised woman cannot possibly lead an orderly life while at the same time displaying , in the words of Shakespeare , her ' infinite variety ' .
There simply is not enough storage space in the workplace , in her handbag or at home .
The president of the World Bank has one asset : his credibility .
The Bank ’s capacity to make a difference lies not in its money and ideas but in its ability to be the world ’s voice for development .
This includes , as Paul Wolfowitz , the current president , has insisted , being the voice for good governance .
Recent revelations have , however , demonstrated such serious failures that the Bank ’s moral authority is endangered .
If the president stays , it risks becoming an object not of respect , but of scorn , and its campaign in favour of good governance not a believable struggle , but blatant hypocrisy .
It is important to understand what is not at issue here .
It is not Mr Wolfowitz ’s unpopularity , even though his role as an architect of the Iraq war made him disliked from the start .
It is not failures of management , even though his reliance on a group of outside appointees made him mistrusted by many inside and outside the Bank .
It is not disagreements over development doctrine , where some convergence of views has occurred .
It is not a romantic relationship with a subordinate , itself hardly a rarity in today ’s world .
The issue is whether the failures of corporate governance are serious enough to damage the Bank ’s moral authority .
In a world where curtailing corruption and improving governance have become central to the practice of development , the world ’s premier development institution must , like Caesar ’s wife , stand above suspicion .
What then is the story ?
When Mr Wolfowitz became president of the World Bank he also became the boss of his girlfriend , Shaha Riza .
To resolve this situation – inconsistent , rightly , with Bank rules – Ms Riza was seconded to the US State Department .
So far , then , so unproblematic .
Yet , it is alleged , the terms of the appointment , which appear astonishingly generous , violate a number of Bank protocols .
Worse , it now appears Mr Wolf­owitz personally directed the Bank ’s head of human resources to offer his girlfriend these exceptional terms .
Worse still , this has come out after misleading claims by a senior official that the ethics committee of the board , in consultation with the general counsel , approved the agreement .
What then do we see here ?
The answer is : an apparent violation of Bank rules ; favouritism that borders on nepotism ; and a possible cover - up .
It is true Mr Wolfowitz and Ms Riza were put in a difficult position .
Even so , what has come out would be bad in any institution .
In an institution that spear - heads the cause of good governance in the developing world , it is lethal .
The World Bank has moved from being a self - proclaimed exemplar of best practice in corporate governance to an example of shoddiness .
As long as Mr Wolfowitz stays , this can be neither repaired nor forgotten , be it outside the Bank or inside it .
In the interests of the Bank itself , he should resign .
If he does not , the board must ask him to go .
“ The first day we put the electrode in , it was shocking , ” Dr. Tsao said .
“ Cell after cell responded to faces but not at all to other objects . ”
Her results were published in October in the journal Science .
Dr. Tsao ’s investigation yielded a surprising related finding : areas of the brain she had identified as face - specific occasionally lighted up in response to objects that bore only a passing resemblance to faces .
“ Nonface objects may have certain features that are weakly triggering these face cells , ” she said .
“ If you go above a certain threshold , the monkeys might think that they ’re seeing a face . ”
In the same way , she said , objects like cinnamon buns , rocky outcroppings and cloud formations may set off face radar if they bear enough resemblance to actual faces .
Pawan Sinha , a cognitive scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , has devoted years of research to figuring out just what attributes touch off these face - specific pings .
Security software that is being developed for identifying potential terrorists or detecting intruders must be able to reliably recognize faces .
In teaching the software to do this , Dr. Sinha and his colleagues have arrived at unexpected insights into the question of why we sometimes see a cinnamon bun as a cinnamon bun , and other times as the earthly incarnation of a sainted nun .

To develop detector software optimized to pick out any human face , even in less - than - ideal surroundings , Dr. Sinha began by putting into his computer hundreds of faces as varied as those in a Benetton advertisement famous for its diversity .
As the computer amassed the information , it was able to discover relationships that were of great significance to almost all faces , but very few nonfaces .
“ These turn out to be very simple relationships , things like the eyes are always darker than the forehead , and the mouth is darker than the cheeks , ” Dr. Sinha said .
“ If you put together about 12 of these relationships , you get a template that you can use to locate a face . ”
The 25 most difficult questions you 'll be asked on a job interview Being prepared is half the battle .
If you are one of those executive types unhappy at your present post and embarking on a New Year 's resolution to find a new one , here 's a helping hand .
The job interview is considered to be the most critical aspect of every expedition that brings you face - to- face with the future boss .
One must prepare for it with the same tenacity and quickness as one does for a fencing tournament or a chess match .

1 . Tell me about yourself .
Since this is often the opening question in an interview , be extracareful that you do n't run off at the mouth .
Keep your answer to a minute or two at most .
Cover four topics : early years , education , work history , and recent career experience .
Emphasize this last subject .
Remember that this is likely to be a warm - up question .
Do n't waste your best points on it .
2 . What do you know about our organization ?
You should be able to discuss products or services , revenues , reputation , image , goals , problems , management style , people , history and philosophy .
But do n't act as if you know everything about the place .
Let your answer show that you have taken the time to do some research , but do n't overwhelm the interviewer , and make it clear that you wish to learn more .
You might start your answer in this manner : " In my job search , I 've investigated a number of companies .
Yours is one of the few that interests me , for these reasons ... "
Give your answer a positive tone .
Do n't say , " Well , everyone tells me that you 're in all sorts of trouble , and that 's why I 'm here " , even if that is why you 're there .
3 . Why do you want to work for us ?
The deadliest answer you can give is " Because I like people . "
What else would you like - animals ?
Here , and throughout the interview , a good answer comes from having done your homework so that you can speak in terms of the company 's needs .
You might say that your research has shown that the company is doing things you would like to be involved with , and that it 's doing them in ways that greatly interest you .
For example , if the organization is known for strong management , your answer should mention that fact and show that you would like to be a part of that team .
If the company places a great deal of emphasis on research and development , emphasize the fact that you want to create new things and that you know this is a place in which such activity is encouraged .
If the organization stresses financial controls , your answer should mention a reverence for numbers .
If you feel that you have to concoct an answer to this question - if , for example , the company stresses research , and you feel that you should mention it even though it really does n't interest you - then you probably should not be taking that interview , because you probably should n't be considering a job with that organization .
Your homework should include learning enough about the company to avoid approaching places where you would n't be able - or would n't want - to function .
Since most of us are poor liars , it 's difficult to con anyone in an interview .
But even if you should succeed at it , your prize is a job you do n't really want .
4 . What can you do for us that someone else can't ?
Here you have every right , and perhaps an obligation , to toot your own horn and be a bit egotistical .
Talk about your record of getting things done , and mention specifics from your resume or list of career accomplishments .
Say that your skills and interests , combined with this history of getting results , make you valuable .
Mention your ability to set priorities , identify problems , and use your experience and energy to solve them .
5 . What do you find most attractive about this position ?
What seems least attractive about it ?
List three or four attractive factors of the job , and mention a single , minor , unattractive item .
6 . Why should we hire you ?
Create your answer by thinking in terms of your ability , your experience , and your energy .
( See question 4 . ) 7 .
What do you look for in a job ?
Keep your answer oriented to opportunities at this organization .
Talk about your desire to perform and be recognized for your contributions .
Make your answer oriented toward opportunity rather than personal security .
8 . Please give me your defintion of [ the position for which you are being interviewed ] .
Keep your answer brief and taskoriented .
Think in in terms of responsibilities and accountability .
Make sure that you really do understand what the position involves before you attempt an answer .
If you are not certain .
ask the interviewer ; he or she may answer the question for you .
9 . How long would it take you to make a meaningful contribution to our firm ?
Be realistic .
Say that , while you would expect to meet pressing demands and pull your own weight from the first day , it might take six months to a year before you could expect to know the organization and its needs well enough to make a major contribution .
10 .
How long would you stay with us ?
Say that you are interested in a career with the organization , but admit that you would have to continue to feel challenged to remain with any organization .
Think in terms of , " As long as we both feel achievement - oriented . "
11 .
Your resume suggests that you may be over - qualified or too experienced for this position .
What 's Your opinion ?
Emphasize your interest in establishing a long - term association with the organization , and say that you assume that if you perform well in his job , new opportunities will open up for you .
Mention that a strong company needs a strong staff .
Observe that experienced executives are always at a premium .
Suggest that since you are so wellqualified , the employer will get a fast return on his investment .
Say that a growing , energetic company can never have too much talent .
12 . What is your management style ?
You should know enough about the company 's style to know that your management style will complement it .
Possible styles include : task oriented ( I 'll enjoy problem - solving identifying what 's wrong , choosing a solution and implementing it " ) , results - oriented ( " Every management decision I make is determined by how it will affect the bottom line " ) , or even paternalistic ( " I 'm committed to taking care of my subordinates and pointing them in the right direction " ) .
A participative style is currently quite popular : an open - door method of managing in which you get things done by motivating people and delegating responsibility .
As you consider this question , think about whether your style will let you work hatppily and effectively within the organization .
13 .
Are you a good manager ?
Can you give me some examples ?
Do you feel that you have top managerial potential ?
Keep your answer achievementand ask - oriented .
Rely on examples from your career to buttress your argument .
Stress your experience and your energy .
14 . What do you look for when You hire people ?
Think in terms of skills .
initiative , and the adaptability to be able to work comfortably and effectively with others .
Mention that you like to hire people who appear capable of moving up in the organization .
15 .
Have you ever had to fire people ?
What were the reasons , and how did you handle the situation ?
Admit that the situation was not easy , but say that it worked out well , both for the company and , you think , for the individual .
Show that , like anyone else , you do n't enjoy unpleasant tasks but that you can resolve them efficiently and - in the case of firing someone - humanely .
16 .
What do you think is the most difficult thing about being a manager or executive ?
Mention planning , execution , and cost - control .
The most difficult task is to motivate and manage employess to get something planned and completed on time and within the budget .
17 .
What important trends do you see in our industry ?
Be prepared with two or three trends that illustrate how well you understand your industry .
You might consider technological challenges or opportunities , economic conditions , or even regulatory demands as you collect your thoughts about the direction in which your business is heading .
18 .
Why are you leaving ( did you leave ) your present ( last ) job ?
Be brief , to the point , and as honest as you can without hurting yourself .
Refer back to the planning phase of your job search .
where you considered this topic as you set your reference statements .
If you were laid off in an across - the - board cutback , say so ; otherwise , indicate that the move was your decision , the result of your action .
Do not mention personality conflicts .
The interviewer may spend some time probing you on this issue , particularly if it is clear that you were terminated .
The " We agreed to disagree " approach may be useful .
Remember hat your references are likely to be checked , so do n't concoct a story for an interview .
19 .
How do you feel about leaving all your benefits to find a new job ?
Mention that you are concerned , naturally , but not panicked .
You are willing to accept some risk to find the right job for yourself .
Do n't suggest that security might interest you more than getting the job done successfully .
20 .
In your current ( last ) position , what features do ( did ) you like the most ?
The least ?
Be careful and be positive .
Describe more features that you liked than disliked .
Do n't cite personality problems .
If you make your last job sound terrible , an interviewer may wonder why you remained there until now .
21 . What do you think of your boss ?
Be as positive as you can .
A potential boss is likely to wonder if you might talk about him in similar terms at some point in the future .
22 . Why are n't you earning more at your age ?
Say that this is one reason that you are conducting this job search .
Do n't be defensive .
23 .
What do you feel this position should pay ?
Salary is a delicate topic .
We suggest that you defer tying yourself to a precise figure for as long as you can do so politely .
You might say , " I understand that the range for this job is between $ ______ and $ ______ .
That seems appropriate for the job as I understand it . "
You might answer the question with a question : " Perhaps you can help me on this one .
Can you tell me if there is a range for similar jobs in the organization ? "
If you are asked the question during an initial screening interview , you might say that you feel you need to know more about the position 's responsibilities before you could give a meaningful answer to that question .
Here , too , either by asking the interviewer or search executive ( if one is involved ) , or in research done as part of your homework , you can try to find out whether there is a salary grade attached to the job .
If there is , and if you can live with it , say that the range seems right to you .
If the interviewer continues to probe , you might say , " You know that I 'm making $ ______ now .
Like everyone else , I 'd like to improve on that figure , but my major interest is with the job itself . "
Remember that the act of taking a new job does not , in and of itself , make you worth more money .
If a search firm is involved , your contact there may be able to help with the salary question .
He or she may even be able to run interference for you .
If , for instance , he tells you what the position pays , and you tell him that you are earning that amount now and would Like to do a bit better , he might go back to the employer and propose that you be offered an additional 10 % .
If no price range is attached to the job , and the interviewer continues to press the subject , then you will have to restpond with a number .
You cannot leave the impression that it does not really matter , that you 'll accept whatever is offered .
If you 've been making $ 80,000 a year , you can't say that a $ 35,000 figure would be fine without sounding as if you 've given up on yourself .
( If you are making a radical career change , however , this kind of disparity may be more reasonable and understandable . )
Do n't sell yourself short , but continue to stress the fact that the job itself is the most important thing in your mind .
The interviewer may be trying to determine just how much you want the job .
Do n't leave the impression that money is the only thing that is important to you .
Link questions of salary to the work itself .
But whenever possible , say as little as you can about salary until you reach the " final " stage of the interview process .
At that point , you know that the company is genuinely interested in you and that it is likely to be flexible in salary negotiations .
24 .
What are your long - range goals ?
Refer back to the planning phase of your job search .
Do n't answer , " I want the job you 've advertised . "
Relate your goals to the company you are interviewing : ' in a firm like yours , I would like to ... " 25 .
How successful do you you 've been so far ?
Say that , all - in - all , you 're happy with the way your career has progressed so far .
Given the normal ups and downs of life , you feel that you 've done quite well and have no complaints .
Present a positive and confident picture of yourself , but do n't overstate your case .
An answer like , " Everything 's wonderful !
I can't think of a time when things were going better !
I 'm overjoyed ! " is likely to make an interviewer wonder whether you 're trying to fool him . . . or yourself .
The most convincing confidence is usually quiet confidence .

Correction Appended
JERUSALEM , July 17 - Israel and the Palestinians faced the possibility of a major confrontation on Sunday as Israel massed tanks and other armored vehicles just outside the borders of the Gaza Strip .
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon told his cabinet ministers that after the recent violence , including a Palestinian bombing and several Israeli airstrikes , there would be " no restriction on our activities to halt the attacks at communities both inside and outside the Gaza Strip . "
In renewed fighting in Gaza on Sunday , Israeli forces fatally shot two Palestinian militants , and several more Palestinians were wounded in a series of incidents , the Israeli military said .
An Israeli soldier killed Said Sayem , 31 , a local Hamas leader in the southern town of Khan Yunis , with a single gunshot to the neck .
Mr. Sayem was just outside his house at the time , and Palestinians in the town and the Israeli news media described it as a sniper shooting carried out by a soldier posted in a nearby Jewish settlement .
Israel 's military said Mr. Sayem had been involved in numerous attacks .
Countries have different attitudes to surrogacy
It was the first time a woman has acted as a surrogate mother for her daughter in Japan , local media reported .
The case is set to stir debate in Japan where surrogate births are opposed by the government and a key medical group .
Japan 's justice ministry also views the woman who gives birth as a child 's mother - not the biological mother .
This legal position has led a Japanese celebrity couple to go to the courts to try to win the right to register twins born to a surrogate mother as their own children .
Their case is continuing .
Adopted
Yahiro Netsu , the head of the Suwa maternity clinic in Nagano , told a news conference that the woman gave birth last year , Reuters reported .
She had agreed to in vitro fertilisation and to act as a surrogate mother because her daughter had had her uterus removed due to cancer and was therefore unable to bear children .
Both the mother and child were reported to be in good health .
Dr Netsu said the woman had first registered the baby as her own and then the child was adopted by her daughter and son - in - law .
The doctor , who has helped other couples to have children through surrogate mothers , called on the government and the medical authorities to review their stance against surrogacy .
Surrogate births involve removing an egg to be fertilised and then implanting it in another woman who carries the baby to birth .
SEPTEMBER 14--Meet Heather Kane .
The Arizona woman , 22 , is facing a murder conspiracy rap for allegedly soliciting a hit man to bump off a woman whose picture appeared on her boyfriend 's MySpace page .
Kane was arrested Tuesday , shortly after Mesa police learned that she was seeking someone to kill her squeeze 's ' female friend , ' according to a probable cause statement filed in Justice Court .
According to investigators , Kane was willing to pay $ 1000 for the murder , and gave an undercover officer a $ 400 down payment during a meeting in a grocery store parking lot .
During that parley , Kane gave the cop photos of the female target , noting that she ' pulled them off a MySpace web site from her boyfriend . '
Kane allegedly asked that the target be shot in the head and that the hit man provide her with a post - murder photo of the victim .
It is unclear what drove Kane to allegedly plot the other woman 's murder .

[ the following letter was mailed in September 2002 ; I 've had no response ]
Dear Condi ,
I 'm 99.99 % sure that my writing this letter will have no effect , but my conscience tells me to write it anyway .
Danziger 's cartoon has pushed me out of my lethargy .
[ His cartoon shows her banging on a grand piano , saying " War! War! War ! " ]
When I knew you at Stanford I had the greatest admiration for your abilities and good sense .
( And I was disappointed that we never were able to get together to play four - hands music . )
But now I cannot help but express to you my chagrin that the warm feelings I once had have basically evaporated .
I hope you can pause to try to understand why this might be the case .
Fundamentally I do n't see how the government of my country has done anything whatsoever to address and correct the root causes of international terrorism .
Quite the contrary ; every action I can see seems almost designed to have the opposite effect --- as if orchestrated to maximize the finances of those who make armaments , by maximizing the number of people who now hate me personally for actions that I do not personally condone .
How can I be a proud citizen of a country that unilaterally pulls out of widely accepted treaties , that refuses to accept a world court , that flouts fair trade with shameful policies regarding steel and agriculture , and that almost blindly supports Israel 's increasingly unjustifiable occupation ?
And worst of all , I find that my leaders , including you , are calling for war against a sovereign nation that we suspect to be corrupt , thereby ( even if our suspicions are correct ) undermining all precedents against unilateral action by other countries who might in future decide that our own policies are wrong .
If we peremptorily strike country X , why should n't country X have a right to do the same to us , and to our children and grandchildren in future years ?
On my trips to Europe all I can do is hope that my friends there can help their governments try to make somebody in my own government act responsibly .
Sincerely , Don Knuth
P.S. This is the second time in my life that I have written a letter to a U.S. government official .
The first time was during the Vietnam war .
The blogs are buzzing today about a major revelation from the LA Times .
Karl Rove 's political operation is facing what appears to be a serious internal investigation :
Most of the time , an obscure federal investigative unit known as the Office of Special Counsel confines itself to monitoring the activities of relatively low - level government employees , stepping in with reprimands and other routine administrative actions for such offenses as discriminating against military personnel or engaging in prohibited political activities .
But the Office of Special Counsel is preparing to jump into one of the most sensitive and potentially explosive issues in Washington , launching a broad investigation into key elements of the White House political operations that for more than six years have been headed by chief strategist Karl Rove .
The new investigation , which will examine the firing of at least one U.S. attorney , missing White House e-mails , and White House efforts to keep presidential appointees attuned to Republican political priorities , could create a substantial new problem for the Bush White House .
First , the inquiry comes from inside the administration , not from Democrats in Congress .
Second , unlike the splintered inquiries being pressed on Capitol Hill , it is expected to be a unified investigation covering many facets of the political operation in which Rove played a leading part .
" We will take the evidence where it leads us , " Scott J. Bloch , head of the Office of Special Counsel and a presidential appointee , said in an interview Monday .
" We will not leave any stone unturned . "
The Washington DC - based media pays enormous deference to Karl Rove .
Still .
Despite all the lies .
Last night on the Daily Show , Jon Stewart interviewed Matt Cooper on this very subject .
The video is on the Daily Show 's website .
Fascinating what the press has let Rove get away with .
Karl plays the media for patsies -- and they are .
It 'll be interesting to see if this latest investigation gets any traction beyond the LA Times and the blogosphere .

The Most Important Design Guideline ?
by Scott Meyers
The activity of " design " includes many things , but certainly one of the most important aspects is interface specification .
Interfaces determine which aspects of a component are accessible and to whom ; they thus determine encapsulation .
Interfaces specify what functionality ( data , properties , methods , and so forth ) is available to clients .
Interfaces reflect how a system is broken down into its constituent components .
Interfaces are everywhere .
They 're the " I " in GUI and API , but they 're much more pervasive than that .
Classes and structs have interfaces ; functions and methods have interfaces ; templates and namespaces have interfaces ; subsystems and modules have interfaces ; libraries and applications have interfaces .
Regardless of your role in the development of a software system , it almost certainly involves some interface design , so it 's helpful to have some heuristics that indicate when you 're doing it well or poorly .
Over time , I 've come to the conclusion that the most important general interface design guideline is this :
Make interfaces easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly .
This guideline leads to a conclusion that some developers find unsettling .
Interface designers must take responsibility
Let 's make the reasonable assumption that your clients the people using your interfaces  are trying to do a good job .
They 're smart , they 're motivated , they 're conscientious .
They 're willing to read some documentation to help them understand the system they 're using .
They want things to behave correctly .
That being the case , if they make a mistake when using your interface , it 's your fault .
We 're assuming they 're doing their best they want to succeed .
If they fail , it 's because you let them .
So , if somebody uses your interface incorrectly , either they 're working hard at it ( less likely ) or your interface allowed them to do something easy that was not correct ( more likely ) .
This puts the shoe on the foot not used to wearing it : it means that responsibility for interface usage errors belongs to the interface designer , not the interface user .
In a perfect world , adherence to this guideline would all but guarantee correct program behavior .
In such a world , programs that would n't do the right thing would n't compile , and programs that compiled would almost certainly do the right thing .
At the human - computer interface level , commands that would n't do the right thing would be rejected , and commands that were accepted would almost certainly do the right thing .
Alas , our world is n't perfect , but the interfaces used in most software systems can be significantly improved with relatively little effort .
Improving your interfaces
Consider a ( C++ ) class for representing dates in time and how its constructor might be declared :
class Date { public : explicit Date ( int month , int day , int year ) ; } ;
This is a classic example of an interface that 's easy to use incorrectly .
Because all three parameters are the same type , callers can easily mix up the order , an error that 's especially likely given that different cultures have different ordering conventions for a date 's month , day , and year .
Furthermore , the interface allows for nonsense data to be passed in , for example , a value of - 29 for a month .
Creating separate types for days , months , and years can eliminate the ordering errors , and creating a fixed set of immutable Month objects can essentially eliminate the possibility of specifying invalid months .
Here 's an example in the form of a simple program :
# include < iostream > struct Day { // thin wrapper for Day explicit Day ( int day ) : d( day ) {} int d ; } ; struct Year { // thin wrapper for Year explicit Year ( int year ) : y( year ) {} int y ; } ; class Month { public : static const Month Jan ; // a fixed set of immutable static const Month Feb ; // Month objects //... static const Month Dec ; int number ( ) const { return m ; } private : explicit Month ( int month ) : m( month ) {} int m ; } ; const Month Month : : Jan ( 1 ) ; const Month Month :: Feb ( 2 ) ; //... const Month Month : : Dec ( 12 ) ; class Date { public : explicit Date ( Month m , Day d , Year y ) ; // revised ( safer , explicit Date ( Year y , Month m , Day d ) ; // more flexible ) explicit Date ( Day d , Month m , Year y ) // interface : d Num ( d.d ) , m Num ( m.number ( ) ) , yNum (y.y ) { std::cout << " D.M.Y = " << dNum << '.' << mNum << '.' << yNum << '
' ; } private : int dNum , mNum , yNum ; } ; int main ( ) { Date today ( Day ( 10 ) , Month : : Jan , Year ( 2005 ) ) ; }
This example points out two important aspects to designing interfaces that obey the guideline .
First , interface designers must train themselves to try to imagine all ( reasonable ) ways in which their interfaces could be used incorrectly .
Second , they must find ways to prevent such errors from occurring .
Perhaps the most widely applicable approach to preventing errors is to define new types for use in the interface , in this case , Day , Month , and Year .
It 's best if such types exhibit the usual characteristics of good type design , including proper encapsulation and well - designed interfaces , but this example demonstrates that even introducing thin wrappers such as Day and Year can prevent some kinds of errors in date specification .
A second commonly useful approach to preventing errors is to eliminate the possibility of clients creating invalid values .
This approach applies when we know the universe of possible values in advance .
In the date - specification example we just saw , I know that there are only 12 valid months , so I created a Month class with a private constructor , thus preventing the creation of Month values other than the 12 specific constant objects offered by the class .
An alternative means to a similar end would be to use an enum , but , at least in C++ , enum s are less type - safe than classes , because the line between enums and ints is n't as distinct as we might wish .
In addition to introducing new types to the revised Date interface , I also added new constructors to the design .
The Day , Month , and Year types make the interface harder to use incorrectly , but without the Date constructor overloads , the result is also harder to use correctly .
Good interfaces support as many forms of correct use as possible while simultaneously thwarting as many incorrect forms as possible .
Both efforts are necessary .
One without the other wo n't suffice .
Forcing users of an interface to choose from a set of guaranteed - valid choices is often good design , but it 's not a panacea .
Consider the following figure , which shows how drop - down boxes for day , month , and year at the United Airlines '
Web site still allow users to specify an invalid date ( such as June 31 ) .
This is an example of an interface that appears to conform to the guideline , but does n't , because it lulls the user into a feeling that mistakes are impossible .
That is , it 's easy to use incorrectly .
Drop - down box allowing specification of an invalid date .
Note also that restricting users to choosing from a set of guaranteed - valid choices does n't necessarily guarantee that the resulting data will be correct .
The most constrained GUI drop - down boxes ( or class constructors ) in the world can't keep me from specifying August 27 when what I really meant was July 27 .
In fact , forcing users to specify information via this kind of interface might actually increase the chances of specifying invalid data .
Many GUI forms ( in both applications and at Web sites ) use drop - down boxes for specifying a state , for example , and my experience has been that I inadvertently specify the wrong state much more frequently than I mistype my state 's two - letter abbreviation .
If my experience is at all typical ( and anecdotal evidence suggests that it is ) , that indicates that a drop - down box for this information is inferior to a simple text input box when considering which interface is easier to use correctly and harder to use incorrectly .
It 's important not to lose sight of this goal lest we confuse means and ends .
The goal is an interface that 's easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly .
An approach that 's often helpful in achieving this is to restrict the available input values , but sometimes that approach can be counterproductive .
Another example of an easy - to - misuse interface is one where a function returns a resource that the caller is responsible for releasing .
Even languages with garbage collection exhibit this problem , because memory is n't the only resource .
Consider this example :
class Resource { public : Resource ( ) ; void release ( ) ; static Resource getResource ( ) ; // caller must call release // on the returned object } ;
Here , the interface presented by the getResource method is a resource leak waiting to happen .
All it takes is a client who forgets to call release when they are supposed to .
The C++ approach to this problem would be to put the resource - releasing code ( possibly as part of a reference - counting scheme ) in Resource 's destructor .
Callers of getResource could then forget about resource management , because it would be automatic .
Unfortunately , languages such as Java and the .NET languages do n't offer destructors or their equivalent , and the idioms that address resource issues such as this ( finally or using blocks , for example ) put the onus on clients to remember to use the idioms .
But interfaces that rely on clients remembering to do something are easy to use incorrectly .
In situations like this , good interface designers fall back on simple encapsulation : if something is tricky or error - prone and there 's no way to get around it , they hide the tricky or error - prone code as much as possible , so as few people as possible have to deal with it .
For example , getResource might be declared private or protected so that the easy - to - use - incorrectly interface is accessible to relatively few clients .
In addition , Resource might be outfitted with debugging capabilities so that situations in which objects that are leaked or that have unusually long lifetimes ( suggesting an overly late call to release ) are easy to identify .
Adhering to the guideline that interfaces should be easy to use correctly and hard to use incorrectly leads to systems that are both more usable and more likely to be used correctly .
That 's why it 's the most important general design guideline in my arsenal .
To employ it , designers need to train themselves to anticipate what clients might reasonably like to do , and then facilitate that activity .
They also must anticipate what clients might incorrectly do , and prevent that activity .
Above all , it requires remembering that when an interface is used incorrectly , the fault is that of the interface designer , not the interface user .

Käpt ’n Iglus dunkle Seite : Fischpiraten vagabundieren über die Weltmeere und fischen alles leer
Überfischung ist ein seit langem bekanntes Problem .
Längst gibt es Schutzzonen und Fischerei - Quoten , um den Fischbestand der Weltmeere zu bewahren .
Schwindet der Fischbestand , sind einzelne Arten gefährdet und das ökologische Gleichgewicht gerät durcheinander .
Umweltverbände protestieren seit Jahren gegen Fischpiraten , die trotzdem illegal vor allem in schlecht bewachten Gewässern auf die Jagd gehen oder unkontrolliert unter Billigflaggen segeln .
Wissenschaftler geben den Öko - Aktivisten Recht , es bedarf einer wirkungsvollen und flexiblen internationalen Kontrolle , um die Ozeane vor den Banditen mit Schleppnetzen zu schützen .
Früher fuhren kleine Boote küstennah aus , und die Besatzung fischten moderate Mengen , um sie auf lokalen Märkten zu verkaufen .
Fisch ist eine leicht verderbliche Ware , nur gesalzen , geräuchert oder getrocknet war er über weite Strecken zu transportieren .
Heute fahren Fangflotten aus , die als riesige Fabrikanlagen auf See den Fang direkt tieffrieren oder zu Fischstäbchen verarbeiten .
Durch Luftfracht und globalisierte Handelswege erreicht ganz frischer Fisch unverzüglich alle Metropolen , um überall auf der Welt auf den Tellern von Feinschmeckern zu landen .
Dazu kommt , dass durch die neuen Fangmethoden jede Menge kleiner , junger oder in anderer Art zum Verzehr nicht geeigneter Fische ( und andere Tiere ) in den riesigen Netzen landen .
Sie werden als unerwünschter Beifang einfach entsorgt .
Die gnadenlose wirtschaftliche Ausbeutung der Meere ist grenzenlos geworden .
Bild : Greenpeace
Der Fischbestand schrumpft in den Weltmeeren ; viele Arten sind gefährdet oder bereits ausgerottet .
Innerhalb der letzten 50 Jahre ist die Artenvielfalt überall in den Ozeanen zwischen 10 und 50 Prozent zurückgegangen .
Gleichzeitig verzehnfachte sich der Fischfang .
Im Atlantik und im Indischen Ozean gab es einen Schwund der Arten um 50 Prozent , im Pazifik um 25 Prozent .
Dabei spielen sowohl die Verschmutzung der Meere als auch die globale Klimaerwärmung eine Rolle , Hauptgrund für die dramatische Verminderung der Fischarten ist aber nachweislich die Überfischung ( Dramatischer Rückgang der Artenvielfalt in den Meeren ) .
Die Umweltschutzorganisation Greenpeace kämpft seit Jahren gegen die Fischpiraten oder Piratenfischer ( SOS Weltmeere ) .
Gerade erst hatten Aktivisten der Organisation mit einer Kette im Rostocker Hafen mehrere Fischtrawler am Auslaufen gehindert , die sie der Fischpiraterie bezichtigen .
Im vergangen Dezember protestierte Greenpeace bereits gegen die Schiffe und forderte die Bundesregierung auf , in dieser Angelegenheit aktiv zu werden .
Damals hießen die etwa sechzig Meter langen Schiffe , denen bereits in der Vergangenheit illegale Fischzüge nachgewiesen wurden , " Oyra " , " Ostroe " , " Okhotino " , " Olchan " und " Ostrovets " .
Mittlerweile wurden sie in " Eva " , " Junita " , " Rosita " , " Isabella " sowie " Carmen " umgetauft und sind in Georgien ( ein Staat , der die Schiffe nicht weiter kontrolliert ) registriert .
Aktion von Greenpeace - Aktivisten in Schlauchbooten mit einer Tonnenkette gegen illegale Fischtrawler im Rostocker Hafen ( Bild : Thomas Haentzschel , Nordlicht / Greenpeace )
Der Umweltschutzorganisation liegen Informationen vor , wonach die Trawler vor Mauretanien / Westafrika oder im Pazifik fischen wollen ( Piratenfischer im Rostocker Hafen festgesetzt ) .
Andrea Cederquist , Meeresbiologin von Greenpeace , prangert die Untätigkeit der Bundesregierung an :
Die Politik muss endlich handeln , die Piratenfischer gehören an die Kette .
Sie dürfen erst auslaufen , wenn sie nachweisen können , dass ihr nächster Fischzug nicht illegal ist .
Die Politiker können nicht behaupten , die illegale Fischerei zu bekämpfen und dann zusehen , wie sich Piratenfischer in einem deutschen Hafen für ihren nächsten Fang rüsten .
Auf hoher
See oder vor den Küsten der armen Länder , z.B. vor Westafrika , fischen die modernen Piraten alles leer .
Die Fischtrawler gehen dabei völlig rücksichtslos vor , sie holen so schnell wie möglich alles an Bord , was sich in Netzen und Leinen verfängt .
Nutzlose Beutetiere wie Wale , Delfine , Seeschildkröten oder auch Vögel werden einfach tot über Bord geworfen .
Besonders problematisch ist zudem die Grundschleppnetzfischerei , die den empfindlichen Tiefseelebensraum schädigt ( Das UN - Moratorium der Grundschleppnetzfischerei auf der Hohen See ) .
Und das obwohl die Tiefsee noch weitgehend unbekanntes Terrain ist und dort ständig neue Arten entdeckt werden ( Rotlichtbezirk unter Wasser ) .
Nach Angaben von Greenpeace lohnt sich das illegale Geschäft enorm , jährlich werden durch die Fischpiraten zwischen 3,4 und 7,6 Milliarden Euro erbeutet .
Gesundes Riff mit intakter Fisch - Fauna ( Bild : Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies , weitere Fotos
Argumentative Unterstützung bekommen die Umweltaktivisten jetzt durch eine Gruppe internationaler Wissenschaftler um Fikret Berkes von der University of Manitoba im kanadischen Winnipeg .
Im Wissenschaftsmagazin Science veröffentlichen sie einen Überblick über die gravierenden Schäden , die Fischpiraten dem marinen Ökosystem zufügen ( Globalization , Roving Bandits and Marine Resources ) .
Die Forscher zeigen auf , dass in der globalisierten
Welt die bisherigen Schutzmechanismen nicht mehr ausreichen .
Wenn es für eine Meereslebensform irgendwo auf der Welt einen interessanten Markt gibt , dann tauchen sofort Trawler auf und fischen ab , so viel sie erwischen .
Und das im Zweifelsfall so schnell , dass nationale Behörden erst reagieren können , wenn es zu spät ist .
Ein Beispiel dafür ist der Seeigel ( Strongylocentrotus droebachiensis ) , der sich nach der radikalen Dezimierung seiner natürlichen Feinde im Golf von Maine in den 80er Jahren erstmal kräftig vermehrte .
Dann entstand eine große Nachfrage nach diesem Meerestier für den rasch wachsenden Sushi - Markt und ab 1987 wurde der Seeigel sehr schnell und intensiv abgefischt .
Bis der Staat reagierte , war der Bestand innerhalb von sechs Jahren schon weitgehend geplündert .
Die Wissenschaftler schreiben :
Was das vagabundierende Banditentum [ Fischpiraterie ] auszeichnet , ist die neue Dynamik der globalisierten Welt : Neue Märkte können so rasch entstehen , dass die Geschwindigkeit der Ausbeutung der Ressourcen oft die Reaktionsfähigkeit lokaler Institutionen überfordert .
Als Folge der unkontrollierten Überfischung gerät das ökologische Gleichgewicht im Meer in Turbulenzen , Nahrungsketten werden geschädigt , die Biodiversität leidet nachhaltig , im Zweifelsfall sterben bestimmte Arten aus .
Co-Autor Terry Hughes , Leiter des Australian Research Council ’s Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies warnt :
Heute kann das intensive Abfischen bestimmter Spezies durch diese mobilen , vagabundierenden Banditen marine Systeme destabilisieren und unberechenbare Kollapse verursachen .
Teile der Fischerei sind zu Industrien mit Fahrerfluchttaktik geworden , sie schlagen unkontrolliert und grenzenlos zu .
Die globale Nachfrage kann eine Ressource zerstören – ohne Rücksicht auf die Leute vor Ort , die darauf für ihr Auskommen angewiesen sind oder auf die Zukunft des Lebensraums Meer .
Die bisher ausgewiesenen Schutzgebiete , wo die Fischerei stark eingeschränkt oder sogar völlig untersagt ist , reichen nicht aus .
Sie müssten stark erweitert werden .
Neue Untersuchungen bestätigen , dass ein komplettes Verbot des Fischens durchaus wirkungsvoll ist und sogar Korallenriffe sich unter diesem Schutz regenerieren ( Raubfische als Korallenschützer ) .
Fikret Berkes und seine Kollegen schlagen vor , sofort und dringlich die Überfischung unter Kontrolle zu bringen .
Dazu gehört ihrer Meinung nach , dass lokale Behörden ihre Möglichkeiten schon existierender Vorschriften voll ausschöpfen , dass weitere Gebiete als Fangverbots - Zonen ausgewiesen , dass Märkte kontrolliert und flexible Management - Ansätze genutzt werden .
Auf allen Ebenen müssten Instrumente entstehen , damit verantwortlich auf die sich ständig verändernden Anforderungen reagiert werden kann .
Der Verbraucher hat es aber auch selbst in der Hand , beim Einkauf etwas gegen Fischpiraterie und die verantwortungslose Ausbeutung der Meere zu unternehmen .
Zum Beispiel sollten Tiefseetische auf dem Speiseplan ebenso ein Tabu sein wie Shrimps oder Seezunge ( Welcher Fisch darf auf den Tisch ? ) .

I happened across this rather nice spring physics library for Processing , so I thought I 'd try making a simple cloth simulation to see what it was capable of .
Turns out it 's really easy to use and works exactly as advertised .
I think it 's time for a little more experimentation .
Instructions
Drag any of the vertices around to control the " cloth " .
Hold down the space bar while releasing the mouse button to " pin " the vertex .

Note : Mercurial 's library .zip contains pyd-files , which normal Python import can't use ( py2exe uses a special importer that allows that ) , but if you unzip library .
zip somewhere and add that directory , it will work on Windows ( tested with tracd ) .
Alternatively , you can install the pre-built Mercurial Python modules from ​https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/files/downloads/ or ​https://www.mercurial-scm.org/release/windows/
You may also want to experiment with ​ Mercurial : Hackable Mercurial distribution .
Configuration
The configuration has to be done on the Trac side , there 's nothing to do on the Mercurial repository side , except for the fact that the repository should be made accessible as a local repository .
Thanks to the distributed nature of Mercurial , that 's always possible .
If the repository is not already local , simply hg clone it .
Setting up the Mercurial plugin
The TracMercurial plugin egg should be added to the plugins folder of the environment , or it can be globally installed : python setup.py install or a python setup.py develop .
For general instructions about plugins , see also TracPlugins .
If you installed the egg globally and you are modifying an existing Trac environment to use the Mercurial backend , then you have to explicitly enable the plugin in TracIni .
[ components ] tracext.hg .* = enabled
Setting up a Trac environment
You can either reuse an existing Trac environment or create a new one .
For general instructions , see TracInstall .
When creating a new environment with TracAdmin initenv command :
for the repository type , specify hg instead of the default svn .
instead of the default .
for the repository directory , specify the location of the Mercurial repository , without the ending .hg .
Your < trac_environment >/conf/trac.ini configuration file should have a [ trac ] section similar to the following :
[ repositories ] repository .
type = hg repository .
dir = / path/to/my/hg/repository
There are also a few Mercurial specific settings in TracIni :
[ hg ] # --
Show revision number in addition to the changeset hash ( defaults to yes ) show_rev = yes # --
Changeset hash format node_format = short # hex :
Show the full SHA1 hash # short :
Show a shortened hash for the changesets ( default )
Setting up post - commit hooks
For 0.12 and later :
If you want to enable post - commit hook functionality on your repository , add the following to your repository 's .hg / hgrc file ( since [ 10728 ] ) :
[ hooks ] #
If mercurial - plugin is installed globally commit = python: tracext.hg.hooks.add_changesets changegroup = python:tracext.hg.hooks.add_changesets #
If mercurial - plugin is installed in a Trac plugins directory commit = python:/ path/to/hooks.py:add_changesets changegroup = python:/ path/to/hooks.py:add_changesets [ trac ] env = / path / to/env trac-admin = / path/to/trac-admin
Remember to change / path / to /env and / path / to / trac - admin to reflect your environment .
If TracMercurial is installed in a Trac plugins directory , you will also have to download hooks .
py​ and place it somewhere accessible .
You must also enable the CommitTicketUpdater functionality in your trac.ini :
[ components ] tracopt.ticket.commit_updater .* = enabled
Features
Mercurial support is basic , but works well and has been tested on the Mercurial repository itself .
The performance is acceptable , even if there is currently no caching in the database , see # 8417 .
For those used to Subversion in general and Subversion repository browsing in Trac in particular , there are a few differences worth noting .
Mercurial Changesets
Changeset Navigation
In Mercurial , the Previous Changeset / Next Changeset navigation is not purely sequential , as it is in Subversion .
Instead of a flat history of successive changesets , we actually navigate a ​DAG of changesets .
This means a changeset can have multiple parents ( 0 , 1 or 2 ) and multiple children as well ( 0 to n ) .
Therefore , Previous Changeset is a link to the first parent , and Next Changeset is a link to the first child .
In case there are additional parents or children , these are shown as additional changeset properties ( Parents or Children ) , placed below the Author property and above the Message property .
Another additional changeset property is the list of Tags that might be associated with a changeset .
Wiki syntax
The Wiki syntax has been extended a bit , to cope with the hexadecimal notation of hg changesets .
For example , [ 8ef2 ] would link to the changeset 8ef2ba892518c115170398ec754bd1c27cab271f .
Plain changeset numbers are also recognized , provided they are long enough ( 12 to 40 ) .
Also , it is possible to refer to changesets using the changeset : prefix , or cset : or chgset : , for hgweb compatibility .
The tag : prefix can be used to refer to symbolic tags , although this is not a requirement , because using cset: tip would work too .
Finally , the branch : prefix has a special meaning , as this will not select the specified revision , but the head which is reachable from that revision .
TracBrowser changes in 0.11
The TracBrowser View revision form has been extended with pulldown menus for jumping to a given tag or branch .
In Mercurial , a branch within a repository corresponds to a head , ie a changeset without children :
There is also support for visual blame annotations :
Mercurial Queue
Since r6443 , the MQ extension is supported .
If you have applied mq patches in your repository , Trac will show the corresponding patch names as Tags : in the changeset view .
Also , with the 0.12 branch of the plugin ( and the MultipleRepository Support branch of Trac ) , you can browse jointly the main repository and the repository for the associated Mercurial queue , if any , ie if you versioned your patch queue using hg qinit -c and hg qcommit .
Furthermore , if you declare such a Mercurial repository to be a MQ repository , then all the patches will be correctly rendered as patches , regardless of the patch name ( see r6462 for details ) .
Visualize branches and merges
There should be a way to show graphically the branch and merge points within the revision log view .
Not something as fancy as hgk , but nonetheless something that will make the changeset relationships immediately obvious .
Starting with Trac 1.0 , we show a graphical overview of the branch graph when viewing the log of the repository root ( # 1492 ) .
Also , there is the ​ RevtreePlugin .
Search over the source
A search provider could do the equivalent of an hg grep .
Highlight Conflict Resolution
While visualizing changeset diffs for merge changesets , we already show the changes relative to both parents , which helps to understand how conflicts ( if any ) were solved .
But this can be improved by specifically highlighting lines that differ from both parents .
Repository Management
Trac should allow for creating new repositories or clones of existing repositories .
Maybe repository deletion and renaming should be supported , too .
Subrepositories support
The forest extension has been superseded by support for ​nested repositories .
Replace forest below by subrepository .
( #9704 )
Support for the Forest extension for Mercurial .
Forest extension allows operations on trees with nested Mercurial repositories , called forests .
Those to some degree correspond to multi-project CVS / Svn /… repositories .
Already most of it is working , expect that it 's hackish in the Trac 0.10.3 version of the plugin .
Since it needs a bit more flexibile templating ( in regards with the lookup / url 's ) this is hacked around node .
path at the moment .
Some ( small / large ? ) issues remain but most of it is working .
Note that with the MultipleRepositorySupport branch of Trac , it should be possible to implement an IRepository Provider component knowing about the forest extension and adding besides the repository for the forest itself , the managed repositories as well .

Bugs and Limitations
Features in Trac+svn but not in Trac+hg
No path history mode , ie show all create / delete operations that affected a given path .
To cache or not to cache ?
Recent versions of the plugin ( r7744 for 0.11 or r7757 for 0.12 ) have a greatly improved browsing speed .
It 's now possible to navigate on repositories of the size of the Linux kernel repo .
However , producing diffs or even gathering the timeline events for repositories of such size is still too slow .
For the diffs , we could reduce the amount diffs generated ( see # 2591 , # 7975 ) .
For the timeline , we should really have a cache , not only for the performance issue but also because the current heuristic for retrieving the changesets in a given period of time does n't always work ( see r5365 ) .
Troubleshooting
" Unsupported version control system hg "
If you get this message try the following two basic checks first :
From a Python console session try to import the Mercurial module , if all goes well it should not complain : >>> from mercurial import ui , hg >>> repo = hg .
repository ( ui . ui ( ) , '/ path/to/mercurial/repo ' ) >>> len ( repo ) 234 hg.__file__ attribute to verify you are loading the expected Mercurial library .
Log in as an user with TRAC_ADMIN permission , and look in the Admin pages , General / Plugins .
Do you see the entry for the TracMercurial plugin there ?
If yes , is the MercurialConnector component enabled ?
" Fatal Python error : PyImport_GetModuleDict : no module dictionary ! "
You might get hard crashes on Windows showing up such messages on the console , when running TracStandalone with the autoreload feature ( -r / -- auto - reload ) , in combination with recent Mercurial versions (> 3.7-rc ) .
This is already fixed in the code , so either upgrade the plugin or apply the corresponding fix .
Known Issues

Implementation Notes
Hacking on Mercurial :
I 'm interested in feedback concerning the code , in particular concerning Mercurial .
I 'm pretty sure I did things in a sub-optimal way , as I was discovering the guts of hg while writing the plugin .
Therefore , I 'll be pleased to get tips for improvements .
These days , Google ’s social networking site , Orkut , has been in the news for a number of reasons , that too for all bad reasons .
First it was the Anti-Shivaji and Anti-Ambedkar communities on Orkut that angered many Indians .
Then it was the Bombay Scottish school kids who shot to fame with their infamous community on their principal .
These issues have been confounding the Indian authorities for a while now , and besides blocking the objectionable forums , the Mumbai Police could do little .
But , now the Mumbai Police are finally equipped to track down such offenders and are able to bring them to book .
With just a single email containing the IP addresses of the Orkut offenders , between the DCP in charge of the Enforcement Branch and Orkut , a number of Orkut offenders will soon be nabbed .
A meeting was held between representatives of Orkut and the Enforcment Directorate , after which the Mumbai Police and Orkut entered into an agreement to seal such cooperation in matters of objectionable material on the Internet .
According to DCP Enforement , Sanjay Mohite , “ Early February , I met three representatives from Orkut.com , including a top official from the US .
The other two were from Bangalore .
We reached a working agreement whereby Orkut has agreed to provide us details of the IP address from which an objectionable message or blog has been posted on the site and the Internet service provider involved . ”
Besides , an encrypted code has also been agreed upon for such communication to prevent people from posing as the Mumbai Police .
“ I am also going to hold a meeting with all Internet service providers to stress the need to share information .
We are also hoping to rope in YouTube in the future , ” said Mohite .
Earlier , if a complaint regarding objectionable content was received , the police would contact the computer emergency response team , a government body based in New Delhi , and ask it to block the concerned web page .
They did not have any way to track down the culprits .
“ It was almost out of the question to track down the person who posted the material as we would have to go through the CBI to get basic information from Orkut as they are based in the US .
The entire process of letter rogatory would come into play .
But now we can take action on any content posted on the site from India , ” he explained .
Canadian MP
Joy Smith introduced a new bill this week designed to cleanse the Internet of child pornography , racial hatred , and material that promotes violence against women .
All noble goals , to be sure , but the cure might be almost as bad as the disease : Smith 's plan calls for government censorship and the licensing of all ISPs in the country .
Bill C - 427 , also known as the " Clean Internet Act , " sets up a Canadian licensing regime that every ISP in the country must be a part of .
The license is required in order to offer Internet services , and it can be revoked under a bizarre set of conditions .
For instance , the government may cancel a license if any director or officer of the ISP in question is found guilty of " an offense under the Criminal Code in the commission of which a woman is the victim of physical violence . "
Consider this for a moment .
Imagine that you get your Internet connection through Rogers .
If any director or officer of Rogers punches his wife in a domestic dispute , the company loses its license to offer Internet service to all Canadians .
While punching one 's wife is certainly a terrible thing , it 's an offense that the law already penalizes , and cutting off Internet access to thousands of people uninvolved in the incident seems an odd way to go about controlling violence against women .
The bill also requires ISPs to deny service to anyone who has committed one of the offenses ( child pornography , racial hatred , violence against women ) within the last seven years .
Expose yourself in a public park ?
You ca n't get Internet access for seven years .
ISPs must also respond to any request from the Minister of Industry , who can designate " any material on the Internet " off - limits after a " reasonable inquiry " if it falls into one of the proscribed categories .
In a statement issued when she introduced the bill on Wednesday , Smith said , " In an age when the Internet is increasingly being used for criminal and exploitive purposes , it is the responsibility of parents and all Canadians to protect our vulnerable citizens .
This Clean Internet
Act is one more step towards ending violence and exploitation of women and children in Canada and abroad . "
Canadian law professor Michael Geist notes that the bill has little chance of passing , though Smith is unlikely to give up on the measure .
The Conservative MP sits on the " Status of Women " committee and has " worked tirelessly in Canada , Israel , Ukraine , the U.S.A. and elsewhere to combat the exploitation of women and children , " according to her official biography .
She considers the Internet one of the " primary tools " used to foster race hatred and violence .
I swear , this guy just oozes slime .
Please contact your Senators and urge them to support Sen.
Schumer 's call for Gonzales 's resignation .
Discourse.net :
As Senators start to pile on our lamentable Attorney General for presiding over Karl Rove 's politicization of the US Attorneys Office -- an offense known as ' obstruction of justice ' --
I would like to direct your attention to a similar but somehow forgotten scandal .
Everyone seems to have forgotten that then - White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales also presided over one of the more sordid aspects of the Plame scandal .
When Gonzales first learned that the Justice Department had started an official investigation into the Plame leak , Gonzales waited twelve hours before putting the White House staff on notice that they had to preserve documents and electronic files .
Which seemed than -- and seems now -- like an open invitation to " shredding and deleting , " not to mention getting your story straight .
In short , obstruction of justice .
And it 's not as if Gonzales dithered trying to make up his mind what to do .
He told White House Chief of Staff Andy Card about the investigation right away -- many hours before sending the official notification to preserve all evidence .
[..]
Lest you think this is much ado about nothing , consider that when Patrick Fitzgerald came looking , key emails to or from the Vice President 's office mysteriously could not be found in the White House computer system 's archives .

1> catch sample : head ( [ 1,2,3 ] ) . 1 2 > catch sample : head ( [ ] ) . {' EXIT ' , " head : empty_list " }
０除算やマッチ失敗などは言語処理系がEXITを発行しますが、 exit 関数を呼ぶと自分でエラー処理もできます。 いわゆる例外処理として使うことができますね。
head ( [ H|_ ] ) -> H ; head ( [ ] ) -> throw ( " head : empty_list " ) .
1> catch sample : head ( [ 1,2,3 ] ) . 1 2 > catch sample : head ( [ ] ) . " head : empty_list "
exitの代わり にthrowを使うと、catchしたときに throwされたものが直接帰ってきます。 こっちの使いどころはイマイチわかってないのですが、 大域脱出などに使うと便利とのことです 。

[ { 1,1} , {1,2} , {1,3} , {2,1} , {2,2} , {2,3} , {3,1} , {3,2} , {3,3} ]
長いです。そこで、こんな書き方ができます。
1 > [ {X , Y} || X < - [ 1,2,3 ] , Y < - [ 1,2,3 ] ] .
[ { 1,1} , {1,2} , {1,3} , {2,1} , {2,2} , {2,3} , {3,1} , {3,2} , {3,3} ]
なんとなく、要素が等しい場合は除きたくなりました。
1 > [ {X , Y} || X < - [ 1,2,3 ] , Y < - [ 1,2,3 ] , X/=Y ] .
[ { 1,2} , {1,3} , {2,1} , {2,3} , {3,1} , {3,2} ]
「 Xに [ 1,2,3 ] のどれか、Y に[ 1,2,3]のどれか、が入っているパターンのうち、
XとYが等しくないもの全て」のリストを作る、という作業になっています。 「 変数名 <- 式 」 の形の部分を生成子( generator ) と呼び、 条件式の部分をフィル タ( filter ) と呼ぶそうです 。
1> Xi = [ 1,2,3,4,5,6 ] .
[ 1,2,3,4,5,6 ]
2 > [ X * Y || X < - Xi , Y < - Xi , ( X+Y ) rem 2 == 0 ] .

The chess duel Man vs Machine , Vladimir Kramnik vs Deep Fritz is being staged from November 25 until December 5th .
It is sponsored by the RAG AG , one of Europe 's largest energy companies .
The venue is the National Art Gallery in Bonn , Germany .
Schedule :
Game 1 : Saturday 25.11.2006 15:00 h Game 2 : Monday 27.11.2006 15:00 h Game 3 : Wednesday 29.11.2006 15:00 h Game 4 : Friday 01.12.2006 15:00 h Game 5 : Sunday 03.12.2006 15:00 h Game 6 : Tuesday 05.12.2006 15:00 h
There will be full live coverage on the Playchess server , as well as on the official site and a number of partner sites .
Game one
Game one was a vintage Kramnik effort against Deep Fritz .
The world champion 's precise and methodical style is dangerous against humans and ideal against computer .
Kramnik employed the same tranquil Catalan opening he used against Veselin Topalov several times in their world championship match .
It 's just the sort of line to squeeze a mild positional advantage with minimal risk , something that 's especially important when facing a computer looking at eight million moves per second .
To no one 's surprise , Kramnik declined several invitations to complicate .
Fritz offered the two rooks for the queen on move 14 , but after 14 .
Qxa8 Bb7 15 .
Qxf8 + Kxf8 there are few targets for the rooks and one of the tenets of playing against a computer is to remove both powerful queens , not just your own !
A few moves later Fritz calmly played 15 .
Rfd8 , which allowed a combination Kramnik declined .
16 . Bxf6 Qxf6 were played and then 17. Ng5 attacks h7 and discovers an attack on the Bb7 at the same time .
But Black can ignore h7 and get a fine position after 17 ..
Bxg2 18 . Qxh7 + Kf8 19 .Qh5 g6 ! 20 . Qh4 Qd4 .
Kramnik settled for doubling Black 's pawns and getting a tiny endgame edge that was more optical than real .
Fritz played some unorthodox moves but never seemed in doubt of the eventual draw .
An impressive control game by Kramnik , although it should be much harder to achieve with the black pieces on Wednesday .

AMSTERDAM ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Could a smoking ban spell the end of Amsterdam ’s world famous coffee shops , where smoking cannabis is one of the main attractions ?
An unidentified man makes a cannabis cigarette at a house in London before the relaxation of cannabis laws , in this January 24 , 2004 file photo .
The Dutch may well follow other European countries in banning tobacco smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars , but coffee shop owner Michael Veling says it should still be possible to smoke dope .
REUTERS / David Bebber
No chance , says local conservative politician and coffee shop owner Michael Veling .
The Dutch may well follow other European countries in banning tobacco smoking in restaurants , cafes and bars , but Veling says it should still be possible to smoke dope .
“ It is ridiculous to think that a smoking ban would be the end of coffee shops ” , the 50 - year - old Veling says .
He says the clientele who have been coming to coffee shops to buy and inhale cannabis are flexible enough to find a way around any ban on smoking the tobacco products they routinely mix with marijuana resin or leaf in rolled paper “ joints ” .
“ You can bring parsley or old socks if you want , cut them here and smoke them , nobody will say anything , ” Veling said .
“ Plus there are plants that have a every similar structure to tobacco and can maybe substitute for it . ”
A tobacco smoking ban , which could come into force at the start of 2008 , may also boost the use of some of the weirder contraptions used for inhaling the active part of marijuana , THC , which gives users a high .
“ Nearly all of our American customers do that anyway , using pipes or the “ volcano ” , ” Veling says in his dark , cosy coffee shop , pointing to a shiny , cone - shaped silver contraption .
The volcano or vaporizer heats cannabis to release vapors of THC and channels these into a long transparent balloon .
At the counter , a dark - haired man waits to get the air from the balloon into his lungs .
Using the volcano makes cannabis consumption cheaper , Veling explains , because the drug can be used several times and is not burned like in a pipe .
“ On good days , when the shop is full of Americans , we sell 100 or 200 of these balloons ” , Veling says .
TOLERANCE
But most European customers of his “ De Kuil ” in central Amsterdam prefer to roll their marijuana with tobacco into joints , Veling admits .
One of them is Czech - born , Swiss resident Pavel Kotrba , sitting near the entrance with a broad smile and dilated pupils .
If a ban came into force , he says : “ I would smoke my joint on the street in front of the coffee shop , no problem ” .
Soft drugs are legally banned in the Netherlands but under a policy of “ tolerance ” , buyers are allowed to have less than 5 g of cannabis in their possession .
Government - regulated coffee shops sell cannabis and can keep stocks of up to 500 g .
Coffee shops first sprung up in the Netherlands in the 70s and have been drawing tourists ever since .
So far the majority of Dutch parliamentarians have urged that the coffee shops be exempt from any smoking ban , but a more sweeping Europe - wide ban might be introduced .
Unlike many of his colleagues in the soft drug retail business , Veling , who is also speaker of the Dutch Cannabis Retailers organization , does not consider the ban a danger to the industry which he estimates rolls in more than 1 billion euros ( $ 1.36 billion ) a year .
Most of the more than 700 coffee shops in the Netherlands would not even be affected by it anyway , he says , as they resemble cannabis drive-ins , where people queue in front of counters , buy and leave .
“ Some of these shops are huge and generate sales of approximately five million euros a year , ” he says .
Plus recent legislation banning the sale of both alcohol and cannabis together in coffee shops does n’t seem to have irked his customers too much .
“ They smoke more , that ’s my impression . ”
The universe has a problem .
The math that describes gravity and the structure of spacetime – general relativity – conflicts with the math that describes the interactions of subatomic particles – quantum mechanics .
For the past two decades , the dominant approach to unifying the two has been string theory , which basically says that the universe is made of infinitesimally small , vibrating filaments of energy moving through multiple dimensions .
It 's wacky stuff , but no weirder than a lot of other science .
Yet in his new book , The Trouble With Physics , theoretician Lee Smolin argues that string theory is not only weird , it might be wrong .
A founding scientist at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo , Ontario , Smolin says that string theory is unconvincing – maybe even nonscientific – and that physicists have embraced it at the expense of other promising research .
At home in Toronto , Smolin talked about physicist cliques and the true nature of the universe .
So you 're calling bullshit on a big chunk of modern physics .
I would n't put it that way , but that 's fair .
The field of fundamental theoretical physics is in trouble , and this book is about why .
But I have enormous respect for everybody whose work I 'm criticizing .
If string theory is a mistake , it 's not a trivial mistake .
It 's a deep mistake and therefore kind of worthy .
Yet you essentially accuse string theorists of being the jocks of theoretical physics .
A lot of people are frustrated that this community that styles itself as dominant – and is dominant in many places in the US – is uninterested in other good work .
Look , when we have quantum gravity meetings , we try to invite a representative from each of the major opposing theories , including string theory .
It 's not that we 're so very moral ; it 's just what you do .
But at the annual international string theory meeting , they 've never done this .
Why are they so antisocial ?
Territoriality ?
One metaphor that I like comes from complexity theory .
Let 's say you have a landscape with a bunch of hills , and you want to find the highest mountain .
String theory is a hill , and loop quantum gravity is a hill , and so are spin foam models and twistor theory and causal sets and brane worlds .
So some scientists are good hill climbers .
You set them on a slope , and they incrementally advance the science upward .
Other scientists are good explorers – valley crossers – who find new slopes .
The problem we have now is that science is dominated by hill climbers .
They 've found the tops of the hills , and they 're just …
… defending the hill .
Right .
And meanwhile , the truth is somewhere over there .
You 've said that string theory does n't make any testable predictions .
What do you mean by that ?
Well , the hypothesis was that the geometry that describes our universe has four " flat " dimensions and six more curled up so tiny that they can't be seen .
The problem is , once you start to curl up some of the dimensions , you get an infinite number of geometries that allow strings to propagate .
That does seem like a problem .
Yeah , and we 're not even there yet .
We know that the expansion of our universe is accelerating , which means a number called the cosmological constant must be positive .
At first everyone thought string theory was completely inconsistent with that .
In 2003 , some evidence was found for string theories where the cosmological constant is positive , too .
But if those theories exist , then there are at least 10500 of them .
So there 's a string theory to cover any observation .
Well , every string theory that 's been written down says the speed of light is universal .
But other ideas about quantum gravity predict the speed of light has actually increased .
And an experiment on the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope , launching next year , will check this .
So I 've said , look , if the speed of light is n't universal , that disconfirms string theory .
But the string theorists say they could probably invent versions of the theory that work either way .
We 'd have to change our notion of what science is to accommodate this proposition .
You just can't do science on that basis .
Let me predict the response to your book :
This is sour grapes from a researcher on the wrong side of history .
First of all , over the past 20 years , I 've published 18 technical papers in string theory .
The last one was about a year ago .
But even if I accepted your premise , this is what the literature is for .
Science moves fastest when there 's plenty of debate and controversy .
So this book is addressed to our colleagues as well as the public .
Then how do you think the stringy folks will respond ?
They could say , " String theory is gonna work ; it 's just taking a long time .
It gets so much right that it has to be worth pursuing . "
But the disagreement is not about whether string theory is worth pursuing .
It 's about whether it should be the only thing pursued .

String theory , says Smolin , may be a mistake .
A really deep mistake .
APRIL 20 -- The reactionary religious group that has staged protests at funerals for soldiers killed in Iraq plans to picket at tomorrow 's funeral for one of the victims of the Virginia Tech massacre .
The Westboro Baptist Church -- which operates the godhatesfags.com web site -- announced its plans to protest at student Ryan Clark 's funeral in a press release ( a copy of which you 'll find below ) .
Clark , 22 , was a biology and English major who reportedly was trying to shield others when he was shot Monday by Seung - Hui Cho .
Clark 's funeral is scheduled for tomorrow morning in Evans , Georgia .
The Westboro organization has protested at the funerals of soldiers because they claim that God is punishing America for ' her sodomite sins ' and the persecution of Westboro ' for warning America of her doom . ' ( 1 page )
Negotiating is n't always done in words .
Sunday , Iran launched a suborbital rocket , a day before the Security Council was to weigh more sanctions on Iran 's nuclear enrichment .
Was this a shot across the West 's bow ?
Or partly a warm - up for striking a deal ?
At the least , the 94 - mile - high launch was a wake - up call about Iran 's potential as a global military player , much like Russia 's 1957 Sputnik launch escalated the cold war and started the space race .
The rocket itself , perhaps built with North Korean help , could be converted within a few years to a type that delivers a warhead 3,000 miles away .
That would help lift Iran 's military posture from purely defensive to a first - strike capability .
Iran 's ambition to project power beyond the Middle East was clear enough after Russia launched two satellites for it in 2005 .
Iran now hopes to put four more satellites into space by 2010 by itself .
They could simply provide Internet access and other telecommunications , or some might be used for military surveillance .
If Iran also then develops intercontinental rockets and nuclear warheads , both Israel and Europe may be in danger .
( For the US , the Bush administration declared last year in a strategy paper that the US " may face no greater challenge from a single country than [ from ] Iran . " )
Dealing with Tehran 's clerics to climb down from such a scenario will reach another critical peak this week .
Last Wednesday , Iran ignored a Security Council deadline to suspend its nuclear enrichment program .
The UN's International Atomic Energy Agency stated that Iran refuses to adequately explain how it obtained small amounts of highly enriched uranium .
The IAEA director also said Iran has already learned enough about enriching uranium in its research .
Iran 's defiance of even Russia and China at the UN , combined with this " research " launch Sunday , will probably boost moves to impose tougher sanctions on Iran .
But how tough ?
Russia seems to have lost its ability to moderate Iran .
( And with this rocket shot , Moscow also loses arguments against plans to place US - made antimissile technology in Eastern Europe . )
With the US already working independently of the UN to push for tighter European limits on loans and export credits to Iran , Russia would be wise to work with the US .
Sanctions on Iran could achieve the same results as with Libya , which stopped its nuclear ambitions to end sanctions .
The current sanctions , imposed two months ago , simply restrict the transfer of nuclear technology to Iran and freeze assets of Iranian companies and individuals involved in nuclear work .
What shocked Iran more was that the Council took action at all .
Sunday 's rocket launch could simply be a move to negotiate a deal .
But keeping unanimity among the five permanent UN members is crucial to ratcheting up the pressure .
A next set of sanctions will require sacrifice by European firms doing business with Iran .
Any new sanctions should include travel bans on senior Iranian leaders .
A united front in a second round of sanctions will send a powerful message – more power than rockets or nuclear weapons can – that the world wants Iran to change course , focus on its economic problems , and seek influence in other ways .

Trees and Other Hierarchies in MySQL
Graphs and SQL Edge list Edge list tree CTE edge list treewalk Automate tree drawing
Nested sets model of a tree Edge - list model of a network Parts explosions
Most non-trivial data is hierarchical .
Customers have orders , which have line items , which refer to products , which have prices .
Population samples have subjects , who take tests , which give results , which have sub-results and norms .
Web sites have pages , which have links , which collect hits across dates and times .
These are hierarchies of tables .
The number of tables limits the number of JOIN s needed to walk the tree .
For such data , standard SQL is excellent .
But when data maps a family tree , or a browsing history , or a bill of materials , data rows relate hierarchically to other rows in the same table .
We no longer know how many JOIN s we need to walk the tree .
We need a different data model .
That model is the graph ( Fig 1 ) , which is a set of nodes ( vertices ) and the edges ( lines or arcs ) that connect them .
This chapter is about how to model and query graphs in a MySQL database .
Graph theory is a branch of topology .
It is the study of geometric relations that are n't changed by stretching and compression — rubber sheet geometry , some call it .
Graph theory is ideal for modelling hierarchies — like family trees , browsing histories , search trees , Bayesian networks and bills of materials — whose shape and size we can't know in advance .
Let the set of nodes in Fig 1 be N , the set of edges be L , and the graph be G .
Then G is the tuple or ordered pair { N , L} :
N = {A , B , C , D , E , F} L = {AC , CD , CF , BE} G = { N,L}
If the edges are directed , the graph is a digraph or directed graph .
A mixed graph has both directed and undirected edges .
Examples of graphs are organisational charts ; itineraries ; route maps ; parts explosions ; massively multiplayer games ; language rules ; chat histories ; network and link analysis in a wide variety of fields , for example search engines , forensics , epidemiology and telecommunications ; data mining ; models of chemical structure hierarchies ; and biochemical processes .
Graph characteristics and models
Nodes and edges :
Two nodes are adjacent if there is an edge between them .
Two edges are adjacent if they connect to a common node .
In a complete graph , all nodes are adjacent to all other nodes .
In a digraph , the number of edges entering a node is its indegree ; the number leaving is its outdegree .
A node of indegree zero is a root node , a node of outdegree zero is a leaf node .
In a weighted graph , used for example to solve the travelling salesman problem , edges have a weight attribute .
A digraph with weighted edges is a network .
Paths and cycles :
A connected sequence of edges is a path , its length the number of edges traversed .
Two nodes are connected if there is a path between them .
If there is a path connecting every pair of nodes , the graph is a connected graph .
A path in which no node repeats is a simple path .
A path which returns to its own origin without crossing itself is a cycle or circuit .
A graph with multiple paths between at least one pair of nodes is reconvergent .
A reconvergent graph may be cyclic or acyclic .
A unit length cycle is a loop .
If a graph 's edges intersect only at nodes , it is planar .
Two paths having no node in common are independent .
Traversing graphs :
There are two main approaches , breadth - first and depth - first .
Breadth - first traversal visits all a node 's siblings before moving on to the next level , and typically uses a queue .
Depth - first traversal follows edges down to leaves and back before proceeding to siblings , and typically uses a stack .
Sparsity : A graph where the size of E approaches the maximum N2 is dense .
When the multiple is much smaller than N , the graph is considered sparse .
Trees :
A tree is a connected graph with no cycles .
It is also a graph where the indegree of the root node is 0 , and the indegree of every other node is 1 .
A tree where every node is of outdegree < =2 is a binary tree .
A forest is a graph in which every connected component is a tree .
Euler paths :
A path which traverses every edge in a graph exactly once is an Euler path .
An Euler path which is a circuit is an Euler circuit .
If and only if every node of a connected graph has even degree , it has an Euler circuit ( which is why the good people of Königsberg cannot go for a walk crossing each of their seven bridges exactly once ) .
If and only if a connected graph has exactly 2 nodes with odd degree , it has a non-circuit Euler path .
The degree of an endpoint of a non-cycle Euler path is 1 + twice the number of times the path passes through that node , so it is always odd .
Models for computing graphs
Traditionally , computer science textbooks have offered edge lists , adjacency lists and adjacency matrices as data structures for graphs , with algorithms implemented in languages like C , C++ and Java .
More recently other models and tools have been suggested , including query languages customised for graphs .
Edge list :
The simplest way to represent a graph is to list its edges : for Fig 1 , the edge list is {AC , CD , CF , BE} .
It is easy to add an edge to the list ; deletion is a little harder .
Table 1 Nodes Adjacent nodes A C B E C F , D, A D C E B F C
Adjacency list :
An adjacency list is a ragged array : for each node it lists all adjacent nodes .
Thus it represents a directed graph of n nodes as a list of n lists where list i contains node j if the graph has an edge from node i to node j .
An undirected graph may be represented by having node j in the list for node i , and node i in the list for node j .
Table 1 shows the adjacency list of the graph in Fig 1 interpreted as undirected .
Adjacency matrix :
An adjacency matrix represents a graph with n nodes as an n x n matrix , where the entry at ( i , j ) is 1 if there is an edge from node i to node j , or zero if there is not .
An adjacency matrix can represent a weighted graph using the weight as the entry , and can represent an undirected graph by using the same entry in both ( i , j ) and ( j , i ) , or by using an upper triangular matrix .
There are useful glossaries here and here .
Graphs and SQL
Standard SQL has been cumbersome for the recursive row - to - row logic of graphs .
To fix this , DB2 , Oracle , SQL Server and PostgreSQL have added recursive Common Table Expressions ( CTE s ) .
Before 8.0 , MySQL did not have CTE s , so recursive graph traversal required stored routines .
MariaDB has had CTEs since version 10.2.2 , MySQL since version 8.0.2 .
Joe Celko and Scott Stephens , among others , have published general SQL graph problem solutions that are simpler and smaller than equivalent C++ , C# or Java code .
Here we show how to use such tools .
Beware that in ports of edge list and adjacency list methods to SQL , there has been name slippage .
What SQLers often call an adjacency list is n't like the adjacency list shown in Table 1 ; it 's an edge list .
Here we 'll honour that fact , and mostly call them edge lists , but to keep the peace we ’ll sometimes call them edge - adjacency lists .
There are also two newer kinds of models : what Joe Celko calls the nested sets model — an interval model using greater - than / less - than arithmetic to encode tree relationships and modified preorder tree traversal ( MPTT ) to query them , and Tropashko 's materialised path model , where each node is stored with its ( denormalised ) path to the root .
So now we have five main ways to model graphs in MySQL :
edge - adjacency lists : based on an adaptation by EF Codd of the logic of linked lists to table structures and queries ,
adjacency matrices ,
nested sets for trees simplify some queries , but insertion and deletion are cumbersome , and
materialised paths ,
recursive CTE s.
The edge list
The edge list is the simplest possible SQL representation of a graph : minimally , a single edges table where each row specifies one node and its parent ( which is NULL for the root node ) , or to avoid DKNF problems , two tables : one for the nodes , the other to link the edges .
In the real world , the nodes table might be a table of personnel , or assembly parts , or locations on a map .
It might have many other columms of data .
The edges table might also have additional columns for edge properties .
The key integers of both tables might be BIGINT s.
To model Fig 1 , though , we keep things as simple as possible :
Listing 1 CREATE TABLE nodes ( nodeID CHAR(1 ) PRIMARY KEY ) ; CREATE TABLE edges ( childID CHAR(1 ) NOT NULL , parentID CHAR(1 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( childID , parentID ) ) ; INSERT INTO nodes VALUES ( ' A ' ) , ( ' B ' ) , ( ' C ' ) , ( ' D ' ) , ( ' E ' ) , ( ' F ' ) ; INSERT INTO edges VALUES ( ' A ' , ' C ' ) , ( ' C ' , 'D ' ) , ( ' C ' , ' F ' ) , ( ' B ' , 'E ' ) ; SELECT * FROM edges ; +---------+----------+
| childID | parentID | +---------+----------+ | A | C | | B | E | | C | D | | C | F | +---------+----------+
Now , without any assumptions about whether the graph is connected , whether it is directed , whether it is a tree , or whatever , how hard is it to write a reachability ( " closure " ) procedure to tell us where we can get to from here , wherever ' here ' is ?
It 's easy with a breadth - first search :
Seed the list with the starting node , Add , but do not duplicate , nodes which are children of nodes in the list , Add , but do not duplicate , nodes which are parents of nodes in the list , Repeat steps 2 and 3 until there are no more nodes to add .
Here it is as a MySQL stored procedure .
It avoids duplicate nodes by defining reached .
nodeID as a primary key and adding reachable nodes with INSERT IGNORE :
Listing 2 DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS ListReached ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE ListReached ( IN root CHAR ( 1 ) ) BEGIN DECLARE rows SMALLINT DEFAULT 0 ; DROP TABLE IF EXISTS reached ; CREATE TABLE reached ( nodeID CHAR (1 ) PRIMARY KEY ) ENGINE=HEAP ; INSERT INTO reached VALUES ( root ) ; SET rows = ROW_COUNT ( ) ; WHILE rows > 0 DO INSERT IGNORE INTO reached SELECT DISTINCT childID FROM edges AS e INNER JOIN reached AS p ON e.parentID = p.nodeID ; SET rows = ROW_COUNT ( ) ; INSERT IGNORE INTO reached SELECT DISTINCT parentID FROM edges AS e INNER JOIN reached AS p ON e.childID = p.nodeID ; SET rows = rows + ROW_COUNT ( ) ; END WHILE ; SELECT * FROM reached ; DROP TABLE reached ; END ; go DELIMITER ; CALL ListReached ( ' A ' ) ; +--------+ | nodeID | +--------+ | A | | C | | D | | F | +--------+
To make the procedure more versatile , give it input parameters to tell it whether to list child , parent or all connections , and whether to recognise loops ( for example C to C ) .
To give the model referential integrity , use InnoDB and make edges.childID and edges.parentID foreign keys .
To add or delete a node , add or delete desired single rows in nodes and edges .
To change an edge , edit it .
The model does not require the graph to be connected or treelike , and does not presume direction .
The edge list is basic to what SQLers often call the adjacency list model .
Edge - adjacency list model of a tree
Writers in the SQL graph literature often give solutions using single denormalised tables .
Denormalisation can cost , big time .
The bigger the table , the bigger the cost .
You can not edit nodes and edges separately .
Carrying extra node information during edge computation slows performance .
To avoid such difficulties , normalise trees like William Shakespeare 's family tree ( Fig 2 ) into two tables , nodes ( family ) with a row for each individual 's information , about individuals , and edges ( familytree ) with a row for each parent - child link or edge .
Listing 3 -- Base data : CREATE TABLE family ( ID smallint unsigned PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT , name char ( 20 ) default '' , siborder tinyint ( 4 ) default NULL , born smallint ( 4 ) unsigned default NULL , died smallint ( 4 ) unsigned default NULL ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 1 , ' Richard Shakespeare ' , NULL , NULL , 1561 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 2 , ' Henry Shakespeare ' , 1 , NULL , 1569 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 3 , ' John Shakespeare ' , 2 , 1530 , 1601 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 4 , ' Joan Shakespeare ' , 1 , 1558 , NULL ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 5 , ' Margaret Shakespeare ' , 2 , 1562 , 1563 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 6 , ' William Shakespeare ' , 3 , 1564 , 1616 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 7 , ' Gilbert Shakespeare ' , 4 , 1566 , 1612 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 8 , ' Joan Shakespeare ' , 5 , 1568 , 1646 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 9 , ' Anne Shakespeare ' , 6 , 1571 , 1579 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 10 , ' Richard Shakespeare ' , 7 , 1574 , 1613 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 11 , ' Edmond Shakespeare ' , 8 , 1580 , 1607 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 12 , ' Susana Shakespeare ' , 1 , 1583 , 1649 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 13 , ' Hamnet Shakespeare ' , 1 , 1585 , 1596 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 14 , ' Judith Shakespeare ' , 1 , 1585 , 1662 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 15 , ' William Hart ' , 1 , 1600 , 1639 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 16 , ' Mary Hart ' , 2 , 1603 , 1607 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 17 , ' Thomas Hart ' , 3 , 1605 , 1670 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 18 , ' Michael Hart ' , 1 , 1608 , 1618 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 19 , ' Elizabeth Hall ' , 1 , 1608 , 1670 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 20 , ' Shakespeare Quiney ' , 1 , 1616 , 1617 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 21 , ' Richard Quiney ' , 2 , 1618 , 1639 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 22 , ' Thomas Quiney ' , 3 , 1620 , 1639 ) ; INSERT INTO family VALUES ( 23 , ' John Bernard ' , 1 , NULL , 1674 ) ; --
Table which models the tree : CREATE TABLE familytree ( childID smallint unsigned NOT NULL , parentID smallint unsigned NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( childID , parentID ) ; ) ; INSERT INTO familytree VALUES ( 2 , 1 ) , ( 3 , 1 ) , ( 4 , 2 ) , ( 5 , 2 ) , ( 6 , 2 ) , ( 7 , 2 ) , ( 8 , 2 ) , ( 9 , 2 ) , ( 10 , 2 ) , ( 11 , 2 ) , ( 12 , 6 ) , ( 13 , 6 ) , ( 14 , 6 ) , ( 15 , 8 ) , ( 16 , 8 ) , ( 17 , 8 ) , ( 18 , 8 ) , ( 19 , 12 ) , ( 20 , 14 ) , ( 21 , 14 ) , ( 22 , 14 ) , ( 23 , 19 ) ;
( The family PK is auto - increment , but the listing is more reader - friendly when the ID values are shown . )
It will be useful to have a function that returns family .
name for a parent or child ID in familytree :
Listing 4 DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS PersonName ; CREATE FUNCTION PersonName ( pid smallint ) RETURNS VARCHAR ( 20 ) DETERMINISTIC
RETURN ( SELECT name FROM family WHERE ID=pid ) ; SELECT PersonName ( parentID ) AS ' Father of William ' FROM familytree WHERE childID = 6 ; +-------------------+ | Father of William | +-------------------+ | Henry Shakespeare | +-------------------+
SELECT PersonName ( childID ) AS ' Children of William ' FROM familytree WHERE parentID = ( SELECT ID FROM family WHERE name = ' William Shakespeare ' ) ; +---------------------+ | Children of William | +---------------------+
| Susana Shakespeare | | Hamnet Shakespeare | | Judith Shakespeare | +---------------------+ SELECT PersonName( childID ) AS child , PersonName ( parentID ) AS parent FROM familytree ; +----------------------+---------------------+ | child | parent |
+----------------------+---------------------+ | Henry Shakespeare | Richard Shakespeare | | John Shakespeare | Richard Shakespeare | | Joan Shakespeare | Henry Shakespeare | | Margaret Shakespeare | Henry Shakespeare | | William Shakespeare | Henry Shakespeare | | Gilbert Shakespeare | Henry Shakespeare | | Joan Shakespeare | Henry Shakespeare | | Anne Shakespeare | Henry Shakespeare | | Richard Shakespeare | Henry Shakespeare | | Edmond Shakespeare | Henry Shakespeare | | Susana Shakespeare | William Shakespeare | | Hamnet Shakespeare | William Shakespeare | | Judith Shakespeare | William Shakespeare | | William Hart | Joan Shakespeare | | Mary Hart | Joan Shakespeare | | Thomas Hart | Joan Shakespeare | | Michael Hart | Joan Shakespeare | | Elizabeth Hall | Susana Shakespeare | | Shakespeare Quiney | Judith Shakespeare | | Richard Quiney | Judith Shakespeare | | Thomas Quiney | Judith Shakespeare | | John Bernard | Elizabeth Hall | +----------------------+---------------------+
A same - table foreign key can simplify tree maintenance :
Listing 4a create table edges ( ID int PRIMARY KEY , parentid int , foreign key ( parentID ) references edges ( ID ) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE ) engine=innodb ; insert into edges ( ID , parentID ) values ( 1,null ) , ( 2,1 ) , ( 3,1 ) , ( 4,2 ) ; select * from edges ; +----+----------+ | ID | parentid | +----+----------+ | 1 | NULL | | 2 | 1 | | 3 | 1 | | 4 | 2 | +----+----------+
delete from edges where id =2 ; select * from edges ; +----+----------+ | ID | parentid | +----+----------+ | 1 | NULL | | 3 | 1 | +----+----------+
Simple queries retrieve basic facts about the tree , for example GROUP_CONCAT ( ) collects parent nodes with their children in correct order :
Listing 5 SELECT parentID AS Parent , GROUP_CONCAT( childID ORDER BY siborder ) AS Children FROM familytree t JOIN family f ON t.parentID=f.ID GROUP BY parentID ; +--------+-------------------+ | Parent | Children | +--------+-------------------+ | 1 | 3,2 | | 2 | 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 | | 6 | 12,13,14 | | 8 | 18,17,16,15 | | 12 | 19 | | 14 | 22,21,20 | | 19 | 23 | +--------+-------------------+
Iterate over those comma-separated lists with a bit of application code and you have a hybrid treewalk .
The paterfamilias is the root node , individuals with no children are the leaf nodes , and queries to retrieve subtree statistics are straightforward :
Listing 6 SELECT PersonName ( ID ) AS Paterfamilias , IFNULL ( born , '? ') AS Born , IFNULL ( died , ' ? ' )
AS Died FROM family AS f LEFT JOIN familytree AS t ON f.ID=t.childID WHERE t.childID IS NULL ; +---------------------+------+------+
| Paterfamilias | Born | Died |
+---------------------+------+------+ | Richard Shakespeare | ? | 1561 | +---------------------+------+------+ SELECT PersonName ( ID ) AS Childless , IFNULL ( born , '? ') AS Born , IFNULL ( died , ' ? ' )
AS Died FROM family AS f LEFT JOIN familytree AS t ON f.ID=t.parentID WHERE t.parentID IS NULL ; +----------------------+------+------+ | Childless | Born | Died |
+----------------------+------+------+ | John Shakespeare | 1530 | 1601 | | Joan Shakespeare | 1558 | ? | | Margaret Shakespeare | 1562 | 1563 | | Gilbert Shakespeare | 1566 | 1612 | | Anne Shakespeare | 1571 | 1579 | | Richard Shakespeare | 1574 | 1613 | | Edmond Shakespeare | 1580 | 1607 | | Hamnet Shakespeare | 1585 | 1596 | | William Hart | 1600 | 1639 | | Mary Hart | 1603 | 1607 | | Thomas Hart | 1605 | 1670 | | Michael Hart | 1608 | 1618 | | Shakespeare Quiney | 1616 | 1617 | | Richard Quiney | 1618 | 1639 | | Thomas Quiney | 1620 | 1639 | | John Bernard | ? | 1674 | +----------------------+------+------+ SELECT ROUND ( AVG ( died - born ) ,2) AS ' Longevity of the childless ' FROM family AS f LEFT JOIN familytree AS t ON f.ID=t.parentID WHERE t.parentID IS NULL ; +----------------------------+ |
Longevity of the childless |
+----------------------------+
| 25.86 | +----------------------------+
In striking contrast with Celko 's nested sets model , inserting a new item in this model requires no revision of existing rows .
We just add a new family row , then a new familytree row with ID s specifying who is parent to whom .
Deletion is also a two - step : delete the familytree row for that child - parent link , then delete the family row for that child .
Walking an edge list tree
Edge list tree traversal is supposed to be difficult .
Usually we do n't know in advance how many levels the tree has , so the query needs recursion or a logically equivalent loop .
Without CTEs ( i.e. , , before MySQL 8.0 or MariaDB 10.2.2 ) , that requires a stored procedure .
Here is a simple algorithm that just seeds a result table with children of the root node , then adds remaining edges with INSERT IGNORE :
Listing 7 DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS famsubtree ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE famsubtree ( root INT ) BEGIN DROP TABLE IF EXISTS famsubtree ; CREATE TABLE famsubtree ( childID smallint unsigned not null , parentID smallint unsigned null , Primary Key( childID , parentID ) ) SELECT childID , parentID , 0 AS level FROM familytree WHERE parentID = root ; REPEAT INSERT IGNORE INTO famsubtree SELECT f.childID , f.parentID , s.level+1 FROM familytree AS f JOIN famsubtree AS s ON f.parentID = s.childID ; UNTIL Row_Count ( ) = 0 END REPEAT ; END ; go DELIMITER ; call famsubtree ( 1 ) ; -- from the root you can see forever SELECT Concat ( Space ( level ) , parentID ) AS Parent , Group_Concat ( childID ORDER BY childID ) AS Child FROM famsubtree GROUP BY parentID ; +--------+-------------------+ | Parent | Child | +--------+-------------------+ | 1 | 2,3 | | 2 | 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 | | 6 | 12,13,14 | | 8 | 15,16,17,18 | | 12 | 19 | | 14 | 20,21,22 | | 19 | 23 | +--------+-------------------+
Simple and quick .
The logic ports to any edge list .
We can prove that right now by writing a generic version .
GenericTree ( ) just needs parameters for the name of the target table , the names of its child and parent ID columns , and the parent ID whose descendants are sought :
Listing 7a : General - purpose edge list tree walker DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS GenericTree ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE GenericTree ( edgeTable CHAR ( 64 ) , edgeIDcol CHAR ( 64 ) , edgeParentIDcol CHAR ( 64 ) , ancestorID INT ) BEGIN DECLARE r INT DEFAULT 0 ; DROP TABLE IF EXISTS subtree ; SET @sql = Concat ( ' CREATE TABLE subtree SELECT ' , edgeIDcol , ' AS childID , ' , edgeParentIDcol , ' AS parentID , ' , '0 AS level FROM ' , edgeTable , ' WHERE ' , edgeParentIDcol , '= ' , ancestorID ) ; PREPARE stmt FROM @sql ; EXECUTE stmt ; DROP PREPARE stmt ; ALTER TABLE subtree ADD PRIMARY KEY ( childID , parentID ) ; REPEAT SET @sql = Concat ( 'INSERT IGNORE INTO subtree SELECT a. ' , edgeIDcol , ', a.',edgeparentIDcol , ', b.level+1 FROM ' , edgeTable , ' AS a JOIN subtree AS b ON a.',edgeParentIDcol , ' =b.childID ' ) ; PREPARE stmt FROM @sql ; EXECUTE stmt ; SET r=Row_Count ( ) ; -- save row_count ( ) result before DROP PREPARE loses the value DROP PREPARE stmt ; UNTIL r < 1 END REPEAT ; END ; go DELIMITER ;
To retrieve details ( e.g. , names ) associated with node IDs , write a frontend query to join the subtree result table with the required detail table (s ) ...
CALL GenericTree(' familytree ' , 'childID ' , 'parentID ',1 ) ; SELECT Concat( Repeat ( ' ' , s.level ) , a.name ) AS Parent , b.name AS Child FROM subtree s JOIN family a ON s.parentID=a.ID JOIN family b ON s.childID=b.ID ; +-----------------------+----------------------+ |

Called for the root node , GenericTree ( ) generates a reachability ( closure ) table .
Is it fast ?
On standard hardware it walks a 5,000 - node tree in less than 0.5 secs — much faster than a comparable nested sets query on the same tree !
It has no serious scaling issues .
And its logic can be used to prune : call GenericTree ( ) then delete the listed rows .
Better still , write a generic tree pruner from Listing 7a and a DELETE command .
To insert a subtree , prepare a table of new rows , point its top edge at an existing node as parent , and INSERT it .
The edge list treewalk is logically recursive , so how about coding it recursively ?
Here is a recursive depth - first PHP treewalk for the familytree and family tables :
Listing 7b : Recursive edge list subtree in PHP $ info = recursivesubtree ( 1 , $ a = array ( ) , 0 ) ; foreach ( $ info as $ row ) echo str_repeat ( " " , 2 * $row [ 4 ] ) , ( $ row [ 3 ] > 0 ) ? " < b>{ $row [ 1 ] } </b > " : $ row [ 1 ] , " < br / > " ; function recursivesubtree ( $ rootID , $ a , $ level ) { $ childcountqry = " ( SELECT COUNT (*) FROM familytree WHERE parentID=t.childID ) AS childcount " ; $ qry = " SELECT t.childid , f.name,t. parentid , $childcountqry , $level " .
" FROM familytree t JOIN family f ON t.childID=f.ID " .
" WHERE parentid=$rootID ORDER BY childcount <>0,t.childID " ; $res = mysql_query ( $ qry ) ; while ( $ row = mysql_fetch_row ( $res ) ) { $ a [ ] = $ row ; if ( $ row [ 3 ] > 0 ) $ a = recursivesubtree ( $ row[0 ] , $ a , $ level+1 ) ; // down before right } return $ a ; }
A query with a subquery , a fetch loop , and a recursive call -- that 's all there is to it .
A nice feature of this algorithm is that it writes result rows in display - ready order .
To port this to MySQL , you must have set maximum recursion depth in my.cnf / ini or in your client :
Listing 7c : Recursive edge list subtree in MySQL SET @@SESSION.max_sp_recursion_depth=25 ; DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS recursivesubtree ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE recursivesubtree ( iroot INT , ilevel INT ) BEGIN DECLARE irows , ichildid , iparentid , ichildcount , done INT DEFAULT 0 ; DECLARE cname VARCHAR ( 64 ) ; SET irows = ( SELECT COUNT (*) FROM familytree WHERE parentID=iroot ) ; IF ilevel = 0 THEN DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS _descendants ; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE _descendants ( childID INT , parentID INT , name VARCHAR ( 64 ) , childcount INT , level INT ) ; END IF ; IF irows > 0 THEN BEGIN DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR SELECT childid , parentid , f.name , ( SELECT COUNT (*) FROM familytree WHERE parentID=t.childID )
AS childcount FROM familytree t JOIN family f ON t.childID=f.ID WHERE parentid=iroot ORDER BY childcount<>0,t.childID ; DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR SQLSTATE '02000 ' SET done = 1 ; OPEN cur ; WHILE NOT done DO FETCH cur INTO ichildid , iparentid , cname , ichildcount ; IF NOT done THEN INSERT INTO _descendants VALUES ( ichildid , iparentid , cname , ichildcount , ilevel ) ; IF ichildcount > 0 THEN CALL recursivesubtree ( ichildid , ilevel + 1 ) ; END IF ; END IF ; END WHILE ; CLOSE cur ; END ; END IF ; IF ilevel = 0 THEN --
Show result table headed by name that corresponds to iroot :
SET cname = ( SELECT name FROM family WHERE ID=iroot ) ;
SET @sql = CONCAT ( 'SELECT CONCAT( REPEAT ( CHAR ( 32),2* level ) , IF( childcount , UPPER ( name ) , name ) ) ' ,
' AS ' , CHAR ( 39 ) , 'Descendants of ' , cname , CHAR ( 39 ) , ' FROM _descendants ' ) ;
PREPARE stmt FROM @sql ;
EXECUTE stmt ;
DROP PREPARE stmt ;
END IF ;
END ;
go
DELIMITER ;

In MySQL this recursive treewalk can be up to 100 times slower than GenericTree ( ) .
Its slowness is comparable to that of a MySQL version of Kendall Willet 's depth - first edge list subtree algorithm :
Listing 7d : Depth - first edge list subtree CREATE PROCEDURE depthfirstsubtree ( iroot INT ) BEGIN DECLARE ilastvisited , inxt , ilastord INT ; SET ilastvisited = iroot ; SET ilastord = 1 ; DROP TABLE IF EXISTS descendants ; CREATE TABLE descendants SELECT childID , parentID , -1 AS ord FROM familytree ; UPDATE descendants SET ord=1 WHERE childID=iroot ; this : LOOP SET inxt = NULL ; SELECT MIN ( childID ) INTO inxt FROM descendants -- go down WHERE parentID = ilastvisited AND ord = - 1 ; IF inxt IS NULL THEN -- nothing down , so go right SELECT MIN ( d2.childID ) INTO inxt FROM descendants d1 JOIN descendants d2 ON d1.parentID = d2.parentID AND d1.childID < d2.childID WHERE d1.childID
= ilastvisited ; END IF ; IF inxt IS NULL THEN -- nothing right .
so go up SELECT parentID INTO inxt FROM descendants WHERE childID = ilastvisited AND parentID IS NOT NULL ; END IF ; UPDATE descendants SET ord = ilastord + 1 WHERE childID = inxt AND ord = - 1 ; IF ROW_COUNT ( ) >
0 THEN SET ilastord = ilastord + 1 ; END IF ; IF inxt IS NULL THEN LEAVE this ; END IF ; SET ilastvisited = inxt ; END LOOP ; END ;
One reason Willet 's is slower is that MySQL does not permit multiple references to a temporary table in a query .
When all algorithms are denied temp tables , though , this algorithm is still slower than recursion , and both are much slower than GenericTree ( ) .
A simple procedure to retrieve a node 's ancestors :
Listing 7e : Find node 's ancestors CREATE PROCEDURE ancestors ( pid int ) begin drop temporary table if exists _ancestors ; create temporary table _ancestors ( parent int ) ; set @id = pid ; repeat select parentID , count ( * ) into @parent , @y from familytree where childID=@id ; if @y > 0 then insert into _ancestors values ( @parent ) ; set @id=@parent ; end if ; until @parent is null or @y=0 end repeat ; select * from _ancestors order by parent ; end ;
Finally , for MariaDB from 10.2.2 and MySQL from 8.0.1 , here is a recursive treewalk using a CTE .
Such queries ( see SELECT / WITH in Chapter 6 ) have five parts : a WITH clause to declare the derived table ; a query to initialise the derived table , in this case with the root node ; a UNION command ; the recursive join ; and a final output SELECT .
We built the familytree table without a row for the root , so the initialising SELECT creates it , but it need n't be shown in the result :
Listing 7f : Tree listing using a CTE : WITH RECURSIVE treewalk AS ( SELECT CAST ( 1 AS UNSIGNED ) AS childID , -- UNION NEEDS EXACT TYPE MATCH CAST ( NULL AS UNSIGNED ) AS parentID , CAST(0 AS UNSIGNED ) AS level , 0 AS siborder UNION ALL SELECT familytree.childID , familytree.parentID , treewalk.level+1 AS level , family .siborder FROM familytree JOIN treewalk ON familytree.parentID=treewalk.childID JOIN family ON family.ID=familytree.childID ) SELECT Concat( Space ( level - 1 ) , parentID ) AS Parent , level - 1 AS Depth , Group_Concat ( childID ORDER BY siborder ) AS Children FROM treewalk WHERE level >0 GROUP BY treewalk.parentID ORDER BY treewalk.parentID ; -- Unset only_full_group_by sql_mode +--------+-------+-------------------+ | Parent | Depth | Children | +--------+-------+-------------------+ | 1 | 0 | 2,3 | | 2 | 1 | 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 | | 6 | 2 | 13,12,14 | | 8 | 2 | 18,15,16,17 | | 12 | 3 | 19 | | 14 | 3 | 20,21,22 | | 19 | 4 | 23 | +--------+-------+-------------------+
The breadth - first logic is that of Listing 7 , but the CTE makes this treewalk about ten times faster , and implements recursion so requires no stored routine .
Set sql_mode to not include only_full_group_by .
If the graph being traversed is cyclic , avoid an endless loop by changing UNION ALL to UNION DISTINCT .
A query can cascade CTEs .
Without CTEs such a query probably needed temporary or intermediate tables .
With CTEs , no more .
This alone may cut query running time by 50 % or more — see “ Treewalks with CTEs ” on our Common Queries page .
To walk a subtree , create a comma-separated cumulative path column and order on it , e.g. , for table infotree ( id , parentid , name ) this retrieves the subtree of node 5 :
Listing 7g : Walk a tree with CTE : set @root=5 ; -- subtree root value with recursive treewalk as ( select id , 0 as level , cast ( id as char ) as path , name from infotree where id=@root -- query for subtree root union select -- query for nodes t.id , tw. level + 1 as level , concat ( path , ' , ' , t.id ) as path , -- the path down to this node t.name from infotree t join treewalk tw on t.parentid=tw.id ) select * from treewalk order by path ;
Edge list tree queries perform faster , and are easier to write , than their reputation suggests — especially when CTEs are available .
And edge tables are flexible .
For a tree describing a parts explosion rather than a family , just add columns for weight , quantity , assembly time , cost , price and so on .
Reports need only aggregate column values and sums .
We 'll revisit this near the end of the chapter .
Enumerating paths in an edge - adjacency list
Path enumeration in an edge list tree is almost as easy as depth - first subtree traversal :
create a table for paths ,
seed it with paths of unit length from the tree table ,
iteratively add paths till there are no more to add .
MySQL's INSERT IGNORE command simplifies the code by removing the need for a NOT EXISTS ( ... ) clause in the INSERT ... SELECT statement .
Since adjacencies are logically symmetrical , we make path direction the caller 's choice , UP or DOWN :
Listing 8 DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS ListAdjacencyPaths ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE ListAdjacencyPaths ( IN direction CHAR ( 5 ) ) BEGIN DROP TABLE IF EXISTS paths ; CREATE TABLE paths ( start SMALLINT , stop SMALLINT , len SMALLINT , PRIMARY KEY ( start , stop ) ) ENGINE=HEAP ; IF direction = ' UP ' THEN INSERT INTO paths SELECT childID , parentID,1 FROM familytree ; ELSE INSERT INTO paths SELECT parentID , childID,1 FROM familytree ; END IF ; WHILE ROW_COUNT ( ) >
0 DO INSERT IGNORE INTO paths SELECT DISTINCT p1.start , p2.stop , p1.len + p2.len FROM paths AS p1 INNER JOIN paths AS p2 ON p1.stop = p2.start ; END WHILE ; SELECT start , stop , len FROM paths ORDER BY start , stop ; DROP TABLE paths ; END ; go DELIMITER ;
To find the paths from just one node , seed the paths table with paths from the starting node , then iteratively search a JOIN of familytree and paths for edges which will extend existing paths in the user - specified direction :
Listing 8a DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS ListAdjacencyPathsOfNode ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE ListAdjacencyPathsOfNode ( IN node SMALLINT , IN direction CHAR ( 5 ) ) BEGIN TRUNCATE paths ; IF direction = ' UP ' THEN INSERT INTO paths SELECT childID , parentID,1 FROM familytree WHERE childID = node ; ELSE INSERT INTO paths SELECT parentID , childID,1 FROM familytree WHERE parentID = node ; END IF ; WHILE ROW_COUNT ( ) > 0 DO IF direction = ' UP ' THEN INSERT IGNORE INTO paths SELECT DISTINCT paths.start , familytree.parentID , paths.len + 1 FROM paths INNER JOIN familytree ON paths.stop = familytree.childID ; ELSE INSERT IGNORE INTO paths SELECT DISTINCT paths.start , familytree.childID , paths.len + 1 FROM paths INNER JOIN familytree ON paths.stop = familytree.parentID ; END IF ; END WHILE ; SELECT start , stop , len FROM paths ORDER BY start , stop ; END ; go DELIMITER ; CALL ListAdjacencyPathsOfNode( 1 , 'DOWN ') ;
+-------+------+------+ | start | stop | len |
+-------+------+------+ | 1 | 2 | 1 | | 1 | 3 | 1 | | 1 | 4 | 2 | | 1 | 5 | 2 | | 1 | 6 | 2 | | 1 | 7 | 2 | | 1 | 8 | 2 | | 1 | 9 | 2 | | 1 | 10 | 2 | | 1 | 11 | 2 | | 1 | 12 | 3 | | 1 | 13 | 3 | | 1 | 14 | 3 | | 1 | 15 | 3 | | 1 | 16 | 3 | | 1 | 17 | 3 | | 1 | 18 | 3 | | 1 | 19 | 4 | | 1 | 20 | 4 | | 1 | 21 | 4 | | 1 | 22 | 4 | | 1 | 23 | 5 | +-------+------+------+
With CTEs , path queries are far simpler , and they run much faster , e.g. , find an individual ’s ancestors :
Listing 8 b : List an individual 's ancestors ( path to root ) : WITH RECURSIVE ctepath AS ( SELECT parentID FROM familytree WHERE childID=23 -- INDIVIDUAL’S FATHER UNION ALL SELECT f.parentID FROM familytree f -- AND THAT INDIVIDUAL’S FATHER ETC JOIN ctepath ON f.childID=ctepath.parentID
) SELECT Group_Concat( parentID )
As AncestorsOf23 FROM ctepath ; -- RETURNS 19,12,6,2,1
These algorithms do n't bend the brain .
They perform acceptably with large trees , faster with CTEs .
Querying edge - adjacency lists for subtrees and paths is less daunting than their reputation suggests .
Automate tree drawing !
Tables of numbers may be the most boring objects on earth .
How to bring them alive ?
The Google Visualization API library has an ‘ OrgChart ’ module that can make edge list trees look like Fig 2 , but each instance needs fifty or so lines of specific JavaScript code , plus an additional line of code for each row of data in the tree .
Could we autogenerate that code ?
Mais oui !
The module needs child node and parent node columns of data , and accepts an optional third column for info that pops up when the mouse hovers .
Here is such a query for the Shakespeare family tree ...
Listing 9a select concat ( node . ID , ' ' , node.name ) as node , if ( edges.parentID is null , '' , concat ( parent .
ID , ' ' , parent.name ) ) as parent , if ( node . born is null , ' Birthdate unknown ' , concat ( ' Born ' , node. born ) ) as tooltip from family as node left join familytree as edges on node .
ID=edges.childID left join family as parent on edges.parentID=parent.ID ;
and here is a PHP function to generate HTML and JavaScript that paints an OrgChart for any tree query returning string columns for node , parent and optionally tooltips :
Listing 9b function orgchart ( $ conn , $ qry ) { $ cols = array ( ) ; $ rows = array ( ) ; $res = mysqli_query ( $ conn , $ qry ) or exit ( mysqli_error ( $ conn ) ) ; $ colcount = mysqli_num_fields ( $res ) ; if ( $ colcount < 2 ) exit ( " Org chart needs two or three columns " ) ; $ rowcount = mysqli_num_rows ( $ res ) ; for ( $ i=0 ; $ i<$colcount ; $ i++ ) $ cols [ ] = mysqli_fetch_field ( $res , $ i ) ; while ( $ row = mysqli_fetch_row ( $res ) ) $ rows [ ] = $ row ; echo " < html >

Nested sets model of a tree
Imagine an oval drawn round every leaf and every subtree in Fig 2 , and a final oval round the entire tree .
The tree is a set .
Each subtree is a subset .
That 's the basic idea of the nested sets model .
The advantage of the nested sets model is that root , leaves , subtrees , levels , tree height , ancestors , descendants and paths can be retrieved without recursion or application language code .
The disadvantages are :
initial setup of the tree table can be difficult ,
queries for parents ( immediate superiors ) and children ( immediate subordinates ) are more complicated than with an edge list model ,
insertion , updates and deletion are extremely cumbersome since they may require updates to much of the tree .
The nested sets model depends on using a modified preorder tree traversal ( MPTT ) depth - first algorithm to assign each node left and right integers which define the node 's tree position .
All nodes of a subtree have
left values greater than the subtree parent 's left value , and
right values smaller than that of the subtree parent 's right value .
so queries for subtrees are dead simple .
If the numbering scheme is integer - sequential as in Fig 3 , the root node receives a left value of 1 and a right value equal to twice the item count .
To see how to code nested sets using MPTT , trace the ascending integers in Fig 3 , starting with 1 on the left side of the root node ( Richard Shakespeare ) .
Following edges downward and leftward , the left side of each box gets the next integer .
When you reach a leaf ( Joan , left= 3 ) , the right side of that box gets the next integer ( 4 ) .
If there is another node to the right on the same level , continue in that direction ; otherwise continue up the right side of the subtree you just descended .
When you arrive back at the root on the right side , you 're done .
Down , right and up .
A serious problem with this scheme jumps out right away : after you 've written the Fig 3 tree to a table , what if historians discover an older brother or sister of Henry and John ?
Every row in the tree table must be updated !
Celko and others have proposed alternative numbering schemes to get round this problem , but the logical difficulty remains : inserts and updates can invalidate many or all rows , and no SQL CHECK or CONSTRAINT can prevent it .
The nested sets model is not good for trees which require frequent updates , and is pretty much unsupportable for large updatable trees that will be accessed by many concurrent users .
But as we 'll see in a moment , it can be very useful indeed for reporting a tree .
How to build a nested sets representation from an edge list
Obviously , numbering a tree by hand would be error - prone , seriously impractical for large trees , so it 's usually best to code the tree initially as an edge list , then use a stored procedure to translate the edge list representation to nested sets .
Celko 's depth - first pushdown stack method will translate any edge list tree into a nested sets tree , though slowly :
Create a table nestedsettree for the tree : node , leftedge , rightedge , and a stack pointer ( top ) , Seed that table with the root node of the edge list tree , Set a nextedge counter to 1 plus the left value of the root node , i.e.
2 , While that counter is less than the rightedge value of the root node ... insert a row for this parent 's smallest unwritten child , and drop down a level , or
if we 're out of children , increment rightedge , write it to the current row , and back up a level .
This version has been improved to handle edge list trees with or without a row containing the root node and its NULL parent :
Listing 10 DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS EdgeListToNestedSet ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE EdgeListToNestedSet ( edgeTable CHAR ( 64 ) , idCol CHAR ( 64 ) , parentCol CHAR ( 64 ) ) BEGIN DECLARE maxrightedge , rows SMALLINT DEFAULT 0 ; DECLARE trees , current SMALLINT DEFAULT 1 ; DECLARE nextedge SMALLINT DEFAULT 2 ; DECLARE msg CHAR ( 128 ) ; -- create working tree table as a copy of edgeTable DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS tree ; CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tree ( childID INT , parentID INT ) ; SET @sql = CONCAT ( 'INSERT INTO tree SELECT ' , idCol , ' , ' , parentCol , ' FROM ' , edgeTable ) ; PREPARE stmt FROM @sql ; EXECUTE stmt ; DROP PREPARE stmt ; -- initialise result table DROP TABLE IF EXISTS nestedsettree ; CREATE TABLE nestedsettree ( top SMALLINT , nodeID SMALLINT , leftedge SMALLINT , rightedge SMALLINT , KEY ( nodeID, leftedge , rightedge ) ) ENGINE=HEAP ; -- root is child with NULL parent or parent which is not a child SET @nulls = ( SELECT Count (*) FROM tree WHERE parentID IS NULL ) ; IF @nulls >

Verify the function with a query that generates an edge list tree from a nested sets tree :
Listing 10a : SELECT a.nodeID , b.nodeID AS parent FROM nestedsettree AS a LEFT JOIN nestedsettree AS b ON b.leftedge = ( SELECT MAX ( leftedge ) FROM nestedsettree AS t WHERE a.leftedge > t.leftedge AND a.leftedge < t.rightedge ) ORDER BY a.nodeID ;
For how to keep multiple trees in one table , see “ Multiple trees in one table ” on our Common Queries page .
Finding a node 's parent and children
In an edge list , the parent of a node is the row 's parentID , and its children are the rows where that nodeID is parentID .
What could be simpler ?
In comparison , nested sets queries for parents and their children are tortuous and slow .
One way to fetch the child nodes of a given node is to INNER JOIN the nested sets tree table AS parent to itself AS child ON child .
leftedge BETWEEN parent.
leftedge AND parent.rightedge , then scope on the target row's leftedge and rightedge values .
In the resulting list , child.nodeID values one level down occur once and are children , grandkids are two levels down and occur twice , and so on :
Listing 11 SELECT PersonName(child.nodeID ) AS ' Descendants of William ' , COUNT (*)
AS Generation FROM nestedsettree AS parent JOIN nestedsettree AS child ON child .
leftedge BETWEEN parent.leftedge AND parent.rightedge WHERE parent.leftedge >
7 AND parent.rightedge < 24 -- William ’s leftedge , rightedge GROUP BY child .
nodeID ; +------------------------+------------+ | Descendants of William | Generation | +------------------------+------------+
| Susana Shakespeare | 1 | | Hamnet Shakespeare | 1 | | Judith Shakespeare | 1 | | Elizabeth Hall | 2 | | Shakespeare Quiney | 2 | | Richard Quiney | 2 | | Thomas Quiney | 2 | | John Bernard | 3 | +------------------------+------------+
Therefore HAVING COUNT ( t2.nodeID ) =1 scopes listed descendants to the children :
Listing 11a SELECT PersonName(child.nodeID ) AS ' Children of William ' FROM nestedsettree AS parent JOIN nestedsettree AS child ON child .
leftedge BETWEEN parent.leftedge AND parent.rightedge WHERE parent.leftedge >

Retrieving a subtree or a subset of parents requires yet another join :
Listing 11 b SELECT Parent , Group_Concat( Child ORDER BY Child ) AS Children FROM ( SELECT master.nodeID AS Parent , child.nodeID AS
Child FROM nestedsettree AS master JOIN nestedsettree AS parent JOIN nestedsettree AS child ON child .
leftedge BETWEEN parent.leftedge AND parent.rightedge WHERE parent.leftedge > master .
leftedge AND parent.rightedge < master.rightedge GROUP BY master.nodeID , child.nodeID HAVING COUNT (*) =1 ) AS tmp WHERE parent in ( 6,8,12,14 ) GROUP BY Parent ; +--------+-------------------+ | Parent | Children | +--------+-------------------+ | 6 | 12,13,14 | | 8 | 15,16,17,18 | | 12 | 19 | | 14 | 20,21,22 | +--------+-------------------+
This takes hundreds of times longer than a query for the same info from an edge list !
An aggregating version of Listing 19 is easier to write , but is an even worse performer :
Listing 11c SELECT p.nodeID AS Parent , Group_Concat( c.nodeID ) AS Children FROM nestedsettree AS p JOIN nestedsettree AS c ON p.leftedge = ( SELECT MAX (s.leftedge ) FROM nestedsettree AS s WHERE c.leftedge > s.leftedge AND c.leftedge < s.rightedge ) GROUP BY Parent ; +--------+-------------------+ | Parent | Children | +--------+-------------------+ | 1 | 2,3 | | 2 | 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,4 | | 6 | 12,13,14 | | 8 | 15,16,17,18 | | 12 | 19 | | 14 | 20,21,22 | | 19 | 23 | +--------+-------------------+
Logic that is reciprocal to that of Listing 11a gets us the parent of a node :
retrieve its leftedge and rightedge values , compute its level , find the node which is one level up and has edge values outside the node 's leftedge and rightedge values .
Listing 12 DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS ShowNestedSetParent ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE ShowNestedSetParent ( node SMALLINT ) BEGIN DECLARE level , thisleft , thisright SMALLINT DEFAULT 0 ; -- find node edges SELECT leftedge , rightedge INTO thisleft , thisright FROM nestedsettree WHERE nodeID = node ; -- find node level SELECT COUNT ( n1.nodeid ) INTO level FROM nestedsettree AS n1 INNER JOIN nestedsettree AS n2 ON n2.
leftedge BETWEEN n1.leftedge AND n1.rightedge WHERE n2.nodeid = node GROUP BY n2.nodeid ; -- find parent SELECT PersonName ( n2.nodeid ) AS Parent FROM nestedsettree AS n1 INNER JOIN nestedsettree AS n2 ON n2.
leftedge BETWEEN n1.leftedge AND n1.rightedge WHERE n2.leftedge < thisleft AND n2.rightedge > thisright GROUP BY n2.nodeid HAVING COUNT ( n1.nodeid ) =level -1 ; END ; go DELIMITER ; CALL ShowNestedSetParent(6 ) ; +-------------------+ | Parent | +-------------------+ | Henry Shakespeare | +-------------------+
Other queries
For some query problems , edge list and nested sets queries are equivalently simple .
For example to find the tree root and leaves , compare Listing 6 with :
Listing 13 SELECT name AS Paterfamilias , IFNULL ( born , '? ') AS Born , IFNULL ( died , ' ? ' )
AS Died FROM nestedsettree AS t INNER JOIN family AS f ON t.nodeID=f.ID WHERE leftedge = 1 ; +---------------------+------+------+
| Paterfamilias | Born | Died |
+---------------------+------+------+ | Richard Shakespeare | ? | 1561 | +---------------------+------+------+
SELECT name AS ' Childless Shakespeares ' , IFNULL ( born , ' ? ' ) AS Born , IFNULL ( died , ' ? ' )
AS Died FROM nestedsettree AS t INNER JOIN family AS f ON t.nodeID=f.ID WHERE rightedge = leftedge +
1 ; +------------------------+------+------+ | Childless Shakespeares | Born | Died |
+------------------------+------+------+ | Joan Shakespeare | 1558 | ? | | Margaret Shakespeare | 1562 | 1563 | | John Bernard | ? | 1674 | | Hamnet Shakespeare | 1585 | 1596 | | Shakespeare Quiney | 1616 | 1617 | | Richard Quiney | 1618 | 1639 | | Thomas Quiney | 1620 | 1639 | | Gilbert Shakespeare | 1566 | 1612 | | William Hart | 1600 | 1639 | | Mary Hart | 1603 | 1607 | | Thomas Hart | 1605 | 1670 | | Michael Hart | 1608 | 1618 | | Anne Shakespeare | 1571 | 1579 | | Richard Shakespeare | 1574 | 1613 | | Edmond Shakespeare | 1580 | 1607 | | John Shakespeare | 1530 | 1601 | +------------------------+------+------+
Finding subtrees in a nested sets model requires no twisted code , no stored procedure .
To retrieve the nestedsettree nodes in William 's subtree , just ask for nodes whose leftedge values are greater , and whose rightedge values are smaller than William's :
Listing 14 SELECT PersonName(t.nodeID ) AS Descendant FROM nestedsettree AS s JOIN nestedsettree AS t ON s.leftedge < t.leftedge AND s.rightedge > t.rightedge JOIN family f ON s.nodeID = f.ID WHERE f.name = ' William Shakespeare ' ;
Finding a single path in the nested sets model is about as complicated as edge list path enumeration ( Listings 8 , 9 ) :
Listing 15 SELECT t2.nodeID AS Node , PersonName ( t2.nodeID ) AS Person , ( SELECT COUNT (*) FROM nestedsettree AS t4 WHERE t4.leftedge BETWEEN t1.leftedge AND t1.rightedge AND t2.leftedge BETWEEN t4.leftedge AND t4.rightedge ) AS Path FROM nestedsettree AS t1 INNER JOIN nestedsettree AS t2 ON t2.leftedge BETWEEN t1.leftedge AND t1.rightedge INNER JOIN nestedsettree AS t3 ON t3.leftedge BETWEEN t2.leftedge AND t2.rightedge WHERE t1.nodeID=( SELECT
ID FROM family WHERE name= ' William Shakespeare ' )
AND t3.nodeID=( SELECT
ID FROM family WHERE name= ' John Bernard ' ) ; +------+---------------------+------+ |
Node | Person | Path |
+------+---------------------+------+ | 6 | William Shakespeare | 1 | | 12 | Susana Shakespeare | 2 | | 19 | Elizabeth Hall | 3 | | 23 | John Bernard | 4 | +------+---------------------+------+
Displaying the tree
Here the nested sets model shines .
The arithmetic that was used to build the tree makes short work of summary queries .
For example to retrieve a node list which preserves all parent - child relations , we need just two facts :
listing order is the order taken in the node walk that created the tree , i.e. leftedge ,
a node 's indentation depth is simply the JOIN ( edge ) count from root to node :
Listing 16 SELECT CONCAT ( SPACE ( 2*COUNT ( parent.nodeid ) - 2 ) , PersonName( child.nodeid ) ) AS ' The Shakespeare Family Tree ' FROM nestedsettree AS parent INNER JOIN nestedsettree AS child ON child .
leftedge BETWEEN parent.leftedge AND parent.rightedge GROUP BY child .
nodeid ORDER BY child .
leftedge ; +-----------------------------+ |
The Shakespeare Family Tree | +-----------------------------+ | Richard Shakespeare | | Henry Shakespeare | | Joan Shakespeare | | Margaret Shakespeare | | William Shakespeare | | Susana Shakespeare | | Elizabeth Hall | | John Bernard | | Hamnet Shakespeare | | Judith Shakespeare | | Shakespeare Quiney | | Richard Quiney | | Thomas Quiney | | Gilbert Shakespeare | | Joan Shakespeare | | William Hart | | Mary Hart | | Thomas Hart | | Michael Hart | | Anne Shakespeare | | Richard Shakespeare | | Edmond Shakespeare | | John Shakespeare | +-----------------------------+
To retrieve only a subtree , add a query clause which restricts nodes to those whose edges are within the range of the parent node 's left and right edge values , for example for William and his descendants ...
WHERE parent.leftedge >= 7 AND parent.rightedge <=24
Node insertions , updates and deletions
Nested sets arithmetic also helps with insertions , updates and deletions , but the problem remains that changing just one node can require changing much of the tree .
Inserting a node in the tree requires at least two pieces of information : the nodeID to insert , and the nodeID of its parent .
The model is normalised so the nodeID first must have been added to the parent ( family ) table .
The algorithm for adding the node to the tree is :
increment leftedge by 2 in nodes where the rightedge value is greater than the parent 's rightedge , increment rightedge by 2 in nodes where the leftedge value is greater than the parent 's leftedge , insert a row with the given nodeID , leftedge = 1 + parent 's leftedge , rightedge = 2 + parent 's leftedge .
That 's not difficult , but all rows will have to be updated !
Listing 17 DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS InsertNestedSetNode ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE InsertNestedSetNode ( IN node SMALLINT , IN parent SMALLINT ) BEGIN DECLARE parentleft , parentright SMALLINT DEFAULT 0 ; SELECT leftedge , rightedge INTO parentleft , parentright FROM nestedsettree WHERE nodeID = parent ; IF FOUND_ROWS ( ) = 1 THEN BEGIN UPDATE nestedsettree SET rightedge = rightedge + 2 WHERE rightedge > parentleft ; UPDATE nestedsettree SET leftedge = leftedge + 2 WHERE leftedge > parentleft ; INSERT INTO nestedsettree VALUES ( 0 , node , parentleft + 1 , parentleft + 2 ) ; END ; END IF ; END ; go DELIMITER ;
" Sibline " or horizontal order is obviously significant in family trees , but may not be significant in other trees .
Listing 17 adds the new node at the left edge of the sibline .
To specify another position , modify the procedure to accept a third parameter for the nodeID which is to be to the left or right of the insertion point .
Updating a node in place requires nothing more than editing nodeID to point at a different parent row .
Deleting a node raises the problem of how to repair links severed by the deletion .
In tree models of parts explosions , the item to be deleted is often replaced by a new item , so it can be treated like a simple node update .
In organisational boss - employee charts , though , does a colleague move over , does a subordinate get promoted , does everybody in the subtree move up a level , or does something else happen ?
No formula can catch all the possibilities .
Listing 18 illustrates how to handle two common scenarios , move everyone up , and move someone over .
All possibilities except simple node replacement of require changes elsewhere in the tree .
Listing 18 DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS DeleteNestedSetNode ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE DeleteNestedSetNode ( IN mode CHAR ( 7 ) , IN node SMALLINT ) BEGIN DECLARE thisleft , thisright SMALLINT DEFAULT 0 ; SELECT leftedge , rightedge INTO thisleft , thisright FROM nestedsettree WHERE nodeID = node ; IF mode = ' PROMOTE ' THEN BEGIN -- Ian Holsman found these two bugs DELETE FROM nestedsettree WHERE nodeID = node ; UPDATE nestedsettree SET leftedge = leftedge - 1 , rightedge = rightedge - 1 -- rather than = thisleft WHERE leftedge BETWEEN thisleft AND thisright ; UPDATE nestedsettree SET rightedge = rightedge - 2 WHERE rightedge > thisright ; UPDATE nestedsettree SET leftedge = leftedge - 2 WHERE leftedge > thisright ; -- rather than > thisleft END ; ELSEIF mode = ' REPLACE ' THEN BEGIN UPDATE nestedsettree SET leftedge = thisleft - 1 , rightedge = thisright WHERE leftedge = thisleft +
1 ; UPDATE nestedsettree SET rightedge = rightedge - 2 WHERE rightedge > thisleft ; UPDATE nestedsettree SET leftedge = leftedge - 2 WHERE leftedge > thisleft ; DELETE FROM nestedsettree WHERE nodeID = node ; END ; END IF ; END ; go DELIMITER ;
Nested set model summary
Some nested sets queries are quicker than their edge list counterparts .
Some are slower .
None are faster than edge list queries using recursive CTEs .
Given the concurrency nightmare that nested sets impose for inserts and deletions , it is reasonable to reserve the nested sets model for fairly static trees whose users are mostly interested in querying subtrees .
If you will be using the nested sets model , you may be converting back and forth with edge list models , so here is a simple query to build an edge list from a nested sets tree :
Listing 19 SELECT p.nodeID AS parentID , c.nodeID AS childID FROM nestedsettree AS p INNER JOIN nestedsettree AS c ON p.leftedge = ( SELECT MAX (s.leftedge ) FROM nestedsettree AS s WHERE c.leftedge > s.leftedge AND c.leftedge < s.rightedge )
ORDER BY p.nodeID ;
Edge list model of a non -tree graph
Many graphs are not trees .
Imagine a small airline which has just acquired licences for flights no longer than 6,000 km between Los Angeles ( LAX ) , New York ( JFK ) , Heathrow in London , Charles de Gaulle in Paris , Amsterdam - Schiphol , Arlanda in Sweden , and Helsinki - Vantaa .
You have been asked to compute the shortest possible one - way routes that do not deviate more than 90° from the direction of the first hop — roughly , one - way routes and no circuits .
Airports are nodes , flights are edges , routes are paths .
We will need three tables .
Airports ( nodes )
To identify an airport we need its code , location name , latitude and longitude .
Latitude and longitude are usually given as degrees , minutes and seconds , north or south of the equator , east or west of Greenwich .
To hide details that are n't directly relevant to nodes and edges , code latitude and longitude as simple reals where longitudes west of Greenwich and latitudes south of the equator are negative , whilst longitudes east of Greenwich and latitudes north of the equator are positive :
Listing 20 CREATE TABLE airports ( code char ( 3 ) NOT NULL , city char( 100 ) default NULL , latitude float NOT NULL , longitude float NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( code ) ) ; INSERT INTO airports VALUES ( ' JFK ' , ' New York , NY ' , 40.75 , - 73.97 ) ; INSERT INTO airports VALUES ( ' LAX ' , ' Los Angeles , CA ' , 34.05 , - 118.22 ) ; INSERT INTO airports VALUES ( ' LHR ' , ' London , England ' , 51.5 , - 0.45 ) ; INSERT INTO airports VALUES ( ' HEL ' , ' Helsinki , Finland ' , 60.17 , 24.97 ) ; INSERT INTO airports VALUES ( ' CDG ' , ' Paris , France ' , 48.86 , 2.33 ) ; INSERT INTO airports VALUES ( ' STL ' , ' St Louis , MO ' , 38.63 , - 90.2 ) ; INSERT INTO airports VALUES ( ' ARN ' , ' Stockholm , Sweden ' , 59.33 , 18.05 ) ;
Flights ( edges )
The model attaches two weights to flights : distance and direction .
We need a method of calculating the Great Circle Distance — the geographical distance between any two cities - another natural job for a stored function .
The distance calculation
converts to radians the degree coordinates of any two points on the earth 's surface ,
calculates the angle of the arc subtended by the two points , and
converts the result , also in radians , to surface ( circumferential ) kilometres ( 1 radian=6,378.388 km ) .
Listing 21 SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators=TRUE
; -- since 5.0.16 DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS GeoDistKM ; DELIMITER go CREATE FUNCTION GeoDistKM ( lat1 FLOAT , lon1 FLOAT , lat2 FLOAT , lon2 FLOAT ) RETURNS float BEGIN DECLARE pi , q1 , q2 , q3 FLOAT ; SET pi = PI ( ) ; SET lat1 = lat1 * pi / 180 ; SET lon1 = lon1 * pi / 180 ; SET lat2 = lat2 * pi / 180 ; SET lon2 = lon2 * pi / 180 ; SET q1 = COS ( lon1-lon2 ) ; SET q2 = COS ( lat1 - lat2 ) ; SET q3 = COS ( lat1+lat2 ) ; SET rads = ACOS ( 0.5*(( 1.0+q1 ) * q2 - ( 1.0 -q1 ) *q3 ) ) ; RETURN 6378.388 * rads ; END ; go DELIMITER ;
That takes care of flight distances .
Flight direction is , approximately , the arctangent ( ATAN ) of the difference between flights .
depart and flights .
arrive latitudes and longitudes .
Now we can seed the airline 's flights table with one - hop flights up to 6,000 km long :
Listing 22 CREATE TABLE flights ( id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT , depart CHAR ( 3 ) , arrive CHAR ( 3 ) , distance DECIMAL ( 10,2 ) , direction DECIMAL ( 10,2 ) ) ; INSERT INTO flights SELECT NULL , depart.code , arrive.code , ROUND ( GeoDistKM(depart.latitude ,depart.longitude,arrive.latitude,arrive.longitude ) ,2 ) , ROUND ( DEGREES( ATAN( arrive.latitude-depart.latitude,arrive.longitude-depart.longitude ) ) ,2 ) FROM airports AS depart INNER JOIN airports AS arrive ON depart.code <> arrive.code HAVING Km <= 6000 ; SELECT * FROM flights ;
+----+--------+--------+----------+-----------+ | id | depart | arrive | distance | direction |
+----+--------+--------+----------+-----------+ | 1 | LAX | JFK | 3941.18 | 8.61 | | 2 | LHR | JFK | 5550.77 | - 171.68 | | 3 | CDG | JFK | 5837.46 | - 173.93 | | 4 | STL | JFK | 1408.11 | 7.44 | | 5 | JFK | LAX | 3941.18 | - 171.39 | | 6 | STL | LAX | 2553.37 | - 170.72 | | 7 | JFK | LHR | 5550.77 | 8.32 | | 8 | HEL | LHR | 1841.91 | - 161.17 | | 9 | CDG | LHR | 354.41 | 136.48 | | 10 | ARN | LHR | 1450.12 | - 157.06 | | 11 | LHR | HEL | 1841.91 | 18.83 | | 12 | CDG | HEL | 1912.96 | 26.54 | | 13 | ARN | HEL | 398.99 | 6.92 | | 14 | JFK | CDG | 5837.46 | 6.07 | | 15 | LHR | CDG | 354.41 | - 43.52 | | 16 | HEL | CDG | 1912.96 | - 153.46 | | 17 | ARN | CDG | 1545.23 | - 146.34 | | 18 | JFK | STL | 1408.11 | - 172.56 | | 19 | LAX | STL | 2553.37 | 9.28 | | 20 | LHR | ARN | 1450.12 | 22.94 | | 21 | HEL | ARN | 398.99 | - 173.08 | | 22 | CDG | ARN | 1545.23 | 33.66 | +----+--------+--------+----------+-----------+
The distances agree approximately with public information sources for flight lengths .
For a pair of airports A and B not very near the poles , the error in calculating direction using ATAN ( ) , is small .
To remove that error , instead of ATAN ( ) use a formula from spherical trigonometry ( for example one of the formulas at http://www.dynagen.co.za/eugene/where/formula.html).
Routes ( paths )
A route is a path along one or more of these edges , so flights : routes is a 1 : many relationship .
For simplicity it 's efficient to denormalise representation of routes with a variation of the materialised path model to store all the hops of one route as a list of flights in one routes column .
The column routes .route is the sequence of airports , from first departure to final arrival , the column routes .hops is the number of hops in that route , and the column routes .
direction is the direction :
Listing 23 CREATE TABLE routes ( id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT , depart CHAR ( 3 ) , arrive CHAR ( 3 ) , hops SMALLINT , route CHAR ( 50 ) , distance DECIMAL ( 10,2 ) , direction DECIMAL ( 10,2 ) ) ;
Starting with an empty routes table , how do we populate it with the shortest routes between all ordered pairs of airports ?
Insert all 1 - hop flights from the flights table .
Add in the set of shortest multi- hop routes for all pairs of airports which do n't have rows in the flights table .
For 1 - hop flights we just write
Listing 24 INSERT INTO routes SELECT NULL , depart , arrive , 1 , CONCAT ( depart , ' , ' , arrive ) , distance , direction FROM flights ;
NULL being the placeholder for the auto - incrementing id column .
For multi- hop routes , we iteratively add in sets of all allowed 2 - hop , 3 - hop , ... n- hop routes , replacing longer routes by shorter routes as we find them , until there is nothing more to add or replace .
That also breaks down to two logical steps : add hops to build the set of next allowed routes , and update longer routes with shorter ones .
Next allowed routes
The set of next allowed routes is the set of shortest routes that can be built by adding , to existing routes , flights that leave from the last arrival airport of an existing route , arrive at an airport not yet in the given route , and stay within ± 90° of the route 's initial compass direction .
So every new route is a JOIN between routes and flights in which
depart = routes .
depart ,
arrive = flights .arrive ,
flights .
depart = routes.arrive ,
distance = MIN( routes.distance + flights.distance ) ,
LOCATE ( flights.arrive,routes.route ) = 0 ,
flights.direction+360 > routes.direction+270 AND flights.direction+360 < routes.direction+450
This looks like a natural logical unit of work for a View :
Listing 25 CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW nextroutes AS SELECT routes .depart , flights.arrive , routes.hops+1 AS hops , CONCAT ( routes.route , ' , ' , flights.arrive ) AS route , MIN ( routes.distance + flights.distance )
AS distance , routes .
direction FROM routes JOIN flights ON routes . arrive = flights .depart AND LOCATE( flights.arrive,routes.route ) = 0 WHERE flights.direction BETWEEN routes.direction-90 AND routes.direction+90 GROUP
BY depart , arrive ;
How to add these new hops to routes ?
In standard SQL , this variant on a query by Scott Stephens should do it ...
Listing 26 INSERT INTO routes SELECT NULL , depart , arrive , hops , route , distance , direction FROM nextroutes WHERE ( nextroutes.depart , nextroutes.arrive ) NOT IN ( SELECT depart , arrive FROM routes ) ;
but MySQL does not yet support update table subqueries .
No worries , rewriting the subquery as a join speeds it up :
Listing 27 INSERT INTO routes SELECT NULL , nextroutes .
depart , nextroutes.arrive , nextroutes.hops , nextroutes.route , nextroutes .
distance , nextroutes .
direction FROM nextroutes LEFT JOIN routes ON nextroutes .
depart = routes .
depart AND nextroutes.arrive = routes.arrive WHERE routes.depart IS NULL AND routes.arrive IS NULL ;
Running that code right after the initial seeding from flights gives ...
SELECT * FROM routes ; +----+--------+--------+------+-------------+----------+-----------+ | id | depart | arrive | hops | route | distance | direction |

... adding 12 two - hop rows .
Replace longer routes with shorter ones
As we build routes with more hops , it is logically possible that the nextroutes view will find shorter routes for an existing routes pair of depart and arrive .
Standard SQL for replacing existing routes rows with nextroutes rows that match ( depart , arrive ) and have shorter distance values would be ...
Listing 28 UPDATE routes SET ( hops , route , distance , direction ) = ( SELECT hops , route , distance , direction FROM nextroutes WHERE nextroutes .
depart = routes .depart AND nextroutes.arrive = routes.arrive ) WHERE ( depart , arrive ) IN ( SELECT depart , arrive FROM nextroutes WHERE nextroutes.distance < routes.distance ) ;
... but MySQL does not support SET ( col1 , ... ) syntax , and as with Listing 7 , MySQL does not yet accept subqueries referencing the table being updated , so we have to write more literal SQL :
Listing 29 UPDATE routes , nextroutes SET routes.hops=nextroutes.hops , routes.route=nextroutes.route , routes.distance=nextroutes.distance , routes.direction=nextroutes.direction
WHERE routes.arrive=nextroutes.arrive AND routes.depart=nextroutes.depart AND nextroutes.distance < routes .distance ;
Running this code right after the first run of Listing 27 updates no rows .
To test the logic of iteration , continue running Listings 27 and 29 until no rows are being added or changed .

All that 's left to do is to assemble the code in a stored procedure :
Listing 30 DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS BuildRoutes ; DELIMITER go CREATE PROCEDURE BuildRoutes ( ) BEGIN DECLARE rows INT DEFAULT 0 ; TRUNCATE routes ; -- STEP 1 , LISTING 24 : SEED ROUTES WITH 1 - HOP FLIGHTS INSERT INTO routes ( depart , arrive , hops , route , distance , direction ) SELECT depart , arrive , 1 , CONCAT ( depart , ' , ' , arrive ) , distance , direction FROM flights ; SET rows = ROW_COUNT ( ) ; WHILE ( rows > 0 ) DO -- STEP 2 , LISTINGS 25 , 27 : ADD NEXT SET OF ROUTES INSERT INTO routes ( depart , arrive , hops , route , distance , direction ) SELECT nextroutes .
depart , nextroutes.arrive , nextroutes.hops , nextroutes.route , nextroutes .
distance , nextroutes .
direction FROM nextroutes LEFT JOIN routes ON nextroutes.depart=routes.depart AND nextroutes.arrive=routes.arrive WHERE routes .ID IS NULL ; SET rows = ROW_COUNT ( ) ; -- STEP 3 , UPDATE SHORTER ROUTES IF ANY UPDATE routes JOIN nextroutes USING ( arrive , depart ) SET routes.hops=nextroutes.hops , routes.route=nextroutes.route , routes.distance=nextroutes.distance , routes.direction=nextroutes.direction
WHERE nextroutes .distance < routes .distance ; END WHILE ; END ; go DELIMITER ;
The procedure looks like a candidate for translation a CTE , but the update command and the two joins to the table being written to ( one in the nextroutes View , one in the insert loop ) defeat the CTE engines in both MariaDB and PostgreSQL .
Route queries
Route queries are straightforward .
How do we check that the algorithm produced no duplicate depart - arrive pairs ?
The following query should yield zero rows ...
Listing 31 SELECT depart , arrive , COUNT (*) FROM routes GROUP BY depart , arrive HAVING COUNT (*) >
1 ;
... and does .
Reachability queries are just as simple , for example where can we fly to from Helsinki ?
Listing 32 SELECT * FROM routes WHERE depart= ' HEL ' ORDER BY distance ; +----+--------+--------+------+-----------------+----------+-----------+ | id | depart | arrive | hops | route | distance | direction |
+----+--------+--------+------+-----------------+----------+-----------+

An extended edge list model is simple to implement , gracefully accepts extended attributes for nodes , edge and paths , does not unduly penalise updates , and responds to queries with reasonable speed .
Parts explosions
A bill of materials for a house would include the cement block , lumber , shingles , doors , wallboard , windows , plumbing , electrical system , heating system , and so on .
Each subassembly also has a bill of materials ; the heating system has a furnace , ducts , and so on .
A bill of materials implosion links component pieces to a major assembly .
A bill of materials explosion breaks apart assemblies and subassemblies into their component parts .
Which graph model best handles a parts explosion ?
Combining edge list and " nested sets " algorithms seems a natural solution .
Imagine a new company that plans to make variously sized bookcases , either packaged as do - it - yourself kits of , or assembled from sides , shelves , shelf brackets , backboards , feet and screws .
Shelves and sides are cut from planks .
Backboards are trimmed from laminated sheeting .
Feet are machine - carved from readycut blocks .
Screws and shelf brackets are purchased in bulk .
Here are the elements of one bookcase ...
1 backboard , 2 x 1 m 1 laminate 8 screws 2 sides 2 m x 30 cm 1 plank length 4 m 12 screws 8 shelves 1 m x 30 cm ( incl. top and bottom ) 2 planks 24 shelf brackets 4 feet 4 cm x 4 cm 4 cubes 16 screws
... which may be packaged in a box for sale at one price , or assembled as a finished product at a different price .
At any time we need to be able to answer questions like
Do we have enough parts to make the bookcases on order ?
What assemblies or packages would be most profitable to make given the current inventory ?
There is no reason to break the normalising rule that item detail belongs in a nodes table , and graph logic belongs in an edges table .
Edges also require a quantity attribute , for example a shelf includes four shelf brackets .
Nodes and edges may also have costs and prices :
item purchase cost ,
item assembly cost ,
assembly cost ,
assembly selling price .
In many parts problems like this one , items occur in multiple assemblies and subassemblies .
The graph is not a tree .
Also , it is often desirable to model multiple graphs without the table glut that would arise from giving each graph its own edges table .
A simple way to solve this problem is to represent multiple graphs ( assemblies ) in the edges table by giving every row not only childID and parentID pointers , but a pointer which identifies the root itemID of the graph to which the row belongs .
So the data model is just two tables , for items ( nodes and for product graphs or assemblies ( edges ) .
Assume that the company begins with a plan to sell the 2 m x 1 m bookcase in two forms , assembled and kit , and that the purchasing department has bought quantities of raw materials ( laminate , planks , shelf supports , screws , wood cubes , boxes ) .
Here are the nodes ( items ) and edges ( assemblies ) :
Listing 33 CREATE TABLE items ( itemID INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT , name CHAR ( 20 ) NOT NULL , onhand INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 , reserved INT NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 , purchasecost DECIMAL ( 10,2 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 , assemblycost DECIMAL ( 10,2 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 , price DECIMAL ( 10,2 ) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0 ) ; CREATE TABLE assemblies ( assemblyID INT NOT NULL , assemblyroot INT NOT NULL , childID INT NOT NULL , parentID INT NOT NULL , quantity DECIMAL ( 10,2 ) NOT NULL , assemblycost DECIMAL ( 10,2 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY( assemblyID , childID , parentID ) ) ; INSERT INTO items VALUES -- inventory ( 1 , 'laminate ' , 40,0,4,0,8 ) , ( 2 , 'screw ',1000,0,0.1,0,.2 ) , ( 3 , ' plank ' , 200,0,10,0,20 ) , ( 4 , 'shelf bracket ',400,0,0.20,0,.4 ) , ( 5 , 'wood cube ' ,100,0,0.5,0,1 ) , ( 6 , 'box ' , 40,0, 1,0,2 ) , ( 7 , 'backboard ' , 0, 0, 0,3,0 ) , ( 8 , 'side ' , 0,0,0,8,0 ) , ( 9 , 'shelf ' , 0,0,0,4,0 ) , ( 10 , 'foot ' , 0,0,0,1,0 ) , ( 11 , 'bookcase2x30 ' , 0,0,0,10,0 ) , ( 12 , 'bookcase2x30 kit' , 0,0,0,2,0 ) ; INSERT INTO assemblies VALUES ( 1,11,1,7,1,0 ) , -- laminate to backboard ( 2,11,2,7,8,0 ) , -- screws to backboard ( 3,11,3,8, .5,0 ) , -- planks to side ( 4,11,2, 8,6,0 ) , -- screws to side ( 5,11,3,9,0.25,0 ) , -- planks to shelf ( 6,11,4,9,4,0 ) , -- shelf brackets to shelf ( 7,11,5,10,1,0 ) , -- wood cubes to foot ( 8,11,2,10,1,0 ) , -- screws to foot ( 9,11,7,11,1,0 ) , -- backboard to bookcase ( 10,11, 8,11,2,0 ) , -- sides to bookcase ( 11,11,9,11,8,0 ) , -- shelves to bookcase ( 12,11,10,11,4,0 ) , -- feet to bookcase ( 13,12, 1,7,1,0 ) , -- laminate to backboard ( 14,12,2,7,8,0 ) , -- screws to backboard ( 15,12,3,8,0.5,0 ) , -- planks to side ( 16,12,2, 8,6,0 ) , -- screws to sides ( 17,12,3,9,0.25,0 ) , -- planks to shelf ( 18,12,4,9,4,0 ) , -- shelf brackets to shelves ( 19,12,5,10,1,0 ) , -- wood cubes to foot ( 20,12,2,10,1,0 ) , -- screws to foot ( 21,12,7,12,1,0 ) , -- backboard to bookcase kit ( 22,12, 8,12,2,0 ) , -- sides to bookcase kit ( 23,12,9,12,8,0 ) , -- shelves to bookcase kit ( 24,12,10,12,4,0 ) , -- feet to bookcase kit ( 25,12,6,12,1,0 ) ; -- container box to bookcase kit
Now , we want a parts list , a bill of materials , which will list show parent - child relationships and quantities , and sum the costs .
Could we adapt the depth - first " nested sets " treewalk algorithm ( Listing 10 ) to this problem even though our graph is not a tree and our sets are not properly nested ?
Yes : touch up the treewalk to handle multiple parent nodes for any child node , and add code to percolate costs and quantities up the graph .
Navigation remains simple using leftedge and rightedge values .
This is just the sort of problem the Celko algorithm is good for : reporting !
Listing 34 CREATE PROCEDURE ShowBOM ( IN root INT ) BEGIN DECLARE thischild , thisparent , rows , maxrightedge INT DEFAULT 0 ; DECLARE thislevel , nextedgenum INT DEFAULT 1 ; DECLARE thisqty , thiscost DECIMAL ( 10,2 ) ; -- Create and seed intermediate table : DROP TABLE IF EXISTS edges ; CREATE TABLE edges ( childID smallint NOT NULL , parentID smallint NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( childID , parentID ) ) ENGINE=HEAP ; INSERT INTO edges SELECT childID , parentID FROM assemblies WHERE assemblyRoot = root ; SET maxrightedge = 2 * ( 1 + ( SELECT COUNT (*) FROM edges ) ) ; --

1 ; WHILE nextedgenum < maxrightedge DO --
How many children of this node remain in the edges table ?
SET rows = ( SELECT COUNT (*) FROM bom AS p JOIN edges AS c ON p.nodeID=c.parentID AND p.level=thislevel ) ; IF rows > 0 THEN -- Child edge exists .
Compute qty & cost , insert in bom , delete from edges .
BEGIN -- Alas MySQL nulls MIN ( t.childid ) when we combine the next two queries SET thischild = ( SELECT MIN ( c.childID ) FROM bom AS p INNER JOIN edges AS c ON p.nodeID=c.parentID AND p.level=thislevel ) ; SET thisparent = ( SELECT DISTINCT c.parentID FROM bom AS p INNER JOIN edges AS c ON p.nodeID=c.parentID AND p.level=thislevel ) ; SET thisqty = ( SELECT quantity FROM assemblies WHERE assemblyroot = root AND childID = thischild AND parentID = thisparent ) ; SET thiscost = ( SELECT thisqty * ( a.assemblycost + i.purchasecost + i.assemblycost ) FROM assemblies AS a JOIN items AS i ON a.childID = i.itemID WHERE assemblyroot = root AND a.parentID = thisparent AND a.childID = thischild ) ; INSERT INTO bom VALUES ( thislevel+1 , thischild , thisparent , thisqty , thiscost , nextedgenum , NULL ) ; DELETE FROM edges WHERE childID=thischild AND parentID=thisparent ; SET thislevel = thislevel + 1 , nextedgenum = nextedgenum + 1 ; END ; ELSE BEGIN --

1 ; END ; END IF ; END WHILE ; SET rows := ( SELECT COUNT (*) FROM edges ) ; IF rows >
0 THEN SELECT ' Orphaned rows remain ' ; ELSE BEGIN SET thiscost = ( SELECT SUM ( cost*qty ) FROM bom ) ; UPDATE bom SET qty=1 , cost=thiscost WHERE nodeID = root ; SELECT CONCAT ( Space ( Abs ( level ) * 2 ) , ItemName ( nodeid , root ) ) AS Item , ROUND ( qty,1 ) AS Qty , ROUND ( cost ,2) AS Cost FROM bom ORDER BY leftedge ; END ; END IF ; END ; go DELIMITER ; -- Function used by ShowBOM ( ) to retrieve bom item names : DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS ItemName ; SET GLOBAL log_bin_trust_function_creators=TRUE
; DELIMITER go CREATE FUNCTION ItemName ( id INT , root INT ) RETURNS CHAR ( 20 ) BEGIN DECLARE s CHAR ( 20 ) DEFAULT ''; SELECT name INTO s FROM items WHERE itemid=id ; RETURN IF ( id = root , UCASE (s ) , s ) ; END ; go DELIMITER ; CALL SHOWBOM ( 11 ) ; +---------------------+------+--------+ |
Item | Qty | Cost | +---------------------+------+--------+

With ShowBOM ( ) in hand , it 's easy to compare costs of assemblies and subassemblies .
By adding price columns , we can do the same for prices and profit margins .
And now that MySQL has re-enabled prepared statements in stored procedures , it will be relatively easy to write a more general version of ShowBOM ( ) .
We leave that to you .
Shorter and sweeter
But ShowBOM ( ) is not the small , efficient bit of nested sets reporting code we were hoping for .
There is a simpler solution : hide graph cycles from the edges table by making them references to rows in a nodes table , so we can treat the edges table like a tree ; then apply a breadth - first edge - list subtree algorithm to generate the Bill of Materials .
Again assume a cabinetmaking company making bookcases ( with a different costing model ) .
For clarity , skip inventory tracking for now .
An items table ww_nodes tracks purchased and assembled bookcase elements with their individual costs , and an assemblies / edges ww_edges table tracks sets of edges that combine to make products .
Listing 35 : DDL for a simpler parts explosion DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ww_nodes ; CREATE TABLE ww_nodes ( nodeID int , description CHAR ( 50 ) , cost decimal ( 10,2 ) ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 1 , ' finished bookcase ',10 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 2 , 'backboard2x1 ' ,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 3 , 'laminate2x1 ' ,8 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 4 , 'screw ' , .10 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 5 , 'side ' ,4 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 6 , ' plank ',20 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 7 , 'shelf ' , 4 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 8 , 'shelf bracket ' , .5 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 9 , ' feet ' , 1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 10 , 'cube4cmx4 cm ' ,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 11 , 'bookcase kit' ,2 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_nodes VALUES ( 12 , 'carton ' ,1 ) ; DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ww_edges ; CREATE TABLE ww_edges ( rootID INT , nodeID int , parentnodeID int , qty decimal ( 10,2 ) ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,1, null,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,2,1,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,3,2,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,4,2,8) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,5,1,2 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,6,5,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,4,5,12 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,7,1,8 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,6,7,.5 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,8,7,4 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,9,1,4 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,10,9,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 1,4,9,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,11 , null,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,2,11,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,3,2,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,4,2,8 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,5,11,2 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,6,5,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,4,5,12 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,7,11,8 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,6,7,.5 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,8,7,4 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,9,11,4 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,10,9,1 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,4,9,11 ) ; INSERT INTO ww_edges VALUES ( 11,12,11,1 ) ;
Here is an adaptation of the breadth - first edge list algorithm to retrieve a Bill of Materials for a product identified by a rootID :
1. Initialise a level - tracking variable to zero .
2 . Seed a temp reporting table with the rootID of the desired product .
3 . While rows are retrieved , increment level and add rows to the temp table whose parentnodeIDs are nodes at the current level .
4 . Print the BOM ordered by path with indentation proportional to tree level .

Summary
Stored procedures , stored functions and Views make it possible to implement edge list graph models , nested sets graph models , and breadth - first and depth - first graph search algorithms since MySQL 5 .
Common Table Expressions in MariaDB since version 10.2.2 , and in MySQL since version 8.0.1 , greatly improve edge list query performance . .

OSCODA , Mich . --
The Oscoda Area High School football team has n't won a game , or even scored a point , in four games this
season .
Because of that , the school district has decided to cancel
the remaining games .
Despite pleas from players and parents , the board recently upheld the school 's earlier decision to end the season , saying
players risked injury in trying to take on much stronger opponents .
" When you go to a game on Friday night and see a team
physically dominated , those are the indisputable facts , " coach
Kyle Tobin said .
" Seniors , I feel for you .
There 's nothing I can say other than
I 'm sorry , " board member Neal Sweet said .
" But you 're not
quitters .
You went out there and did your best . "
Tobin said the team was not physically competitive , had too few
players and faced a tough schedule in the North East Michigan
Conference , The Bay City Times reported .
Senior quarterback Mike Gondek pleaded with the school board to
reconsider the school 's Sept. 19 decision to cancel the remaining
games .
" All I ever wanted to do was play football , " Gondek said .
" My
teammates never felt so unsafe that we did n't want to be out
there . "
Tobin , a first - year coach , defended his decision .
" I have 28 years of coaching experience in high school and
college , and I know the difference between a team playing bad and a
team that 's unsafe , " he said .

・ 神奈川県 セフレ アプリ じゃあ、メッセージ目の女性にあるように ” 神奈川県 セフレ アプリを確認してこまめに対応することができれば ” が条件です。 と考えるともったいない男性は流行りのマッチングアプリを使うのではなく、あえてＰＣＭＡＸという手もありですね。 昔からお願いが主で実際しょっぱく、できるに醤油を組み合わせたピリ辛の探すとの組み合わせは監視以来変わっていないそうです。
逆にある実績は、全部後者で進めて効率よくセフレを探すことだけに集中するスタイルもありました。 仲良くＬＩＮＥが使えないから、詳しい名前に聞きながらＬＩＮＥを効率しなおした。 が女性に押されて初めて機能が可能と言った一番真剣な利用が存在します。そんな豊田市ではありますが、商業誘導のネットに趣味ができたそうです。しかし、情報は少し高めなので、目的的に番外がある時におメッセージで、演出することをおすすめします。
そういう子に最初から通りを出していくと、警戒されたり、引かれたりするリスクがちょっと発生するので、取りこぼしが出てくる真剣性があります。

・ 神奈川県 セフレ アプリアプリゲーム出会い 素人相手のなかには会うつもりはないことを神 奈川県 セフレ アプリに書いてある人もいます 。
普通の出会い男性なので、気に入れば会いたいくらいの軽い情報で登録しているので出会うのは不可能ではありませんが、メッセージのやり取りを引き延ばそうという面倒なのでスルーしましょう。
浮気した自由な相手は、自動が納得していれば、セフレのような自分が気軽な経営に出会いを持ちません。セフレでの確認を怠った出会い系が悪いといえばどこまでですが、嫌な経験でした。ケイペアーズは、コツがあるのでデザインして閉鎖することができましたね。
同じ機能は、リストに出会いを入れることによって、画面入れした日以降の掲示板書き込みを見れなくする見合いです。まず発言後の会話を始めるのですが、おおむねハッピーな好みは決めて話したほうが良いです。
総合：出会いは相手のニーズに合わせてユーザー⇒特にそんなになって自分の男性に近づけるという神奈川県 セフレ アプリにする 。
セフレ作りや出会いの運営が目的ならば、出会い系アプリを使用しましょう。
実際にモデルでペアーズを利用していた時は、月に７人の特徴と会えました。
街中でナンパされたい場合は、人通りの多い充実パターンへ行き、ほとんどのんびり歩いていると声をかけられいいです。
だからといって、簡単に出会い系アプリを利用してもセフレ作りはデートしません。なので「ワイは出会い系でタダマン課金したいんや〜〜」みたいな人には割とハードルが上がる。
タップル発生の特徴と共に、神奈川県 セフレ アプリで繋がりやすいコミュニティが火災になっていますが、ケイのアクションを探すときには美人いっぱいの相手のプロフィール写真を見て「いいかも」か「イマイチ」のあなたかに振り分けます。
紹介してくれた人にきまづいので、出会いや友達のプレゼントで知り合った女性と、セフレになるのはないでしょう。その場合はほとんどプロフを盛ってようが、写真を盛ってようが多少と登録に応えましょう。
脱いでもらったら抜群に詳しくてびっくりしたことは最近何回かあります。
一番大切なのは入会審査でも女性に見られているであろう「顔誰か」の撮り方（撮られ方）を研究することです。
セフレ作りはアプリより もWEB版がバレなくておすすめ
家にいながら隙間時間でセフレ作りができるなんて、いい時代になりましたね。
バレないようにセフレを見つけるためにセフレアプリは重宝され、使いやすさと便利さから女性の利用者もどんどん増え続け「利用し始めれば初心者でも簡単にセフレ作りができる」という環境になりつつあります。
しかし、バレないようにセフレアプリを利用することは非常に難しく、どうしても怪しまれてしまいます。
もし隠れた出会いを本気で見つけたいのならば「 WEB版」を利用することが最適でしょう。
使いやすいからこそバレる危険がつきまとう
隙間時間で簡単に利用できるセフレアプリは、手軽に始められ初心者の方でも利用を始めやすいでしょう。
アプリに大勢いる女性とのやり取りは今までの日常とは全く違うものになり、のめり込んでしまう男性もいるほどです。
ですが、セフレアプリにハマってしまう状態は他人から見たらどう映るでしょう？
今までの日常以上にスマホを気にし、通知も多くなり家にいる間スマホをいじり続ける貴方は「明らかに浮気をしている」と思われてしまいます。
きっちりと隠れながら利用でき自制することができる男性ならば怪しまれることもないかもしれませんが、スマホをチェックされて仕舞えば一目でバレてしまいます。
つまり、隠れてこっそりセフレ探しをしたいという人ほど「スマホアプリは向いていない」のです。
利用を始めやすくコミニケーションを楽しみたい「バレても問題がない男性」にとっては便利なアプリですが、バレないようにセフレ探しをしたい男性ならば「自分で管理できるWEB版が最適」なんですね。
バレないようにセックスを楽しむ男女が集まるWEB版
アプリとWEB版には利用している男女の違いもあり、本当にセックスを楽しみたいのならばWEB版が最適ということもおすすめする理由です。
アプリを利用する女性の多くは「 SNSのように利用している」ことがほとんどです。承認欲求を満たすために活動している女性が多く、目的は「出会いではなくコミニケーション」であることが多いんですね。
その点、バレないようにセフレ探しをしている男女が集まるWEB版では「出会いを強く求めている女性」が多くいます。
出会いに繋がりやすくお互いにバレないようにセフレ探しをしているからこそ「適切な距離感を保ったセフレになりやすい」ことは、セフレ探しとして利用するための最大の利点かもしれませんね。
バレないように出会いやすい相手を探すのならば、WEB版の利用を一度考えてみてください。

その判断基準として、 「プロフィールや日記に注目する」ことが重要です。
プロフィールの充実具合や日記の更新頻度、これは「セフレを求める本気度」といっても過言ではありません。

出会いを目的としていない女性はセフレになりやすい女性
プロフィールや日記に注目すると、「出会いを求めていない」という女性がいることに気がつくでしょう。
メッセージでのやり取りで最初に言われることも多く、セフレを探している男性のほとんどはそこで諦めてしまうはずです。
ですが、そういった女性は多くの男性がアプローチを止めるからこそ狙い目だと言えます。
「 競争率」が非常に低く、そういった女性とのやり取りを続ければ「特別な男性」と信頼してもらうことも簡単なのです。
つまり、出会いを求めていないという女性は「体目的の男性との出会いを求めていない女性」なのです。
出会いの先にあるセックスのことを考えている「出会い目的ではない女性」ほど、性的な欲求が強い場合も多いです。
彼女たちが求める 「信頼できる特別な男性」になることができれば、他の女性を狙うよりも遥かに簡単に出会うことができるのです。

Interestingly , Alberto Gonzales was involved in discussions to fire the U.S. attorneys with Rove and he did n't even object to the idea .
New unreleased e-mails from top administration officials show the idea of firing all 93 U.S. attorneys was raised by White House adviser Karl Rove in early January 2005 , indicating Rove was more involved in the plan than previously acknowledged by the White House .
The e-mails also show Attorney General Alberto Gonzales discussed the idea of firing the attorneys en masse while he was still White House counsel — weeks before he was confirmed as attorney general .
The e-mails directly contradict White House assertions that the notion originated with recently departed White House counsel Harriet Miers and was her idea alone .
Two independent sources in a position to know have described the contents of the e-mail exchange , which could be released as early as Friday .
They put Rove at the epicenter of the imbroglio and raise questions about Gonzales ' explanations of the matter ....
White House press secretary Tony Snow told reporters Tuesday that Miers had suggesting firing all 93 and that it was " her idea only . "
Snow said Miers ' idea was quickly rejected by the Department of Justice .
The latest e-mails show that Gonzales and Rove both were involved in the discussion , and neither rejected it out of hand .
Remember where the oil fields and the rigs are ?
They are here :
From one of our insiders , here 's a couple of pictures of damaged rigs here ( GSF Adriatic VII ) and here ( GSF High Island III ) .
The insider reminded us that :
As you pointed out you have to balance the design life of the structure , the raw replacement cost of the structure , and the cost of not having the production from the structure .
Lets look at five sites in the GOMEX ( map attached here ) .
All wind speeds are in knots , two minute average at 10 meters above the surface , and are based on an analysis of hurricane activity since 1851 ( see Watson and Johnson , " Hurricane Loss Models , an opportunity to improve the state of the art " , Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society , Nov. 2004 ) .
Assuming a 10 year design life , what conditions should we expect ?
Here are the 10 year , 95 % prediction limit values ( in other words , in any given 10 year period there is only a 5 % chance this value will be exceeded ) for these sites :
10 Year
Site 1
70
Site 2
79
Site 3
80
Site 4
75
Site 5
70
Most engineers use a 100 year design criteria for major structures even if the design life is substantially less than that .
Our comparable 100 year values are :
100 Year
Site 1
117
Site 2
139
Site 3
140
Site 4
131
Site 5
118
The 100 year values used in the GOMEX are a bit lower than this because most ocean engineering firms base their analyses on data since 1900 , and missed the period of intense activity in the late 1800's .
It is important to keep in mind that very few sites actually exceeded a 100 year design event for Katrina or Rita .
However , even if a structure is a 100 year design on commissioning day , after a couple years bathing
in warm salt air and the normal wear and tear of use it probably is n't anywhere near that level in reality , even with a PM program .
So how hard is it to build a better structure ?
Harder than you might think .
This table shows the relative wind load and relative stress ( which includes vibration modes ) between the minimum wind speed for each Saffir Simpson Category :
Category
Min Wind
Wind Load
Stress
1
64
1.00
1.00
2
84
1.72
2.26
3
97
2.30
3.48
4
114
3.17
5.65
5
135
4.45
9.39
In Saffir / Simpson terms , most designs are for a Cat 3 .
If you wanted to build something to withstand a Cat 5 , you would have to build it roughly three times stronger - a pretty tough thing to do without totally blowing out the economics of the structures .
These are wind loads - designing for wave loads for an anchored structure get to be nightmarish for extreme events .
A big air gap for waves means a big surface area for wind loads .
The uplift forces , differential stress from waves coming from different directions ( which happens inside hurricanes ) , combined with wind loads , makes designs above Cat 3 problematic .
The ultimate question is , do you pay some large amount up front in your design , or do you roll the dice and hope your less well designed structure is lucky ?
Most engineers try to split the difference and protect against most events , and hope the big ones do n't show up during their watch .
Jay Kimble , CodeBetter 's resident AJAX guru , issued a little challenge to us TDD bloggers about using Test Driven Development to develop a custom extension to the MS Ajax ScriptManager control .
In the comments , Jeff Perrin ( you need to blog more Jeff ) proposes a solution that 's about what I would have suggested — remove most of the functionality to a " POO " class that is n't coupled in any way to the ASP .
Net runtime .
I think the most important things to know or think about upfront before transitioning to TDD are :
There is a way to write an automated test for almost any piece of code , including the user interface itself ( the idea that the GUI can't be tested is somewhat a myth )
The biggest part of driving code through the tests is thinking through * how * you 're going to split up the responsibilities of the code to be able to easily write unit tests * before * you commit to writing code .
I know a lot of people blanch at the thought of doing things just for testing , but a lot of making code testable is simply a strong focus on separating responsibilities into cohesive and loosely coupled modules .
Basically , traditionally good design in general .
Assume that you will have to change the way you code in order to make writing the unit tests easier .
Maybe you wo n't , but you should still have an open mind and be prepared to challenge the way that you write code .
Specific to .
Net , the " Visual Studio way " of creating code often detracts from testability .
More on this below .
Laying down the Law
Back to Jay 's issue , let 's try to apply some of Jeremy 's Laws of TDD .
Isolate the Ugly Stuff .
In Jay 's case the ugly stuff is anything related to the ASP .
Net runtime .
Following law # 1 , boil the " meat " of the real functionality away from the " bones " of the ASP .
Net runtime .
Now , the functionality can be tested without all the overhead of a web server .
Push , Not Pull .
In Jay 's control , divide the responsibilities into two pieces .
The control itself is only responsible for handling the interaction with the ASP .
Net runtime and delegating to the " POO " class that actually implements the functionality .
If the " POO " class is given everything it needs to do the work , it 's completely decoupled from its data source , and therefore easy to test .
Known input , expected outcome .
This is what I call the " Roadies and Aerosmith " analogy .
The " POO " class ( Aerosmith ) is doing all the sexy work , but the web control ( the Roadie ) is responsible for giving everything to the " POO " class that it needs to do its work .
Test Small Before Testing Big .
Obviously , the whole thing , control and " POO " class , needs to be tested front to back in an integration test .
Before you even attempt the big bang test , build and test the constituent pieces in isolation first .
That strategy both leads to effective evolutionary design , and keeps the debugger turned off .
Avoid a Long Tail ( forthcoming , but soon because I need some content for my DevTeach talks ) .
Jay 's scenario is really too simple for this law to come into play , but think on this : if you need to pick up any piece of logic or behavior in your system and write a test for it , how much " stuff " has to come with it ?
For example , if you can't test some business logic without a database or Active Directory authentication , you 're TDD efforts are going to be much more difficult than they could be .
More Classes ?
Yes !
Again referring to Jay 's post , one of the commenter 's is concerned that the extra classes will create performance / scalability problems and I 'm would also guess an unvoiced concern over extra complexity .
Two points :
I vehemently oppose the attitude that more classes automatically equates to complexity .
I think a much , much more pervasive problem in the wild is classes that are bloated in size with unrelated responsibilities .
In a way , I 'm personally more concerned with the complexity of any one single piece of code more than the whole .
I 'll take a dozen classes with cohesive responsibilities versus a single 1000 line procedure any day of the week .
I will happily stand up and shout this all damn day .
In all but the most extreme cases , the performance overhead of creating well factored code ( smaller classes and methods ) is trivial in the grand scheme of things .
Maintainability , of which testability is a crucial component , should never be sacrificed at the alter of performance without very good reason .
I cringe every time I read somebody say to avoid creating more objects as a performance optimization .
Sure it is , but compared to a single inefficient database query or chatty communication ?
The Underlying Problems of TDD in the .
Net World
Now , the very real problem that Jay 's little example exposes to broad daylight : in .
Net development , and especially ASP .
Net WebForms development , you often have to go out of your way to create testable code .
To steal a phrase from Jeffrey Palermo , .
Net does not help you " fall into success " with good separation of concerns and testability .
In Jay 's case , you can't simply write a small unit test for the control as a whole because any UserControl is tightly coupled to the ASP .
Net runtime .
You can fake the HttpContext and the page event cycle , but it 's nontrivial and does n't save you much time ( and no , do n't ask me exactly how .
The examples I 've seen relied on lots of Win32 calls and quite a bit of time with Reflector .
My advice is to go to MonoRail or wrestle WebForms into an MVP structure ) .
You * can * abstract away the HttpContext by surrounding it with abstracted interface wrappers , and I do recommend this , but the better question I should probably be asking , even as a fervent TDD advocate , is " why do I have to do all this extra stuff for testability ? "
One of the most popular posts I 've ever written was on using a Model View Presenter architecture with ASP .
Net for testability .
Half a year later I completely lost my enthusiasm for MVP with WebForms in a short morning of presentations from Prag Dave Thomas on Ruby on Rails .
What I saw in only a couple hours was a far more elegant solution for testable presentation code than MVP / WebForms can possibly provide .
At one point I even made Dave stop and repeat a sentence on how state and information was moved from controller to view because their technique eliminated most of the mechanical work we were doing to force ASPX pages into something testable .
One of the huge advantages of Ruby on Rails over WebForms is the inherent testability that is baked into Rails .
The way you develop pages in Rails out of the box is inherently testable , in WebForms you have to apply an extra layer of stuff that is n't built in .
Rails comes with built in extensions into the Ruby xUnit tool to stub out the equivalent of the HttpContext at will to simulate user requests , plus more extensions for common assertions for Controller to View interaction .
You can even happily test the generated web page itself without starting up a web server , and that 's a huge win in terms of the rapid feedback cycles you want with TDD .
Rails straightjackets you into an MVC breakdown by default that separates responsibilities for easier testing .
ASP .
Net is all too happy to let you throw everything into the code behinds .
I was extremely dubious about Software Factories at first , but there might be some room for a software factory for ASP .
Net that leads to better practices .
We 'll see .
If Jay had been building this functionality with Ruby on Rails ( which already has that functionality btw ) , he would n't have had to go out of his way one single bit because Rails is inherently testable , and that 's my whole point in this section .
We want ASP .
Net to have the same level of testability that Rails does .
We should be asking Microsoft to move ASP .
Net in a direction that enables us to write testable code without fighting the framework .
I do n't know how much say or influence I get with this MVP thingie , but the one single thing that I would beg Microsoft for in whatever is beyond Orcas is far more consideration for testability in the .
Net framework .
It 's the one area in particular where I think the .
Net framework needs a lot of improvement .
ScottGu , since you 're amazingly all seeing , are you out there ?
Can we talk about testability in ASP .
Net ?
Can we jump testability over new wiz bangy RAD capabilities in the priority list ?
Who 's with me ?
I really think the .
Net community needs to reexamine and debate the merits and appropriateness of the Visual RAD approach .
A lot of what makes ASP .
Net WebForms hard to test is the extra complexity that 's there to support design time controls , specifically the page event cycle .
RAD is doing more damage than good because the negative impact on maintainability / testability overwhelms the " write once " advantages of RAD .

My Stuff on Test Driven Development
5 Hidden OSX Gems
As a recent convert to OSX there are many little pieces of functionality that delight me on an almost daily basis .
Beyond the pretty UI , excellent ( for the most part ) usability and the fact that things seem to “ just work ” , theres a plethora of features that many users will simply not discover .
No this list probably is n’t going to be helpful to those of you who are long time OSX users but for recent switchers , and those who do n’t usually “ explore ” their computer , this may very well be helpful .
Save as PDF
OSX has an inbuilt ability to save almost anything as a PDF .
The way it does this is by using a PDF print driver and , as such , the option can be found in amongst the print options .
The image to the right ( click to enlarge ) shows the expanded PDF option that can be found in nearly all OSX applications .
The reason is that OSX , like Windows , uses a generic print service which other apps simply send data to .
This allows for a consistent interface when printing .
As part of this consistent interface , you ’ll find the option to print as PDF .
This means that you can save webpages , office documents and photos as PDF files for easy sharing .
Preview
Preview is one of those apps that you do n’t appreciate until you move to an OS that ’s without it .
It seems to handle every conceivable file you throw at it , from PDFs ( see above ) to images .
Next time your on a Windows system , count how many different apps you need just to open the different types of files preview handles .
Note : This was written in 2007 .
Since then Preview has continued to grow into an extremely powerful tool .
You can read two hidden OSX Preview gems here .
Summarize
This is probably one of the most obscure features of OSX that I use regularly .
Called Summarize , it can be found in the services menu ( click the name of the current app in the top left hand corner then choose services and summarize ) .
What this does is create a summary of any text you have selected , and its actually pretty good .
Somehow , probably through invoking some voodoo god , it knows how to summarize text .
Apparently this is done through a combination of identifying unique , as well as commonly used phrases / words and striking a balance between the themes emphasised through repeating and those that are unique .
It works a charm .
Click the image on the left to see an example of summarized text from a recent article here , I think you ’ll agree that for an automated tool dealing with a fairly complex sample of text ( some of it was formatted in an ordered list ) its done pretty well .
The one thing to bear in mind about summarize though is that its not compatible with every app .
FireFox , for example , is not currently aware of the OSX services .
Hopefully this will be rectified when we get a proper OSX FireFox build ( Note : It was n’t ) .
If you use iTunes then the chances are you use Smart Folders , they are called Smart Playlists .
They allow you to create a folder , the contents of which constantly updates based upon rules you set .
You can use these for absolutely anything .
One of my favourite usages is to colour code certain files in OSX based upon the level of attention they need , such as red for urgent or green for dealt with .
That way I can have an “ Urgent ” Smart Folder that contains all the items that I deem to require urgent attention .
Then , when something comes through my Inbox that needs my attention , I just colour it red and it will get picked up by the Smart Folder .
With this being OSX , Spotlight is used so you can utilise the standard operators in addition to the simple options the Smart Folder dialogue provides .
There are many other options open to you once you master the impressive Smart Folders , like using OSX ’s comments to tag items .
It also allows you to classify files in a number of different ways .
Say , for example , you keep all your invoices in an invoices folder but you also want to keep them in the project specific folder , then you could have one Smart Folder which contains everything on the project , and one that contains all the invoices .
If you adapt this technique I guarantee ( Warning , guarantee not valid on this planet ) you ’ll spend a heck of alot less time organising your files , because , you can essentially just put them anywhere and rely on Smart Folders and Spotlight to pick out the ones you need , when you need them .
Snippets
I ’m not sure what else to call this but I use it nearly every day .
Put simply , it allows you to quickly grab pieces of information from all over the place and very easily save it to your machine .
Not I ’m not talking about something as advanced as grep or curl here , its much more visual .
All you have to do is select some text and drag it to your desktop .
When you do this OSX automatically creates a text file on your desktop containing the text .
Taking that on a step , you can do the same with images and many other types of information .
Compare that to the process of saving text in Windows where you select the text , copy , go to your desktop , right clicking , new text file , rename the text file , open the text file , paste the text and then save it .
If any one process sums up OSX when compared to Windows , its that one .
Why not check out the second post in this series , 5 More OSX Hidden Gems .
If you enjoyed this list , may I recommend this post on why OSX makes a great Web Development Platform and this one on Five things that make Quicksilver Awesome .

A team of engineering students from The University of British Columbia has built a vehicle so efficient that it could travel from Vancouver to Halifax on a gallon of gasoline .
The futuristic - looking , single - occupancy vehicle won top prize at a recent international competition , marking the UBC team ’s fourth win in as many years .
The Society of Automotive Engineers ( SAE ) Supermileage Competition took place June 9 in Marshall , Michigan .
Forty teams from Canada , the U.S. and India competed in designing and building the most fuel - efficient vehicle .
“ We achieved this level of efficiency by optimizing many aspects of the vehicle design , including : aerodynamics , light - weight construction , a small displacement engine ( 54 cc ) , and conservative driving habits , ” says Team Captain Kevin Li .
The UBC design , which required the driver to lie down while navigating it , achieved 3,145 miles per US gallon ( 0.074 litres / 100 km ) -- equivalent of Vancouver to Halifax on a gallon ( 3.79 litres ) of gas -- costing less than $ 5 at the pump .
UBC ’s student team has taken first place four out of the six years it has competed , with 2006 marking the fourth straight victory .
Last year the UBC team beat out 27 teams by reaching 1,600 miles per gallon ( mpg ) .
Université Laval ( Que. ) took second place this year with a score of 1,823 mpg .
Other teams represented University of Windsor , University of California , Los Angeles , UC Berkeley , Pennsylvania State University , and the Delhi College of Engineering .
Supermileage ( http://www.supermileage.org) is an annual student competition that challenges students to design , build , and drive a single person vehicle ( powered solely by a gasoline engine ) to achieve the best fuel mileage possible .
The vehicle must be powered by only an internal combustion engine , with no assistance from electric motors or human propulsion .
The UBC project is funded with support from TD Friends of the Environment Foundation , AirCare , the Walter Gage Memorial Fund , and the UBC Dept. of Mechanical Engineering .

Balthazar Napoleon de Bourbon , a jovial Indian lawyer and part - time farmer , has always been fascinated by France .
Framed pictures of the Eiffel Tower and the palace of Versailles implausibly decorate his house in a dusty , bustling suburb of the central Indian city of Bhopal .
He gave his children French names even though he has never set foot in France .
But he may soon make his first trip to Paris , after he was visited by a relative of Prince Philip , who told him that he is the first in line to the lost French throne .
This Indian father - of - three is being feted as the long - lost descendent of the Bourbon kings who ruled France from the 16th century to the French revolution .
A distant cousin of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette , he is alleged to be not only related to the current Bourbon king of Spain and the Bourbon descendants still in France , but to have more claim than any of them to the French crown .
The story of a potential Asian dauphin to one of the most important royal houses of Europe appears to be a poke in the eye for colonial history , and has sparked a rush of interest among royals in Europe .
Prince Michael of Greece , the cousin of Prince Philip , this week published a historical novel called Le Rajah de Bourbon , which traces the swashbuckling story of Mr Bourbon 's first royal ancestor in India .
Prince Michael believes Jean de Bourbon was a nephew of the first Bourbon French king , Henry IV .
In the mid-16th century Jean embarked on an action - packed adventure across the world which saw him survive assassination attempts and kidnap by pirates to be sold at an Egyptian slave market and serve in the Ethiopian army .
In 1560 , he turned up at the court of the Mogul emperor Akbar .
It was the beginning of a long line of Bourbons in India , who centuries later would serve as the administrators of Bhopal and become the second most important family in the region .
Michael of Greece , who lives in Paris and is of Bourbon descent , believes his detective work on his newfound Indian " cousins " is more than just the latest whimsy in a history of attempts to uncover relatives of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette .
" If I am right - and I do n't have absolute proof , but I completely believe in my theory - then Balthazar Bourbon would be the eldest in the line , " he told the Guardian .
" This is the cherry on the cake .
Mr Bourbon is head of a decent , dignified , middle - class Indian family .
They look so Indian and yet bear this name .
When you look at them , it seems incredible .
The more unbelievable it is , the more I believe in it . "
He said several of his royal relatives in Spain and France were " quite excited and thrilled to have found a new branch " .
He was in favour of a DNA test , perhaps from a surviving lock of Bourbon hair , to establish the facts .
From his home in the Bhopal suburbs , Mr Bourbon , 48 , said he would be glad to take a DNA test , but remained stoical about the " hypothetical question " of whether he was heir to the throne .
Conscious of the bloody outcome for royals in France , he felt royal status could bring " trouble " , not to mention questions from skeptical historians .
Still , he has long had a brass plaque above his front door reading " House of Bourbon " with the fleur - de - lis crest of the French monarchy .
His wife runs the neighbouring school for local children , called the Bourbon school .
The family is Catholic and keeps Bourbon relics , including a sword , in their home .
He said he felt " a sense of pride " when contemplating the picture of Versailles on his wall .
But he is aware that his family 's fortunes waned in Bhopal long ago .
He describes the Indian branch of the family as Bourbons on the rocks .
" From the day I was born , I was made to understand that I belonged to the family of the Bourbons , " he said .
" I may be from a royal family but I live my life as a commoner .
I did n't have time to learn French as a teenager because my father 's death meant I had to work to look after my mother and sisters .
Life has been very tough for me . "
When his sister went to France on holiday she visited a castle once owned by Bourbon kings .
It was closed to the public but she showed her Indian passport with the Bourbon name and was allowed in .
" I do n't know if any of this will change my life , " Mr Bourbon said .
" The fact is , we 've been having visitors from England , France and across Europe for years , curious about our family name .
" All these travellers , all this publicity , but nothing has happened yet .
So how can I believe that something will change now ? "
Backstory
War , assassinations , child kings , opulence and revolution marked the two centuries during which the Bourbons ruled France .
They were known as much for their colourful personal lives as their politics .
The first king , Henri IV , came to power in 1589 and was reputed to have more than 60 mistresses and 11 illegitimate children .
Later Louis XIV , the Sun King , became the most powerful ruler in French history and one of the longest reigning kings in Europe .
In 1793 , Louis XVI was guillotined by revolutionaries , followed months later by his wife Marie Antoinette .
Different branches of the Bourbons were restored to the throne from 1814 until the revolution of 1848 .

About the rock icon ’s collection ( sorry , no plaster casters ) :
Paul Stanley creates portraits and abstracts that are emotionally charged compositions .
The scale is huge , the paint laid on thickly ; the colors have been chosen in order to generate a powerfully physical and emotional effect .
Paul ’s work can be associated with the Abstract Expressionists of the late 1940 ’s and 1950’s .
He aims to maximize the direct , physical impact of his paintings through scale , texture , color and simplicity of images .
One sees in Paul ’s abstracts the influences of Kandinsky , Mondrian , Malevich , Paul Klee , and Mark Rothko .

Hostess ads ran in comic books starting in 1977 with Batman and the Mummy .
This continued for five insane years .
Five years of amazing super beings tossing food to madmen whose special ability may or may not have been really enjoying peaches .
Each hero has his or her own unique approach to fighting crime with snacks .
Aquaman likes to fail or suck and then share in cupcakes .
Captain America prefers to kick the fuck out you maybe hand you a pie , and then kick out whatever fuck you have left .
But Thor and Wonder Woman ... those two use Hostess treats as a portal to an impossible underverse of dislogic and nonsense .
In the comments section of my post on the worst school massacre in US history , I posted this :
I have been thinking , putting the profile of these mass murderers together with my theory of the popularity among so - called Zeta Males of Second Life , World of Warcraft , and other such virtual life forums .
They fit very well together , but what are the effects ?
Does participation in a community such as Second Life give such people ( ego - driven failures , basically ) enough gratification and recognition that it reduces their inclination to turn to violence in the real world ?
Now that , if I say so myself , is an interesting question .
And so it is .
Let ’s review a few things before we get into a discussion .
First , mass murders of the Virginia Tech and Bath Disaster proportions are generally carried out by tightly - wound , ego - driven men who would conventionally be described as failures .
They have high ego but low accomplishment , and the disparity between these two drives them literally insane .
They account for the difference between their self - opinion and their status by convincing themselves that various conspiracies or forces are working against them .
In Kimveer Gill ’s case , he settled on bullies , although he himself had not been bullied ; he essentially picked an excuse that was popular with his online peer group , who commonly complained about being bullied .
In Andrew Kehoe ’s case , he believed it was the School Board and the taxation system ’s fault he was facing bankruptcy , ignoring the fact that his farm failed to prosper because he farmed according to his ( inaccurate ) theories rather than according to sound principles .
In Cho Seung - Hui ’s case , he blamed the rich and debauched generally , specifically stating repeatedly that the killing was their responsibility , not his .
These are Zeta Males .
Now , let ’s look for a moment at the post I did about Maslow ’s Hierarchy of Needs .
I discovered that , even though I have difficulty affording the basics like food and shelter ( and my internet bill is three months overdue right now ) I am highly self - actualized and recognized by the community .
According to standard theory , this should be impossible , but obviously it is n’t .
It ’s because of this blog .
It is because of the internet .
It is because I can go online and know that I will be seen and heard and respected if I prove myself , which I know I can do in this arena .
I have a record of accomplishment in the cybersphere .
This is precisely what is so attractive about Second Life .
In another forum , there was a lively discussion about who joins SL , with those less sophisticated in the ways of the internet assuming that it would primarily be populated with teenagers .
This immediately seemed wrong to me and , indeed , proves not to be true ; it seemed obvious that Second Life was most attractive to mature people who ’d failed in First Life .
It ’s a Zeta - being magnet , because it gives you the opportunity to hit REPLAY and live your life over , and if you do n’t like the way it ’s going , you hit DELETE and create a new life .
This is not something that those accustomed to success would find compelling .
Now , the question becomes , does participation in online worlds fill these people ’s needs for recognition and somehow bleed off the deadly pressure , or do they fail even online , thus reinforcing their destructive tendencies ?
If there ’s hard information out there about this , I have n’t found it .
I would love to hear from psychologists tracking membership in these online forums , though , and what I am hoping to hear is that it can transform people from embittered , dangerous and irrational outsiders into something closer to a sane human being .
I want to be optimistic about this …but …

Marijuana and its uses
Marijuana , common name for a drug made from the dried leaves and flowering tops of the Indian hemp plant Cannabis sativa ( see Cannabis ) .
People smoke , chew , or eat marijuana for its hallucinogenic and intoxicating effects .
Marijuana Plant Marijuana is formed from the dried leaves and flowering tops of the Indian hemp plant Cannabis sativa .
Popularly known as “ grass , ” “ pot , ” “ reefer , ” and “ Mary Jane , ” marijuana is smoked or chewed for its intoxicating effect , and it has also been used as a sedative and analgesic .
Hashish is formed from the resin of the flowering tops of the same plant , and it is five to eight times more potent than marijuana when smoked .
Photo Researchers , Inc .
The flowering tops of the Cannabis plant secrete a sticky resin that contains the active ingredient of marijuana , known as delta - 9 - tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) .
The plant has both male and female forms , and the sticky flowers of the female plant are the most potent .
Hashish is a similar drug prepared from the same plant .
It differs from marijuana in that it is comprised of only the resin from the plant , whereas marijuana is made up of flowering tops and leaves .
Effects
Many users describe two phases of marijuana intoxication : initial stimulation , which includes giddiness and euphoria , followed by sedation and pleasant tranquility .
Mood changes are often accompanied by altered perceptions of time and space .
Thinking processes become disrupted by fragmentary ideas and memories .
Many users report increased appetite , heightened sensory awareness , and general feelings of pleasure .
Negative effects of marijuana use can include confusion , acute panic reactions , anxiety attacks , fear , a sense of helplessness , and loss of self - control .
Chronic marijuana users may develop amotivational syndrome characterized by passivity , decreased motivation , and preoccupation with taking drugs .
Like alcohol intoxication , marijuana intoxication impairs judgment , comprehension , memory , speech , problem - solving ability , reaction time , and driving skills .
The effects of long - term marijuana use on the intellect have not been established , and there is no evidence that marijuana causes brain damage .
Smoking marijuana can damage the lungs , however , and long - term use may increase the risk of lung cancer .
Although marijuana is not physically addicting and no physical withdrawal symptoms occur when use is discontinued , psychological dependence develops in some 10 to 20 percent of long - term regular users ( see Drug Dependence ) .
Medical uses
Some people find that marijuana combats the unpleasant symptoms associated with medical conditions .
But the potential medical uses of marijuana are hard to assess , as there have been few clinical trials .
Pure THC has been shown to improve appetite and prevent the severe weight loss associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , and it also reduces the nausea caused by cancer chemotherapy and radiation treatments .
Pure THC sold under the brand name Marinol is available in capsule form as a prescription medicine in the United States for these uses .
Compared to smoked marijuana , however , this drug is slower to provide symptom relief due to the time required for the drug to be absorbed into the bloodstream .
Marijuana is also reported to have beneficial effects in treating pain and muscle spasms in patients with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) .
Many people who suffer from MS and other chronic diseases report that marijuana provides symptom relief when all other medications fail .
In the United States , the potential medical benefits of marijuana have sparked a debate about the legalization of marijuana for medicinal purposes .
Since 1986 nine states — Alaska , Arizona , California , Colorado , Hawaii , Maine , Nevada , Oregon , and Washington — have passed legislation that permits patients to possess and grow marijuana for medicinal purposes with their doctor ’s approval .
These state laws are not in accordance with federal laws , which prohibit the use , possession , growth , or distribution of marijuana for any purpose .
In 2001 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers ' Cooperative that marijuana distributors cannot offer a medical - necessity defense to avoid a federal conviction for marijuana manufacture , distribution , and possession .
Some proponents of medical marijuana fear that this ruling may eventually make it more difficult for individuals to claim a medical - necessity defense in state courts .
In the United Kingdom large - scale clinical trials of cannabis - based medicines for pain and multiple sclerosis were initiated in 2000 .
If successful these trials could lead to the approval of such medicines in Europe .

ALL DAY , ALL NIGHT ! / S.F. startup puts camera on founder 's head for real - time feed , and a star is born 1 / 23 Back to Gallery
Just call him Air Justin .
Eleven days ago , 23 - year - old Justin Kan was just another no -name startup guy with big dreams of the small screen .
Then he and his friends launched Justin.tv , an Internet reality show chronicling their adventures as young San Francisco entrepreneurs that , at least for now , is proving to be a smash hit with online viewers .
Kan calls it " lifecasting . "
The concept is simple : Using technology his team developed , Kan has strapped a camera to his head to capture every moment of his existence in live streaming video on the Internet .
Viewers literally see the world through Kan 's virtual eyes , which broadcast his life onto the Web 24 / 7 .
He interacts with his audience through 21 chat rooms and hundreds of e-mails each day .
He even took their calls on his cell phone until he got overwhelmed .
The show 's slogan says it all : " Waste time watching other people waste time . "
And that 's what tens of thousand of folks around the globe are doing , turning Kan into an online phenom by tuning in to his irreverent and uncensored world .
That sudden explosion of peeping onlookers has caused so many technical difficulties that Justin.tv had to recruit volunteers from the audience to keep the show rolling .
Viewers seem to delight in playing along with their new online idol , cramming chat rooms and pulling pranks on him , first calling 911 to report a stabbing in the group 's apartment ( prompting some friends to give Kan a bullet - proof vest for the next time officers burst in , guns drawn ) , then reporting a fire there .
San Francisco emergency dispatchers , leery of any more false alarms , now call to confirm there 's an actual emergency before responding .
So fans moved on to different sorts of pranks , such as ordering $ 63 worth of pizza to be delivered to Justin.tv 's door .
Instant fame has had some pretty dramatic results .
Kan 's inbox overflows with praise ( " please go off the air , you 're ruining my life with your addictive site " ) and questions particularly of the personal nature , such as what will he do when he masturbates or has sex on - screen .
Meanwhile , Emmett Shear , 23 , and Kyle Vogt , 21 , who comprise the technical team , have barely slept in a desperate effort to keep up with the ever - increasing traffic .
Michael Seibel , the show 's 24 - year - old producer , appears to have a cell phone permanently attached to his ear .
Kan jokes that he should hire a full - time assistant just to accept all the new friend requests on MySpace and Facebook .
He 's already getting noticed on the street .
And he is getting flattering attention -- and even his first onscreen kiss -- from his most coveted demographic : starstruck young hotties .
( He has lined up three blind dates this weekend ) .
Coming in a close second : Fans who treat him and his cash - strapped gang to dinner .
Those fan get an on - air shout - out .
" Eventually my ego is going to be the size of the planet Earth , " Kan said .
The business model centers on product placement .
Already corporate sponsors are lining up to plug their products alongside Zipcar rentals and Bawls energy drink , both of which have posters on the walls of Justin.tv 's headquarters in North Beach .
The apartment is four blocks from where the movie " Ed TV , " in which a video clerk agrees to have his life videotaped for network TV , was filmed .
And Hollywood producers , charged with figuring out new strategies for delivering shows to viewers , are looking to get a piece of the action even though the production values are as crude as the Justin.tv vocabulary .
Of course , Justin.tv is a new twist on an old idea , piggybacking on earlier hits such as MTV's " Real World " and Jennicam , an Internet site run by a young woman who in 1996 became one of the first to install webcams in her home so viewers could observe every aspect of her private life .
Kan hopes his show 's budding success will power a Justin.tv network complete with a lineup of shows , including a " Sex and the City " - inspired tale to be filmed in Manhattan .
" We want to find people far more charismatic and attractive than me to go out and do this , " Kan said .
All the runaway hype begs the question : Will Justin.tv be fad or flop ?
Andrew Keen , a sharp critic of the self - broadcasting movement whose book " The Cult of the Amateur " comes out in June , says this brand of digital narcissism not only will fail , it will be recalled with shame in more sober economic times , just like the dot -coms of the late 1990s .
" This is the last gasp of the Web 2.0 boom , " Keen said .
" People are going to look back at this and say , ' This makes Second Life look like the BBC . '
I think even Justin will look back on it and be embarrassed .
" This ( show ) attracts people who are profoundly bored with their lives and are waiting for the next media fix .
They will go on to the next thing when they get bored of this thing .
It has no legs . "
Months ago , when The Chronicle first met the Justin.tv crew as they were in the early planning phase , the show certainly seemed like a gamble .
Would people with lives of their own sit around and watch Kan live his , even when he 's just spending face time with his laptop or going to the bathroom with the camera discreetly pointed toward the ceiling ?
Justin.tv is more than ready for prime time , insists Paul Graham , founder of Y Combinator , which provided seed money for the company .
The business incubator usually gives the companies it sponsors about $ 5,000 per founder .
" Of the 39 startups we 've funded so far , Justin .
TV might have the most potential , " Graham said .
" Ultimately their plan is to have hundreds of people with these cameras .
Each would be a channel ; viewers would watch whichever was most interesting at that time .
With hundreds of people , there would always be something interesting .
So why would anyone even switch on their TV ?
" If this does n't scare the s -- out of TV networks , it 's only because they do n't understand it yet .
TV is moving to the Internet especially for the 18 - to 35 - ( year - old ) males the TV networks can barely hang onto now . "
Kan 's concept is another step in rewriting the script for programming , said John Furrier , CEO of Podtech.net , a Silicon Valley podcasting network .
" It 's not about what it is today but what it will turn into .
A lot of people will be quick to dismiss the quality of his programming .
And it will be crude at first .
But it will evolve very quickly . "
To get an idea of what Justin.tv is all about right now , picture four guys gone wild in a two - bedroom apartment littered with disheveled furniture , empty beer cans , remnants of pizza crust and randomly strewn socks and shoes .
On a giant white board is the show 's apparent goal : Jay Leno , 30 days or less .
On another smaller white board is a long list of possible activities for Kan , from going to a shooting range to making a deposit at a sperm bank .
Advertisers ' banners adorn the walls .
Even Hearst Castle is an unofficial sponsor .
The Justin.tv crew , frustrated that the castle was closed during a recent road trip , " borrowed " one of its flags .
Kan is fixated on getting Budweiser as a sponsor , which would help with the drain on the thirsty startup 's budget .
Kan , who says he grew up a shy introvert in an upper - middle - class family in Seattle , has a bona fide exhibitionist streak .
A
Yale physics and philosophy grad turned high - tech entrepreneur , he once posed lathered in shaving cream for a college pin-up calendar to raise money for tsunami relief , and he sold his first Internet company in an attention - getting stunt on eBay .
Now his average day alternates between a blur of antics and long spells of boredom .
Kan never takes the camera off unless he 's sleeping .
That 's the only time the camera actually films him instead of his perspective on the world .
Viewers , tired of waiting for him to rise , like to egg his roommates on to wake him .
On a recent morning , they poured a glass of water on him .
Kan likes to think and talk about himself as a man of the people , so he gets out in the world when he can .
Highlights from earlier this week : a walk to pick up coffee -- Kan started drinking it a month ago to get more pep earlier in the day -- a flurry of media interviews and lunch in South Park with his No. 1 fan , friend Seeyuen Lee .
Lee began watching Justin.tv before it launched .
" Now that they have thousands of viewers , everyone wants to be Justin 's No. 1 fan , but I am squatting on the title , " she said .
Later , Kan headed for the Museum of Modern Art to meet with the folks at Podtech , then to take his friend and neighbor , Steve Huffman , who became a millionaire by selling his startup Reddit to Wired Digital , shopping for a Corvette at Ellis Brooks Chevrolet .
No errand is ordinary when you have a camera strapped to your head .
Kan , who ran out of clean socks , walked to Fisherman 's
Wharf to buy some more at the Gap but was kicked out when he refused to stop shooting .
Soon he got an e-mail from a viewer : " Hey Justin I gave a call to that Gap store hah .
I told the guy you had 1,000 people watching the camera live and he just looked like a dick to the whole Internet . "
Rather than return empty - handed to the apartment , Kan wandered across the street to watch breakdancers as the sun set on the bay .
As he took in the booming music and acrobatic moves , he became still for the first time all day , and , for a moment , appeared alone in the crowd .
" It 's nice to watch someone else perform instead of me , " he said .
Kan realizes there are downsides to so much notoriety .
He and Seibel have to instant message each other with phone numbers and other sensitive information they do n't want to go out on the air .
And , despite all the attention , Kan has never before been so isolated .
He spends far more time interacting with strangers than his own family .
With a show that runs more on impulse than inspiration , Kan has considered banning his parents '
IP addresses from accessing the site .
He does n't want them to see him acting " like an ass , " he says .
Then the moment passes , and he's off again , drawn to the glow of an evening spent with friends over pizza and poker .
When some of Vogt 's friends from MIT show up , they can't believe the show is for real .
So Kan tells viewers that if they send 100 e-mails in 20 minutes , the entire gang will dive into the swimming pool completely clothed .
Kan clocks 300 messages .
With that kind of response , Kan says he has no intention of turning off the camera anytime soon .
" We will keep going as long as it's fun and as long as it's relevant , " he said .
" I figure that will be for a long time to come .
...
If I was n't starting this company , I would be starting another company .
It 's my job .
It 's my life . "
On a brisk , sunny December day , a small group of Burmese refugees gathered in the East Oakland house of Yan Aung to discuss how the Patriot Act and related immigration laws are being used to keep their compatriots out of the country .
Aung is in his early 40s , and works nights in an automobile factory .
He lives in East Oakland with his 35 - year - old wife , San San Win , their two children and two other families .
Because he works nights , he is still sleeping when others arrive , on a Sunday afternoon .
One of the first to come is U Maung Maung Latt ( U is a title of distinction for an older man in Burma , similar to " sir " ) .
Just shy of 60 , dressed in Levi's and a rust - colored jacket , Latt is nearly the age of Burma 's Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi ; and certainly of an older generation than the others who have come today , those who were mostly students when Burma held its fateful elections in 1990 .
Latt 's age , and his glasses , give him a certain technocratic authority ; yet his expression is that of a man who 's overwritten an easy grin with a more serious expression .
The grin , though , is not entirely erased .
In Burma , he was chairman of a local branch of the National League for Democracy ( NLD ) -- in a town called Bilin .
The National League for Democracy won Burma 's 1990 elections ( 392 of 492 seats of parliament ) but were denied their place in government .
Maung Maung Latt , then , is an elected member of Parliament ; so he is arguably one of the Burmese most directly disenfranchised by the current military regime .
Latt went into hiding after the election , to avoid arrest and torture , and , later , to set up a government in exile to resist the power grab of Burma 's military regime , the State Peace and Development Council .
Holding power since 1962 , the SPDC ( then known as the State Law and Order Restoration Committee ) shocked the nation when its leader , General Ne Win , offered to retire and phase - in democracy in 1988 .
This led to the rise of the NLD and other democracy groups .
When the NLD won the elections in 1990 , the SPDC reneged on their promise , and one by one , as many of the NLD 's leaders as could be found were arrested .
San Suu Kyi had already been arrested while campaigning , and later won both the election and the 1991 Nobel Prize for Peace under house arrest in Burma 's main city , Rangoon .
She remains there today , nearly 17 years after winning the leadership of her country , all visitors banned but her doctor and her maid .
Since 2005 , refugees have been barred entry to the United States as terrorists ( or supporters of terrorists ) if they once picked up a weapon as part of a group , or gave assistance to someone who did -- even if the weapons were used to fight a government the United States deemed illegitimate .
Particularly affected by these rules were Burmese pro-democracy advocates like this small group , who , in student groups and as part of a wider ethnic conflict , have fought Burma 's dictatorship or helped to facilitate that fight .
They were the lucky ones who slipped in before the Patriot Act .
On Jan. 12 , under pressure from refugee advocates and members of Congress from both parties , the Department of Homeland Security announced a change to its refugee policy .
Many Burmese armed groups were placed on a list of organizations whose supporters would be exempt from the material - support designation -- even though the groups themselves met the Act 's generic definition of terrorism .
Explaining the change , Jarrod Agen , spokesmen for the Department of Homeland Security , said , " The U.S. has a long tradition of welcoming refugees and asylum seekers , but we want to keep security in mind .
When we can be flexible we will , by looking at a group 's past history . "
After he went into hiding , Latt says , the NLD and armed groups worked together to decide on a way forward .
In councils at Manerplaw in 1994 , non-violent political groups met with armed student groups and armed ethnic groups -- some who had been fighting for independence since World War II , others fighting to rid Burma of its dictatorship and to restore a democracy that had never quite taken off after independence .
The NLD , since the elections , sat under the umbrella of the National Council for the Union of Burma , Latt explains .
This is the broadest umbrella group that brings together the NLD with the Karen National Army , the People 's Democratic Front and a number of other armed and unarmed groups alike .
Having been an elected MP and served as a member of Suu Kyi's nonviolent NLD does n't seem a likely profile for a terrorist .
But it is Latt 's ties to the armed groups and a strict reading of a vague law , that could have posed a problem under the Patriot Act .
Someone in his position today might fall under the category of having given " material support " to terrorism , depending on a number of factors .
Tyler Giannini , associate clinical director of the Human Rights Program at the Harvard Law School , explained , " If you gave a family member a bed to sleep in for a night or a glass of water , and that person was part of an armed struggle resisting an oppressive regime like the Nazis , you could still be cited under the current laws as giving material support to a terrorist .
By the definitions in place when I spoke to Giannini , in early January , George Washington would be defined as a terrorist , he said .
( Giannini did n't think someone like Latt , an elected MP from the NLD , would have as much of a problem as someone who actually fought and received weapons training , however . )
Yawning , Aung lumbers into his living room to meet the others wearing a longyi , a Burmese wrap similar to a sari , with a winter coat over it .
The 45 - year - old married his wife , Win , while fighting Burma 's guerrilla war .
When the SPDC denied the NLD members their place in parliament in 1990 , Aung left Rangoon .
" We fled to the border , " Aung says , going back and forth between English and Burmese , " to meet the ethnic groups , and we prepared for government . "
First , acting on behalf of the NLD , Aung took part in setting up a government in exile , or " parallel government " as he and his wife call it , and assisting disenfranchised MPs .
But in 1994 , Aung was tapped to lead a small group of the People 's Democratic Front , where he fought the Burmese regime directly in guerrilla combat in the jungle .
Win was just 20 in 1988 when she left home for weapons training in the jungle .
She watched the regime kill thousands of her fellow students in 1988 , a year before Tiananmen Square .
She was n't so sure the regime would honor the elections they promised , if they took place at all , and if they reneged she wanted to be ready to fight .
Her parents were arrested after she left , but soon released .
Going home after that , she knew , would mean more trouble for them ; for they had been lucky to be released without incident .
She remembers an aunt , a schoolteacher who was arrested for supporting a group of former students in their activism .
In prison just a week , she was tortured so severely she was never the same .
" When she get out , " Win said , " she can only say again and again that her life is over and she just wants to be a nun . "
Because it was easier for women to travel around the country , Win became a courier for the resistance .
Eventually her cover was blown , and on three occasions she escaped from military authorities by just minutes .
At first she hid out with apolitical relatives , but that became too risky for them .
Win met Aung when she was working in the NLD office in Rangoon , Burma 's capital , in 1989 .
( Asked how they fell in love and if she found him handsome , she laughs and says , " I did n't notice that . " )
Deep in the jungle , amongst soldiers and ethnic resistance leaders all hoping for Burmese democracy , they married .
This is also when they met Jack LaMorte , a Bay Area native doing work in Thailand ( who asked us to use an alias so as not to hinder his ongoing work in Burma ) .
" I ran into one of Yan Aung 's soldiers in Bangkok .
They took me to the border , which we crossed -- over a dirt road in the mountains -- to get to their camp inside .
I was fascinated by their struggle and began to hang out there .
San San
Win was pregnant , so I took her to the hospital while Yan Aung stayed in the camp , and Thunder was born there .
After that , we were family . "
Indeed , when Aung and Win applied as refugees , LaMorte agreed to sponsor their application -- which meant they would end up in the Bay Area .
Today , LaMorte and another Burmese refugee , Anil Verma , live in Aung and Win 's house , which the couple bought two years ago .
( Aung had the garage converted into an apartment for Verma . )
Likely , Aung and Win would have trouble -- possibly even being defined as terrorists , not just material supporters , like Latt -- if they applied for refuge in the United States today .
Says LaMorte , " I am sure they asked Yan Aung about [ his armed activities ] , I prepared his CV , which included photos of him addressing his troops .
I think the fact that he led an insurgency made him a good candidate for asylum .
But those were the good old days when we acted rationally . "
While Aung works nights in the automobile factory , Win -- a recent graduate in accounting from Laney College -- is hoping to find an accounting job .
Their daughter Thunder is now 12 .
The latest addition to their family is Nyein Chan , 5 , first to be born in the United States .
He goes to preschool and will begin kindergarten next year .
They worry , say this group , about those unlucky enough to have been left behind before the Patriot Act made it so difficult to gain entry .
Verma , who has acted as translator , organizer and co-host of the gathering , says that if a refugee application case has material support ties , it simply languishes .
In some cases , it goes into a bureaucratic purgatory ; no action will move it forward , no answer will come .
" It 's simple , " Verma says .
" People now are going to lie .
Because we know we are not terrorists ...
Our common goal , " he begins , then pauses for the words .
" We are not going to harm any other people .
The SPDC is creating all the problems .
We are not terrorists . "
Verma works now for Asia Pacific Psychological Services , where he counsels newly arrived refugees and assists with their assimilation .
He just started in January and is excited as he is the first there to speak Burmese or Hindi -- which he speaks in addition to a little Thai and a smidgen of Nepalese .
Aung , Win , Verma , Latt and LaMorte are also involved in Burma advocacy through the Burmese American Democratic Alliance ( and their partner group for women , the Burmese Democratic Women 's Association ) .
They hold Burma Day events , where professors , resistance leaders and authors come to speak ; they work with the U.S. government on Burma advocacy -- including close work with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Tom Lantos , D - San Mateo ; and they keep themselves and their community informed on Burma issues and news .
They also speak at churches , telling their stories , and answering questions about the refugee ban in the Patriot Act and how it affects Burmese today -- like Eh Wah , who wants to be known by her alias .
Eh Wah is a member of the Karen ethnic group .
She fled to the border with her mom and two siblings when she was a little girl .
Her dad had been killed by SPDC soldiers when she was 1 .
After crossing the border and setting up camp with other refugees in Thailand , her mom made the several - day journey back to their village when Eh Wah was 5 .
Her mom , too , was gunned down by SPDC soldiers .
When she was older , Wah began doing intelligence and logistics work for the resistance .
To make her way around Asia , ferrying new arrivals in and out of Thailand , relaying information , she bought a fake passport and assumed a Thai identity .
Wah says she told the truth at her refugee interview ; not only did she support the fighters ( mostly by cooking meals , she says ) but she also assumed a false identity and worked on logistics for the resistance .
In early 2005 she was denied asylum .
Worse still , since she was already living in Queens , N.Y. , her fake passport was confiscated and now all she had to identify herself was her student ID .
" I can't even go to visit friends in other parts of the country , " she says , " since you need ID to fly . "
Human rights groups have taken on her case , and she is appealing her denial for asylum .
The Jan. 12 changes to the Patriot Act suggested that no applicant for refugee status or asylum would be banned simply because they once gave " a glass of water " or a bag of rice or a bed to one of their friends or family members who were part of an armed group -- provided that the group they once supported could be deemed safe after a government review .
Six of Burma 's armed independence groups were on the list for waivers , as well as two non-Burmese groups .
Days after the announcement , though , some refugee advocates were suspicious of what they saw as a partial but imperfect fix .
The fix made it unlikely that someone in Latt 's position , applying for refugee or asylum entry into the United States today , would have to worry about being barred .
But what about someone like Win , who ran messages between armed group members and who had weapons training ?
What about her husband Aung , who led a platoon of the People 's Democratic Front , an armed group not placed on the list ?
For now , their counterparts will likely continue to be banned -- though the changes do mark the political will to fix a widely acknowledged problem .
Some advocates , like Edith Mirante , an author who has focused on Burma for more than 20 years , wondered how the groups were chosen .
" It does strike me as interesting that most of the Burmese groups are Christian , " she said .
LaMorte worried about the same thing -- that Christian groups such as the Karen National Army and the Chin National Front , also on the list , might be getting preferential treatment .
But Jennifer Daskal , U.S. coordinator for Human Rights
Watch , says there are other reasons for some groups to be missing from the Department of Homeland Security 's exemption list .
" While the U.S. has waiver authority with regard to the material supporters of these groups , it will not exercise this authority until it has completed a terrorist assessment of that group . "
So if there is preferential treatment , as some have suggested , it does not mean other groups ' exclusion is permanent .
( But the only groups being reviewed now , says Agen , are the Hmong of Laos and the Montagnards of Vietnam .
Both groups were automatically banned , because the law does not make allowances for having fought alongside the United States . )
The department also announced plans to expand its waiver authority so that it can waive in not just so - called material supporters , but also members of the so - called terrorist groups themselves , if deemed not to be a threat .
This would mean that the groups would continue to be defined legally as terrorist groups , but then would be allowed refugee status or asylum through a waiver .
This would allow people like Win and Aung into the United States , but it still represents a problem to Daskal and others .
" The real problem , " says Daskal , " is that these individuals are labeled terrorists in the first place , coupled with the lack of waiver authority for members and combatants .
The administration 's proposed legislation solves the second problem by expanding the waiver authority , but does not touch the first -- the overly broad definitions of terrorism , which basically define any civilian who bears arms , even if engaged in a legitimate resistance movement , as a terrorist . "
Agen knew of no plans , he said , to change the definition of terrorism as it applies to refugees .
In a mood of melancholic nostalgia for the good old days when he was still in the Guinness Book as World ’s Hugest Infant , Norbizness sent me this snapshot , taken in the Sugarland Home for Unwed Mothers just before I put him up for adoption in 1948 .
I ca n’t say for sure , but I think feminism may have a slight image problem , at least among dudes who identify as “ Geek men . ”
Sadistic blamer Pris goaded me via email into perusing the afore - linked forum , wherein “ feminists ” — although nobody is suggesting that they should be denied “ equal rights ” — are lamented most poignantly as having abandoned femininity .
The burning question is this : “ Are there any aspects of feminism that make a woman more appealing to you , as a geek man ? ”
The answer , according to the responding experts on feminist theory , is ” no . ”
Feminism is a universal uglifier , in that it requires its apostles to betray their Prime Directive , i.e .
The Pursuit of Pornaliciosity , in an effort to fulfill their unholy destiny as masculine men-haters .
Says Geek man Mac D :
I am in no way saying that the female gender should not have equal rights and be able to pursue her dreams what ever they might be .
It ’s just when I go out on a date with a girl I like them to let me open the door for them and pick up the check . [ … ]
Feminazi ’s go just way to far .
They think to be equal they need to be exactly like a guy .
My ex-wife [… ] has what most people would call a mans job but she still acts like a girl .
Hear that , potential “ female gender ” dates of Mac D ?
So that everything he believes about what is right and good with the world does not come crashing down around him , you must pretend to be an impecunious weakling .
FYI : he does n’t specifically demand this , but , woman to woman , you might further bolster his precarious sense of privilege by coyly revealing a bit of dÃ©colletage at dinner , while speaking ( when spoken to , of course ! ) disparagingly about the 19th Amendment .
Play your cards right , and he just might throw his sportcoat onto a mud puddle for you , you sexy little equal , you .
To further illuminate the deplorable condition of feminist sex appeal , feminist scholar nerdwithnofriends has helpfully compiled a compendium of the different species of feminists , so that such women might be more easily identified , and reviled , by his fellow Geek men .
The “ man-haters , ” for example , “ tend to have lots of stock phrases that they bandy about , ” one of the most fearsome of which is the ubiquitous “ damn you and your patriarchy ! ”
Feminists , according to nerdwithnofriends , are also frequently heard stampeding around town intoning other common catch - phrases , such as “ If women ruled the world , there would be no war , starvation , disease , or death ” and “ You ca n’t possibly understand , you ’re an emotionally closed off MALE !!! ”
The din kicked up by these women is deafening .
Nerdwithnofriends , I should point out in the interest of fairness , wishes to set the record straight when he avers that of course men feel emotions ; it ’s just that men are “ simply ( on average ) more capable of controlling how they affect [ them ] . ”
And then there are the “ new - age feminists . ”
This unfuckable bunch base their ideology on the core belief that “ men are incapable of true creation because they are incapable of bearing a child .
( See Terminator Two for a quote ) . ” Nerdwithnofriends ’ analysis of the new - age feminist critique of the U.S. ’s “ truly amazing system of electrical distribution ” ( telephone poles are “ not very pretty ” ) is not to be missed .
Our professor ’s closing remarks identify the “ problem ” with “ ‘ modern ’ feminism ” : “ it no longer seeks equality for women , but superiority . ”
I know what you ’re thinking .
You ’re thinking that because these statements are merely the unsophisticated Internetian ( rhymes with “ Venetian ” ) prattle of terrified young honky dudes with Oedipal issues , this bit of blaming more or less constitutes shooting fish in a barrel .
And you ’re right .
But lately I ’ve been seeing a resurgence of a disturbing trend , which resurgence these Geek men illustrate perfectly .
Their remarks represent what I have scientifically determined to be the most prevalent misconception about American feminists ( aside from our famed dedication to the Three Hs : Hairiness , Humorlessness , and Hate ) : that we desire “ equality ” with men .
This notion of inadequate women clamoring for parity is undoubtedly a comforting one , since it postulates “ men ” as the ideal that is desperately sought by legions of shrill bitches who , ultimately , are doomed never to prevail owing to “ innate differences . ”
That equality with men is the last thing on the radical feminist ’s To Do list will not blow any veteran blamer ’s mind , but it is incumbent on the spinster aunt to reiterate every ten minutes or so that our objective is liberation from male dominance , not the opportunity to mimic the patriarchal model of oppression .
If you are not a feminist , you defend the conviction — here haplessly demonstrated by our Geek men — that women exist for male use .
Introducing feeds.reddit
Over the past few weeks , I ’ve been working on another new project .
I think it ’s finally time to tell people about it and what better place to start then here ?
So here ’s the site :
feeds.reddit.com
The idea is that it ’s a more social web feed ( RSS ) reader .
First , it ’s got a great interface for reading feeds over the Internet — it has key commands ( see the faq ) that let you easily breeze through stories while keeping track of what you ’ve read and have n’t read .
Then there ’s a simple URL you can go to any time , anywhere ( I visit it from my phone ) to see stories you have n’t read yet .
Second , just like on reddit , you can vote on items you like a lot .
This will go towards creating a list of the most popular items but it will also train a recommendations system to try to find other items and other feeds that you ’ll probably like as well .
The problem is that building this stuff up requires users .
So I hope you ’ll try it out .
It ’s got one - click import from Bloglines and imports OPML files from any other feed reader , so there ’s no harm in trying it out .
Let me know what you think .
You should follow me on twitter here .

The Flying Spaghetti MonsterA student has been suspended from school in America for coming to class dressed as a pirate .
But the disciplinary action has provoked controversy – because the student says that the ban violates his rights , as the pirate costume is part of his religion .
Bryan Killian says that he follows the Pastafarian religion , and that as a crucial part of his faith , he must wear ' full pirate regalia ' as prescribed in the holy texts of Pastafarianism .
The school , however , say that his pirate garb was disruptive .
Pastafarians follow the Flying Spaghetti Monster ( pictured ) , and believe that the world was created by the touch of his noodly appendage .
Furthermore , they acknowledge pirates as being ' absolute divine beings ' , and stress that the worldwide decline in the number of pirates has directly led to global warming .
Pastafarianism gained wide attention when its key prophet , Bobby Henderson , wrote to the Kansas School Board during the height of the controversy over ' Intelligent Design ' being taught in science classes .
His letter , also published on his website , demanded equal time be given to the teachings of the Flying Spaghetti Monster as was given to ID and evolutionary theory .
Since then , the Flying Spaghetti Monster has gained countless followers worldwide , although there are those who remain spagnostic .
The school , in North Buncombe , North Carolina , remains adamant that their decision to suspend Killian for a day has nothing to do with his religion , and quite a lot to do with his repeated refusal to heed warnings against wearing pirate outfits .
If you want to learn more about this religion and the Flying Spagetti Monster , go to Wikipedia

[ Note : This is a living page and I am periodically adding to it as I find new issues .
If Nokia fixes things in a future release , I will be sure to note it . ]
I 'm a former spare - time Newton Message Pad user and software developer .
I wrote , among other things , the Waba for the Newton Java virtual machine and the Hemlock Internet Search Tool for the Newton .
And a lot of Chinese applications .
I think I qualify as a power user and developer .
I 'm also an okay UNIX hacker , though I 'm better on BSD than on Linux , much less uLinux / BusyBox .
I recently purchased a Nokia N800 Internet Tablet to replace my aging Newton MessagePad 2100 .
The MessagePad 's touchscreen is going bad and with the advent of Intel Macs , I can no longer do any software development for it .
This is what makes the N800 particularly attractive to me : it 's a 100 % Linux box with phenominal features , and enables me to throw some code around again .
Woohoo !
Plus eventually , with luck , I might get Einstein running on it .
Einstein is a Newton emulator which runs ( slowly ) on N800 's predecessor ( the 770 ) .
The idea is not to convert the N800 to a Newton -- for me , that would be foolish -- but to give grumpy Newton users an easy way to migrate to a new platform .
And to open up a whole new set of applications to N800 users .
Indeed , in the primary Newton forum I told others that the N800 was the first PDA I 'd recommend as a Newton replacement .
The N800 is a great machine .
Technologically speaking , the N800 is a dramatic advance over the Newton .
At right is a Newton Message Pad 2100 .
It 's an old monster .
Its screen is twice the size of the N800 , but it 's only 320x480 .
It 's much larger and heavier than the N800 , mostly due to NiMH batteries .
It does have a much better stylus , so much so that I keep it in my N800 's bag .
[ Bag hint for N800 Owners : the N800 is about the same size and shape as the Nintendo DS Lite ] .
In contrast , the N800 has true multitasking .
It has a CPU that 's twice the speed .
It has 32 times as much SDRAM .
It has a color screen , and built - in 802.11 and bluetooth ( Newton users hack wireless and bluetooth with public domain plug-ins and cards ) .
It has a flat memory model and 2 SD cards rather than 2 PCMCIA slots .
It 's got a client USB rather than serial ports .
It 's got a great , modern web browser with JavaScript and Flash .
I like the N800 .
That 's why I bought it .
But as great as the N800 is , and as much of an advance it represents technologically over my 10 - year - old MessagePad , I am surprised at how much more sophisticated the MessagePad is than the N800 in terms of user experience .
The point of this essay is to discuss places where Nokia could improve the N800 quickly and easily , particularly from a Newton viewpoint .
But it might be useful first to mention some areas where the Newton really shines compared to the N800 , but which the N800 probably will never ( and in some cases should never ) adopt simply because the change in technology would require too large a tradeoff in other areas .
Unfortunate but probably necessary given the N800's intended purpose .
After this I 'll discuss some things that Nokia can ( and should ) steal from the Newton immediately .
Second , I 'll discuss some stupidities in the N800's interface , independent of Newton discussion , which Nokia ought to fix as soon as possible .
Third , I 'll mention some serious interface failures of individual applications which come with the device .
Great Things the Newton Has that the Nokia Doesn't
(... and Maybe Shouldn't )
The Newton uses an object - oriented database as its backing store for all applications .
All of an application 's documents are immediately in this database as soon as they are created or modified .
No need to " save " files or " open " files -- they 're just there .
Newton apps know where all of their documents are on the machine , and can sort them all , perform sophisticated searches on them , file them , move them from card to card to internal store , bundle them up and beam them to other Newtons , etc .
It 's all highly consistent and elegant .
The N800 uses a file system similar to a PC .
This makes for a surprisingly worse user experience , but on the other hand it allows for better interoperability with PCs via sharing cards etc. , and it allows for easier porting of applications , so that 's an unfortunate but probably worthy tradeoff nowadays ( sigh ) .

It 's all highly consistent and elegant .
The Newton has real , systematic handwriting recognition .
Not just a better HWR engine ( and it 's far superior to the very slow , inaccurate one in the N800 ) , but one which is part and parcel of the GUI itself .
On the Newton , you write directly in text fields and entry areas .
Various on - screen and hardware keyboards and other input systems are still available if you wish them .
The Newton 's HWR even cleans up shapes and doodles , has sophisticated built - in handwriting gestures ( " scrubbing " a word to delete it , writing a caret to make space to insert a word , etc. ) , and allows you to turn off the recognition or delay it indefinitely ( it'd then store and display the handwriting exactly as you had written , or if you preferred , in miniaturized form ) .
On the N800 , you click on a text field and up pops the keyboard or HWR entry window .
You enter your text letter by letter , and close the text entry mechanism .
Over and over again .
Clunky to say the least !
This was the crummy approach that PalmOS went with : but at least they had a built - in mechanism ( the Graffiti pad ) .
The N800 does not -- keyboards keep popping up and going away , even if you do n't want them to show up -- maybe you just wanted to select some text to copy it or move it .
The problem is that adopting a Newton - style HWR system would require incompatibility with a ton of existing GTK + code out there which assumes text entry in a more traditional fashion .

The Newton has powerful interapplication interaction features .
I 'm not talking about pipes and message - passing libraries .
The Newton uses C++ down deep , but its primary application language , called NewtonScript , is similar in many respects to Python and Lisp .
All Newton applications exist in the same collective environment , much like emacs applications or Squeak Smalltalk .
A dynamic environment like this lets applications offer parts of themselves to one another , patch features of the system in a revertible fashion , build onto themselves dynamically , and access collective global variables and data stores .
Replicating this in a protected - memory , preemptive multitasking environment like the N800 is perhaps less than reasonable , except under emulation of course ( like how Squeak or Einstein work on the 770 ) .
An example .
The Newton has an application called " Assist " , which basically consists of a text field and a " Do " button .
A screenshot of the Einstein emulator is shown at right with the File Manager in the background and Assist , the Clock , and Time Zones in the foreground .
In the Assist text field , I could write " Lunch Thursday with Glen in Fairfax " .
The system would realize that lunch is typically at 12:00 PM , then access one of the Names app's widgets to select which Glen I meant , and automatically figure out from Names where Fairfax might be .
Then Assist would access the Dates application to register a calendar event with the relevant information .
Easy , because all applications have the same interoperability mechanisms , and done not with message - passing protocols but with direct function calls and variable access of the relevant applications .

The Newton can print and fax and applications can easily do it because they rendered text the same way to the printer / fax as they did to the screen .
The N800 , to my knowledge , can do neither , and I do n't expect it to any time soon , CUPS and GIMPprint not withstanding .
But I would love to be proven wrong here .

But I would love to be proven wrong here .
The Newton has fantastic battery life and the N800's is only okay .
Specifically : 30 hours on a Newton ( and several weeks in standby ) vs 6 hrs and a several days standby on the N800 .
Well , those are the tradeoffs you make when you move to Linux , LiPoly , built - in wireless , and a color screen , I suppose .
The Newton also has a better instant - on mechanism than the N800 .
On the N800 , weirdly , you can't put the machine to sleep .
You have to wait for it to go to sleep .
On the Newton you can wait for it to sleep or you can flick the switch and it goes to sleep right then and there .
Same thing for the Palm .
I do n't understand why this is n't an option .
[ As an aside , you may not have realized this , but you can't set the N800 to its lowest brightness .
Try it .
Set it to its lowest value .
Then wait for the screen dimmer to kick in .
It 'll get lower .
Why ? ]
Now , the Newton also has flaws that the N800 should not copy :
No threading or top - level multitasking .
The Newton 's C++ innards are preemptively multithreaded , but not the NewtonScript application environment .
It is perfectly plausible for one app to hog as much time as it wanted .
And furthermore , TCP / IP is very slow because it had to all be done with event callbacks .
No file system .
Without one , Newton applications could not easily trade files with external systems , since the notion of " files " was somewhat alien .
No file system also meant that large streams of data ( web pages , for example ) were nontrivial to shuffle in and out and manage .
Doable but problematic .
No built - in keyboard except in the laptop - style Emate 300 shown at left .
Many people ( myself included ) can type much faster than we can write .
Sure , the Newton had an optional , loud keyboard which plugged into the serial port .
But even a slide - out thumb board would have been enormously helpful sometimes .
Over -reliance on developer toolkits tied to a proprietary , and dead , OS ( MacOS 9 ) .
Apple never opened their development tool sources .
Now with MacOS 9 gone , the Newton third - party development is extremely difficult .
Segmented memory space .
The Newton reserved chunks of RAM for the NewtonScript VM , the screen , C++ processes , globals , etc .
This made expanding RAM in one of those segments nearly impossible short of modifying the ROM .
Do n't expect Linux on this device any time soon .
What Nokia Could Steal from Apple Today
The N800's " Hildon " UI is shown at right , in a screenshot reduced 50 % , which gives you the sense of how large it looks on the N800 's small screen .
The N800 employs the GTK + toolkit , originally created for the GIMP photo - manipulation program but ( unlike the GIMP itself ) bearing the hallmarks of inexpert design .
It tries to copy much of the look and feel of Windows 95 , including IMHO its worst features .
Nokia then took this toolkit and tweaked it to look if not feel a little better , but could n't escape their cell phone roots : the modified version they created is very , very modal .
Much like PalmOS , only one application may appear at a time ; applications take up the entire screen ; and applications interact with one another rather less than in the Newton .
In fact , the modality relationships with PalmOS are interesting , in that Palm was started by ex-Newton third - party developers ( Graffiti was written for the Newton ) .
The Palm Pilot was created because the Palm did n't like where Apple was going : making ever more impressive ( and expensive ) machines , rather than a $ 300 machine , with a cut-rate but cheap GUI and OS , that customers could afford .
And they were right .
But strangely , with much better and cheaper hardware available now , and a much better OS ( Linux ) , Nokia is still basically copying features from a quick - and - dirty GUI designed for 8MHz processors .
At right is a screenshot from Einstein , the bit - for - bit Newton emulator on my Mac .
The UI is less flashy than Hildon of course , but anyone who 's used Newtons for a while will understand that it's a very sophisticated UI .
And there are a lot of things Nokia could trivially steal from it .
I 've hilighted in red some simple items I 'll discuss below .
Windows Which Don't Take Up the Whole Screen
On the Newton you can have multiple applications displayed at one time .
Typically one application is in the background taking up the whole screen ( such as the Note Pad shown at right ) .
And other applications , or subwindows of the main application , may float freely on the screen , such as the number pad at right .
The earlier screenshot of Einstein shows further floating applications .
This allows for drag - and - drop or via-event application interaction which largely does n't exist on the N800 .
On the N800 all dialogs and notification windows are fixed in location and no additional windows are permitted .
You just have one application take over or another , PalmOS - style .
I understand the basic argument for having windows take up the whole screen : the screen is small , and required window manipulation at that size is less than optimal .
This is the lesson that Palm learned .
And indeed on the Newton most " primary " apps ( note pad , calendar , etc. ) take up the whole screen .
But this should n't preclude the ability to make draggable , small windows .
There are lots of useful utility applications that can exist by floating on top of the main , screen - filling app .
You could have a small floating calculator , or a Chinese input window , or a little dictionary or spell - check app , or a floating pasteboard , or pop - up timer .
Not on the N800 .
Stability The Newton is rock - solid stable .
The N800 is not .
In the course of using the machine I 've had status bar icons disappear , Opera crash once or twice , menus refuse to go away without me choosing something , and the machine suddenly disavow all knowledge of its SD card .
But the worst by far is the email program , which crashes as a matter of course .
It 's like crashzilla .
The Newton crashes so little that I had forgotten what crashes looked like on a PDA .
Changeable Icon Bar Icons
The Icon Bar on the Newton is for whatever apps you find useful to place there .
Just drag them from the Newton 's equivalent of the File Manager .
But on the N800 , there are three big , overly - spaced icons which cannot be replaced ; and only the third one , which pops up a menu , allows part of that menu to be changed .
What the point of that is I have no idea .
I suspect the reason why there are only three big icons is because ( 1 ) Nokia wants them hittable by your finger and ( 2 ) Nokia wanted to leave space for the " small " icons which indicate running processes .
Running process icons are cute but not very useful : they replicate the functionality of an existing icon , the oddly - shaped icon .
Why not get rid of them , make the icon bigger , and squeeze the icons together a little bit , and you 'd have space for six custom icons .
No squeezing ?
You 'd still get five custom icons out of it .
Decent System Fonts and Icons The N800 has okay fonts .
But the Newton used bold system fonts throughout , resulting in high readability even in poor light situations .
The N800's GTK - inspired small application - function icons are atrocious .
The worst I 've seen on a PDA .
Tiny , with large borders of whitespace around them , faded , obscure , and often difficult to make out .
Compare to the Newton 's icons , which are bold , professional , have little white space , and are easy to read .
This is how you make icons , Nokia .
More on this later .
Out - of - the - Box Unicode Support GTK + supports Unicode .
But how could the N800 have not come with a Unicode font built - in from the start to display in the web browser , much less a Unicode entry system built - in ?
At right is what we get in Opera when we visit ChinaNews.com .
In contrast , the Newton was the first device ( PDA or computer ) to use Unicode as its foundation , and its web browsers could even display Chinese characters .
Like the N800 , the Newton did n't come with , say , Chinese fonts by default ( come on , this was 1995 ) .
But Chinese fonts for the Newton were easily found by even rank beginners and loaded without any difficulty ; and they worked everywhere instantly .
At right is a screenshot of some fonts I ported to the Newton , including a slight tweak to a preexisting Chinese font .
All could be printed to Postscript printers .
On the N800 , installation of Unicode fonts -- or any fonts -- is , shall we say , an adventure .
For an " international " company , Nokia 's machine is fairly unimpressive in the Unicode font scene .
Cut and Paste Through Drag - And - Drop
On the Newton there is no concept of cut and paste per se .
You do n't select an object ( text , picture , file , whatever ) and then choose " cut " .
Instead , you select the object and drag it to the side of the screen .
When you lift up , it sticks there , in miniaturized form , as a " clipping " .
If you Tap - Drag rather than just Drag , the object is copied to rather than moved to the clipping .
Depending on settings , you can have many clippings attached to the various sides of the screen .
Next , you go to some other application or different document as you like , then drag the clipping to the location you want and it unhooks and moves there .
If you Tap - Drag from a clipping , a copy is made from the clipping and the clipping remains .
If you Drag the clipping to a nonsensical place , it is deleted .
You can also move clippings to another location on the edge of the screen .
There is also a notion of a " primary " clipping , which is the last clipping that you touched with your stylus .
Some applications have " cut " and " copy " and " paste " menu options , for the benefit of people with keyboards -- if you choose " cut " , a clipping is automatically created on the side of the screen and becomes primary .
If you choose " paste " , the primary clipping is unhooked and pasted in .
Sadly , the N800 can't do anything like this : it uses a cut and paste from the menu , with only a single clipboard .
I was all set to write a Status Bar Icon that allowed me to drag text or pictures to the Icon and store it , then drag it off of the Icon 's menu to some other application .
But Nokia has declared that no drag - and - drop shall leave an application 's main window !
No , seriously , that 's actually what they wrote : ( part 12 )
Compared to the PC environment , items cannot be dragged outside the application area ( i.e. into Task Navigator or Status Bar ) .
If user drags an item out of the application area and then lifts the pen up , the item will be placed back to its original location .
So much for interapplication interaction .
Even if this were possible , such a Status Bar Icon would be further complicated by a bad design decision in the N800 : if you tap in any text area , the keyboard always pops up .
Even if you 're just selecting text to drag it , the keyboard still pops up , sometimes obscuring the very text you were trying to drag ( this particularly happens in text fields embedded in the web browser ) .
There needs to be an interface mechanism to allow you to select text without the keyboard coming up and smashing everything .
Here 's a recommendation : if you tap in a text area , and there is no bluetooth keyboard attached , then the virtual keyboard pops up .
If you drag in a text area to select text , you should have the option , in the control panels , of having the N800 not pop up the keyboard .
If you tap - drag , then it pops up the keyboard .
And please , in the Notes application if I even press the italics or bold buttons , the keyboard still pops up .
What the ...?
While we 're on the subject of the keyboard : the N800's on - screen keyboard ( large and small ) drops every fifth letter or so unless you go very slowly .
I 've learned to use the backspace key a * lot* .
Screen Rotation
I find it unbelievable that in 2007 a PDA has come out which cannot rotate its screen .
The Newton did this in 1995 , and any orientation you liked ; you could also move about the button bar ( see the first Einstein picture in this article ) .
The Palm Pilot can do it , for heavens ' sakes .
At right , as a quick cut - and - paste hack , I rearranged the elements in the screenshot at top to show how screen rotation might look .
Routing Many Newton applications have a routing menu which allows you to send a document ( a note , a drawing , a contact 's card , a calendar , etc. ) to be processed by some other application , or sent somewhere .
The basic Newton routing menu can print , fax , beam , duplicate , and delete documents .
Applications plug into this menu to add more routings -- for example , you might email a document , or send it via bluetooth , or upload it as a web page , or have it translated into Spanish , or get a word count of it .
This is in some sense similar to MacOS X's Services menu .
On the N800 we could allow objects to be sent via bluetooth to another N800 , for example .
Move In Addition to Save As mentioned , the Newton does n't have a file system : it has a database .
When I create a document , it 's automatically in the database .
The N800 takes a desktop - computer approach instead , which is much less functional for a PDA : you save documents in a file system .
That 's fine I guess , but at lest the N800 should allow you to have the option of moving a document to a new location , from within an application other than the File Manager , instead of just saving it to a new location .
While we 're on the subject of the file manager , files are not easily copied or duplicated with drag - and - drop .
They can only be moved .
Tap - drag should enable duplication and copying of a file , and drag should enable moving a file .
More Expressive Standard Widgets Longhand is slow , and so the Newton UI designers spent a great deal of time making a large number of powerful widgets shared by all applications .
GTK + does n't have a fifth of the widgets the Newton has standard , and it really shows : different N800 applications have different methods for entry .
One place the Newton particularly excels in here is in its persistent use of a variety of standard combo - box - like structures .
Here are a few .
Some pop-ups are meant to label a text field , like the one at right .
Similar pop-ups fill in the text field for you , either with common items , or with one of the last N items you had entered for that particular text field , or both .
Other pop-ups are more traditional , but augmented with additional menu choices .
There are a wide variety of pop-ups for times and dates .
Shown at right are pop-ups for time intervals , calendar days , and date intervals .
There are sophisticated pop-ups for choosing locations as well .
Here I 'm picking a new home location for my time zone .
Tokyo looks nice .
You can also click directly on the map and a menu will pop up of all the cities in the vicinity .
There are even pop-ups which bring forth entire subelements of other applications .
Here , after clicking on " Invitees " in the calendar application , I get a popup showing contacts from the Contacts application .
The N800 uses very few pop-ups or other time - saving widgets .
For example , to add a field to a contact , I must first click on a weird " > > " button and choose " Edit ... " .
Then I must click on " Add field " , choose a field , and press " OK " , then " OK " again .
All told six button taps and two dialog boxes when I could have done this with a single pop -up menu .
I am afraid to say it , but the N800 has a great many frustrating dialog box mazes like this one .
More on problems with the Contacts app later .
Useless confirmation dialog boxes show up a lot .
Here 's one from the Bookmarks application .
I have just dragged my Reddit bookmark into the N800 folder ( for purposes of demonstration here ) .
And I receive : a confirmation box to move the Reddit bookmark into the N800 folder !
Is n't that what I just did ?
On every other operating system I can think of , when you perform a drag - and - drop , it happens -- but the N800 requires you to do an extra tap to confirm what you just did .
I suspect one reason for all of Nokia 's verification dialogs is several standard N800 applications ( Contacts , Bookmarks , File Manager , etc. ) do n't have Undo .
So they 're being way overly cautious , verifying every drag - and - drop even if it 's reversable .
This kind of thing happens a lot , forcing you to do lots of extra taps when you should have just performed a single pen operation .
Even though they should have Undo , even without it , such trivially reversable operations should n't have annoying confirmation .
While we 're on the subject : why is there no " New Bookmark " icon on the button bar ?
But there is a " New Folder " icon .
I , like most people , construct bookmarks ten times as often as bookmark folders .
I spent an hour today adding bookmarks , and every time I had to tap three times to wend myself through a deep menu .
A Better Button Bar The Newton designers expended considerable effort reducing the number of taps necessary to do something .
As a result , the Newton in my experience requires about half to a third as many taps to do things as WindowsCE does .
The N800's not bad here , but it could be significantly improved .
The N800's big failure here is its over - reliance on a single menu with submenus and subsubmenus .
To create a new document I often need to tap at least three times to wend myself throughout the menu , not including the many taps to save the old document .
On the Newton , it 's two or less , because all the menus are split out onto the button bar , and documents are stored in a database ( no " Save " ) .
Here 's the Newton 's contacts application 's button bar at bottom :
The little diamond icons indicate that clicking on a text button pops up a menu ; " New " pops up " Person " , " Company " , and " Group " .
Pick one and you 're on your way -- no need to save the old document ( as previously mentioned ) .
If you have a very common operation , it 's fine to have a textual or icon button just for it .
The " i " menu is the Information menu , and typically contains About , Help , and Preferences .
The folder files the document under a folder , and the envelope , as mentioned , is the routing menu .
The " X " is the close box .
The Newton 's main widgets are all on the bottom , which is easier to tap .
How could we improve the N800 button bars , allowing for a bit more Newton - ish operation ?
By allowing the user to organize the button bars .
Perhaps the most elegant mechanism would be a procedure by which the user could select a submenu or menu item , drag it to the button bar , and assign it an icon or a textual button like the Newton ( and to rename the text ) .
There 's plenty of space on the button bar right now ( see gripes later on ) for whole menu structures .
MacOS
X does this in a particularly elegant fashion , albeit with no option for menus .
Here the button - bar - reorganization panel has popped up on my text editor .
The Mac also allows for different sized icons in the button bar : the N800 could very easily do this as well , obviating some my complaints below about poor icon sizes .
These changes need to be persistent -- they need to stay that way when you quit the program and relaunch it .
See below for more discussion of persistence .
This goes along with the need for changeable Icon bar icons .
I do n't want to have to wend my way through a menu to find an application to launch .
I want to have it right there on my Icon bar , launched in one tap .
Why can't I do this ?
Bad , But Easily Fixed GUI Design Flaws
Nokia Loves Triangles
Icons which perform different functions should look nothing like one another .
Yet we have at least five different major functions , all being represented with the same basic shape .
Icons which perform the same basic function should look largely identical .
But even the two menu - scrolling triangles have different aspect ratios !
The triangles which pop up various objects are all different looking .
And to make matters worse , there are other strange triangular icons which also pop up menus , such as this one : Note to Nokia : that icon usually implies " Fast Forward " .
Nokia seems to have a triangle fetish .
The eight triangles at right are all taken from the N800 interface , and they largely do different things .
One of them pops up the menu .
One of them pops up a combo-box .
One of them reveals additional headers in the mail program .
Two of them scroll menus .
One of them scrolls the scroll bar .
One of them specifies the sort ordering in a column .
And one of them appears in button which , counter - intuitively , changes the relative ordering of items in a list .
This is doubly problematic :
Can you tell what icon does what function ?
Have fun .
Here are some Newton icons for similar operations .
This icon : appears alongside text in combo boxes , and this one : appears alongside text inside buttons which pop up menus .
This icon : performs global scrolling down for the main document , and this one : performs local scrolling for small windows and menus .
Note the consistency .
Bad Icons
Many PDAs have settled on one or two icon sizes : a " big " one and a " small " one .
The N800 has .
One " large " one , which exists only for coolness factor , and two " small " ones , one which is a nice 32 pixels high , and one which is slightly smaller for some reason ( typically 18 - 24 pixels high ) .
To make matters worse , the icons tend to be cryptic .
Here 's some fun from the email program .
This icon : apparently means " put a star on my envelope " .
I 'm just guessing here .
This icon : means , I imagine , " rock beats paper " .
Which everyone knows is false .
In rock - paper - scissors , paper beats rock .
This set of icons : means " reply " , " reply - all " , and " forward " .
If the reply - all was n't there , would you have any idea which one was forward and which one was reply ?
There 's no way to find out except for pressing the icon , a potentially destructive operation .
And here is yet another down - arrow icon for scrolling to the next item ( in this case the next message ) .
While we 're on the subject , let 's examine the Nokia Button Bar .
Notice two things .
First , the icons are tiny compared to the button bar .
Here 's the button bar at approximately the size it appears on the N800 in reality , at least on my Mac :
Note the considerable amount of wasted whitespace , which only emphasizes the icons ' small size .
A number of the icons throughout applications are also light in color on a big white background , making them quite surprisingly hard to read on the N800 screen .
Making matters worse , there 's a useless decorative border on the bottom of the button bar which does nothing when tapped .
If Nokia had seen fit to change the background , make the icons larger ( there 's plenty of space ! ) , move them closer together , and delete the borders so as to increase the vertical hit - space , we'd have a much easier to use toolbar .
How can we know this ?
Because there 's another bar on the same screen which employs Nokia 's " slightly bigger " icons on a legible background : the Status Bar !
Shown below .
Reduced by 50 % to Nokia screen size :
Now this button bar is a little better .
The icons are slightly larger ( they could stand to be larger still ) , much more legible , and I find them a bit easier to hit .
Quite weird , having two button bars on the same screen , one better than the other , in the same exact UI .
Note to Nokia : when the status bar overflows it should extend in width .
I do n't need to see the whole application title .
It should also shrink to fit the icons there .
And what 's with the status bar hanging down by about five pixels , pushing the available application space down by that much ?
Immobile Windows
The N800 has various dialogs and notification boxes .
For absolutely no good reason , none of them can be moved .
The most egregious example is the notification box at right : the email application 's " Deleting " notification .
It 's important to understand that this window pops up in a non-modal fashion : you can still do things in the background .
That 's nice .
What 's not nice is that the window obscures the scroll bar up - button , and sometimes the entire scroll bar thumb , and there 's no way to get around it .
Why can't you move this window ?
I really have no idea .
Lest you think this is just an email thing : I 've seen the same immobile non-modal dialog in at least one other standard application .
Why does this non-modal window exist at all ?
In the same application , when you 're performing another non-modal background function -- connecting to the server and downloading mail -- the notification appears inside the button bar , pushing some button bar buttons to the side :
That 's a perfectly good approach .
Why ca n't Nokia adopt it everywhere ?
Note to Nokia : the white " Connecting " text on blue background is very close to unreadable .
Hard - To- Manipulate Widgets
At right is the N800's File Manager application .
It 's a pretty decent program all in all .
But it nicely illustrates some places where widgets could be significantly improved .
The blue bar down the middle is the split - pane divider , and it 's supposed to be movable .
But it 's very hard to do so .
You have to hit it precisely , and even then nothing may happen .
And it 's ridiculously thin : 5 pixels wide .
On a screen this dense , it 's far too thin to manipulate easily .
The bar should be at least twice as wide .
Also , it appears that in some apps the split - pane divider will just ignore you for a while , then allow you to move it only later .
It 's got to be a bug .

Also , it appears that in some apps the split - pane divider will just ignore you for a while , then allow you to move it only later .
It 's got to be a bug .
Next to the blue bar is a scroll bar .
It 's also extremely thin and hard to hit , though if you hit the divider you 're likely to get the scroll bar instead ( and vice versa ! ) .
The up / down arrows on the scroll bar are close to microscopic .
The scroll bars also need to be about twice as thick .
And compared to the ugly option of having the scroll bar next to the divider bar , is there some law that says you can't put the scroll bar to the left of the things it scrolls ?
For some reason the scroll bar is set to scroll by the screenful if you click in the white area .
This is an ancient scrolling behavior popularized by the original Macintosh 128 .
For a small device with a variable - sized thumb on its scroll bars , the better choice is the modern NeXTSTEP - style scrolling to the location clicked on the scroll bar .
That way you do n't have to hit the thumb -- just hit the scrollbar and start moving .
We 're not in the 1980s any more .
To the right of the rightmost scrollbar is a gutter as wide as the scrollbar itself , which eats into application space .
I 've been told that one reason it may exist is to move the scrollbar away from the edge of the screen , where it can be hard to hit .
All right , fair enough .
But why not just make the scroll bar wider to fill in that area ?
Why have an area on the edge that can't be used ?
On some apps the gutter actually is an extension of the scrollbar .
On others it 's not .
And in full - screen mode the gutter goes away .
Why ?
Get rid of the gutter .
Indeed , all applications have an additional 5 - pixel or so white border around the top and both sides -- more noticable in the web browser -- which disappears if you go into full - screen mode .
It serves no function except to reduce the available space an application can use .
And to make the app uglier .
The column headers ( Name , Date , Size ) are fixed .
You cannot resize them , reorder them , or hide ones you do n't want !
In this example , I do n't want to see the date of my files , as they 're all 12/31/1969 .
Why can't I get rid of the Date column as a menu option ?
In OS X for example , there 's usually a menu option where you can select or deselect columns ; columns can be dragged relative to one another ; and they can be resized at will .
And if the Date is resized , it changes to smaller and smaller formats .
In some N800 applications , such as the email app , you can resize the columns , but it 's excruciatingly difficult to do so without accidentally selecting them .
In the File Manager , even this minor option is unavailable .
While we 're on the subject of hard - to - hit widgets , this is a good button : and this is not a good button : .
One is easy to hit with the stylus , the other is not only painfully small , it 's hard to read and lacking in whitespace .
I understand why the N800 has both .
It 's not a good reason .
Also , on the N800 , only a few apps have persistent state widgets .
If I adjust the column sizes in the email program , or change the location of the slider bar , it stays that way after I quit the program and return .
Good job !
But if I do the same thing in the File Manager , it does n't stay that way .
This tells me that widget persistence has to be programmed in on a per-app basis and is not a built - in feature of the GUI .
That needs to be fixed .
All sliders should be persistent .
All scroll bars should be persistent .
All column orderings , sizes , and choices of which columns are displayed should be persistent .
Pop -ups should be persistent if they have state features .
Table orderings should be persistent .
Tree view states should be persistent .
Notification windows should be movable and persistent ( and non-modal ones should n't exist -- they should be moved to the button bar as discussed before ) .
File choosers ' default directory start - points should be persistent .
Windows Style Alerts
Linux tends to copy Windows even when it 's reallybad .
Here 's a place it should be copying OS X instead .
OS X's dialogs and dialog buttons actuallythings and only occur when it's
At right is one of worst GUI mistakes I 've seen in the N800 : the Delete Verification panel .
It 's bad design on quite a lot of levels : it has a radio button list with only one option ; it has badly - named buttons ; it has a " Note " with no value ; it only exists because of a program flaw .
Allow me to vent here .
On the Mac , dialog buttons are actions .
" Cancel " is an action , but " OK " is not an action , it is an agreement .
" Delete " is an action .
It makes it clear what you 're going to do when you press that button .
Plus , what 's with the Note ?
Beginners would n't know the difference between headers and messages , and experts would n't ever make the assumption the Note warns against .
No email program does that .
A message is a message .
Ideally this ridiculous window could have been replaced with a simple window that says :
Permanently Delete This Message ?
[ Delete ] [ Delete Only on N800 ] [ Cancel ]
Or if you 're using IMAP , it 's should simply be :
Permanently Delete This Message ?
[ Delete ] [ Cancel ]
The question remains : why does this window even exist ?
Because unlike practically every other email program on the planet , when you delete a message on the N800 , it is deleted .
Not moved to a Trash folder .
Gone from the server forever .
If the app instead moved to Trash , this window would n't even be necessary , as the action would be undoable .
While we 're on the subject , so far as I 've been able to tell the email program is incapable of clearing your email cache .
So if you set it to download 50 messages , the next day it downloads more messages to add to that 50 .
You can't restrict it to just 50 , and you can't clear them out to save memory , short of removing the account .
Oh yes , and the email is stored on your internal flash with no option to move it to a card : it just slowly burns your flash out .
Big Bad Menus
The N800 has a nice feature .
If you press on the screen with your finger , certain menus and keyboards pop up in " big " size , easy to select with your finger rather than with the stylus .
Unfortunately this feature is marred by a really stupid menu mechanism .
Consider the " big- size " menu at right , which popped up when I pressed my finger on one of the icons at its left .
What 's wrong with it ?
Several things .
It 's powerfully wasteful of space .
If I 'm selecting with my finger , I want to use the whole screen to pick items , but I 'm restricted to the " standard " width menu , which can only hold four items !
What in the world is the giant grayed - out scroll triangle doing there , wasting an entire line ?
Why not just have no scroll triangle there , which tells me the same thing ?
It 's standard practice on a number of OSes for the menu triangle to only appear when you actually can use it .
For example , at right is a MacOS X menu in three parts : the start of the menu , scrolling in the middle of it , and down at the bottom of it .
The scroll triangles adjust the menu -- I wish I were kidding you -- by the pixel .
Not the item .
The pixel .
It 's really fun pressing and holding for things to slowly go by .
It 's not hard to fix this .
Just have menus which fill the whole screen in a grid as shown in the imaginary screenshot at right .
If you need more space , make a big right - pointing arrow , and when you press it , a whole new grid slides in to replace the current one ( plus a left - pointing arrow is introduced perhaps ) .
But in many cases , such as the example at right , no arrow is necessary .
The entire menu could have easily fit on the screen .
You just need a little space to click on the background behind the menu in order to cancel it .
One issue with this revised version is how to navigate submenus or go back to a supermenu .
Submenus are easy : if you press one , the menu fades away and the submenu fades in .
To go to a supermenu , perhaps a " back " button might appear at left along with the left arrow , if any .
I see no problem with modality here -- this is where short - term modality is expected by the user -- unlike other places in Nokia 's interface .
Note to Nokia : why is it that if you press the icon with your finger , the menu that pops up displays items with small icons rather than the large icons used everywhere else ?
As a result you get a few more , slightly shorter menu items .
Surely you could squish the regular large menus together a bit more in a similar fashion .
Application - Specific Interface Failures That Should Be Fixed
I 'll continue to add here as I find things .
The Opera Web Browser
The web browser is wonderful .
Except when you zoom in at the right amount .
At which time it seems to misunderstand that the fonts have changed in size , resulting in the text mess at right .
The Nokia keyboard has a tendency to drop letters .
In Opera , this translates into URL typos , most of which need to be corrected by clicking at a location and typing a single letter .
But when you click in the URL field , the keyboard pops up and the entire URL is selected .
You have to manually deselect it and click where you wanted again .
Maddening .
.
You have to manually deselect it and click where you wanted .
Maddening .
The procedure for selecting text on - screen is counterintuitive : you tap - drag .
And it does n't work if your selection starts at a link : Opera incorrectly loads the link instead .
The Contacts Application
Unlike the web browser , the contacts application is decidedly not wonderful .
Compared to the Newton 's Names application , it 's a very poor program .
I have no compassion for Nokia here : they are a cell phone company and a well - designed contacts program GUI should be a central competency of the corporation ; and they 've made this program front and center , non-removable , in their OS UI .
The primary function I want to do with a contacts program is : look up phone numbers .
The secondary function is : look up addresses .
I do n't make internet chats or voip calls from my contacts program .
I use the chat program .
I do n't initiate email messages from my contacts program .
I use an email program .
A contacts program exists fundamentally to store , view , and edit contacts .
Yet Nokia has seen fit to make this basic function unusually difficult , or ( in the case of snail mail , see below ) impossible , in order to put front and center features which , in my opinion , no one wants .
The new MacBook comes with what Apple calls a " 13.3 - inch glossy widescreen display . "
The key word there is " glossy , " and it serves as a warning to the scant few Mac users who immediately know what it means in this context .
In recent years , PC laptops have started sprouting LCD screens with shiny surfaces .
Glossy , you might say .
It started with just a few models .
Today , you 'll be hard - pressed to find any PC laptops with non-glossy screens at your local Best Buy or Circuit City .
Meanwhile , Apple 's laptops have stuck with their traditional matte - finish screens .
That 's changed with the introduction of the MacBook and its glossy display .
The MacBook Pro now has a glossy display option as well .
So , what 's the big deal ?
Consider some synonyms for the word " glossy . "
Gleaming .
Shiny .
Reflective .
Now you 're getting it .
When the screen is off , it 's basically a mirror .
Fine .
Who cares what it looks like when it 's off , right ?
Let 's boot this baby up and bask in the glow of our lustrous , glistening , shimmering screen !
Is that a staircase ?
Windows or fluorescent lights ?
You decide .
These pictures demonstrate why so many Mac users read the phrase " glossy display " with a heavy heart .
Reflections !
Glare !
These are not good things !
I did n't have hunt for these pictures , by the way .
They were taken from the very first " unofficial " set of MacBook photos that I saw on the web today .
This is really what this kind of screen looks like .
When they say " glossy , " they mean it .
Glossy displays have effectively taken over the entire laptop market .
Why are they so popular ?
Here are three possible reasons .
They are better than matte - finish displays .
They are cheaper than matte - finish displays .
People are idiots .
Before we look at the whole market , let 's briefly consider only Apple , the latecomer to the shiny screen party .
Why did Apple go glossy ?
When answering that question , reason number two looks very persuasive .
If the entire PC laptop market has moved to glossy displays , it may be difficult for Apple to find anyone to sell them matte - finish displays at all , let alone sell them at competitive prices .
But I do n't know how different the manufacturing process is for glossy and matte - finish screens .
Maybe it 's trivial to make one or the other in the same plant .
More broadly speaking , I suppose it 's possible that glossy displays are somehow inherently cheaper to manufacture than matte - finish displays — enough so that the entire industry switched over .
Again , I do n't know enough about the actual manufacturing process to definitively rule this out , but my gut tells me that it 's unlikely .
As for reason number one , that glossy displays are " better " than matte - finish displays , I must rule by fiat .
For any reasonable definition of " better " that I can think of , the answer is a big , fat , " no . "
Maybe you do n't think glare is an issue .
Maybe you always view the screen head - on in perfectly diffuse lighting .
Maybe you think the benefits of the glossy screen outweigh the drawbacks .
Whatever the reason , we 'll just have to agree to disagree on this issue .
You can probably stop reading now .
Now we come to reason number three : people are idiots .
Put another way , people like shiny things .
When the glossy screens first started to appear in Best Buy and CompUSA , the contrast with their non-glossy brethren was striking .
Walking into the laptop aisle , your eye was immediately drawn to the glossy displays .
Aside from the shine , there 's also a perceptible difference in sharpness and color saturation on glossy screens .
These things stand out .
In " shopping mode , " this is all people see .
Shiny , saturated , sharp .
Customers are n't trying to read the screens or move the laptops to different locations in different kinds of lighting .
Shopping is almost always an emotional experience , not a rational one .
The fallout is predictable , particularly in the world of retail electronics .
I 'll just give my two favorite examples .
Electronics departments usually have the products out on the floor or lined up against a wall , grouped by product type .
This makes " comparison shopping " easy .
People like to compare ; it makes them feel more confident about their decisions .
Confident people spend .
Unfortunately , people are lousy at making sensible comparisons .
Take televisions , for my first example .
When comparison shopping for TVs of a given size , there is one picture quality attribute that dominates all others : brightness .
Brighter TVs " look better . "
Differences in color saturation , uniformity , sharpness , black level , you name it , can all be overshadowed by cranking up the brightness on one TV .
You can take out a video essentials DVD and " prove " that one TV has better objective picture quality than another , and people will still insist that you 're wrong and proceed to buy the brighter TV instead .
The second example is the world of speakers .
The rule here is similar .
Louder speakers " sound better . "
This one is even more crushing .
You can make nearly anyone buy anything in one of those " listening rooms " by simply making one set of speakers slightly louder than another .
Incidentally , you can also see this in the recording industry .
The volume of recorded music has been creeping up for years .
Music on modern CDs is compressed to an absurd degree , destroying the dynamic range in order to increase the overall volume .
Different product , same principle : louder " sounds better . "
Back to shiny laptop screens .
It seems pretty obvious to me that shiny " looks better , " and that 's why it 's taken over the laptop market .
This makes me sad , and not a little bitter .
Thus , reason number three .
People are idiots .
I declare it the winner !
I can't really rule out the cost issue without more information , of course .
But for now , I 'm sticking with the idiot theory .
With that premise , let 's try to assign blame for the MacBook glossy conversion .
There 's an idiot here somewhere , but maybe it's not the consumer this time .
Mac users are an odd bunch .
We 've been buying matte - finish laptops long after the PC laptop world went glossy , and there has n't exactly been any outcry over the " gloss gap . "
So it seems to me that Mac users are not the idiots here , demanding shiny screens on their various < blank > Books for emotional reasons .
We 've set aside cost for the sake of argument , and we 've eliminated the idiot consumer as a factor .
Only Apple itself is left .
The long - standing tradition of Apple punditry demands that Apple be personified in the form of one Steve Jobs , and so I will now consider the possibility that all blame for the GlossBook and GlossBook Pro lies entirely on him .
Jobs has proven time and again that he 's willing to place superficial perception well above more practical concerns .
If he thinks that shiny screens " look better , " then it 's not so far - fetched to imagine that he initiated the move to glossy screens .
I certainly would n't put it past him .
So , to sum up .
Glossy screens : bad .
People : idiots .
Steve Jobs : insane .
This post : too long .
Blah .
