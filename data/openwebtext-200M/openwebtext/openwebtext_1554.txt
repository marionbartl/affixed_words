Fisker have been hard at work behind the scenes , locking down over half a billion dollars in DoE funding plus an additional $ 115 million in private sector funding so far this year .
They are reportedly on track to begin sales of their Fisker Karma luxury hybrid later this year and with a pre-order book already 1,600 names long it seems they ’ll have no shortage of customers .
They are having the first generation of Karma sedans built by Valmet in Finland ( they build Porsche Boxters as well ) and they ’re targeting 15,000 units per year in global sales , a number which most industry analysts expect to fall far short of actual global demand .
The Karma will be utilising battery systems from the US based , MIT founded company A123 Systems ( NASDAQ : AONE ) , who have themselves been garnering significant attention of late .
Fisker is not so secretly working on “ Project Nina ” which , as Joe Biden so kindly overshared with us all last year , will consist of a coupe , a sedan and a crossover and we are expecting to see these hitting the road in late 2012 or early 2013 at targeted price point of $ 40,000 USD before tax credits .
That should place it at the high end of the affordable car market for middle class America and once the significantly reduced gasoline expenditure is calculated and the “ cool ” factor is thrown in I think Fisker and Tesla , with the Model S , are going to have very , very busy factories and one hell of a fascinating rivalry .
The Fisker Karma is currently on a tour of the US , visiting the 42 cities that have or will have Fisker dealers , just incase you are lucky enough to live in one of these cities we have included the full press release from Fisker as well as a list of dates and cities .

How Turkey Manufactured a Coup Plot
On Feb. 22 , Cetin Dogan , a retired four - star Turkish Army general , was detained and subsequently imprisoned by Turkish prosecutors , accused of masterminding an elaborate plot in 2002 and 2003 to topple the country ’s newly elected conservative Islamist government .
He and the scores of other military officers who were also arrested — both retired and on active duty — face horrifying charges .
Among other deeds , the officers stand accused of planning to shoot down a Turkish fighter jet and blow up two mosques during Friday prayers , so as to incite parliament to declare martial law .
And this is just the latest in a wave of arrests targeting hundreds of retired military officers and their alleged civilian accomplices since early 2008 , on charges ranging from murder to coup attempts .
For us , however , this particular arrest comes very close to home :
We are Çetin Dogan ’s daughter and son - in - law .
We have observed intimately the development of the case against him , and the closer one looks at the details of this case , the more untenable the government ’s argument becomes .
Rather , his arrest , coupled with the rash of recent anti-military arrests , suggest that the future prospects of Turkish democracy are more ominous than most people think .
The military has long set the ground rules of Turkish politics .
Its hard line defending secularism has resulted in frequent clashes with political movements it views as " soft " on Islam , such as the Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) , which has governed the country since November 2002 .
Periodically , the military has intervened , bringing down governments and , on occasion , establishing periods of military rule , most recently from 1980 to 1983 .
The narrative that has captured the headlines in Turkey and the Western media is that the recent arrests , signifying the end of an era of military tutelage , are good news for Turkish democracy .
Provided the AKP and its leader , Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan , do not abuse their power , the story line goes , Turkey will ultimately emerge stronger — perhaps more pious and conservative , but also more democratic .
Until very recently , we too bought into this story .
Even though the charges against some of the individuals in the earlier waves of arrests seemed far - fetched and the indictments poorly prepared , we thought these shortcomings were the product of excessive prosecutorial zeal rather than deliberate attempts to frame innocent individuals .
But the way in which the case against Dogan has unfolded suggests that we were wrong .
The charges originate from a trove of documents delivered to and published by the Turkish daily Taraf .
The documents include authentic voice recordings from a war simulation workshop held at the headquarters of the 1st Army , then headed by Dogan , in March 2003 .
These recordings make no reference to a coup or any illegal activities .
But taking a major leap of faith , the newspaper alleges that the March 2003 workshop was a dress rehearsal for the planned coup .
This accusation strains credulity , considering that the workshop was recorded on Dogan ’s orders and attended by scores of top brass , including observers from the high command .
The documents also include other material that has clearly been manufactured , detailing preparations for a coup .
The only thing that directly implicates Dogan in this material is an 11 - page document dated Dec. 2 , 2002 , barely two weeks after the AKP government was formed .
The document has Dogan ’s name printed underneath , but it is not signed .
The excerpts published by Taraf contain several pointers to its fraudulent nature .
There are obvious anachronisms , such as criticism of government activities that did not take place until many years later , including its push for constitutional amendments and financial pressure on the opposition press .
There are verbatim extracts from a speech that was actually delivered in 2005 .
And there is wording that does n’t conform to military usage .
None of the material published by Taraf and subsequently used by the prosecutors provide evidence that would stand in a U.S. court of law .
No self - respecting editorial office in the United States or Western Europe would have even considered publishing the documents .
The prosecutors have refused to release any of their evidence to Dogan ’s lawyers — nor have they provided it to the military prosecutors , who are conducting their own independent investigation and have found nothing to corroborate the charges .
Far from being presumed innocent , Dogan is forced to prove his innocence , and to do so without access to the material that is said to implicate him .
The significance of these developments goes beyond the injustice done to a man who has served his country with great honor and distinction .
The facts suggest that the conflict in Turkey is not a simple power struggle between ultrasecular militarists and pro-democracy conservatives , as it is commonly portrayed .
A shadowy third group is manipulating both the media and the judiciary with great success , using manufactured evidence to deliberately stir conflict .
Dogan , a retired officer well known for his strong stance against Islamists , is an obvious target for such a group .
We do not know who is behind the attempt to frame Dogan and the other retired officers involved in the case .
Some point to Fethullah Gülen , a Turkish religious leader based in the United States with a vast network of supporters , whom they suspect of fomenting anti-secular activities .
Others , in the Turkish press , implicate a conspiracy by clandestine paramilitary groups aimed at muddying the waters and covering their own tracks .
Some , implausibly , even see the finger of the CIA .
The Taraf reporter who was provided with the forged material has written that his source is a retired Army officer who served with Dogan .
That is highly implausible , because the material includes documents not only from the 1st Army , which Dogan headed from 2002 to 2003 , but also from the Air Force , Navy , and National Gendarmerie .
A single individual could not have had access to the top - secret repositories of so many different services .
Nor does it make sense that he would have waited seven years before making his cache public .
Instead , it is possible that the voice recordings and other original documents , which were subsequently doctored , were leaked following an internal military inquiry that apparently took place after Dogan retired .
Dogan has appealed to the military high command and the government to reveal information about this inquiry and its aftermath .
Whoever the culprits may be , it is distressing that they have been allowed to be so effective .
Clearly , their interest lies not in advancing the cause of democracy , but something quite different .
They aim to polarize Turkish society , discredit the military , and complicate the courts ’ ability to effectively prosecute those who are truly guilty of criminal activities .
The judiciary ’s reaction to the allegations against Dogan and other officers has also been alarming .
Instead of questioning the authenticity of the documents delivered to Taraf , prosecutors have accepted the theories spouted by the newspaper wholesale .
Sticking to what appears to have been a preordained script , they have shown no interest whatsoever in any of the explanations offered by Dogan and his lawyers during the interrogation .
They have gone on a ludicrous fishing expedition that includes an attempt to link Dogan with the November 2003 bombing of two synagogues and the HSBC bank in Istanbul , even though he had already retired by then .
Against all precedent and in violation of Turkish law , they have successfully appealed against a judge ’s decision to release him .
Dogan remains in a hospital , where he is suffering from ailments that were aggravated during his detention .
The media , for its part , has had a feeding frenzy .
Lies , innuendo , and selective leaks from the prosecutors have been used to stoke public resentment against Dogan .
Taraf has repeatedly asserted that the 11 - page document contains Dogan ’s own signature ( it does not ) .
Other newspapers have claimed , falsely , that Dogan was tipped about his impending arrest and about to flee to Mexico .
The words in a leaked report by the military prosecutors have been repeatedly twisted to suggest that the report authenticated Taraf ’s claims ( it did not ) .
He has been accused of feigning illness so he can remain in a hospital instead of in prison .
Such misinformation has made it practically impossible for even well - informed citizens to discriminate between fact and fiction .
Journalists who have expressed skepticism of the plot ’s veracity have been intimidated and targeted as putschists themselves .
One highly regarded journalist has told us in confidence that he is reluctant to dwell on the inconsistencies in the prosecutors ’ case , for fear of being labeled a coup supporter .
Most surprisingly , Turkish liberals have loudly endorsed the prosecutors ’ activities in the interests of increased civilian control over the country , despite the obvious holes in the evidence and the gross violations of due process .
Prime Minister Erdogan and his entourage have fanned the flames by making statements that purport to support the independence of the judiciary yet clearly lend credence to the coup plot charges .
One AKP member of parliament has expressed in public what many others in that party must think in private :
It is now their turn to submit the military to the persecution they feel they experienced for so long .
Respect for the rule of law is upheld only when convenient .
A member of Erdogan ’s government has even accused the judge that released Dogan of belonging to the same criminal gang as the coup plotters .
We are against military coups of any kind .
We believe in a democracy where the military does not play a political role .
However , we also believe that the cause of democracy and human rights is not well served by vendettas and witch hunts .
Tragically , Turkish democracy and its supporters will take the biggest hit once the full story comes out .
The eventual unraveling of the case will discredit the judiciary , make the AKP government appear complicit in the debacle , shake the faith of the liberal intelligentsia , and set back the demilitarization of Turkish politics .
In the interest of Turkish democracy , cooler heads must prevail .
Jaroslav Halak
Blocked Shots
Shutting Down Ovechkin
Washington Power- play
The Disappearance of Green and Semin
This is obvious .
The Capitals outshot the Canadiens 292-194 , yet still lost .
In the six games that Halak played he stopped a total of 217 shots - a ridiculous .939 % .
Only Ilya Bryzgalov and Craig Anderson faced more rubber ( and Bryzgalov played an extra game ) .
In the four games the Canadiens won Halak faced 181 shots and only gave up 5 goals .
It ’s pretty hard to win games if the other goalie is playing like that .
Over the final three games when the Canadiens were facing elimination Halak faced 134 shots and turned aside all but 3 .
That ’s a .978 % .
Halak stood on his head and I ’m pretty sure he was n’t shaking when he went to take a drink of water .
In fact , it seemed like Halak started to get into the heads of the Capitals .
They looked like a team who felt they would never score , especially in game 7 when Bergeron put the Habs ahead .
They played scared .
As good as Halak was , he got a lot of help from his defence .
Over the course of seven games Montreal blocked a grand total of 182 shots .
For every 1.6 shots that the Capitals took there was a Montreal player blocking a shot .
Washington actually blocked shots at a similar rate – 1 blocked shot for every 1.78 shots taken – but the sheer volume that the Canadiens players got in front of is impressive .
They knew with the skill of the Capitals if they did n’t block shots then they would have a hard time winning , even with Halak playing like he did .
Hal Gill led the way by blocking 31 shots – almost 4.5 per game .
Gill ’s partner , Josh Gorges , blocked 20 shots .
That ’s just will right there .
It ’s hard to imagine that a player who scored 5 goals and 5 assists in 7 games was shut down , but that ’s exactly what happened .
Ovechkin was held to only one goal and one assist in the four games that the Capitals lost .
It ’s true that the Capitals have offensive threats other than Ovechkin , but if you ’re able to shut down the most skilled player in the game then you have a very good chance of winning .
The tandem of Josh Gorges and Hal Gill was able to contain Ovechkin and frustrated him all series .
Ovechkin did score a goal in game 7 that would have tied the game at one , but it was called back on account of goalie interference .
I thought the call was a little dubious , but I ’m certainly biased in the matter .
I did n’t think Halak ’s ability to stop the puck was actually impeded .
Knuble does bump his skate , but it does n’t seem to throw him off at all .
He was going down to stop the shot , but it went in because he could n’t see with Knuble blocking his view .
This was Gary Bettman ’s way of ensuring the Capitals did n’t make it through - taking the NHL down from the inside .
Good job , Gary !
Well , there was n’t one .
Washington scored one measly power - play goal in 33 attempts .
That ’s an abysmal 3 % .
Lots of credit needs to be given to Jaroslav Halak and the Montreal defence .
Anytime your penalty kill is successful you can bet that the goalie has a big part to do with it .
Willing yourself to get down in front of a Mike Green slap shot helps too .
Still , how can a team with Ovechkin , Backstrom , Semin , and Green only score once on the power - play over seven games ?
This was a team with the most proficient power - play in the league during the regular season , scoring 25 % of the time .
They were given almost five power - plays a game during this series and could only score once .
If I was a Washington fan I would be looking at that stat and crying .
I'm pretty sure both these players were last seen in the regular season .
Semin had two assists all series , one coming in the final game .
He took more shots than any other Capital player ( 44 ) , but could n’t finish .
That ’s very little production for someone who scored 40 goals and 84 points during the regular season .
Mike Green did n’t fare any better .
He finished the series with 3 assists , only one of which was in the final three elimination games .
The only stat that really stands out is his 12 penalty minutes accumulated .
What also stood out was his poor defensive play .
A Norris candidate should not be exposed as being poor defensively .
Points do not necessarily make a good defenceman .
It ’s a cliché , but your best players need to be your best players in order to succeed in the playoffs .
Just ask the San Jose Sharks .
For Washington , two of their top four players barely even got their names on the score sheet .
It ’s hard to win when that happens .
A combination of Montreal hard work and the Great Washington Disappearing Act propelled the Canadiens to an improbable seven game series victory .
Now they have the honour of facing Sidney Crosby and the defending Stanley Cup champions .
I ’m sure Montreal fans are dusting off their riot gear and getting ready to tear up the downtown , but I do n’t think it ’s wise to bet against Crosby .
WILKINSBURG , PA . — Police say a third - grader in Pennsylvania handed out more than 60 small bags of heroin to his classmates before his teacher discovered them .
Wilkinsburg police say the 8 - year - old brought the bags to Turner Elementary School on Tuesday .
At a news conference Wednesday , police said some of the bags were found empty in a trash can , but there was no evidence the kids had ingested the drugs .
Police say the bags were stamped with the words “ trust me . ”
School officials sent a letter home to parents about the incident .
Police are investigating how the boy got the drugs .
Wilkinsburg is about eight kilometres east of Pittsburgh .
SpringSource tc Server 2.0 Adds VMware Virtualization to Commercial Tomcat
VMware 's SpringSource division this week announced the release of its tc Server 2.0 platform , providing a commercially supported version of the open source Apache Tomcat server for enterprise users .
As part of the tc Server 2.0 release , SpringSource is also expanding the platform with a new Spring version , offering tc Server users the ability to run Spring Java applications .
The new Spring edition of tc Server 2.0 also provides expanded integration with virtualization technologies from VMware ( NYSE : VMW ) , enabling developers to deploy apps to both real and virtual environments .
With tc Server 2.0 , SpringSource is aiming help both developers and server operators get the best performance out of their Java applications .
" This really culminates our strategy when we launched the product last May to really provide a solid developer edition and a platform that the application operators can use so they can ensure that applications meet their business goals , " Shaun Connolly , vice president of product management at SpringSource , told InternetNews.com .
VMware acquired SpringSource for $ 420 million in September 2009 , after the initial tc Server launch .
SpringSource launched the original edition of tc Server almost a year ago as a way to provide commercial support for a lightweight Java middleware server .
Previously , only two versions were available -- the standard edition and the freely available developer edition .
Both versions are also receiving an update as part of the tc Server 2.0 rollout .
" There is increased functionality across the board in this release , " Connolly said .
The free developer edition provides the core functionality of the tc Server , while the standard edition includes application provisioning , centralized server configuration and commercial support .
" The new Spring edition adds a fully supported Spring on tc Server stack with the operational metrics and some more sophisticated ways of dealing with alerts , " Connolly said .
" So you get a deeper experience from an operational standpoint in terms of measuring and managing applications in production . "
The tc Server application management server is built on technology from management vendor Hyperic , which SpringSource acquired in May 2009 .
With Hyperic , users who need additional monitoring capabilities they can upgrade and add them in , Connolly said .
As part of the upgrade , SpringSource is providing integration between the tc Server and VMware Workstation and VMware Lab Manager virtualization products .
Connolly noted that the goal is to enable deployment flexibility for developers and production people to be able to deploy across virtual environments .
While Spring framework , management and virtualization features are all included in the release , SpringSource 's tc Server is also improving as the core Apache Tomcat server continues to evolve .
" We are in line with the latest Apache 6.x version number and since our engineers on staff are helping to drive Tomcat capabilities we stay on top of the latest releases , " Connolly said .
" There is a Tomcat 7 out in the community , but we 'll wait for that to bake in the open source community before we consider it to be enterprise - ready . "

When ARM announced a cooperation with GlobalFoundries , the question about the nature of this deal came into place .
Thanks to Subramani Kengeri , VP of Design Solutions at GlobalFoundries – we managed to find out just that .
According to Subramani , the very first thing GlobalFoundries did was license a Cortex - A9 MPCore in order to build a reference design for 28nm HKMG [ High - K Metal Gate ] / Gate First design .
When GlobalFoundries was splitting from AMD , the company also acquired CPU Design Team that closely worked with IBM in East Fishkill Fab .
The expertise of that team and the Design Team in Dresden expanded from standard SOI [ Silicon - On- Insulator ]
CPUs to world ’s first SOI GPU [ graphics subsystem inside Llano / AMD Fusion APU ] and to bulk silicon .
For bulk silicon , GlobalFoundries elected to use Cortex - A9 MPCore IP , as the company views that part as one of key ingredients for future smartphones , smart - books , netbooks , tablets and the like .
You can expect the official announcement once that the company finishes the design , currently scheduled for June / July , with mass - production starting in the second half of 2010 .
In order to woo customers , their implementation of Cortex - A9 is supposed to be the most advanced one in the field – the design teams placed their extensive knowledge in transistor design to create a product which should offer double - digit efficiency improvement than anything competition might come with , and extend the modern x86 CPU manufacturing technologies into the world of bulk silicon .
Besides power , the GlobalFoundries design also enabled much higher clock than what is coming from the competition .
One of key enables was the transistor design evolution former AMD , now GlobalFoundries is so proud off .
From the opening of 200 mm Fab 30 [ Now Fab 1 Module 2 ] back in June 2000 , AMD transistor design team developed more than 15 generations of transistors .
According to Subramani , “ one of largest issues customers faced in the past was the fact that most advanced manufacturing facilities were n’t available .
With GlobalFoundries and custom Cortex - A9 silicon , a client can come , take the 28nm design and just assemble an SOC around it , saving months in design time . ”
When asked why GlobalFoundries made such an investment in designing a part that will never come to market as a GlobalFoundries part , Subramani gave one simple answer : “ Because we can . ”
It is n’t hard to imagine why – with the acquisition of Chartered , GlobalFoundries inherited over 150 customers such as Nintendo , Microsoft , Qualcomm , TI – to name the few .
In theory , if a client such as Microsoft would desire to create a custom silicon for their Zune Phone like they did with Xbox , they would only need to purchase the Cortex - A9 MPCore design from GlobalFoundries , order Digital and Analog Logic parts from other players such as NXP , BroadCom , STMicro , Marvell etc – and order wafers from GlobalFoundries .
Instead of designing a part for several years , they could deliver a complete SoC silicon within few quarters .
This level of speed offered by GlobalFoundries did n’t exist in the industry before and the company looks fairly certain that 2010 and 2011 are only the beginning of their battle for dominance .
The company already has clients for their 28nm version of Cortex - A9 MPCore , so it will be interesting to see who will switch from Samsung , TSMC and the like – to Fab 1 Module 2 .

The London G20 summit agreed banks must pay for bail - outs Banks and other financial institutions face paying two new taxes to fund future bail - outs , the BBC has learned .
Business editor Robert Peston said the global proposals by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) were " more radical " than most had anticipated .
All institutions would pay a bank levy - initially at a flat - rate - and also face a further tax on profits and pay .
The measures are designed to make banks pay for the costs of future financial and economic rescue packages .
The proposals are likely to horrify banks , especially the proposed tax on pay
Robert Peston
BBC Business Editor
Read Robert 's thoughts
The IMF documents were made available to governments of the G20 group of nations on Tuesday afternoon and seen by the BBC soon afterwards .
The plans will be discussed by finance ministers this weekend .
" The proposals are likely to horrify banks , especially the proposed tax on pay , " our business editor said .
" They will also be politically explosive both domestically and internationally . "
Insurers , hedge funds and other financial institutions must also pay the taxes , the IMF argues , despite them being less implicated in the recent crisis .
If they were not included , activities currently carried out by banks would be reclassified as , for example , insurance or hedge - fund services to escape the levies .
While the general levy , or " financial stability contribution " , would initially be at a flat rate , this would eventually be refined so that riskier businesses paid more .
British chancellor Alistair Darling said the IMF 's proposals were " important " and should be welcomed .
" The recognition that banks should make a contribution to the society in which they operate is right , " he said .

It was agreed at the G20 summit in London last year that financial institutions and not tax - payers should pay for future bank rescue packages .
Since then several proposals have been put forward by various governments including the so - called " Tobin Tax " on financial transactions .
Some nations , including Canada , oppose any new bank taxes .
However no country has yet introduced taxes to pay for future bailouts - arguing that unless the rules were brought in on a coordinated basis , institutions would simply " cherry pick " where they operated , moving to jurisdictions with less tough financial regulation .
The body which represents banks in the UK , the British Bankers ' Association said it was concerned about any move which would place the UK industry " at a competitive disadvantage internationally " .
" We also need to see all the detail of what is proposed - and how any new levy and tax would apply - to determine the effect it would have " , it said .
Party claims
In the light of the UK's looming general election , the IMF proposals were likely to be used for some political point - scoring , our business editor said .
" Labour is bound to claim that the IMF is implicitly criticising the Tories ' plan to impose a new tax on banks irrespective of what other countries do - because the IMF paper says that ' international co-operation would be beneficial ' .
" I would also start to question my sanity if Gordon Brown does n't claim credit for putting pressure on the IMF to launch its review of possible bank taxes . "
But he added that the Conservatives would say that their bank tax proposals resembled the financial stability contribution .
And the Liberal Democrats would claim that their proposed tax on banks ' profits was similar to the second tranche of the IMF proposal .

Wrap-up
The Incredible also does fairly high resolution video -- up to 800 x 480 .
We would have liked to see a 720 p option here , but we realize we 're being hopeless romantics .
Regardless , the higher res video did a decent , if somewhat pixelated and slightly stutttery , job at capturing a beautiful Brooklyn sunset .
We had better results at VGA resolution , but both modes were more than acceptable for basic shooting .
Just do n't expect this to stand in for your HD camcorder , and you 'll be all set .
As you may know , we loved the sound quality on the Motorola Droid .
In fact , we think it 's probably the best sounding phone we 've ever used .
We did n't get quite as excited about the Nexus One ( tinny , not loud enough ) , but the Incredible has seriously jockeyed for Moto 's spot here .
The earpiece on this device is loud and clear , but never painful on the ' drums , while the speakerphone is excellent for both conversations and video / audio playback .
It 's a really solid speaker which should be more than sufficient for conference callers and voracious media snackers alike .
Bravo guys !
In a somewhat new move for Android phone , HTC has equipped the Incredible with 8GB of internal storage as well as a MicroSD slot which can handle an additional 32GB -- giving you a whopping potential 40 GB of space for your goods .
We love the idea of a hardwired option for content storage , but HTC has some problems with this implementation .
Firstly , many apps currently available in the Android Market which utilize an SD card for offloading data are n't able to see the internal storage at all , which means if you drag some APKs you want to install or want to download some data when you 're in an app , you 're out of luck .
It just simply does n't see it .
This was especially problematic with the NYC Bus & Subway Maps application which requires a download of the train maps , and when we tried to run Nesoid ( a popular NES emulator ) , it not only could n't find ROMs saved on the phone 's storage , but it force closed when we tried to move up a directory !
This may not seem like a big deal , but more than once when using the phone we hit this brick wall by not having an SD card present .
For the $ 199 price tag on this thing , it would n't have killed HTC or Verizon to throw in even a 2GB card to make the transition easier .
We 're not going to go into excessive detail on Android 2.1 and the Sense UI present on this phone , as you can read all the details on the software in our previous reviews of the Desire and the Legend , though there are tweaks and additions here that are worth making mention of .
Firstly , we need to talk about the differences between Android 2.1 with and without the Sense UI .
If you 've looked at a Nexus One ( or own one ) , then you probably know that the experience with the UI is a mixed bag .
Some portions of the software have been dramatically cleaned up , while others seem to be left on the cutting room floor .
That 's absolutely not the case with 2.1 and Sense .
Basically , the Incredible -- and all devices with that combo -- feel like complete , polished , modern smartphones , with none of the perks or features missing .
In particular , the homescreens have been massively expanded here , giving you seven screens in which to store icons and widgets ... and there are a lot of widgets .
HTC has included a handful of its own widgets alongside some of the familiar stock ones which Google offers .
Of course , the widgets ( and their corresponding apps ) which HTC offers generally offer far more functionality than Google 's options , and they 're also tied together with Sense in way that makes the experience of using them within the OS feel complete -- something notably missing from the Google - only experience .
To say that this UI is competitive with something like iPhone OS 3.1 ( or 4 for that matter ) , or Palm 's webOS is an understatement ; in many ways it 's superior to what Apple and Palm are offering .
HTC has done a marvelous job in tweaking Sense in all the right places .
The first Sense device we tested was the Hero , which we found to be seriously lacking in the horsepower department , resulting in an experience that was sluggish and disappointing .
The performance of the Incredible could n't have been more opposite .
The phone never hiccuped , and scrolling between pages or up and down long lists happened without hesitation .
Not only was the UI blazingly fast and responsive -- even with all seven homescreens running heavy widgets -- but as we mentioned previously , the touchscreen response on this phone seem remarkably better than its contemporaries , which leads us to believe that HTC has honed the software in this regard as well .
That sensitivity comes in especially handy when using HTC's new pinch feature on the homescreens , which brings up a " card " view of all your pages .
The only spot where we noticed any kind of slowdown was when using the live wallpapers -- we 're not really big fans of the concept to begin with , but it did seem to make the homescreen frame rate visibly more sluggish .
Besides just the cosmetic stuff , HTC has also done seriously heavy lifting in the details department , continuing to improve the music , video , and photo browsing options on their devices , as well as making their fantastic on - screen keyboard even better in this higher resolution version .
We found finger tracking and typing speed to be considerably improved , as well as word prediction and correction .
Apple , watch your back ...
HTC has done a damn good job of sneaking up on your tech , and maybe improving on it .
We can't stress this enough : HTC has made a really good OS ( Android ) into a truly amazing and competitive OS .
HTC has even improved upon the copy and paste functions of the phone , making the process much more iPhone - like , but expanding on that with options to share and look up your selections via a context menu .
Oh , and did we mention the amazing new text flow in the browser ?
No matter how far you zoom in , HTC 's software will reflow the text you 're looking at to make it zoomable .
It 's pretty amazing , actually .
We do n't know why Google does n't just collaborate with the company in a more formal fashion , because no one else has been able to deliver this cohesive and enjoyable of an experience with Android .
It should also be noted that the browser on these phones is equipped with Flash lite , though we had lots of trouble getting videos to play on many of the sites we visited ( Engadget included ) .
If someone was hoping to convince us that Flash could work on a device like this , consider the job unfinished .
Verizon and HTC have collaborated on a few perks in the OS as well , cleaning up the Google Navigation , er , navigation , and also collapsing Visual Voicemail into the messaging app on the phone , making it easier to get at all your communications at once .
We 're Google Voice users ( which of course perfectly integrates with the device ) , so we did n't spend much time with Verizon 's version .
HTC was also happy to point out that its email app supports multiple Exchange , POP , or IMAP accounts with a unified inbox -- something that should please a number of enterprise users .
Other bundled apps include Quickoffice , a PDF viewer , HTC's Teeter game , and Peep , the company 's built - in Twitter client .
A note about this latter application ; we 're big fans of HTC making Twitter an integrated part of its UI , but this app has the annoying habit of auto - updating your timeline and jumping to the most recent tweet , which makes this " solution " less than appealing .
We ended up sticking with Seesmic , and probably will until HTC addresses this minor issue .
One other item that cropped up -- which may or may not have to do with this being an unreleased device -- is that we got very different results for apps in the Market .
Some programs we were looking for just simply did n't show up in our searches .
We had the same problem with the Desire and Legend when testing , and HTC says it 's looking into this problem , though we have yet to hear a proper explanation from the company on why this is occurring .
Overall the experience with 2.1 and Sense was a complete pleasure -- using the phone felt fast and efficient .
We 'd like to point out that we 've been running the Incredible without any third party task managers , and without manually killing any applications .
Android is designed to multitask without the need for utilities of the sort , and based on Steve Jobs ' words from the recent iPhone OS 4 event , we were extra curious to see how this brand new build of the software would fare .
We can tell you this -- it has n't let us down yet , and we 're not seeing any sluggish behavior or force closes on apps .
If this OS has a need for management of its processes , we have n't experienced it yet .
As usual , Verizon 's network was outstanding .
We know everyone already accepts how rock - solid Big Red 's connections are , but we'd like to point out that at various times while riding an NYC subway underground , the Incredible managed to squeeze connectivity out of the big V .
In fact , when we first took the phone out of its box we were riding the train , and it picked up enough data to auto - update our time and location .
Now that really is something .
As we said previously , we did n't have an enormous amount of time to test this device , but in the handful of days we had , we found battery life to be good , but not outstanding .
In comparison to the Nexus One , it seemed to fare a bit worse ; we could get through a day , but things were down to the wire by the end of the night .
It 's obvious that a lot of these widgets and background processes HTC is running are going to put a strain on your device , and given that we 're pretty active with our smartphones , something is bound to give .
Now keep in mind there 's nothing really abnormal about the battery life on the Incredible -- it 's just not going to wow you .
Let 's just put this out there : the Droid Incredible is the best Android device that you can purchase in America right now .
It 's better than the Droid , better than the Nexus One , and certainly beats the pants off of any previous generation handsets like the Eris , myTouch , or Cliq .
It 's not just a very , very good Android phone ( though it is ) ; it 's also an excellent smartphone no matter how you cut it .
If you 're on Verizon right now , you 're finally getting really great options for phones , but the Incredible is currently sitting at the top of that heap with a good bit of distance to the next in line .
Sure , there are still issues like a lack of quality titles in the Android Market , and if a hardware keyboard is a must , this wo n't do the job for you .
Also , while Sense is truly great on this phone , there may be users who prefer a more streamlined , stripped down experience .
Still , if you 're looking for an ultra-fast , extremely capable smartphone that has the guts and gleam to go the distance , the Incredible just might be the Droid you 're looking for .
Yes , we made that joke .

Alex Jones undertakes a psychological experiment that proves dangerous in more than one sense .
While the public is caught up in the hype and promotion of the new iPad , it is clear once again that technology has captured our humanity – our worth has been caught up in baubles , and we are dangerously close to caring more about our gadgets than our family and neighbors .
With this in mind , Alex daringly “ tortures ” the new toy being pushed by corporate elite to control the masses .
He attempts to find out – or at least raise the question– as to whether humanity will concern itself with more with the senseless destruction of a computer than it does with the torture and senseless killing of more than a million Iraqis ( to put forward one example ) along with countless others across the globe .

Top 6 Savings Mistakes
Everyone knows that it ’s important to save money .
Indeed , the recent recession has driven that point home for most of us .
However , sometimes we fail to save money as we should .
Here are the top 6 savings mistakes that can derail progress to financial freedom :
1. Ignorance of Your Spending and Saving Habits
First of all , knowledge is key .
If you do n’t know how much money you have coming in , and where it is going when you spend it , you are making a mistake .
In order to save money effectively , it is vital that you have a good idea of what money you have coming in , and that you keep track of your spending .
That way , you can determine how much money you can set aside for savings , and set more realistic financial goals .
2. Failure to Change Your Spending Habits so You Can Save More
Just knowing what you are spending your money on is not enough .
You also need to be willing to prioritize your expenses , and cut back on things that are not important .
If you want to save more money , you need to modify your spending habits so that you have more money to set aside .
Failure to move saving money to the top of your spending priorities list is a big money mistake that can cost you down the road .
3. Failure to Set a Specific Financial Goal
Many people just say that they want to save more money .
They do n’t have a target dollar amount for their emergency fund , and they do n’t have a specific dollar amount in mind for retirement savings .
This mistake can be costly , since it leaves you generally rudderless .
Create a plan for your savings , and have a specific target .
You need to be able to have a goal that you can break down and achieve .
Plus , having a specific savings goal allows you to more accurately track your savings progress .
4. Buying Something Because
It ’s on Sale
We talk about “ saving money ” when we get a good deal on something , or get something because it ’s on sale .
But are you really saving ?
Spending money is still spending money .
If you are buying something because you think it is a bargain and you might want or need it for some mostly unknown reason in the future , you are n’t really saving .
Only buy something on sale if you had planned on it .
Do n’t get something just because you “ ca n’t beat the price . ”
This goes for using coupons as well .
Do n’t buy something just because you have a coupon .
5. Failure to Take Advantage of Free Money
A company match for retirement plans is one of the best ways to save money .
This is because you are actually offered free money .
Whenever possible , you should take advantage of a company match .
Also in this category are the bonuses offered by many banks these days when you open savings accounts and other types of accounts .
ING regularly runs promotions where you can get a bonus for opening an account .
Other banks offer these bonuses as well .
Look for ways to boost your savings with free money .
6. Cashing Out Your Company Retirement Plan
When they leave a job , many people cash out their retirement plans .
However , that results in a tax hit , as well as a possible penalty .
Instead of cashing out a retirement plan , roll it into an IRA , or roll it into the plan offered by your new employer .
Bottom line :
You need to have a plan to save money .
Without a plan , you are likely to waste more money , and you can slow your progress to financial freedom .
Organs removed from dead patients without family consent after NHS blunder
Hundreds of thousands of people have been caught up in an astonishing NHS blunder that saw organs being taken from dead patients and used without their consent .
Donors who expressly stated they did not want certain body parts taken after their death had their details changed so their records showed any of their organs could be removed .
Now more than 21 bereaved families will be contacted by health officials to be told the disturbing news that tissue was mistakenly taken from their loved ones .
[ caption ]
[ caption ]
The error , which affected 800,000 people , happened when details concerning the body parts that donors do not want to be removed was deleted from the NHS Organ Donor Register .
Some people specifically request not to have their eyes or heart removed after their death even if they are happy for other tissue to be donated .
But these details have been
wiped from the records of 812,000 people over the course of the last decade - although the mistake has only just come to light .
Critics said the blunder was another example of the Government 's ' lax ' attitude to sensitive data .
The NHS is under pressure to increase the number of organ donors as the number of seriously ill people on the transplant waiting list has risen from 5,700 in 2004 to more than 8,000 last year .
The number of people joining the register is not keeping pace with the demands - last year it rose by just 7 per cent .
Now , according to NHS Blood and Transplant , which holds the Organ Donor Register , there are at least 21 cases where the deceased 's body parts were removed without their consent .
Officials will now contact their relatives and apologise .
It is illegal to remove body tissue without a person 's prior consent or that of their next - of - kin .
Families of those involved face agonising guilt as they would have given permission for their loved ones ' organs to be removed - based on wrong information about their final wishes .
Health Secretary Andy Burnham has ordered an investigation and said he ' deeply regretted ' the distress caused to those involved .
The error occurred when information was being transferred from the Driving and Vehicle Licensing Authority to the NHS Blood and Transplant database .
There is a section in the DVLA 's driving licence application form which asks people if they want to become organ donors .
Up to half of Britain 's 17 million donors have signed up this way .
Some 28 per cent of British adults are registered - many of whom carry a ' donor card ' .
But most major organs can only be used if a person dies in hospital as body tissue deteriorates rapidly .
The mistake only came to light after NHS Blood and Transplant wrote to new donors last year thanking them and clarifying their exact wishes .
Several wrote back to say the details were wrong .
Officials then trawled through records and identified 45 cases whereby a donor had died in a situation where their organs were suitable to be removed .
In just under half of these cases , body parts had been used despite the donor specifically requesting they did not want them used .
An NHS Blood and Transplant spokesman said yesterday : ' There are a small number of cases , 21 over the past six years , where the person has died and their preferences may not have been correctly recorded .
In each case the family gave permission for the donation to take place , but it may not have been in line with the individual 's preferences .
' We sincerely apologise for any distress this may have caused . '
Patients ' groups reacted angrily .
Joyce Robins , of Patient Concern said : ' It is absolutely dreadful that such sensitive details are handled in such a careless way . '
Dylan Sharpe , of Big Brother Watch , said : ' This is further evidence that the Government takes a very lax attitude when handling our personal data .
' Yet they continue to try and build an enormous database containing all our medical records . '

Better battery life is on the top of most people 's gadget wish lists .
Now , a technology breakthrough from MIT offers hope for the mobile masses – but it will have to contend with other experimental approaches in a race to the market that could take years , experts say .
MIT researchers say they have found a way to create batteries that can offer up to three times the energy density of current batteries , while being much lighter .
That paves the way for portable devices that could both be lighter and have a much longer battery life than current gadgets .
" You can get battery life in a laptop computer similar that 's three times more than what you have now , even as the battery gets three times lighter , " Yang Shao - Horn , associate professor of mechanical engineering and materials science at MIT , told Wired.com .
While advances in material sciences and chip design have led to more powerful computers with better displays , battery life has remained a big roadblock .
That 's why new battery technologies have become a major area of research .
Companies such as GE and IBM are exploring the promise of a new kind of battery called lithium - air .
These batteries could replace existing lithium - ion batteries .
Lithium - air batteries have a lithium anode that is electrochemically coupled to atmospheric oxygen through an air cathode .
By contrast , current lithium - ion batteries have a carbon anode and a metal oxide - based cathode .
" There 's huge potential for lithium - air batteries , " says Vishal Sapru , industry manager for power and energy system at research firm Frost & Sullivan .
" The combination of lithium anode and air cathode not only makes them lighter than lithium - ion but also offers higher energy density . "
Sapru estimates that a typical lithium - air battery can offer an output of 1800 watts per kilogram compared to about 120 to 350 watts per kilogram seen in lithium - ion batteries .
But so far , there has been a lack of understanding about the kinds of electrode materials that could promote the electrochemical reactions that take place in lithium - air batteries , which has held back their development , says MIT 's Shao - Horn .
The answer , she says , according to her team , lies in using gold or platinum as a catalyst .
And despite the bling factor , batteries using these precious metals could still be cost competitive , says Shao - Horn .
" We need to have only the surfaces covered by these elements , " she says .
" We are not using platinum and gold in the bulk of the battery . "
It 's an interesting breakthrough , agrees Sapru , but one that 's by no means guaranteed a commercial future .
Other battery researchers are working on other materials , such as aluminum - polymer laminates , for instance .
What will eventually reach the hands of consumers remains to be seen , he says .
" Till these technologies reach commercial manufacturing stage we can't reliably tell how they will do in terms of costs and accessibility , " says Sapru .
" While gold and platinum offer some advantages , aluminum - polymer laminates can be more flexible , so we will have to wait and see . "
Shao - Horn says her team 's ideas are still a long way from commercialization .
The group is yet to perfect the chemistry of the charging and discharging processes and increase efficiency of the system , she says .
" Ultimately , just like we have different types of lithium - ion batteries today , " says Sapru , " we will have different lithium - air batteries .
But all of this is a couple of years away from reaching consumers . "

With the popularity of Rush Poker as a cash game , it was a matter of time before FTP rolled out a MTT version .
As of today , tournament players can now get their fix with Rush Poker tournaments on Full Tilt .
Rush Poker has certainly been one of the more interesting and talked - about innovations in the online poker sector over the last year .
The format , which essentially takes a pool of players and moves them into new tables each hand , allowing for a much quicker game - speed , proved to be a hit for Full Tilt Poker .
For a more detailed explanation on how Rush Poker works , check out this article .
Now , Rush Poker is available for tournaments as well .
The beta release of Rush Poker MTTs seems to have been a bit rocky for Full Tilt , so expect the roll out to be a gradual one , but the core is present and it should n’t be too long before RP MTTs are available at a variety of limits .
Some details , for those interested :
How do you find Rush Poker tournaments ?
They ’re listed in the MTT lobby with a black R symbol next to the tournament name .
In the Standard view , you can either use the main filter ( show below ) to access Rush tournaments …
… or you can use the Advanced Filter , which now has a radio button for Rush Poker MTTs :
How do Rush Poker tournaments work ?
At the heart of it , Rush Poker tournaments are the same as regular tournaments – whoever gets all of the chips wins the tournament .
That said , the Rush poker format clearly requires some alterations .
We may see these evolve over time , but here are the key differences at this point :
– There is no hand - for - hand play in Rush MTTs .
Typically in a tournament there will be a “ hand - for - hand ” period near the bubble or big money jumps .
This means all tables play one hand before any table moves on to another hand , and it stops people from stalling in an attempt to move up the ranks .
Rush will lack this feature , but Full Tilt says they ’ve got other mechanisms in place to prevent stalling .
– Tables will play down further before being combined .
FTP says that when a tournament gets down to 30 players , tables will continue to run without combination until a final table is reached .
There are also some key differences between Rush MTTs and Rush Poker :
– When a Rush MTT reaches the final table , it reverts to a typical tournament , as there ’s only one table left .
This table can also , unlike other Rush tables , be observed by other players .
– The way that the blinds are posted is different .
Rush Poker tournaments will consider both the number of hands and the amount of time passed since the last time you posted the blind .
Whoever has the biggest number gets the blind .
Additionally the small blind is also tracked now , as opposed to just the big blind .
Rush Poker is only available at Full Tilt Poker .
If you ’re thinking about signing up at Full Tilt , make sure you read this first .
Death Avoidable had IRS Simply Enforced Its Own Policies
On the morning of November 6 , 2007 , a dozen or so armed agents / officers wearing flak jackets and with guns showing , from and / or associated with the Criminal Division of the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) , served a search warrant on the Fort Wayne , Indiana residence of Jim and Denise Simon , while Jim Simon was working in Europe .
Denise , at the time , was home preparing her youngest child , a ten year old daughter , for school .
The extensive search continued from early morning until late into the evening .
Denise was so affected by the events and the deplorable treatment of her by the agents that three days later , on November 9th , she took her own life .
She left a typewritten
suicide note
Immigration dominated the agenda of the third and final UK Leaders ' Debate , with David Cameron coming out on top in early polls .
It was ‘ immigration , immigration , immigration ’ as the ghost of Gordon Brown 's campaign gaffe haunted tonight 's TV debate between prime ministerial hopefuls .
While neither questioner nor the three party leaders spoke specifically of Mr Brown 's branding of pensioner Gillian Duffy as ‘ a bigoted woman ’ after quizzing him on Eastern Europeans flocking to Britain , it was only when the issue she had raised yesterday in Rochdale bubbled up again in the Birmingham studio that the broadcast came alive .
Mr Brown spoke speedily and rattled through the Government 's policies and his own concerns , Tory leader David Cameron sounded predictably at ease with the issue and it was left to the Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg first to seem to deny his party 's policy of an amnesty for illegal immigrants , then flounder while explaining it .
All three leaders were put through their paces , first on the economy then on issues from benefit scroungers to the affordability of housing to the future of education .
And in his perhaps final 90 minutes to undo the damage he did yesterday , Mr Brown - blighted by his nervous grin - fulfilled Labour election strategist Lord Mandelson 's ambition that he should be seen as a workhorse rather than a ‘ show pony ’ .
Mr Cameron gave his most assured performance yet , looking far more relaxed and comfortably addressing viewers straight down the camera lens , addressing Mr Brown frequently as Prime Minister - rather than Gordon or Gordon Brown , as he had done the previous two weeks .
It was a tactic presumably designed to highlight the fact that Mr Brown 's party has been in power for the last 13 years , and pay due deference to his office , eschewing the rather showy ‘ if I was your Prime Minister ’ formula the Conservative leader deployed last week .
Mr Clegg looked less at ease than during any of the previous contests , not just over immigration but on a range of issues where he tried to cut across the other two leaders and seemed sometimes at pains to agree with every questioner .
But if his performance tonight was somewhat lacklustre , he has undoubtedly been the big winner of the first series of televised showdowns which look set to become a fixture of British election campaigns .
BNP leader says Irish welcome in Britain
Earlier , the leader of the British National Party said Irish citizens are welcome in Britain despite his party 's anti-immigration policies .
Nick Griffin said the country 's doors would be shut , except to those immigrants whose entry would suit the UK , such as physicists with specialist skills .
Speaking on BBC radio this morning , Mr Griffin said : ' We are certainly not going to shut the doors to the Irish , because the Irish , as far as we are concerned , are part of Britain and fully entitled to come here .
' We mean that the doors are going to be shut , because Britain 's full .
We are the most overcrowded country in Europe .
' If you are talking about Polish plumbers or Afghan refugees , the doors are going to be shut , because Britain is full . '
' The door is shut to any significant numbers whatsoever , from anywhere .
It 's open where it suits Britain and suits the British people .
That 's fair enough . '
In the course of planning a rather significant event for the coming weekend , I was forced , for the first time in my life , to confront the following conundrum :
Which is sunnier — “ partly sunny ” or “ partly cloudy ” ?
My faith in the power of pure reason was severely shaken when I realized I could construct equally plausible arguments in either direction .
So , with reluctance , I abandoned theory and turned to evidence , in the form of the logos employed by two of the more popular weather forecasting sites :
Weather Underground Accuweather Partly Sunny Partly Cloudy
Weather Underground takes an unambiguous stand : partly cloudy is definitely sunnier than partly sunny .
Accuweather is a little , umm , hazier on the issue ; apparently at Accuweather , partly cloudy means something like “ somewhat wispier clouds , covering more of the central portion of the sun but a bit less of the edges , than partly sunny ” .
Overall , though , it appears that at Accuweather , partly sunny is sunnier than partly cloudy .
I turned to The Weather Channel to break the tie , but as far as I can tell ( after checking ten - day forecasts for a half dozen cities ) , the melancholy folks at The Weather Channel are quite incapable of ever seeing the world as “ partly sunny ” .
“ Partly cloudy ” they use with reckless abandon .
I invite commenters to weigh in both descriptively and prescriptively on this issue — what do “ partly sunny ” and “ partly cloudy ” usually mean in practice , and what ought they mean ?
If we succeed in resolving the matter , we can tackle the even more difficult question :
First Google decided to turn historical safe - search off on the Chinese government , then China makes Googling impossible .
The months - long information hose fight between the search engine giant and the plucky up - and - coming global power has made us wonder on more than one occasion what the Chinese people must be saying as they try to procrastinate at work .
That 's where you came in .
We asked Nedroid to start things off with a bare bones comic that you could modify as you pleased .
The $ 50 winner is below , but first the runners up .

Please , shoot me if there is a similar topic up already - the search feature has failed me yet again , though whose fault that is I am not sure .
I intend for this thread to be a repository of all levels of knowledge specifically for ableton specifically for psy trance - if you have a really basic technique that works well for you , post it !
if you have a really advanced idea , post it !
I will start out with two tricks that are fairly basic but have an incredible impact , at least for me .
The first one is blatantly stolen from Tom Cosm ( and if you dont know his website and you use ableton , do yourself a favor and check it out )
Filter Delay trick - this adds a very small ( 1 - 10 MS works best for me ) delay on your sound , your mind is not able to separate the delay from the original sound , and the primary effect of this is to give your sound more space , and on certain sounds it will slightly change the pitch .
I pretty much throw it on anything that feels thin and weak .
Takes all of 30 seconds to set up - add filter delay , change L and R delay to " Time " instead of Sync , and make them slightly different MS amounts ( I usually do 1 MS and 10 MS ) , then drag the band pass filter so that the areas dont overlap much ( or else you get unwanted feedback style stuff ) .
Also remember to turn off the L+R middle channel .
CLIP MODULATION !
I saw someone post this on the psymusic forum and I was n't really sure what it meant until right now .
What I * had * been doing was doing all my automation in the timeline arrangement view .
For a different approach , double click on a midi clip , then in the lower left hand corner click the little " E " for envelope .
Now , in the envelope box thats opened up you have a couple of choices - I assumed that this was only useful for modulating the 3 big buttons - Pitch Bend , Pan , Volume .
However , if you look above Pitch Bend there are two drop downs - top one is the machine that hosts all the parameters ( for me , Ableton 's Operator synth ) and in the second dropdown select the parameter you want to modulate - made it much , much easier for me to automate a buildup in one of my leads .
try it !
Will continue to update this post with fun things that I find and I encourage others to do the same !

Adding a grain delay and two stacked beat repeats with subtle settings ( I recommend starting with Microfillz or Semisubtle presets ) is always fun for making a little glitchy madness .
Do the unlinked envelope trick on the delay , feedback , wet / dry and pitch parameters of the grain delay .
Resample .
I do this sort of thing on my leads sometimes to spice things up .
Another trick I like : I group my bass and kick , then add an audio track with this chain of effects .
First , a vocoder , set to enhance with noise as the carrier .
Second , a bandpass filter set high in the freq range , with a long LFO on it , so it changes slowly .
Third , a pingpong delay set to about 40 milliseconds , medium feedback and wet / dry settings , then another pingpong delay set to whatever setting seems best .
Set the vocoder to receive audio from the kick / bass group .
This makes very nice almost highhat like washes of sound .

Small break buildups :
Works best on pads and other sounds that have been in the background
chop a hole in your kick / bass a bar or two ( or however long you want the break to be ) , then insert a frequency shifter on the things you want to accelerate
automate a rise in frequency from the beginning of the break to the end of the break , then have it drop back to normal .
also can play with different LFOs on the frequency shifter for more interesting effects
creates a rise in energy , also can add emphasis to a lead sound if a prominent part plays inside the break willsanquil

Been experimenting with using sidechain compression on a return track for making cool one shots really rip through the mix ... just insert compressor side chained to an FX track on a return , then automate that for really subtle ducking willsanquil

what I like about ableton is the ability to take snap shots .
for example , look into chains and their automation with dummy clips .
you can start up instantly really complex setups of effects , route them wherever you want anytime you want without interruption .
lemme try to give an example .
It 's really hard to control a complex effect like beat repeat or glitchy plugins you can find over the net .
But if you get a nice effect going , you just drag it out to your templates folder in ableton .
Drag it in again to a audio effect rack into a separate chain in every ableton track you created or create from now on ... this gives you all these settings back .
WOW , no reconfiguration , no rerouting if you stick to a certain buildup ( track template ) ... and now the fun starts , twist them up and export the settings again .
drag them back again ... a simple sequencer just is n't capable of that .
now set up your midi - controller for these chains , some cc 's controlled in realtime ... it 's so amazing to have everything you ever created ( sound FX wise ) back in every project you want .
try to route send effects back to a control group in cubase pre V 4 ... it 's not possible .
for example I like to route delays and reverbs as send effects , so in the actual tracks of the single synths I have a pretty dry signal to export .
if you want to have send effects and run them through a filter , try that .
it 's so easy with ableton .
it was hard with older versions of cubase .
like controlling the volume of the synth and having that result on the effect chain in one go ... headacke time before .
I think why I love ableton so much is because I 've started with trackers .
With trackers , every note on or note off information had the possibility to control ADSR and so much things on top very easily .
This ability came back with ableton .
When trying to do complex edits very quickly with other sequencers , I had to open this track , open this sub-editor and yadda yadda .
These edits got locked to exactly this part of the sequence .
( if you worked with separate midi tracks for midi automation , one could do that too , but it got messy real quick )
In Ableton , you create several midi tracks controlling the same synth .
One contains the note , another controls the release of the notes or whatever you feel like .
You can play these automationes on every sequence you created , disregarding the exact point of time in your composition .
You can use the actual midi track or a dummy track , thinking of that , ableton never really intended this functionality !
I 'm sure you can do that with every sequencer with the right amount of work .
It just never came so fluently like I was used in a tracker ( and ableton ) .
I really recommend shifting to a clip based setup , controlled by a grid controller like apc40 or novation launchpad .
creation of music was never that intuitive .
But frankly , lots of people made better sound with much more limited gear .
it 's just such a joy with ableton for me ...
In the end , I realize - no actual tips in my post .
But I really feel obligated to recommend everyone into looking into tracker based music creation and the fast - forward thinking of pattern based creation instead of the silly timeline everyone is so used .
Use the piano roll - lots of nonse sence - but there 's much to gain from sites like
http://www.thecovertoperators.org/
http://drumkill.com/?p=15
and the ableton forums .
meh , I can't find most of the links I 've collected .
Luckely they went by heart pretty quick
feel free to ask , I like to give my limited knowledge to anyone keen to demand soundcloud.com / epsylohm Scolopendra

This technique has served me well when analyzing songs that I like and has taught me a good deal about arrangement / song structure :
Find the song you want to learn about , find the BPM , chuck it onto your timeline .
Go through the song and label the major parts and transitions , breakdowns , lead 1 enters lead 2 blah blah
Once you 're done w/ the general arrangement layout , time to get more specific - whats the bass pattern ?
Most of the time it is hard to discern the pattern from looking at a raw waveform , so put an auto filter or an EQ on the track , adjust it so that you can * only * hear the bass or whatever piece you are trying to analyze .
Freeze the track , create a new audio track underneath , copy the frozen body to the new audio track - presto chango your waveform now reflects only what was passing through the filter - most of the time the bass pattern will jump right out at you , or lead , or whatever
this is great because say you always liked this one lead , but it comes at you so fast its hard to see how many notes are in it .
apply a band pass filter to the original waveform , zero in on the lead .
freeze and bounce , now play just a bar or two at a time and look at the waveform - should be able to clearly see if its 16th or 32nd notes , etc ...

oh the freeze bounce technique , if you didnt know .... just freeze a track and if you copy that track and paste it into a audio track , you will get the processed waveform instead of the MIDI notes or whatever .
Much more time efficient than changing the routing and recording into a new audio track .
However , freezing does n't work with side chain compression so :\ dija

look up " dummy clips " on google .
there is an ableton wiki all about dummy clips if you google it .
dummy clips modulate anything you wan't on a clip , much like the envelope of the actual clip , only you can use many different dummy clips for one real clip , so its not just one envelope setting repeating over and over , and you can use the same dummy clip on any clip you want ore more than once at once etc.
if clip modulation is an area of interest to you , dummy clips are you 're best friend .

Following on the idea of the procrastination dash and Jeff ’s progressive dash , I ’ve been experimenting with a squirelly new system to pound through my procrastinated to - do list .
Brace yourself , because it is a bit more byzantine than is Merlin 2005 ’s newly stripped - down habit .
It ’s called ( 10+2 ) * 5 , and today it will save your ass .
Who it ’s for
procrastinators
the easily distracted
compulsive web - surfers
people with a long list of very short tasks ( a/k/a “ mosquitos ” )
people having trouble chipping away at very large tasks
What you ’ll need
a timer must be easy to reset
electronic kitchen timer is particularly good ( pref. with multiple alarm memories ) , or
an app like Minuteur ( get the newest version — several cool new features ) a reduced subset of your to - do list tasks that can be worked on ( not necessarily completed ) in blocks of 10 minutes or less
GTD people : next actions only , please an hour of your time ( less is potentially okay , but it ’s non-canonical ) your sorry , procrastinating ass
How it works
It ’s called “ ( 10+2 ) * 5 ” and here ’s why :
10 - Work for ten minutes with single - minded focus on moving toward completion on a single task .
Ten minutes , and that ’s all you ’re allowed to do is work , work , work .
No cheating , because ( DING ! ) you actually get a break when you ’re done …
- Work for ten minutes with single - minded focus on moving toward completion on a single task .
Ten minutes , and that ’s all you ’re allowed to do is work , work , work .
No cheating , because ( ) you actually get a break when you ’re done …
2 - After ten minutes of sweaty , dedicated work you get a 2 - minute break to do whatever you want — drink coffee , read 5ives , call your bookie , whatever .
When the two minutes are up , it ’s back to work on the next task on your list .
This is important .
- After ten minutes of sweaty , dedicated work you get a 2 - minute break to do whatever you want — drink coffee , read 5ives , call your bookie , whatever .
When the two minutes are up , it ’s back to work on the task on your list .
This is important .
* 5 - You ’re going to iterate this four more times for a total of one hour ’s working / breaking
Important squirrely rules
You do not need to finish your task or your project in ten minutes ; you just need to move it forward
If you finish a satisfying amount of work in fewer than ten minutes , STOP , and go right to your 2 - minute break , than start another 10 - minute dash
Do NOT skip breaks !
You are not allowed .
Breaks can not be missed .
Period .
Go surf the web .
Now .
Seriously .
GO !
What will happen
You ’ll blaze through an hour ’s worth of work / not work and will find yourself looking forward to both the breaking and working parts of the cycle .
( Dang , how ’s that for a change ? )
The MacGuffin
The Now Habit
by Neil Fiore by
Okay , you caught me .
That ’s the hack : you can and eventually will skip breaks .
In his ( extremely wonderful ) The Now Habit , Neil Fiore suggests a similar habit of “ unscheduling , ” where you only make obligations to the things that you enjoy and that are not the source of procrastination .
John Perry suggests “ Structured Procrastination , ” where you only give high priority to “ unimportant ” tasks .
Of course , this is taken to a hilarious extreme with Joshua Newman ’s plan for scheduling just a few minutes of work per hour , and then focusing on the “ more important ” tasks like DVD re-arranging .
In all these cases — each of which will surely seem ludicrous to the “ Why do n’t you just go do your damned work ? ” crowd — the trick is to snap your mind out of the inert state that ’s allowing procrastination to take over .
You ’re breaking down whatever resistance has made you not do what your brain knows needs to be done .
Your hacks for your problems
“ ( 10+2 ) * 5 ” can be adapted in any number of ways ( change any of the three numerals to your liking ) , but remember : these goofy hacks only work because you ’re a pathetic bastard like me whose mind can be tricked into work as easily as it can be lulled into torpor .
Set your rules , follow your rules , and keep moving forward .
Snap that procrastination by slipping your work through the back door .
Now go take a break .
You ’ve earned , you hard - working hacker , you .

By the same date — 2015 — that the new 35.5 mpg EPA mandate is due to go into effect , oil companies are also mandated by Congress to double the amount of corn ethanol use ( from 2007 levels ) to 15 billion gallons .
The current mandate of a 10 percent ethanol mix in fuel wo n’t get us there , so the powerful corn lobby is demanding EPA increase the mandate to a 15 percent ethanol mix .
Trouble is , a gallon of ethanol is 30 percent less efficient than a gallon of gas meaning that the more ethanol you mix in , the worse your gas mileage .
Department of Energy studies show steadily decreasing fuel economy as ethanol blends rise from so - called E10 ( fuel composed of 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gas ) up through E15 and E20 — with E20 suffering a 7.7 percent fuel efficiency loss .
Yet DOE ’s green - zealot - in - chief Steven Chu still favors an increased mix of ethanol .
So while automakers are sweating under the federal gun to make increasingly fuel - efficient engines , the government is mandating they do it with less - efficient fuel .
Supreme Court and Rules of the Game
Supreme Court and Rules of the Game
COLUMBUS , Ohio --
The Detroit Red Wings realize they are not measured by how they perform in the regular season .
They have piled up so many wins and points over the years that it ’s easy to take their success for granted .
But after Friday ’s 1 - 0 shootout victory against the Columbus Blue Jackets at Nationwide Arena -- in a goaltending duel between Jimmy Howard and Steve Mason -- the Red Wings reached 100 points for the 10th consecutive season , extending their own NHL record .
It wo n’t mean anything when the playoffs start next week , but considering how hard they had to battle , how many injuries they had to overcome , this 100 - point season might be their most satisfying .
“ It ’s something we should be proud of , keep that streak going , ’’ Kris Draper said .
“ We know we do n’t get measured on what we do in the regular season , but you want to win as many games as you can , especially this year , when a lot of people had written us off . ’’
There were even some doubts within the team that they could reach this plateau .
But a 15 - 3 - 2 record since the Olympic break made it possible .
“ I remember looking at the standings a while ago and thinking there was no chance ( at 100 points ) , ’’ defenseman Brad Stuart said .
“ It ’s a credit to everybody in here that we were able to put a good run together . ’’
Said forward Todd Bertuzzi : “ A lot of people wrote us off numerous times during the year , but we kept on going .
To get 100 points is pretty impressive , especially the way we had man -game losses ( injuries ) .
It ’s something we ’ve been building on and trying to get better for the real deal . ’’
Mason made 45 saves in regulation and overtime .
Howard made 22 stops for his third shutout .
The Red Wings outscored the Blue Jackets 2 - 1 in the shootout .
Pavel Datsyuk and Rick Nash each scored on their team ’s first shot , and Bertuzzi won it on his club ’s fourth attempt , roofing a backhand shot over Mason after his usual slow - motion approach .
He worked on the shot during the team ’s three - day respite last month in Kelowna , British Columbia .
“ I missed a couple of ( shootout attempts ) with a couple of other moves I had , so I thought I ’d work on it and try to come up with something new , ’’ Bertuzzi said .
“ Done it a bit and it seems to be working . ’’
Howard could empathize with Mason .
“ It ’s absolutely annoying when he goes against me in practice because he comes in so slow , ’’ Howard said .
“ You ’re just at his mercy , because when he comes in , if he speeds up or starts stick - handling the way he did tonight , you pretty much got no chance . ’’
The win assured the Red Wings of not finishing in eighth place in the Western Conference .
They will finish anywhere from fifth to seventh , but their first - round opponent probably wo n’t be determined until after their season finale Sunday afternoon in Chicago .
“ It did n’t matter to me where we finished in the standings as long as we got in ( the playoffs ) , because I ’m very confident in our team and I think we can take on any single team , ’’ Howard said .
This is the second time Mason and Howard have faced each other in a game that was scoreless in regulation .
The Blue Jackets defeated the Red Wings 1 - 0 on Fredrik Modin ’s goal at 3:12 of overtime Dec. 28 .
“ He ’s a great goalie .
He always plays well against us , ’’ Howard said .
“ I have to rise to the occasion because I know we might not get many past him . ’’
Mason stopped Darren
Helm on a penalty shot at 7:26 of the third period to keep the game scoreless .
Helm was about to make a deke when the 6 - foot - 4 Mason used his reach to poke - check the puck off his stick .
Helm was awarded the penalty shot when he was hooked by Grant Clitsome on a breakaway .
“ I was n’t really prepared , ’’ Helm said .
“ I was just trying to go on my backhand .
Maybe I should n’t have tried to deke and should have just shot .
It ’s easier to think about it now . ’’
Detroit is 5 - 0 - 1 against Columbus this season .
“ In the end , we got what we needed , ’’ Red Wings coach Mike Babcock said .
“ We got some exercise , the team played well and everyone ’s feeling good . ’’
This week , the house of Gizmodo editor Jason Chen was raided by police over the matter .
A significant number of items were seized , including documents , computers , servers , digital cameras , hard drives , mobile phones , laptops and other gadgets .
Gizmodo publisher Gawker Media argues the raid was unlawful because Chen is a journalist and protected by US shield laws .
The company had already returned the prototype to Apple , but only after all of its secrets were revealed .
The controversy surrounding the raid has deepened after it emerged that Apple sits on the steering committee of the Rapid Enforcement Allied Computer Team ( REACT ) taskforce , which was responsible for the raid on Chen 's house .
The Santa Clara County District Attorney 's office told Yahoo !
News in a statement that Apple provided the taskforce with " advice , recommendations , strategic input and direction " , but the extent of the company 's involvement in the Gizmodo raid is not yet clear .
Authorities have already confirmed that their criminal investigation into the alleged theft of the iPhone prototype from the bar came at the request of Apple .
Nobody has been charged with a crime .
Following the raid on Chen 's house , law enforcement officers were able to identify and interview the man who took the phone from the bar , the San Jose Business Journal reported .
However , the man has not yet been identified and it is not yet clear if he is the same person who sold the phone to Gizmodo .
But Wired.com reported today that , according to insiders , Apple representatives also visited the house of the phone finder and asked for permission to search his house .
A roommate reportedly refused to let them in .
The source told Wired that the goal of shopping the prototype to tech blogs was not to make money but to confirm that it was in fact the next iPhone .
Nevertheless , legal experts have said both the finder and Gizmodo could face criminal charges .
Some have found it curious that REACT , a taskforce set up to investigate high - tech crimes , was handling a case involving a phone left in a bar .
However , the risks to Apple as a result of the intellectual property leak are far greater than one missing handset .
Apple is known for being one of the most secretive tech companies in the world , and the leak of the prototype killed some of the mystique surrounding the upcoming device and might dissuade people from buying the current iPhone model .
Matt Zimmerman , spokesman for the Electronic Frontier Foundation , said the raid on Chen 's house was unlawful because reporters such as Chen were protected from police searches aimed at uncovering confidential sources and seizing other information developed during newsgathering activities .
" The police appear to have gone too far , " said Zimmerman , adding police were putting the interests of Apple ahead of citizens ' rights .
" Now that First Amendment lawyers , reporters , and others have highlighted the potential legal improprieties of this search , the taskforce should freeze their investigation , return Chen 's property and reconsider whether going after journalists for trying to break news about one of the Valley 's most secretive ( and profitable ) companies is a good expenditure of taxpayer dollars . "
Authorities have said Chen 's computers , hard drives and servers would remain untouched until investigators determined whether Chen was in fact protected by US shield laws .
A crucial question will be whether shield laws apply , given that the prototype was believed by law enforcement officers to have been stolen .
Meanwhile , Nokia , by contrast , has taken a very different approach to leaks .
Its new smartphone , the N8 , fell into the hands of a Russian blogger , who published extensive details before the launch day .
Nokia did not initiate a police raid or sack any staff , instead opting to ask for the prototype back politely in a blog post .
The company made a veiled attack on Apple in its post .
Loading " While we are determined to protect our intellectual property and maintain the surprise when a shiny new gadget is introduced , we are not going to do so at the expense of the working conditions we enjoy here at Nokia , " the company wrote .
" We are not the Secret Police , and we want to maintain our culture of openness . "
Maoist rebels in eastern India killed at least 76 paramilitary troops Tuesday , authorities said , underscoring the continued strength of an insurgency that India has tried for decades to wipe out .
The dawn attack in Chhattisgarh state was among the deadliest by the guerrillas in memory .
S.R. Kalluri , a deputy police inspector in densely forested Dantewada district , where the attack occurred , told local reporters that the troops were on an extended patrol and stopped to rest Monday night .
Insurgents learned of their location and “ at the break of dawn the Maoists attacked , ” Kalluri said .
“ Now we are chalking a strategy to retaliate . ”
Several thousand people have died in attacks since the Maoist insurgency began in the late 1960s .
The rebels are said to number about 20,000 , including an estimated 6,000 hard - core combatants .
In recent months , they have stepped up their attacks in response to a police offensive initiated late last year across several “ red corridor ” states .
On Sunday , rebels set off a land mine that killed at least 10 members of an elite anti-Maoist unit in the mineral - rich eastern state of Orissa .
The rebels are funded in part by hundreds of millions of dollars extorted from companies each year .
Their arsenal includes automatic rifles , shoulder - fired rocket launchers , mines and related explosives , some of which have been stolen from Indian authorities and some purchased from Chinese smugglers .
The Maoists , who say they are fighting for poor farmers and landless workers , are particularly strong in impoverished , rural areas where basic government services are limited and local corruption is endemic .
India ’s expanding middle class displays its affluence in the cities , clogging roads and crowding shopping centers , but vast swaths of the country have not shared in the economic gains .
Home Affairs Minister P. Chidambaram said an evident intelligence failure allowed the patrol , a joint operation of state and central government forces , to walk into a trap .
Monday was reportedly the second night that the paramilitary units had been camping out in remote jungle terrain .
Police spokesman R.K.
Vij estimated that 1,000 rebels took part in the attack ; others put the number closer to 300 .
Although the central government has claimed progress in its Operation Green Hunt campaign against the Maoists , the number of attackers and their ability to avoid detection suggest that the government faces a tough fight .
More than 1,000 attacks , resulting in 600 deaths , were recorded last year .
“ They will hit you where you are the weakest and run and hide when you are strong , ” said Ajai Sahni , executive director of the New Delhi - based Institute for Conflict Management , a think tank .
“ It is the basic principle of guerrilla warfare .
. . .
The government needs to stop telling people about massive deployments and giving sound bites to the media .
It needs to develop a strategy . ”

It is just over a month since the cringeworthy Labour Foreign Secretary , David Miliband went through the motions in the House of Commons , over the abuse of British Passports in the Dubai murder case by the Israeli intelligence agencies .
UK Passports ( Use in Dubai Murder ) - Oral Answers to Questions -- Justice - House of Commons debates , 23 March 2010 , 3:36 pm
David Miliband ( Secretary of State , Foreign and Commonwealth Office ; South Shields , Labour ) [...]
The Government take this matter extremely seriously .
Such misuse of British passports is intolerable .
It presents a hazard to the safety of British nationals in the region .
Also , it represents a profound disregard for the sovereignty of the UK .
The fact that that was done by a country that is a friend , with significant diplomatic , cultural , business and personal ties to the UK , only adds insult to injury .
No country or Government could stand by in such a situation . [...]
However , I have asked for a member of the embassy of Israel to be withdrawn from the UK as a result of this affair , and that is taking place . [...]
Martin Linton MP is Chair of Labour Friends of Palestine & the Middle East .
Martin Linton ( Battersea , Labour ) I commend my right hon .
Friend on his decisive action in expelling a so far unnamed diplomat from the Israeli embassy , although he is of course welcome to name him .
I have the diplomatic list , from the ambassador to the defence attaché , who , to refer to the previous question , just happens to be a Colonel Kaufman . [...]
Peter Bone ( Wellingborough , Conservative ) Could the Foreign Secretary be clearer ?
He has been very evasive about the person who will be expelled .
Could the Foreign Secretary say what position the person held ?
Did he have any relationship to Mossad ?
David Miliband ( Secretary of State , Foreign and Commonwealth Office ; South Shields , Labour ) I am not going to give any further information about the individual concerned , and I am not going to describe anything further about the role that he played .
I have been very clear about the basis on which he was chosen .
That is the right thing to do
David Miliband should never have represented our country as Foreign Secretary .
When he is not insulting our intelligence , he is fawning over some foreign leaders and insulting other foreign heads of state whilst smirking and grinning .
This may suit Gordon Brown , for petty internal Labour party reasons , but it is yet another reason to get rid of the lot of them at the May 6th elections .
Martin Linton is one of the few Labour backbenchers who has spoken out in favour compuslory ID Cards and the the National Identity Register , although most have them have voted in favour ..
Hopefully , with a majority of only 137 , he will be voted out on May 6th .
Martin Linton seems to have been wrong about the name of the defence attaché at the Israeli Embassy in London - he probably relied on the annually printed version of the London Diplomatic List , rather than the online versions , which now seem to be published approximately every month .
Hansard has misspelled the name as " Kaufman " rather than " Caufman " , presumably because the debate also had a contribution by Labour MP Sir Gerald Kaufman .
Colonel Gil - Shlomo Caufman was Defence & Armed Forces Attaché at the Israeli Embassy in London until at least August 2009 .
Colonel Hadar Furman was Defence & Armed Forces Attaché at the Israeli Embassy in London from at least November 2009 and was listed as such at the time of the diplomatic expulsion statement on 23rd March 2010 .
Has this diplomat or intelligence officer ( either from Mossad or Shabak or Aman etc. ) actually been expelled from London yet ?

Presumably nobody had yet been expelled in the 18 days between the Ministerial Statement on 22nd March and the publication of the 9th of April London Diplomatic List .
Will Colonel Hadar Furman , or will someone else turn out to have been the diplomat who was expelled , when the next London Diplomatic List is published ?

David Miliband 's Orwellian newspeak and doublethink showed through , when he attempted to pretend that a major objection against the National Identity Register , somehow makes a case for it .
Edward Garnier ( Shadow Attorney General , Justice ; Harborough , Conservative )
The point that my right hon .
and learned Friend Mr. Hogg made is just as important even if one is not dealing with an alleged killing .
The courts of England send people with no previous convictions to prison for passport forgery and their sentences are measured in years .
What does this story tell us about the integrity of the Government 's proposals for identity cards ?
Does it not undermine the Government 's case ?
David Miliband ( Secretary of State , Foreign and Commonwealth Office ; South Shields , Labour ) I am delighted that the hon .
and learned Gentleman has raised that point , because it makes a very strong case precisely for the national identity register that we propose .
I think that many people , if they can be diverted from the issue at hand for a moment , will see that the determination to have a national identity register precisely fits into the sort of concerns that people have about identity theft .
Actually , the case is made for the proposal that the Government have put forward , and I hope that the hon .
and learned Gentleman will reconsider his opposition to it .
So is the Labour plan to share the sensitive personal details held on the National Identity Register with all foreign governments ?
This would make it even easier for foreign governments to forge UK Passports .
American presidents used to promise a chicken in every pot .
If it were up to Google it would be a smart meter in every home .
In an initiative with the Climate Group , the company this week wrote a letter and hosted a summit at its Washington DC offices to urge Barack Obama to adopt a goal of providing every household with real time information about their electricity use .
" By giving people the ability to monitor and manage their energy consumption , for instance , via their computers , phones or other devices , we can unleash the forces of innovation in homes and businesses , " says the letter , signed by more than 40 leading businesses and environmental groups .
As the roster of signatures - which includes Nokia , General Electric , AT&T , Intel and Hewlett Packard - suggests Google is not the only company to see huge potential in upgrading America 's antiquated grid with modern information technology .
More than 200 start - ups are now working on energy information devices to provide consumers with actionable information on how their electricity is generated , eg coal or solar ; the cost of running appliances ; and the price according to the time of day .
Google has already launched its PowerMeter , a free web device that allows people to track their electricity use from their computers .
The companies claim devices such as these can make an immediate difference in behaviour , getting people to switch off lights or do their laundry at night , when electricity is cheaper .
Charlene Begley , the chief executive officer of GE 's home and business solutions , said they were finding a 7 % to 10 % reduction in energy use after installation of real - time metering devices .
But there is a lot the companies still do n't know .
How much information do consumers really want ?
Do they want to be nagged to switch off the lights every night , or will they rebel ?
It 's not even clear how they want that information delivered : by smart phone , computer widget , or television ( if at all ) .
" We are not ready to place a bet on any one format , " said Lorie Wigle , the head of Intel 's eco-technology unit .
Who owns the highly personal information collected in private homes ?
How do you protect consumers ' privacy ?
" It could be very attractive to package this and sell it in all kinds of ways , " said Leslie Harris , president of the Centre for Democracy and Technology .
Then there is the problem of hackers .
And , even as the Obama administration funds the roll - out of some 18 million smart meters ( with some $ 3.4bn alloted under last year 's economic recovery plan ) it remains unclear who is to pay for the transition .
The summit was told the administration has to do more to promote the deployment of new technologies , such as offering rebates to consumers and helping companies with the initial expense of smart technology .
Begley said it could cost GE more than $ 200 m to develop a refrigerator capable of automatically adjusting functions according to the time of day .
" We have to be able to show shareholders a promising return , " she said .
It is also crucial to reassure consumers that they will indeed be better - off having the new technology in their home .
In Texas and California , initial limited rollouts of smart meters have generated thousands of complaints and even lawsuits claiming that the meters led to much higher electricity prices .
California 's regulatory authority ordered an independent audit of the smart meters deployed by one company , Pacific Gas & Electricity .
In some cases , customers reported bills three times higher than normal even when they were away on holiday .
For the rollout of a new technology that does n't look very smart .
Being innovative and outrageously creative in drug smuggling schemes requires a lot of desperation and obviously a lot of brains .
Conversely , evidently as creative as the list of such schemes is as below , they all still got caught .
Nevertheless , they do deserve a cachet for coming up with such ingenious ideas .
Continue reading for the list !
Chopping and slicing thinly sheets of cocaine to make it look just like Pringles and then putting them in a can of Pringles is definitely a pure desperate act of genius .
In 2006 , Austin , Texas , police found about 168 grams of cocaine inside a can of Pringles .
The cocaine was ingeniously made to look like the actual Pringles crisps .
Talk about creativity !
We have all heard of religious statues being filled with drugs , but imagine a statue being made of plaster and drugs , and that to a statue of no ordinary bloke , but that of Jesus !
In 2008 , in Texas , the U.S. customs officials caught a woman at the border crossing in Laredo .
She was carrying the 6.6 pound statue and trying to escape to Mexico .
The creators of this specific statue were so creative with their craft , that they made the entire statue of the Christian Savior with illicit white powder , painted the statue and made it look extremely regal .
They were actually hoping to sell it for $ 30 , 000 .
Constricted blood vessels , increased blood pressure , mental alertness and increased energy are just some of the cocaine effects that become apparent in the short term .
3. Leg Cast
In March , 2009 , Spanish police arrested a man who had arrived at Barcelona airport from Chile after successfully formatting that the cast on his fractured leg was actually made of cocaine .
The peculiar thing about this innovative way of smuggling drugs is that , the 66 year old Chilean man had a real fracture of two bones below the knee .
However the police suspected that he or his accomplices may have actually fractured the leg intentionally , just so that the cocaine cast could be applied .
The police seized 4.8 kilograms ( 10.5 lb ) of cocaine from a leg cast .
4. Human Hair Extensions
In 2006 , Namibian authorities caught a 21 year old Angolan national at the HoseaKutako International Airport , in connection with an alleged plan of smuggling drugs into the country .
The extremely creative aspect of this case of drug smuggling is that the suspect was attempting to use cocaine lightly spread over some 76 packets of human hair extensions .
5. Stuffing of a Giant Squid with a Dash of Pepper
In 2004 , Peruvian police seized nearly 1,540 pounds ( 700 Kilograms ) of cocaine that was stuffed and hidden in a frozen giant squid , which was bound to go to Mexico and the United States .
The much artistic fashion of smuggling drugs in this manner was not only filling a frozen giant squid with cocaine but further wrapping it up in pepper , so that in case they were caught , the sniffer dogs would be left off sneezing from the scene and diverts the officials .
However , that did not happen and the police caught about seven suspects .
6. Condoms Wrapped with Drugs Stuffed into Snakes
In 1993 , the Drug Enforcement Agents at Miami airport seized nearly 36 kilograms of cocaine wrapped in condoms and stuffed in Boa constrictors .
The snakes had been imported from South America , and were still alive when they were found .
There were over 312 snakes about 1.5 meters in length .
The cocaine was actually found by mistake when one of the snakes appeared to have an abnormal bulge .
The security officials X - rayed it to see what was inside and ultimately removed two condom wrapped pellets .
No one was charged in relation to the case , as the officials were unable to find the people behind not only such a creative , baffling and a little perverted drug smuggling case .
7. Baby s Diaper filled with Drugs
In June , 2009 , a 22 year old young mother was caught trying to smuggle amphetamines into a Rheinbach prison , by filling up her daughter ’s diaper with the drugs .
The police arrested the young woman and her 41 year old husband .
The police found 15 grams of amphetamines and 46 pills in their 17 month old daughter ’s diaper .
Upon further investigation , the police recovered 12 grams of amphetamines hidden in her clothing as well .
Sure it was creative to smuggle drugs in a diaper , but into a federal prison ?
How absurd could one get ?
8. Hiding Drugs In Garden Gnomes
Seriously who would even think of looking for drugs in garden gnomes , but hats off for the granny who hid coke in her garden gnomes ?
Yes !
The 52 year old woman was caught with in excess of nearly three kilograms of Charlie at the Auckland Airport in 2004 .
The drug known to be the Peruvian Red Bull was secretly hidden inside four garden gnomes in a suitcase .
Linda Martin , the accused , blamed that she had been hoodwinked by a Nigerian drug gang .
After her trial , Justice John Priestly established that Martin was immature , but as she knew that she was dealing with drug trafficker , and also considering her cooperation with the customs and the police , her health problems and her obvious lack of previous convictions , he granted her imprisonment for eight and a half years .
9. Drug Bugs
In 2007 , custom officials in Amsterdam found 100 dead beetles that had been stuffed with cocaine , while inspecting a package from Peru .
The bugs contained a total of 300 grams of cocaine .
The estimated street value of the drugs from bugs was about 8,000 Euros ( $ 11,270 ) .
A government spokesperson said that they had never seen anything like that previously .
Well obviously , they had not , there seems to be no end to such creative endeavors .
10 . Intoxicating Holy Water
In 2008 , a 50 year old man was arrested near the Niagara Falls after trying to illegally enter the United States from Canada .
He claimed that he had bought a few religious items .
While the man was being questioned by the US Custom officers and the Border Protection officials , a Customs dog sniffed out the drug that the man was carrying .
Once laboratory tests came out , it was confirmed that the man was not carrying any religious items , namely Holy Water but they were bottles filled with Ketamine , which is an extremely powerful hallucinogenic used mostly as a date rape drug .

In the video , plainclothes officers chase a patron into a storefront doorway .
One man is pushed face - first to the ground and handcuffed .
Another patron is knocked down as two officers rush past .
Some carry nightclubs .
One officer appears to slap a patron twice on the head .
The images could be out of a late - night cop show .
But the video shows the March 31 raid of the headquarters of CALM , or Cannabis As Living Medicine , at 106 Queen St. E .
The compassion club , which sells medical marijuana to patients suffering from chronic diseases , posted the video on YouTube after piecing together footage from security cameras .
Police have not yet commented on the raid .
But the images provide an example of what can happen in the legal grey zone in which compassion clubs operate in Canada .
“ Until recently , it seemed like authorities were looking the other way , ” said Dr. Chris Cavacuiti , a family physician at St. Michael ’s Hospital .
“ Nobody was really sure where it stood . ”
According to Neev Tapiero , CALM ’s owner , this is the first time police have raided the club since it opened in 1996 .
Compassion clubs across Canada sporadically face police scrutiny .
In February , the Qikiqtani Compassion Club in Iqaluit was shut down by police .
Owner Ed DeVries plans to defend his possession charges by mounting a constitutional challenge .
He claims people in Nunavut who could benefit from medical marijuana are having their rights violated because the medical community will not provide the legal documentation required by Health Canada .
Health Canada granted access to medical marijuana in July 2001 .
The Marihuana Medical Access Regulations define the conditions for which an individual is permitted to use , possess or produce medical marijuana .
Palliative care patients , patients with specific symptoms and medical conditions or patients for whom conventional treatment has failed can apply to possess medical marijuana from Health Canada .
Conditions and symptoms the agency lists include : severe pain and / or muscle spasms from multiple sclerosis , spinal cord injury or spinal cord disease , and severe pain , weight loss and nausea from cancer or HIV / AIDS infection .
According to Health Canada , “ applicants must provide a declaration from a medical practitioner to support their application . ”
However , physicians are largely uncomfortable in this gatekeeper roll .
The Canadian Medical Protective Association ( CMPA ) , which provides legal defence and liability protection to physicians , recommends that doctors ask a patient to sign a “ release from liability form ” before completing Health Canada ’s application .
Physicians are required to submit the daily amount , form and route of administration of marijuana the “ applicant intends to use , ” according to the CMPA .
Applicants for Health Canada - approved marijuana must also declare they have discussed the risks with the physician who signs the form .
Cavacuiti said physicians are generally uncomfortable with Health Canada ’s required forms .
“ It ’s being used as a medication and Health Canada is asking physicians to state that this medication can be safely used in this individual patient , ” said Cavacuiti .
“ I think many doctors have some concerns about that because it has n’t gone the same rigorous clinical trial evaluation that most medications are forced to before they become approved as prescribable medications . ”
According to Health Canada , as of June 2009 , 4,029 people were allowed to possess dried marijuana and 2,841 were allowed to cultivate or produce marijuana for medical purposes .
In Ontario , 1,631 people have been authorized by Health Canada to possess medical marijuana and 801 physicians supported Health Canada ’s application for medical marijuana .
Cavacuiti said physicians are more likely to suggest patients get medical marijuana from compassion clubs , such as CALM , which only ask physicians to list a patient ’s diagnosis .

“ I think there is generally a higher level of comfort in the physician community with providing a list of diagnoses a patient has and confirming the diagnoses with organizations like CALM , ” Cavacuiti said .
CALM ’s lawyer Ron Marzel said the compassion club is lobbying for clearance from Health Canada to sell medical marijuana .
Nine people , including CALM ’s owner , face drug charges following the raid .
The compassion club has about 3,000 registered members .
About 10 per cent have federally issued cards permitting them to possess medical marijuana , while the rest have written approval from a doctor , chiropractor or naturopath .
Hey , remember that infamous Ubisoft DRM that requires you to maintain a perfect internet connection ?
That was a big problem for a lot of folks .
Well , a big problem for about 24 hours , at least .
If rumors currently going around the scene are true , Silent Hunter 5 , a submarine sim released by Ubisoft and equipped the DRM that will also be vexing owners of Assassin 's Creed 2 , Settlers 7 - and all future PC gamers who wish to buy their Ubisoft games legitimately - has already been cracked wide open by cracker group SKIDROW .
According to instructions from the released crack files ' .nfo document , the process is apparently quite simple :
Do n't use / install Ubisoft launcher , or block any connection to the internet .
Install game and copy crack , it 's that simple !
We do n't intend to download the game for the sake of confirming the claim ( that would just be rude ) , but if they 're true , it really did n't take too long at all .
Ubisoft 's new DRM cracked in under 24 - hours [ Infoaddict , thanks to Michael for the tip ! ]

The human memory can be impressive , but it is equally prone to letting us down .
Now groundbreaking research has revealed the extent of just how fragile it can be - and how to use it better .
You 're in the pub and trouble starts .
There is shouting , someone is stabbed , they die .
It happened right in front of your eyes and the police want to speak to you .
But what exactly did you see ?
It 's long been accepted that eyewitness testimony may not always be as reliable as it seems .
The problem is people simply do n't remember exactly what happened , say psychologists .
The mind does not work like a video camera , nowhere in the brain is the perfect memory of everything that has been seen , in the order it happened .
Can you pick out the criminal ?
But however fallible human memory is , it 's often the only thing police have to go on and eyewitnesses have been responsible for sending people to prison ever since the justice system began - both rightly and wrongly .
Now research has gone further than ever before to understand the fragile nature of our powers of recall .
The project - involving the Open University , the BBC and Greater Manchester Police ( GMP ) - is groundbreaking in several ways .
The technology it used is cutting edge , including eye trackers - devices for measuring eye positions and eye movement .
But just as unparalleled was the realism involved .
It 's always a big issue with research - how do you accurately test someone 's everyday reactions when they know they are part of an experiment and in controlled conditions ?
Wo n't they try harder to remember details if they know they are doing a memory test ?
' Appalling '
In this case the important action took place when they were least expecting it .
The 10 volunteers were put through days of memory tests in a studio and assumed this was the research .
In fact , two intricately planned and elaborate mock crimes - a fatal stabbing and an armed robbery - were really what mattered .
On one day the participants went for lunch in a local pub , which was really filled with actors , stuntmen and 10 hidden cameras .
A fight broke out and someone appeared to be stabbed and killed .
The whole scenario unfolded over 20 minutes .
EYEWITNESS SIMON WOODTHORPE
The whole experience really surprised me .
I 'd never had a problem with my memory before but had never been in a situation where I 'd been asked to recall things in that much detail .
I was good at describing the overall situation .
But when it came to the real detail of what had happened , I was actually creating a lot of what I thought I 'd remembered .
I 'm not sure I would be confident about saying I 'd seen anything after this .
I 'd be worried about incriminating someone .
" It was incredibly realistic , " says Simon Woodthorpe , 44 , a photographers ' agent who was one of the volunteers .
" We were n't expecting it at all and only started to get suspicious when the police turned up really quickly .
By then it did n't matter , we'd not suspected it was staged so we had n't consciously thought about paying extra attention to all the details .
" I always thought I had a good memory , but I was yards away from the incident , saw it all unfold and still got the murderer wrong .
I said it was the wrong man . "
What was also unprecedented about the project was the access to interviewing techniques used by GMP .
Detectives treated each mock crime as if it were real , interviewing the volunteers , but unlike a real case , the force 's conclusions about what had happened could be checked against what exactly went on .
It was a real test of their skill .
During the drama the eye trackers - still being worn by some volunteers during the mock robbery - were able to pinpoint exactly what people were looking at and compared to what they reported .
The differences , say those involved , were in some cases staggering .
' Lifeblood '
" One person thought they had n't seen the crime being committed , they were adamant about it , " says Dr Graham Pike , a memory expert involved in the project .
" When we reviewed the eye tracker we found they 'd actually spent almost the entire time looking at it unfold .
It was quite amazing . "

What makes the memory this vulnerable is the fact it is malleable and not fixed , says Dr Pike .
" It 's not like inputting data into a computer , the mind does not store facts absolutely the way they are and it does not recall them absolutely accurately either . "
There are three stages in memory , according to modern pyschology .
The first is perception , which is what we see - also what we hear , taste , touch and smell .
This in itself is a selective process .
From the start we can fail to encode detail or simply not notice something , so the information going in is n't accurate .
Secondly there 's storage .
We know we forget things over time , but we also revise our memories and re-write them to fit in with new ideas .
Finally there 's the retrieval stage , where the brain searches out information .
When you remember something , lots of different parts of the brain work together and from that emerges the mental representation that is going to be your experience of a memory .
Every time you recall something , you reinterpret it all over again .
And in every reconstruction process there are many opportunities for error .
' Empty the head '
In a crime situation memory is influenced by many factors such as stress , the presence of a weapon and even just the desire to help police solve the crime .
" Police know how fallible the memory can be , " says Steve Retford , a former head of the investigative skills unit at GMP and now specialist interviewing adviser with the force .
" They also know this is usually not through mischievousness on the part of the witnesses , but through stress and shock . "
Take the case of Jean Charles de Menezes , shot at Stockwell Tube station in 2005 by police who mistook him for a suicide bomber .
Eyewitnesses said he had vaulted a ticket barrier when running away from the police .
In fact it was later shown by CCTV that Mr Menezes had walked through the barriers , having picked up a free newspaper , and only ran when he saw his train arriving .
Memories are reconstructed subconsciously
In some cases erroneous eyewitness testimony has led to false imprisonment .
In the 1970s , the overturning of several eyewitnesses cases resulted in the Devlin Committee 's investigation of identification evidence .
It found many witnesses overstated their ability to single out the right person .
What this latest research has proved is the extent of how fallible the memory can be , which is " massively important " , say those involved .
" That the memory is vulnerable is not new , " says Dr Pike .
" But it is so important that we know how fallible it is and in what ways .
By understanding this better we can design police techniques that make the most of memory . "
For the police , the findings of the project are essential because eyewitnesses are still at the heart of most investigations - even with the growth of CCTV .
" Eyewitnesses are our lifeblood and without them you are usually stuffed , " says Mr Retford .
" Creating the right environment and using the correct psychological tools to get accurate evidence is vital .
You have to be on top of your game and really empty the head of all the detail you need . "
Below is a selection of your comments .
This article just goes to prove how careful the police need to be when piecing together eyewitness statements and really bears out the painstaking number of hours that are required for statements to be checked and re-checked in order to come to the right conclusion when any sort of serious crime has been committed .
Keith Parker , Edinburgh , Scotland
This is why the death penalty is seriously flawed .
Unless hard medical / forensic evidence and / or video tape can be produced , no country should be allowed to execute anyone - even if they do have " eyewitness testimony " .
And even then , it 's debatable , but that 's another story ...
Let 's just be grateful it does n't apply in the UK !
Gemma , Crawley , UK Being interested in psychology as well as crime / forensics I have often played that game with myself .
Recalling an incident - often very recent - and trying to pin down the details .
It is astonishingly hard .
Observational skills are a part of many careers but often the observer is safe , comfortable and well aware of what they are trying to observe .
Unexpected and dangerous situations do n't do the memory any favours at all .
You can see why the police like cameras in more situations than the public might appreciate .
I 'd recommend anyone to try it themselves .
Sit in a cafe , observe an interaction between a few people then , a little later , try to descibe it .
Sandy Fox , Derby , UK I recently saw a burglary and embarassingly , I could n't tell the police anything about the car model or registration .
I was n't even sure about the colour .
I did , however , remember that the getaway driver wore a gold sovereign ring on the middle finger of his left hand .
It seems like a weird thing to have focussed on , and I do n't think that it helped much ...!
Sue , London Hilarious - " we only started to get suspicious when the police turned up really quickly "
Graham , Aberdeen UK I witnessed a robbery and took a mental note of the car make & model , colour and the registration plate .
I was amazed that someone next to me could n't even get the colour of the car correct .
Mike , Potters Bar , UK
It brings the strength to having high qulaity cctv cameras .
You can't rely on people and what they claim , because people have agendas .
John Evans , London
Surly this type of research should make it mandatory for CCTV to be in use in all public places and spaces .
Clearly if we are sending the wrong people to jail based on eye witness accounts the law should be more measured in the relevance of such accounts .
This also explains why it 's so easy for barristers to discredit eye witnesses .
Also this accounts for why I 've been watching my football team all my life , they are clearly rubbish but when I watch them they play great !

It has a double penis , is as long as a tall human , and lives in a heavily populated area of the Philippines .
Yet somehow the giant lizard Varanus bitatawa has gone undetected by science until now .
Long known to Filipino tribal hunters , the monitor lizard was identified as a new species in 2009 via its DNA , scale pattern , size , and peculiar penis , a new study says .
At about six and a half feet ( two meters ) long , the new lizard species is closely related to the world 's largest living lizard , the Komodo dragon .
Unlike the Komodo , though , Varanus bitatawa has evolved to be a vegetarian .
The lizard discovery " comes as an unprecedented surprise , " not least because V. bitatawa's home island of Luzon is " heavily populated and highly deforested , " the study authors write in Wednesday 's issue of the journal Biology Letters .
How the Giant Lizard Hid Out From Science
The researchers suspect the 22 - pound ( 10 - kilogram ) lizard species escaped scientific detection until now because there 've been few reptile surveys of the mountain forests where V. bitatawa lives .
These fruit - eating lizards are also " incredibly secretive , " said study team member and biologist Daniel Bennett of Mampam Conservation .
" You could stay in that forest for years and have absolutely no idea that they are there , " Bennett said .
" They spend all their time high up in trees , more than 20 meters [ 66 feet ] above the ground . "
Similar lizard species spend less than 20 minutes on the ground per week , he added .
But while scientists were n't aware of the lizard , its existence comes as no surprise to resident tribespeople who hunt the creature for its meat .
Photographs of hunters with the lizard delicacy taken in 2001 spurred the team 's two - month expedition in search of the elusive species last summer .
Split Penis Points the Way
The team captured specimens of both V. bitatawa and the extremely rare but closely related Gray 's monitor lizard ( Varanus olivaceus ) , another Philippines native .
Capturing both types of lizards was crucial , Bennett said , because it allowed the team to inspect the two monitor lizards side - by - side and detect subtle differences that can help determine whether the animals represent different species .
One particularly revealing trait was the double - ended penis common to monitor lizards .
The shape of this reptilian feature is unique to each species .
The giant - lizard find " adds to the recognition of the Philippines as a global conservation hot spot and a regional superpower of biodiversity , " the study team says .

A song that ’s been played over speakers at hundreds of campaign rallies , vibrated in the space between drinks at everyone ’s favorite bar and set millions of heads nodding from radio stations coast to coast — a piece of music that is literally stitched into the fabric of American blue - collar culture , Bruce Springsteen ’s “ Born in the USA ” — is , according to right - wing pundit Glenn Beck , “ anti-American ” and “ propaganda ” that people must “ wake up ” from .
ADVERTISEMENT
If you ’re unfamiliar , need a refresher or simply like good music , give it a listen :
The lyrics are available here .
“ Born down in a dead man ’s town , ” the Fox News personality said during his Thursday radio broadcast , quoting Springsteen ’s lyrics .
“ The first kick I took was when I hit the ground .
You end up like a dog that ’s been beat too much .
‘ Til you spend half your life just covering up .
“ Born , in the USA . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Beck continued like that , dryly reading Springsteen ’s words , almost as if he were imitating William Shatner .
“ Born in the USA ” is , of course , about a working class guy with a factory job who ends up in Vietnam , to “ kill the yellow man . ”
One of his friends dies in the war , leaving behind a baby in Saigon .
When he comes home he works hard for 10 years in the “ shadow of the penitentiary , ” but still has “ nowhere to run . ”
“ I ’m a cool rocking daddy in the USA , ” Springsteen wails .
“ Born in the USA . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Naturally , no summary could equate the emotion this tale conveys .
It is the quintessential American script , an experience millions of poor and working - class people can relate to .
“ That ’s what it ’s all about , ” Beck said .
“ That ’s what America ’s all about , according to Springsteen . …
It ’s time for us to wake , wake up , out of our , um , dreamstate .
Wake up out of the propaganda .
The , you know , this is the thing that , people who come from the Soviet - bloc or Cuba , they ’re all saying , ‘ How do you guys not hear this ?
How do you not see this ? ’
Well , that ’s ’ cause we do n’t ever expect it . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The likely reason Beck is attacking someone far more talented than himself is because Springsteen has endorsed a number of Democrats , including President Obama .
Springsteen even put on a show at the 2008 Democratic National Convention .
He did the same for Sen. John Kerry ( D - MA ) near the end of the 2004 presidential campaign .
Springsteen explained to Rolling Stone publisher Jann S. Wenner in an exclusive interview that he kept out of partisan politics for a long time because he wanted to remain “ credible ” and “ independent . ”
It was the Iraq war that brought Springsteen back into the political foray , as it did for many other Americans .
“ I knew after we invaded Iraq that I was going to be involved in the election , ” he said .
“ It made me angry .
We started to talk about it onstage .
I take my three minutes a night for what I call my public - service announcement .
We talked about it almost every night on our summer tour .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I felt we had been misled .
I felt they had been fundamentally dishonest and had frightened and manipulated the American people into war .
And as the saying goes , ‘ The first casualty of war is truth . ’
I felt that the Bush doctrine of pre-emption was dangerous foreign policy .
I do n’t think it has made America safer . ” [… ]
“ Sitting on the sidelines would be a betrayal of the ideas I ’d written about for a long time . ”
Springsteen added :
I did n’t grow up in a very political household .
The only politics I heard was from my mother .
I came home from grade school , where someone asked me if I was Republican or Democrat , and I asked my mom , “ Well , what are we ? ”
She said , “ We ’re Democrats , ’ cause Democrats are for the working people . ”
I was politicized by the Sixties , like most of the other people of that generation at that time .
I can remember doing a concert when I was probably in my very late teens , helping to bus people down to Washington for an anti-war demonstration .
But still , basically , I wanted to remain an independent voice for the audience that came to my shows .
We ’ve tried to build up a lot of credibility over the years , so that if we took a stand on something , people would receive it with an open mind .
Part of not being particularly partisan was just an effort to remain a very thoughtful voice in my fans ’ lives .
I always liked being involved actively more at a grass - roots level , to act as a partisan for a set of ideals : civil rights , economic justice , a sane foreign policy , democracy .
That was the position I felt comfortable coming from .
For his song “ Working On A Dream , ” Springsteen won “ Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance ” at the 2010 Grammy Awards .
He also recently appeared in The History Channel ’s documentary “ The People Speak “ , which is based on the late author and historian Howard Zinn ’s book , “ A People ’s History of the United States “ .
This audio was snipped from The Glenn Beck Program on March 11 , 2010 , by watchdog group Media Matters .
It is always amazing to watch birds in flight because they often behave as if they respond to unseen commands when they turn in unison .
Pigeons have been recently studied by Oxford University and EÃ¶tvÃ¶s University ( Hungary ) to see who is command in a given flock .
Pigeon flocks ( they concluded ) are guided by a flexible system of leadership in which almost every member gets a vote but the votes of high ranking birds seem to carry more weight .
Pigeons are a member of the bird family Columbidae ( doves and pigeons ) .
Pigeons are commonly seen in many major cities and have been raised as pets or used as carrier pigeons for their homing ability .
Scientists used GPS ( Global Positioning System ) backpacks to record the flight paths of individual pigeons and then analyzed their interactions with each other .
Their findings could help us understand the collective behavior of other animals , including humans
" We are all aware of the amazing aerobatics performed by flocks of birds but how such flocks decide where to go and whether decisions are made by a dominant leader or by the group as a whole has always been a mystery , " said Dr Dora Biro of Oxford Universityâ€™s Department of Zoology , an author of the paper .
" We found that , whilst most birds have a say in decision making , a flexible system of rank ensures that some birds are more likely to lead and others to follow . "
The miniature GPS loggers weighing just 16 grams were fitted into custom made backpacks carried by flocks of up to 10 homing pigeons .
These enabled scientists to explore spatial and temporal relationships between individual birds and the movement decisions they made at the scale of a fraction of a second .
The team measured shifts in the flight direction of each bird every 0.2 seconds and tried to line up these changes across different birds in the flock to determine who initiated any given change in direction and who followed ( and with what time delay ) .
The research revealed unexpectedly well defined hierarchies within the flocks , with a spectrum of different levels of leadership .
A hierarchy is the organization of individuals in a group often in response to a threat or competition / aggression .
Schjelderup - Ebbe , who studied the often cited example of the pecking order in chickens ( a dominance based hierarchy ) , found that such social structures lead to more stable flocks with reduced aggression among individuals .
Dominance hierarchies can be despotic or linear .
In a despotic hierarchy , only one individual is dominant , while the others are all equally submissive .
In a linear hierarchy , for example , in the above cited pecking order of chickens , each individual dominates all individuals below him and not those above him .
Dominance hierarchies occur in most social animal species , including primates who normally live in groups .
Dominance hierarchies have been extensively studied in fish , birds , and mammals .
Dominance hierarchies can be simple linear structures , which often arise from the physical differences among individuals in a group in relation to their access to resources .
They are also influenced by the complex social interactions among individuals in the group .
The type of hierarchy amongst pigeons is still to be determined .
The current study suggests that the pigeon hierarchy is flexible yet predictable .
Any given pigeon may be in a position to respond and lead the flock or lend a " vote " to the overall decision .
How such a leader is selected or a consensus is reached is not known .
The team also discovered that a birdâ€™s position in the flock matched its position in the hierarchy , with individuals nearer the front more likely to be responsible for decisions .
Additionally , they found that followers responded more quickly to those flying on their left , confirming observations in the laboratory that suggest birds process information predominantly through input that the brain receives from the left eye .
The researchers believe their findings could help unravel the decision making process in many other groups of animals .
Further studies may reveal how such a sophisticated leadership strategy confers evolutionary advantage on individuals over a strategy based on a single leader or one in which all members contribute equally to decision making .
A report of the research , entitled " Hierarchical group dynamics in pigeon flocks " , was published in Nature on April 8 .

When Sir James
Black passed away this week he left a vacancy in the Order of Merit - the so - called " most exclusive club in the world " .
But what is it and what makes it so special ?
Sir James
Black invented beta - blocker drugs , won a Nobel Prize and is widely hailed as one of the great Scottish scientists of the 20th Century .
But tucked away in his biography is a lesser - known accolade .
In 2000 , Sir James was given what 's often called " the UK's highest honour " - the Order of Merit ( OM ) .
The medal is compared to France 's Legion d'honneur and America 's Congressional Gold Medal , but with one big difference .
Most people in France and the US have heard of their country 's honour , while over here most people have no idea what the Order of Merit is .
This has a lot to do with the arithmetic , says Stanley Martin , a former diplomat who has written a book on the honour .
SOME CURRENT MEMBERS Lucian Freud , artist Sir Aaron Klug , chemist Sir Thomas Stoppard , playwright Baroness Betty Boothroyd , politician Lord ( Norman ) Foster , architect Sir Timothy Berners - Lee , inventor of the world wide web
At any point in time , there can only be a total of 24 members of the OM .
This has been the case since King Edward VII established it in 1902 to reward those whose accomplishments in the arts , sciences and learning may go unsung .
Also , the honour does not come with a title , so there 's no immediately obvious way of knowing someone has been bestowed with it .
Members are given a red and blue enamel badge , which reads " For Merit " .
When a member dies the badge is returned to the Queen , who receives the next - of - kin personally .
She also has a portrait painted of each member , which becomes part of the royal collection , and hosts a gathering for the entire Order every five years .
It 's thought the number of members is so small to keep it exclusive .
" That was the number deemed to be exclusive enough , " says a Buckingham Palace spokesperson .
' Personal gift '
Mr Martin says the ratio of knights and dames to OMs is 150 to one .
" Knights and dames are ten - a - penny , " he says .
" [ The Order of Merit ] is extremely exclusive .
They are the names of the 20th Century . "
People who have been awarded the honour include Florence Nightingale - who was the first woman - TS Eliot and Sir Winston Churchill .
There have been 11 honorary members from foreign countries , like Mother Teresa and Nelson Mandela .
Although nearly all prime ministers of the 20th Century have been knighted , only six of the 20 received the OM .
Lady
Thatcher is a member of the current group .
Although there is some attempt to keep a balance between different disciplines , royal experts say the OM is n't about meeting quotas .
Jean Chretien was the latest person to receive the Order of Merit in 2009 " It 's absolutely earned by the individual every time , " says Hugo Vickers , a royal biographer .
" There 's nothing automatic about it at all . "
Mr Martin says the Queen 's advisers believe it 's better to have multiple members who are outstanding in the same discipline , than to have mediocre members from varied fields .
What also makes the OM special is that it is a " personal gift of the sovereign " .
It is awarded without any ministerial input ; the decision rests squarely with the Queen .
Her personal secretary receives suggestions from people and current members of the OM , according to Mr Martin .
She then makes a decision .
" It 's an elite award , but nevertheless it 's been fairly meritocratic , " he says .
Intellectual ' appeal ' Sir Michael Atiyah , a mathematician and former president of the Royal Society , was awarded the OM in 1992 .
He recognises that members are not often well - known among the general public .
But for him the honour is about getting respect from his peers .
" It 's not like being a pop star , " he says .
" I 'm quite happy with modest fame and notoriety amongst people I respect . "
Mr Martin says the public 's ignorance of the OM may be because it does n't come with a title .
The majority of knights and dames are n't famous , but the title gives them an air of importance .
Rudyard Kipling did n't want the Order of Merit " Our society is so hidebound with our obsession with titles , " he says .
" For anything to be worth anything , it must have a title . "
But Mr Vickers points out that the OM is " more intellectual than a more worldly honour " .
Lucian Freud famously turned down a knighthood but accepted the OM .
" It appeals to intellectuals , those who do n't want to be ' Sir Somebody ' , " he says .
" It just means fantastic achievement at a very high and special level . "
Not everyone is of the same opinion .
There have been a few notable deferrers , including Rudyard Kipling , who turned it down twice .
Kipling believed it was n't right for him to take an honour from the state , says Mr Martin .
The death of Sir James leaves a vacancy , but who will be the next recipient is not yet known .

Oxford University is involved in a research project to unearth 30,000 year old climate records , before they are lost forever .
The rings of preserved kauri trees , hidden in New Zealand 's peat bogs , hold the secret to climate fluctuations spanning back to the end of the last Ice Age .
The team , led by Exeter University , has been awarded a grant from the Natural Environment Research Council to carry out carbon dating and other analyses of the kauri tree rings .
The trees store an immense amount of information about rapid and extreme climate change in the past .
For instance , wide ring widths are associated with cool dry summer conditions .
The scientists believe their findings will help us understand what future climate change may bring .
Tree rings are now known to be an excellent resource for extracting very precise and detailed data on atmospheric carbon from a particular time period .
Therefore this study could help plug a large gap in our knowledge of climate change by extending historical weather records that only date back to the mid-nineteenth century .
There is nowhere else in the world with such a rich resource of ancient wood that spans such a large period of time .
The ancient kauri logs are of enormous dimensions , up to several metres across , and have the potential to provide new detailed information about rapid , extreme and abrupt climate changes at a time when there was significant human migration throughout the globe .
While various records exist for historic climate change , such as those derived from ice cores , there is no easy way of correlating these records .
The research will focus on the last 30,000 years , but some trees date back 130,000 years .
The period towards the end of the last Ice Age is particularly difficult to understand .
This unique archive of kauri trees is likely to be lost within the next ten years because the timber is so highly - prized for furniture , arts and crafts .
Kauri ( Agathis australis ) are conifer trees buried in peat bogs across northern New Zealand .
Trees can measure up to four metres wide and live for up to 2,000 years .
As well as containing information on past climates , they could also shed light on environmental and archaeological change .
Samples from a network of sites with buried trees will be collected in New Zealand and taken back to the UK laboratories for preparation and analysis at Exeter and then radiocarbon measurement at Oxford .
Professor Christopher Ramsey , from the School of Archaeology at the University of Oxford , said : ' This gives us a unique opportunity to increase our knowledge of the earth 's climate and human responses to it at the end of the last Ice Age .
The radiocarbon measurements should give us important new data that will help us to understand interactions between the atmosphere and the oceans during this period when there was rapid and dynamic change .
Equally exciting is the prospect it will give us of more precise dating of archaeological sites from this period -- illuminating the only window we have onto how humans responded to these major changes in the environment . '
Lead researcher Professor Chris Turney of the University of Exeter said : ' We are facing a race against the clock to gather the information locked inside these preserved trees .
It is fantastic to have this funding so we are able to gather this information before it is lost forever .
While it will be fascinating to find out more about the earth 30,000 years ago perhaps more importantly we will have a better appreciation of the challenges of future climate change . '

After Eric Massa told the world about the time a naked Rahm Emanuel accosted him in the congressional locker rooms , we had to wonder : “ Is there naked deal - making that goes on in D.C. , or was that just a fantasy that Eric Massa concocted — which in his mind ended in a playful , ticklish snorkeling expedition ? ”
Initially , that seemed to be the case — but after sliding a few rungs down on the Beltway power ladder , the Washington Post managed to find a group of D.C. “ insiders ” who like to get naked and sweat together .
There is , apparently , a gang of mid-level lobbyists and bureaucrats who hang out in the big , scorching hot sauna at the Finnish Embassy .
( It ’s twice as hot as the one at the Swedish embassy ) .
From the Post :
Back scratching does feel good when you are nice and sweaty .
But the love fest that is these networking meetings sounds like it goes from fun and sexy , to , well , a little scary , pretty quickly :
This just sounds like the lead up to a porno we absolutely do not want to see .

With fifty completed 7DRLs this year , some people wonder how they will have time to play them all !
Fortunately , that is simple …
Just play one a week for the next year .
For those less dedicated , a team of evaluators was assembled to give all the roguelikes a once - over .
We graded the roguelikes under six categories using a simple three point scale .
We ensured every roguelike was graded by at least two reviewers , and aimed for most to have three reviewers .
After a long week of playing , we present our results !
Check them out here , at Roguetemple ’s 7DRL Shrine !

This list is not meant to be an authoritative ranking of the games .
If you dive in , you will see different reviewers often disagreed on the rankings .
Instead , it is a way for you to help select which 7DRLs are likely to have things of interest to you .
Specific comments were also written by reviewers .
Note that these are criticism for the developer to better improve the game – please do not be unduly offended if they are nitpicky or consist of “ I got killed by a ferret on the first screen ” .
The categories are , with description of what a 3 means :
Completeness :
Bug free , polished game with no features that feel like they are missing .
Aesthetics : Good looking , excellent controls and UI .
Fun :
If you try any 7DRLs , try this one .
Innovation : Brings something fundamentally new to roguelikes .
Scope : Beyond what you think could have been done in seven days .
Roguelike : 3 means Roguelike , 2 means Roguelike - like , 1 means Not Roguelike .

Der US - Rechnungshof hat sich in einem Bericht mit den Auswirkungen durch Produktpiraterie befasst .
Dies geschah , um ein bereits unter US - Präsident Bush verabschiedetes Gesetz zum Schutz des geistigen Eigentums ( PRO - IP Act ) auf eine solide Basis zu stellen .
Eine solche Grundlage konnte jedoch nicht gefunden werden .
Nicht nur in den USA sondern weltweit versucht sich die Musik - und Filmindustrie gegen den Schaden zu wehren , der ihr durch das illegale Herunterladen oder Tauschen von Kreativinhalten entsteht .
In den USA wurde zu diesem Zweck 2008 allerdings ein umstrittenes Gesetz auf den Weg gebracht – der PRO - IP Act .
Neben der Schaffung eines eigenen Amtes im Weißen Haus , dem Beauftragten für Urheberrechtsverletzungen , wurden auch die Strafen für Produktpiraterie angezogen .
Der Bericht des US - Rechnungshofes sollte eine Datenbasis für die Arbeit gemäß des PRO - IP Acts schaffen und Zahlen etwa zum Umfang und den Auswirkungen von Produktpiraterie erstellen .
Bis dahin galten vor allem jene Werte , welche die geschädigte Industrie selbst verkündete .
Für den US - amerikanischen
Raum bedeutete dies einen Verlust von 250 Milliarden US - Dollar sowie einen Jobabbau von 750.000 Stellen .
Dass diese Zahlen in dem Umfang nicht stimmen , wird der Industrie bereits seit Jahren vorgeworfen .
Es fehle insbesondere an Transparenz bezüglich der Berechnungsmethoden .
Auch stellt sich bei genauer Betrachtung schnell die Frage , wer Urheber dieser Daten ist und für welchen Zeitraum sie überhaupt gelten sollen .
Der US - Rechnungshof äußerte in seinem Bericht nun ganz offiziell Zweifel an diesen Zahlen .
Er fand in seiner Untersuchung keinerlei Datenbasis für eine korrekte Berechnung .
Das sei vor allem deshalb nicht möglich , weil die wirklichen Auswirkungen des Filesharings nur geschätzt werden können und hierbei vor allem zwei Probleme auftreten :
Weder über die Substitutionsrate der Downloader noch über den eigentlichen Wert der kopierten Inhalte herrsche Einigkeit .
Bei der Substitutionsrate handelt es sich um den Anteil an Produkten , die ein Produktpirat kaufen würde , wenn er nicht anderweitig an das Objekt seiner Begierde gelangen könnte .
Es dürfte hierbei klar sein , dass nicht jeder heruntergeladene Film auch gekauft würde , wenn man ihn nicht illegal über das Internet beziehen könnte .
Von welchem Anteil hier jedoch ausgegangen werden muss , lässt sich nicht bestimmen .
Zum
Wert des eigentlichen Produktes lässt sich auch mehr philosophieren als Tatsachen schaffen .
So lassen sich kopierte Güter nicht anhand einer Preistabelle abschätzen und ebenso wenig gegen ihre Originale aufrechnen .
Zum einen müsste stets eine qualitative Vergleichbarkeit bestehen , was bei kopierter Musik oder bei Filmen nicht immer der Fall ist , zum anderen lässt sich der Wert des originalen Gutes schon nicht eindeutig bestimmen .
Neben den Herstellungskosten könnten hierfür auch der anvisierte Verkaufspreis oder die Selbstkosten des Produkts in Frage kommen .
Diese Unbekannten müssten mit Annahmen gefüllt werden , die das Endergebnis stark beeinflussen .
Da es für derlei Annahmen jedoch keine sinnvollen Vorgaben gibt , können die Aussagen der Musik - und Filmindustrie nicht vom Rechnungshof gestützt werden .
Er erinnerte in dem Bericht zudem daran , dass es auch positive Effekte durch Produktpiraterie geben könne , die allerdings ebenso schwer abzuschätzen sind wie negative .
Gemeinhin werden positive Effekte im Vergleich zu negativen als unbedeutend gering bezeichnet , was aber nicht bestätigt werden könne , da es zu beiden keine verlässliche Datenbasis gebe und die negativen Effekte zumeist überschätzt würden .
Positive Effekte der Produktpiraterie können dabei eine stärkere Marke und damit erhöhte Merchandising - Verkäufe sein sowie ein Wachstum in anderen Wirtschaftsbereichen , etwa bei Herstellern von Speicherprodukten oder Anbietern von Infrastrukturlösungen für Internetverbindungen .
Obama breaks down in tears at funeral of ' Godmother ' of American civil rights movement Dorothy Height
Tears streaming down his cheeks , grief overcame Barack Obama today as he attended the funeral of the woman he called the ' Godmother ' of the American civil rights movement .
The U.S. president was weeping openly as he watched the service for Dorothy Height in Washington today .
He delivered the eulogy for Dr Height , whose activisim stretched from the New Deal right up until Mr Obama 's election as the first African American president of the United States .
Overcome : U.S. President Barack Obama wipes away tears during the funeral for the ' Godmother ' of the civil rights movement Dorothy Height in Washington today
Distraught :
The president was joined by his wife Michelle , and Vice President Joe Biden and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the service
Changing the course of history : Dr Dorothy Height , left , in one of her characteristically colourful outfits , with her comrade - at - arms Rosa Parks
Dr Height died last week at 98 after a long illness .
She was a pioneering voice of the civil rights movement who remained active and outspoken well into her 90s .
She often received rousing ovations at events around Washington , where she was easily recognisable in the bright , colourful hats she almost always wore .
Dr Height led the National Council of Negro Women for decades and marched with the Rev Martin Luther King Jr .
She was honoured by Mr Obama during the service at Washington National Cathedral for her leadership on the front lines fighting for equality , education and to ease racial tension .
Respect : Mr Obama watches as Dr Height 's coffin is carried into the cathedral
Here because of her : Mr Obama takes the podium to deliver the eulogy for Dr Height today
' She never cared about who got the credit , ' the president said .
' What she cared about was the cause .
The cause of justice , the cause of equality , the cause of opportunity , freedom 's cause . '
His 13 - minute tribute often drew gentle laughter as Obama remembered the doggedness and energy of Dr Height , who led the National Council of Negro Women for decades and marched with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , the head of the civil rights movement .
Dr Height in 1974 , and with President Ronald Regan during a reception at the White House in 1983
Height visited the Obama White House 21 times , the president said .
He noted that she was determined to attend a meeting of African American leaders on unemployment last winter despite an approaching blizzard and being confined to a wheelchair .
She would not allow ' just a bunch of men ' to control the meeting , Obama said .
Dr When Height 's attendance became impossible because cars could not reach her snow - choked driveway , he said , she still sent a message with her ideas .
Noting Dr Height 's trademark attire , Obama said , 'we loved those hats she wore like a crown .
Regal .'
He cited her role in desegregating the Young Women 's Christian Association and in leading the National Council of Negro Women with ' vision and energy , vision and class ' .
He said her name should be associated with great leaders such as King and W.E.B. DuBois , an early 20th century black nationalist .
Regal lady : Dr Height shares a joke with George W Bush before he presented her with the Congressional Gold Medal in Washington DC in 2004
' She too deserves a place in our history books , ' Obama said .
' She too deserves a place of honor in America 's memory . '
He urged Americans to honor Dr Height 's memory by serving their country and making it better .
She was a voice for women in the civil rights movement and beyond .
Leading women are expected to celebrate her life in return , including poet Maya Angelou , educator Camille Cosby , singers BeBe Winans and Denyce Graves , among others .
Dr Height was a quietly powerful figure in Washington , meeting with every president since Dwight D. Eisenhower .
Honoured : Then - President Bill Clinton applauds Dr Height after presenting her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994
Born in Richmond , Virginia , in 1912 before women could vote and when black people had few rights in America , Dr Height went on to earn bachelor 's and master 's degrees from New York University .
As a social worker in the 1930s , she worked to resolve riots in Harlem and marched in protest of lynching .
By 1957 , she became head of the organisation and created the National Black Family Reunion , attended by thousands since 1986 on the National Mall .
Lasting impact :
The view inside the cathedral today as Mr Obama took to the podium
She led the council to be the only historic black group with a home on Washington 's symbolic Pennsylvania Avenue between the Capitol and White House .
She stepped down in 1997 , but the building still bears her name .
Friends raised $ 5 million in 2002 to pay off the mortgage .
One of the things that is n't widely advertised in science is that progress often looks a bit like this video — things get done , but the results are rarely quite what you expect .
A recent example of this two steps forward , one step back progress may be the study of the recently observed excess positrons coming from the center of our galaxy .
Although there are many possible astrophysical explanations , none of them were that clean or appealing , leaving one alternative attractive : dark matter .
Dark matter is thought to be made up of weakly interacting massive particles , which every now and again collide and annihilate .
One particular pathway for the annihilation results in positrons with about the same energy of those seen coming from the core of the galaxy .
Hey , presto ! thought some scientists .
We may have seen dark matter decays , which then allow us to pin down dark matter .
Oh and incidentally , the medal should be pinned on my left — that 's your right — lapel .
But , as a recent Physical Review Paper shows , the excess may be real , but if it comes from dark matter , we have some serious cosmological problems on the horizon .
Let 's take a step back .
We know that dark matter exists from numerous lines of indirect and direct evidence .
These observations also tell us how dark matter is distributed within galaxies .
There are two key parameters here : the physical shape of the dark matter distribution and the density of dark matter .
We also know from dark matter 's apparent lack of visibility that it can't interact with regular matter very strongly , which allows physicists to piece together the basic physics of positron production .
The latter act was performed by the researchers who had observed excess positrons from the center of the galaxy .
They found that dark matter could only explain the excess if there was some kind of resonant enhancement of the decay .
Luckily , particle physics comes equipped with these resonances naturally , so you end up with a lovely if - then scenario .
If the positrons come from dark matter , then we know the resonant enhancement must be about so much , and therefore dark matter must have the following properties .
Very tempting conclusion .
Unfortunately , the original research did not consider whether the required enhancement would be in agreement with other data .
Now , a trio of researchers from University of California in Irvine have taken a look at this .
They observed that the shape of the distribution of dark matter in the galaxy NGC 720 was elliptical , but that increasingly stronger resonant enhancement resulted in nearly spherical dark matter distributions .
In the end , the shape of the distribution could not be reconciled with the idea that the excess positrons came from dark matter annihilations , resonantly enhanced or not .
The other key factor is the density of dark matter .
Here , the researchers found something a little more interesting .
First , the density does allow for dark matter annihilations , but with only a very small resonant enhancement .
More interesting is the fact that resonant dark matter annihilations predict different dark matter densities than those obtained from astronomical models , meaning that we can look for galaxies that do n't fit the models to see whether they might be accounted for by dark matter annihilations .
This will then allow us to place even tighter bounds on the nature of dark matter .
So , if I had been an author on one of the original papers , I might be feeling a bit bruised right now .
However , the result was good for the field — this research offers a new direction from which to approach the dark matter problem .
We can now turn our attention back to the universe , and see if she happens to have another crumb or two of information for us .

On Friday , we wrote about the changes Apple is making to the terms and conditions that it requires from iPhone , iPod Touch , and iPad developers before they can write software for these platforms .
The new terms include a clause that prohibits a wide range of third - party toolkits and frameworks that offer developers benefits such as quicker , more robust application development and instant access to complex functionality like 3D game engines .
We believe the targets of this change to be , in particular , Adobe and Google 's Android .
Adobe is imminently releasing a new version of Flash that will , among other things , be able to produce iPhone applications .
The new terms prohibit the use of such tools .
Android is hurt because many of these frameworks facilitate cross-platform software development .
As the smaller platform , Android benefits from the use of toolkits that allow developers to target the iPhone and then rapidly , and at low cost , migrate to Android .
Over the weekend , it appears that Steve Jobs weighed in on the issue .
Jobs referenced John Gruber 's rationale for the changes .
He then , if the e-mails are authentic , clarified Apple 's position , claiming that intermediate layers between developers and the platform have two results : they result in " sub - standard apps " and they hinder the " progress of the platform . "
Let 's take a look at each claim .
Standards
The first argument remains unconvincing to us for empirical reasons ; just look at the App store !
There are many excellent applications for iPhone that use the now - restricted frameworks ( for example , the enjoyable and well - received games Colorbind , Battle Bears : Zombies , and Zombieville USA all use the Unity3D framework ) , while many sub - standard ones that do not ( see : every fart application , ever ) .
The use of frameworks is orthogonal to quality .
In fact , some of the very applications that Jobs demonstrated at the Apple event appear to use techniques that are now forbidden — Tap Tap Revenge makes use of Lua scripting , for instance .
One thing shown off during this demonstration was how the game interacted with iPhone OS 4's multitasking support ; this has significance because some commentators have speculated that the framework ban is somehow due to an inability of programs using these toolkits to support multitasking .
Clearly , that is not the case .
If an application is good enough for Apple to highlight on - stage , it seems disingenuous to suggest that the app is sub-standard .
If high - quality applications are what Apple is after , then that is what Apple should insist on ; native code is no promise of quality .
Quality
The second claim might initially seem more sound .
It 's true that typical frameworks do not provide access to every single feature of the underlying operating system .
This may not be universally true ( I believe that MonoTouch , allowing C# development on the iPhone , offers extremely broad support for iPhone OS's APIs ) , but it 's a common enough occurrence .
As such , it 's certainly the case that users of a particular framework might be cut off from some new platform feature that native coders would have access to , and that framework users are therefore restricted to a particular subset of the platform 's capabilities .
This in turn has the potential to damage uptake of new features .
But this claim also feels unconvincing when considered in more detail .
Developers generally make their choice of framework with their eyes open .
Developers already balance ease - of - use , time - to - market , and similar concerns against the level of access to the full operating system , and the result of this evaluation might lead to picking a toolkit that prevents access to certain platform features .
So what ?
This is nothing new .
i Phone OS provides a huge range of APIs ( a range that grows larger with each new release ) , and developers already make decisions about which APIs to use and which to ignore .
No program uses every single API , nor should it .
The damage done to the platform by having , say , a games toolkit that cannot access the new iPhone OS 4 calendar API is negligible ; developers writing games will almost certainly ignore the calendar API anyway .
Making those same developers use native code just makes their job that much harder .
On its own , it does little to ensure greater use of platform features .
Further , if Apple adds new , useful APIs that a broad set of developers wish to use , the developers of third - party toolkits and frameworks will surely respond to this demand by extending their frameworks to provide this access .
If this does n't happen , and a new API is left inaccessible , then perhaps it is not so much a flaw of the use of such toolkits , but rather an indication that the new capabilities are of minority interest .
This argument can also work in the other direction .
The developers of the toolkits might very well have specialized expertise — expertise that users of the toolkit lack .
Consider , for example , the Unity3D framework .
The people writing Unity3D understand 3D graphics , physics engines , and so on , and it 's quite plausible that they understand these things better than many users of their framework .
As such , the Unity3D developers are in a position to expertly evaluate — and integrate — new features that Apple has added , such as the new hardware - accelerated mathematical operations .
If left up to the individual game developers , however , this integration might not happen due to lack of expertise and resources .
This is not far - fetched ; the use of this kind of framework is endemic in the world of console gaming .
It enables game developers ( whose expertise is typically creating compelling games rather than , say , maximizing performance of the PlayStation 3's Cell processor ) to make better games that wring out more of the performance and capabilities of the underlying platform than would be the case if they had to start from scratch .
As such , well - written frameworks , far from reducing the level of uptake of platform features , can actually increase it .
There may also be a concern that if developers do want to use features that are not offered in their toolkits then they face a large task ahead : porting to native code ( or perhaps to some other toolkit ) just to escape the confines of the toolkit they are using , and so Apple wants to avoid this kind of lock - in ( instead locking them in to Objective - C , of course ) .
Lessons from history
Such a problem has concerned Apple in the past , when many developers used Metrowerks '
PowerPlant development environment to write " Classic " Mac OS software .
When Apple subsequently introduced the CarbonLib transition framework to aid in porting to Mac OS X , these developers were then trapped , facing substantial costs to migrate their code .
This is certainly something that developers need to be aware of , but native code is no panacea in this regard .
The provisioning of new platform APIs still requires developers to learn these APIs and then integrate them into their pre-existing programs , and this integration can have substantial consequences .
Programs might have to be radically restructured or rewritten to make use of new platform features ( for example , breaking down complex tasks into individual pieces so that they can be used with Grand Central Dispatch , or transforming their data structures to be used with SIMD ) , and the inertia of these existing codebases is itself an impediment to the progress of the platform .
It 's also a little peculiar to imply that these porting costs only exist when third - party frameworks are used .
Apple is in the process of killing off the Carbon library on Mac OS X ( no new features are being added to Carbon , and its 64 - bit version was killed off unexpectedly , even though it was substantially complete ) , forcing developers to suffer an expensive migration to Cocoa .
Developers had to undergo an expensive and lengthy porting operation in spite of using a first - party , native API .
Any time you have a legacy codebase , you are at risk of developers avoiding new features because they require too much development effort to add .
Third - party frameworks do not create this problem ; they are merely victims of it , just as native programs are .
The new 3.3.1 terms tie developers ' hands , yet do nothing to ensure that applications are high quality or that platform features are exploited by software developers .
In our view , the targets remain Adobe and Android , and everyone — except perhaps Apple — still loses .

“ During the course of my three tours , the rules of engagement changed a lot , ” Washburn ’s testimony continued , “ The higher the threat the more viciously we were permitted and expected to respond .
Something else we were encouraged to do , almost with a wink and nudge , was to carry ‘ drop weapons ’ , or by my third tour , ‘ drop shovels ’ .
We would carry these weapons or shovels with us because if we accidentally shot a civilian , we could just toss the weapon on the body , and make them look like an insurgent . ”
Hart Viges , a member of the 82nd Airborne Division of the Army who served one year in Iraq , told of taking orders over the radio .

Fire on all taxicabs ? ’
The lieutenant colonel responded , ‘ You heard me , trooper , ﬁre on all taxicabs . ’
After that , the town lit up , with all the units ﬁring on cars .
This was my ﬁrst experience with war , and that kind of set the tone for the rest of the deployment . ”
Vincent Emanuele , a Marine rifleman who spent a year in the al - Qaim area of Iraq near the Syrian border , told of emptying magazines of bullets into the city without identifying targets , running over corpses with Humvees and stopping to take “ trophy ” photos of bodies .
Rob Ford wants subways , not streetcars Mayoral candidate Rob Ford says he would scrap the Transit City light rail plan in the absence of full funding from the province , and try to build subways instead .
Mr. Ford has always been against streetcars , and he said a vote for him would be a vote against expanding that mode of transit .
" People want subways , " he said today .
While he has n't developed a subway roll out plan , Mr. Ford said he would look at selling the air rights on top of stations to pay for tunneling underground .
Mayoral candidate Sarah Thomson was the first to call for subways and would institute a $ 5 rush hour toll on the Gardiner and the DVP to pay for it .
" Unless the federal government comes to the table , our only option is the private sector , " said Mr. Ford .
Light rail proponents in Toronto have said that ridership does n't warrant subways , and they cost significantly more .
At a meeting earlier this year about the Eglinton LRT — which included many in the audience clamoring for subways — Transit City staff said the projected ridership along the midtown thoroughfare is about half of the peak 10,000 passengers per hour that a subway demands .
Staff also said a subway costs about $ 250 to $ 300 - million per kilometre , and on average it costs about $ 50 - million per kilometre for light rail .
The provincial government had committed over $ 9 - billion in funding for a slate of new routes , but recently decided to delay a chunk of funding .
" If we get money , I 'll take anything I can , " said Mr. Ford .
" As of now there 's no sense in planning for it , if you do n't have the money . "
He mentioned Sheppard and the Eglinton line as two possible subway candidates .
" I know there is a push to finish the Sheppard subway , " he said .
" We could look at doing Eglinton ... whatever the people want .
This is all after public consultation , the whole nine yards . "

A class action lawsuit has been filed against Sony Computer Entertainment America for the removal of the ' Other OS ' feature from the PlayStation 3 .
In March , Sony released firmware v3.21 that disabled the feature , disallowing users from installing the Linux operating system .
The update was not mandatory ; however those who chose not to download it were cut off from a number of other features , one of which included signing in to PlayStation Network .
The suit , filed on April 27 by Anthony Ventura of California , seeks to redress Sony for the " intentional disablement of the valuable functionality originally advertised as available " for the Playstation 3 .
The disabling of Linux support is not only in breach of the sales contract between Sony and its customers , the suit says , but also a deceptive business practice " perpetrated on millions of unsuspecting customers .
" Sony publicly stated the removal of the feature was for security reasons , however , the lawsuit says the company was more concerned with potential piracy .
"
On information and belief , contrary to Sony 's statement , the ' security concerns ' did not involve a threat to PS3 users , but rather reflected Sony 's concerns that the Other OS feature might be used by ' hackers ' to copy and / or steal gaming and other content .
"
The suit also alleges Sony violated California 's Unfair Competition Law by restricting the PS3's functionalities by " forcing consumers to choose between the Other OS function and the Other Advertised Features impaired by Update 3.21 " The suit states those who purchased a PlayStation 3 had " no ability to negotiate the System Software License Agreement 's terms which was only provided to them after they purchased their PS3s , including the terms allowing Sony to remove functions at will , allowing it unilaterally change the System Software License Agreement at will and forcing consumers to either accept any changes in the System Software License Agreement or cease their use of their PS3 .
" This class action lawsuit is brought on behalf of a nationwide class of all persons who purchased a PS3 during the period of November 17 , 2006 to March 27 , 2010 and who did not resell their PS3 before March 27 , 2010 .
The suit seeks , among other things , compensatory damages , and injunction relief .
No specific sum was listed , however the suit says " the amount in controversy is in excess of $ 5 million .
" IGN has contacted Sony for comment .
We 'll update this story when we hear more . :
Sony said it does not comment on pending litigation .

CAN YOU TASTE IT : Until now , it was thought the tongue could detect only five tastes – sweet , salty , sour , bitter and umami , sometimes called savoury ( a taste for identifying protein - rich foods ) - but the tongue can also detect fat .
A Kiwi scientist has helped discover the " sixth sense " of the human tongue and it may unlock the secret to keeping you slim .
Until now , it was thought the tongue could detect only five tastes – sweet , salty , sour , bitter and umami , sometimes called savoury ( a taste for identifying protein - rich foods ) .
But new research led by Deakin University in Australia , in conjunction with Massey University , has discovered the tongue can also detect fat .
Experts believe this discovery could help in developing foods that trick the body into thinking it has consumed enough fat .
Massey University Associate Professor Matt Golding , who was part of the research team , said people 's taste threshold for fat varied from person to person .
Some had a high sensitivity to the taste while others did not – and those who did tended to eat less fatty food and be slimmer .
" The high fat - tasting population appeared to have a lower BMI [ body mass index ] than those who had a poor ability to taste fat , " he said .
Researchers tested 33 people 's ability to taste a range of fatty acids , by first inserting small doses into milk and then custard , Professor Golding said .
" There was no difference in texture between the samples and yet we found a number of people were able to quite clearly detect the presence of `something else ' within the samples . "
The research could lead to the development of solutions for tackling obesity by promoting the taste of fat in foods , he said .
" But I do n't think there is such a thing as a silver bullet ... clearly a lot more work would need to be done in this area to see those effects . "
The results are published in the British Journal of Nutrition .
Meanwhile , Massey University is set to benefit from $ 21 million the Government will spend to establish a network of food development facilities .
The Food Innovation Network New Zealand will have hubs in Palmerston North , Manukau , Waikato and Canterbury and will provide support for firms to develop food and beverage ingredients and consumer products .
APRIL 1-- Meet George Jolicoeur .
The 600 - pound Florida man copped yesterday to criminal charges of stealing food from restaurants and convenience stores .
The bedridden Jolicoeur was not in a Seminole County courtroom when his lawyer entered a no contest plea on the 38 - year - old 's behalf to five misdemeanor petty theft counts .
The plea deal spared the 5 ' 11 ' Jolicoeur -- who breathes with the aid of a respirator - - a jail term , though he was ordered to pay court costs and restitution .
According to investigators , Jolicoeur would con businesses out of food or refunds by claiming that his grub was spoiled , adulterated , or inedible ( Jolicoeur 's ruse dates back several years and resulted in a prior no contest plea to theft charges ) .
A Seminole County Sheriff 's Officer report details an August 2007 incident in which Jolicoeur attempted a refund scam at a 7 - Eleven .
Jolicoeur , described as having ' labored breathing , similar to wheezing , ' claimed to have purchased $ 50 worth of beef jerky that turned out to be moldy .
When Seminole cop Jeff Sabounji went to Jolicoeur 's home to arrest him , the officer reported hearing ' what sounded like a male trying to cover his voice as a female .
The person said that Jolicoeur was not here . '
At that point , Sabounji noted , ' I could hear a female inside of the residence stating , ' George , just turn yourself in . ''
As he was later being transported to jail , Jolicoeur explained to Sabounji , ' the beef jerky got me . '
Jolicoeur was busted again two months later for swindling $ 50 from a different 7 - Eleven store .
Masquerading as a fireman , Jolicoeur pretended to have been sold 10 ' damaged ' containers of Breyers ice cream , according to an Oviedo Police Department report .
Not surprisingly , he claimed to have purchased 10 gallons of the frozen confection .

Windows XP users will not be able to run the final version of , according to Microsoft executives , cutting out a decade - old , yet still popular operating system .
In fact , the , as well as the final version , wo n't run on anything but the latest Microsoft operating systems .
Users trying to run the preview code on an XP system will receive the following dialogue box : " Windows Internet Explorer Platform Preview does not support any operating system earlier than Windows Vista SP2 . "
And of course , do n't even think about versions for non-Windows operating systems .
IE General Manager that Mac and Linux versions were n't currently in the company 's plans .
The reason IE9 does n't work in XP is that it uses the Direct2D feature of DirectX when .
Direct2D was introduced in Windows 7 , but then added to Windows Vista SP2 and Windows Server 2008 R2 .
But not to WIndows XP .
When I asked the IE9 team about their plans for the legacy OS , they confirmed that XP was not in the cards :
" Windows XP users have a fast , safe , reliable and private browser in Internet Explorer 8 , " company representatives said in an emailed statement .
" As the Web has continued to change in everything from security to the future HTML5 applications developers are starting to build today , browsers should require the modern graphics and security infrastructure that has come along since 2001 .
Internet Explorer 9 requires the modern graphics and security underpinnings that have come since 2001 , and is intended to be run on a modern operating system in order to build on the latest hardware and operating system innovations . "
It only makes sense the the OS vendor wants to give people as many reasons to upgrade their PCs to Wnidows 7 as possible , and not spend developer man-hours updating software that debuted nine years ago .
Still , this probably wo n't make XP loyalists smile .
They may even jump ship to fast browsers that do run on their platform  like Chrome , Opera , and Safari .
Today , mothers who 've invested a college education 's worth of spa and beauty treatments on their kids — ages 9 and under — appeared on Tyra .
What 's even more ridiculous is that the angle of the show was all , " Is n't this cute ? "
While the first half of the episode was a sort of celebration at this weird and frankly , needless , spending ( what the hell kind of normal 8 - year - old needs weekly massages ? ) ,
Tyra did try to bring some " seriousness " to the stage later in the show by having a debate between these parents and " normal " parents who do n't spend five or six figures on child beauty care .
However , instead of anyone mentioning that perhaps such a strong focus on image could potentially fuck a kid up , the debate was more about spoiling a child with something that should just be an occasional treat .
Do n't get me wrong , I 've loved makeup and nail polish since before I could read , and I 'm not against the idea of children wanting to play around with it .
Instead , it 's the idea of aesthetic perfection — of which the mother in this clip claims she instills in her children — that could lead to a lot of problems later on in life .

Pillar at Sunset
Image Credit & Copyright : David Alquist
Explanation : Reddened light from the setting Sun illuminates the cloud banks hugging this snowy , rugged terrain .
Inspiring a moment of quiet contemplation , the sunset scene included a remarkable pillar of light that seemed to connect the clouds in the sky with the mountains below .
Known as a Sun pillar , the luminous column was produced by sunlight reflecting from flat , six - sided ice crystals formed high in the cold atmosphere and fluttering toward the ground .
Last Monday , astronomers watched this Sun pillar slowly fade , as the twilight deepened and clearing , dark skies came to Mt. Jelm and the Wyoming Infrared Observatory .
Back in December 2009 , we reported on President Barack Obama 's efforts to increase funding for the Office on Violence Against Women .
Part of the Justice Department , the bureau is tasked with implementing the Violence Against Women
Act by steering financial and technical assistance to communities that are developing programs to help women who have been victims of violence .
At the time , we rated the promise In the Works , since Obama had not yet signed the 2010 budget , which would increase the level of funding -- or so we thought .
It turns out that in the midst of the holiday season , we fell a little behind the schedule .
On December 16 , 2009 , a day before we posted our rating , Obama signed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2010 , which provided funding to various departments , including the Justice Department .
Congress gave OVAW $ 418.5 million , $ 29.5 million more than in 2009 .
Of specific focus were the STOP ( Services , Training , Officers , and Prosecutors ) program , the sexual assault victims services , and civil legal assistance programs for abused women , which received $ 210 million , $ 15 million and $ 41 million , respectively .
By this point , the Obama administration has released its 2011 budget request , so we thought we'd take a look .
According to the Office of Management and Budget , the 2011 budget " includes $ 538 million , an increase of $ 120 million , to support women victims of violence , including domestic abuse and sexual assault victims . "
Obama increased funding for the Violence Against Women Act in his 2010 budget and asked for further increases in 2011 .

Taiwan ’s Dragon Stadium Turns Sunshine into Power
Dragons show up everywhere in traditional Chinese culture .
There are dragon robes and dragon boats ; fengshui practitioners tell of dragons that nestle in the earth and influence the flow of energy .
The Mandarin term for “ lobster ” is longxia ( “ dragon shrimp ” ) , while “ dinosaur ” translates as konglong , “ fearsome dragon . ”
There ’s nothing old - fashioned about the Chinese world ’s latest dragon , though .
Dramatic , beautiful , and innovative , this new dragon - shaped sports stadium in the southern Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung is the largest in Asia to be powered solely by sunlight .
When it comes to solar power projects , Kaohsiung is an excellent location .
The city receives an average of 5.6 hours of sunlight per day , which means that the 8,844 solar panels can not only light up the 50,000 - seat structure during sporting events , but their power can be channeled to the surrounding area when the stadium ’s unoccupied .
Electrical power is not the structure ’s only “ green ” feature .
Japanese architect Toyo Ito also incorporated permeable pavement , recycled materials , and strategic alignment to take advantage of wind and shade .
Fengshui principles came into play too , to help ensure that this gigantic dragon would function in beneficial ways .
Not surprisingly , such a beast is costly to feed .
The stadium ’s pioneering features called for more than the usual amount of testing and research , resulting in a price tag of $ 150 million .
Once it starts generating power , however , this imposing new dragon will begin earning that money back — and all without moving a muscle .

“ We sent ten Boeing 747 and Airbus 340 jets on transfer flights from Munich to Frankfurt , ” Lufthansa spokesman Klaus Walther told the paper .
The planes were moved in order to be in the most useful place once the ban is lifted , he explained .
“ Our machines flew to a height of 24,000 feet , or around 8,000 metres .
In Frankfurt the machines were examined by our technicians .
They did n’t find the slightest scratch on the cockpit windscreens , on the outer skin nor in the engines . ”
“ The flight ban , which is completely based on computer calculations , is causing economic damage in the billions .
This is why , for the future , we demand that dependable measurements must be available before a flight ban is imposed . ”

At left : the model from the Met Office used to look at dispersion .
The Nuclear Accident Model ( NAME ) was originally developed after the nuclear accident in 1986 at Chernobyl , which highlighted the need for a capability to predict the spread and deposition of radioactive material released into the atmosphere .
The model has continued to be developed and is now applied to a wide range of atmospheric pollution problems , ranging from emergency responses to daily air - quality forecasts .
Over the years , NAME has been applied to a number of atmospheric releases , including radioactive releases , the Kuwaiti oil fires , major industrial fires and chemical spills , and two major volcanic eruptions that occurred in Iceland .
Both of these eruptions resulted in aircraft having to be re-routed to avoid potentially dangerous ash clouds .
An example of the volcanic ash guidance provided to the aviation community is shown in Figure 1 .

Here is what Professor Jerom Ravetz of Oxford has to say about the issue ( via email ) :
Interim contribution to the Post - Normal Science debate .
Considering the effects of the Icelandic volcano on air transport , we seem to have :
Facts Uncertain : how thin must the dust be , for it to be safe enough for flying ?
Values in Dispute : Regulators wanting safety at all costs , others needing to get flying now .
Stakes High : Crippling costs to industry , versus big risks to aircraft and people .
Decisions Urgent : Every day the immediate costs mount , and the long - term costs grow .
Is this analysis an invitation to scientists to cheat ?
Some of my critics would say so , and perhaps even some of my supporters as well !

Like Obama , he ’s got “ a big target ” on his back , he says .
Like Obama , other Democratic candidates are “ hanging their hats ” on his re-election , and on the minority voters he draws to the polls .
It ’s why he feels an intense responsibility to take his November re-election campaign to the next level — using his national popularity and statewide connections to hang tight to a local seat Republicans would love to seize .
“ I may be criticized for this , but there ’s a political process , and I ’m going to be a part of it , ” Watkins says without apology , crossing his trademark cowboy boots — the pair mentioned on late - night political comedian Stephen Colbert ’s show — in front of him .
“ I wo n’t stop dispensing justice .
But I ’ve got to fight the political attacks coming at me from all directions .
I ’ll say it publicly :
If you throw punches at us , we ’ll drop a bomb on you . ”
Watkins has good reason to play defense .
While his national reputation remains largely intact , he ’s battling intense criticism at home : about his campaign spending , an alleged conflict of interest and suspicions that he has intentionally stalled what some call an in - the - bag corruption investigation .
He ’s been skewered in The Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Observer for taking no public steps to prosecute two Democratic Dallas County constables facing accusations of bribery and kickbacks from their colleagues , and for seeking a restraining order when Republican county commissioners hired their own investigator to look into the charges .
( His Republican opponents say he 's protecting the constables , who are fellow Democrats . )
His latest power play ?
Watkins shunned two separate offers from the Texas attorney general to help investigate the constables .
“ If the Dallas DA is vulnerable in November , it ’s mainly because he ’s mishandled this fiasco surrounding the constables so badly , ” says Scott Henson , the former policy director of the Innocence Project of Texas who writes the criminal justice blog Grits for Breakfast .
“ Everyone investigating this case knows it ’s not credible to believe he ’s performing a diligent investigation . ”
Watkins has also made headlines over his campaign finance spending habits — paying tens of thousands of dollars to family members or the businesses they operate .
And he ’s caught heat for an alleged conflict of interest :
His wife ’s political consulting firm represents judges who preside over the same county courts where his office prosecutes cases .
Watkins counters that ethics rules do n’t prohibit hiring family members or using family businesses to run campaigns ( in fact , it ’s a common occurrence ) .
And his wife ’s political consulting business has checked out all the way up to the State Commission on Judicial Conduct .
He staunchly refutes the toughest allegation against him — that he was using campaign funds to pay the utility bills for the family businesses that share his campaign office space .
“ I have only ever paid my share , ” he says .
Watkins wo n’t confirm or deny whether he ’s investigating the constables ; it would n’t be appropriate , he says .
But he notes that he has just two prosecutors in his public integrity unit , both of whom have other cases on their plate .
If they happened to be working on the constable case , hypothetically speaking , he says he would n’t expect them to be done yet .
“ Look at the Dallas City Hall corruption investigation .
That took years , ” he says .
“ There ’s no timetable — we do n’t rush an investigation . ”
In the meantime , he says , he ’s the only one with legal authority to prosecute the case — and he wants everyone else to stay out of it .
He accuses the Republican county commissioners of using the allegations against the Democratic constables to unfairly discredit him before an election .
And he says there ’s no way he could trust their handpicked investigator anyway ( “ He ’s a hired gun , hired to get a certain result ” ) .
Watkins sees Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott ’s repeated offers of assistance as " encroaching " on his territory .
“ What I want the citizens to know is that I ’m not dragging my feet , and I would never do that in any case , ” Watkins says , noting that he has charged one of the constables ' deputies with numerous felonies as part of a criminal investigation .
“ It ’s politically beneficial for them to say the Dallas DA is not doing this quick enough . ”
Dallas County Republican Party Chairman Jonathan Neerman says he does n’t question Watkins ’ ethics — but he does question his judgment .
While Watkins still rides high on the national profile his innocence work provides , Neerman says he thinks perceptions locally , at a minimum , have started to change .
“ In the past two years , there have been a lot of very troubling incidents involving him , so many silly things that , taken together , blemish what the national perception is of him , ” he says .
Democratic political strategist Matt Angle chalks up the attacks against Watkins to nasty campaign politics — a sign Republicans are threatened by the DA 's “ unlimited potential . ”
Watkins has proven an exceptional public servant , cleaning up a troubled DA ’s office , Angle says .
Now , he must defend himself against GOP party operatives who would love nothing more than to unseat him .
“ He ’s certainly moved to another level with this campaign , building a more sophisticated political operation , and I think Republicans can take some credit for that , ” Angle says .
“ There ’s nothing more threatening to Republicans in Dallas or statewide than an African - American politician who does his job well . ”
At least publicly , Watkins does n’t see the constable debacle or the campaign finance questions as political liabilities .
But as he faces an election challenge from Republican Danny Clancy — a former Dallas county criminal court judge and assistant prosecutor — he wants to remind voters that he ’s been as effective in locking up the guilty as exonerating the innocent .
While he ’s been given celebrity status on CNN , 60 Minutes and The View for freeing people , he has also fast - tracked prosecutions for career offenders , expanded the sexual assault conviction unit , located more high - risk absconders and started using forensic evidence to track stolen or burglarized vehicles , Watkins says .
His office has maintained a 99 percent conviction rate on cases it prosecutes , he says .
“ They call me a liberal DA , ” Watkins says , “ but this is all about the victims . ”
Meanwhile , he appears to be studying the playbook for a statewide run .
He ’s got a slick campaign website , and has taken to referring to his re-election bid as “ an art , a business . ”
He says he ’s moving past the grassroots campaign , the “ family members sitting around a table , ” to “ a more strategic game . ”
This time , he says , he ’ll have the resources to do it — he ’s aiming to raise $ 1 million or more for the November election .
Watkins appears to be off to a fast start , scheduling high - profile fundraisers in New England and Washington , D.C. , and hobnobbing with statewide movers and shakers in Austin .
“ I know I ’m not the be - all - end - all , but it ’s not just about me anymore , ” Watkins says .
“ I have to hold onto the seat I ’m in so that all of those [ candidates ] holding on to me are successful , too . ”
After a protest in East Harlem , baseball cap manufacturer New Era has agreed to pull Yankees caps from store shelves .
A number of caps seem to refer to the Bloods , Crips and Latin Kings and became a controversy during a back - to - school shopping trip .
Jose Rivera liked a Yankees cap with a gold crown on it and wanted to buy it for his son , but his son explained that he could be in danger for wearing it .
Rivera told NY1 , " It was [ my son ] who said this crown might be construed as something possibly associated with a gang .
I said ‘ what kind of a gang ? ’
He said maybe the Latin Kings .
I said ‘ why ?
It ’s just a New York Yankee hat . ’
It ’s quite nice .
I liked it and the crown to me said ‘ you 're the king ! ’
That ’s great . "
If you watch the video from NY1 , you 'll also see Rivera 's son explaining how the red bandanna cap stands for the Bloods while the blue one is for the Crips .
And the NY Times reports that Rivera also asked many kids what the caps meant , " From 8 years old and up , they knew they represented violent gangs . "
New Era , a Buffalo based company , released a statement saying :
In response to the situation in New York City regarding our caps , New Era Cap offers the following statement .
It is our mission at New Era to create , design and market headwear that follows fashion trends around the world .
Recently , it has been brought to our attention that some combinations of icons and colors on a select number of our caps could be too closely perceived to be in association with gangs .
In response , we , along with Major League Baseball ( MLB ) have pulled those caps .
In addition , as part of our ongoing effort to ensure that there is no possibility that our products are seen as promoting gangs or gang related activity , we are working closely with MLB and continuing our internal efforts with local gang suppression units to set - up training sessions to better understand gang symbols , names and locations .
A good move , but really , it seems pretty clear that the caps were referring to gangs .
New Era has a license with the MLB .
Maybe we 're classicists , but it 's sort of weird seeing caps in different colors with the Yankees logos - why not stick to the tried and true team colors ?

Recently : Doug Casey : Making Terrorism YourFriend
L : Doug , you keep saying you ’re an anarchist .
I suspect most of our readers know that does n’t mean you like to wear black army boots and throw Molotov cocktails at McDonald ’s restaurants during WTO protests , but I ’m not sure how many really know what it is you do mean .
And since this is central to your world - view and hence touches on all your thinking as an investor and speculator , it seems useful to clear the air .
Few may agree with us on this topic , but let ’s talk about anarchy .
Doug : Sure .
If people are n’t open - minded enough to even consider an alternative view , they ’re their own worst problem , not my ideas .
In point of fact , anarchism is the gentlest of all political systems .
It contemplates no institutionalized coercion .
It ’s the watercourse way , where everything is allowed to rise or fall naturally to its own level .
An anarchic system is necessarily one of free - market capitalism .
Any services that are needed and wanted by people — like the police or the courts — would be provided by entrepreneurs , who ’d do it for a profit .
Look , I ’d be happy enough if the state — which is an instrument of pure coercion , even after you tart it up with the trappings of democracy , a constitution , and what - not — were limited to protecting you from coercion and absolutely nothing more .
That would imply a police force to protect you from coercion within its bailiwick .
A court system to allow you to adjudicate disputes without resorting to force .
And some type of military to protect you from outside predators .
Unfortunately , the government today does everything but these functions — and when it does deign to protect , it does so very poorly .
The police are increasingly ineffective at protecting you ; they seem to specialize in enforcing arbitrary laws .
The courts ?
They apply arbitrary laws , and you need to be wealthy to use them — although you ’re likely to be impoverished by the time you get out of them .
And the military hardly defends the country anymore — it ’s all over the world creating enemies , generally , of the most backward foreigners .
In a free - market anarchy , the police would likely be subsidiaries of insurance companies , and courts would have to compete with each other based on the speed , fairness , and low cost of their decisions .
The military presents a more complex problem , beyond our range here , although we ’ve gone into a lot of aspects in our discussion on terror last week and the military a couple months back .
L : That ’s a lot for most mainstream folks to swallow at once , Boss .
On the other hand , the way I see it , it would be inconsistent with my libertarian principles to demand that anyone agree with me — but I do n’t need to be helping those who would enslave me to make money anyway .
That said , let ’s try to ease into this …
Doug :
So , let ’s start with a definition .
Many people think of anarchy as being chaos .
They see riots and chaos on TV from some place in conflict and think , “ What anarchy ! ”
L : That ’s if the talking heads do n’t tell them that what they are seeing is anarchy to begin with .
Doug : Right .
But chaos and bomb throwing are not anarchy .
Chaos is the actual opposite of anarchy .
Anarchy is simply a form of political organization that does not put one ruler , or ruling body , over everyone in a society .
Whether that ’s actually possible is a separate matter .
This is what it means .
And I see it as an ideal to strive for .
L : I ’m looking at Webster ’s , and it says that anarchy is : A : Absence of government .
B : A state of lawlessness or political disorder due to the absence of governmental authority .
C : A utopian society of individuals who enjoy complete freedom without government .
People might say you ’re focusing only on C .
Doug : Look at the etymology .
It comes from the Greek anarchos , meaning “ having no ruler , ” an- , not , and archos , ruler .
Definition B has come into popular use , but that does n’t make it right .
Democracy u2013 The Go ... Hans - Hermann Hoppe Best Price : $ 24.77 Buy New $ 37.61 ( as of 09:25 EST - Details )
“ Anarchy ” is a word that ’s been stolen and corrupted by the collectivists — like “ liberal , ” It used to be that a liberal was someone who believed in both social and economic freedom .
Now a liberal is no better than a muddle - headed thief — someone who ’s liberal only with other people ’s money .
I refuse to let the bad guys control the intellectual battlefield by expropriating and ruining good words .
In any event , there ’s no conflict whatsoever between anarchy and the rule of law , since there are private forms of law and governance .
That ’s what Common Law is all about .
So the correct definition is a combination of A and C .
But I never said a truly free , anarchic society would be a utopia ; it would simply be a society that emphasizes personal responsibility and does n’t have any organized institutions of coercion .
Perfect harmony is not an option for imperfect human beings .
Social order , however , is possible without the state .
In fact , the state is so dangerous because it necessarily draws the sociopaths — who like coercion — to itself .
What holds society together is not a bunch of strict laws and a brutal police force — it ’s basically peer pressure , moral suasion , and social opprobrium .
Look at a restaurant .
The bills get paid not because anybody is afraid of the police , but for the three reasons I just mentioned .
L : I saw some of this in Argentina over the last few days .
Here we are at your Harvest Celebration .
Two hundred people , most of whom have never met before , a hundred miles from nowhere — I do n’t know if the nearby town of Cafayate even has a cop , but if it does , he ’s well hidden .
For all anyone can see , it ’s us , the grape vines , and the mountains .
And yet , there was order .
The Estancia is private property .
Your people organized things , and the guests went along with it and had a great time .
Why ?
I do n’t think many of them calculated the odds of getting killed if they tried to use violence to get everything they wanted , though a rational person making such a calculation would decide it was n’t worth it .
Most people are brought up to be decent , and the people you tend to attract have a certain moral fiber .
In other words , the event was governed by a culture of voluntary and honorable cooperation .
Doug : Just so .
It ’s like when people form lines at movie theaters or ski lifts .
There does n’t have to be a cop with a gun there to make everyone take turns .
Everyone knows that if they take turns , it all works out better for everyone — and they are brought up to act that way , so they usually do n’t even have to make that calculation .
A more obviously government - like example is Disneyworld , which is nothing less than a private city , complete with numerous rules that would be called laws if it were run by politicians instead of a corporation .
Why would anyone go along with rules that are n’t laws ?
Because they want to go to Disneyworld .
They agree , and for the most part , they go along , and if they cause too much trouble , Disney kicks ’em out — which they have every right to do as owners of their private property .
As Pareto ’s Law indicates , there ’s inevitably a bad element in most places .
80 % of folks are truly decent , and 20 % are perhaps problematical .
And 20 % of that 20 % are bad apples .
You have to have a culture that keeps them hiding under rocks , rather than rising to the top — as they wind up doing quite often in government .
The reaction of a person to the idea of a truly free society is an excellent moral litmus test .
The more negative the reaction , the more likely you ’re dealing with a sociopath .
L : What would you say to people who point out that when the government collapsed in Somalia a few years ago , bloodshed ensued , or that when the government disappeared from New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina , ugly chaos did erupt ?
Doug :
It ’s as you said : a cultural matter .
If you have people who ’ve been brought up to believe that the only limits on what you can or should do is the force exerted by the authorities , it ’s no surprise that when the greater power disappears , they reach out to take whatever they want , by force .
That ’s clearly the case in Somalia , but it ’s also true of the people stranded in New Orleans , who were primarily those with no money to flee — in other words , the inhabitants of government housing projects .
It ’s not politically correct to point this out , but those people had , on average , a distinctly different culture from that of the average American .
Actually , ex-police states are the most dangerous places — like Russia in the early ’90s , the Congo in the early ’ 60s , or Haiti today , because they have a culture of repression that ’s like a pressure cooker .
When the lid comes off , it ’s a mess .
L : I seem to recall a flood in West Virginia in recent years that wiped out half of a small town .
Instead of raping and robbing each other , those not hurt helped the victims .
They housed them , fed them , and even helped them build new houses .
And no one made them do it .
It was n’t a case of better government — it was just their culture to do so .
Doug :
And culture is a matter of education , which means that societies that function on voluntary cooperation , as in Cafayate , Disneyland , or the town you ’re talking about in West Virginia , are possible .
There is nothing in human nature that makes it impossible to create a society of people who respect each other ’s rights and follow accepted systems for working out differences , like getting in lines at movie theaters .
There would still be criminals and sociopaths to deal with , as these occur in a standard distribution in every population — but the point is that the society does n’t have to be built around an essentially criminal organization , the state .
L : And those sociopaths would be limited to whatever mischief they could wreak personally , instead of having access to the machinery of the state to multiply the harm they can do .
But I think most people would balk at your characterization of the state as essentially criminal .
I know that ’s a big topic people have written whole books about , but can you give us something brief to substantiate your view ?
Doug :
Well , it ’s really not that complicated .
We can probably agree that it ’s wrong for me to point a gun at you and take all your money .
Some people might feel sorry for me if I did that to buy medicine for my dying mother , but it ’s still a crime , because it violates your human rights .
And it ’s still a crime if I ask someone else to do the same thing for me — and still a crime if a whole bunch of people vote to ask someone with a spiffy uniform and a badge to do the same thing .
It would n’t matter any more if a group of people calling themselves Congress went through some rituals that involved a leader putting some ink on some paper and said a violation of your rights was now “ legal ” than if a witch - doctor told a tribe ’s warriors that it was okay to take slaves and sacrifice them to the gods .
Laws are just a “ civilized ” man ’s taboos .
L : Obamacare is a case of exactly this .
Socialized medicine puts you and me in the position of the tribe ’s sacrifice , because the mass of voters want free goodies at the expense of those who produce more than they do .
But to get back to the word “ criminal ” — you ’re saying that the state is inherently criminal because it violates human rights .
But does it have to be that way ?
Did n’t Ayn Rand have an idea for a kind of government that would not violate anyone ’s rights ?
Doug : I do n’t think she ever came up with a detailed plan .
I find it interesting that her “ Galt ’s Gulch ” in Atlas Shrugged was clearly a private city .
It was built on land owned by Midas Mulligan , and people who bought in agreed to his terms .
There was no mention of police or elected officials .
What Rand said was that a moral government could not violate anyone ’s rights , and that meant raising revenues through user fees and other voluntary means — no taxes .
That ’s a great step in the right direction , but leaves a lot of unanswered questions as to how to do this .
Here ’s the rub ; imagine that the Quebecois decided unanimously that they really did n’t want to be part of Canada anymore but wanted to be an independent , French - speaking country .
So they peacefully vote and take their marbles to play their own game .
In doing so , they do n’t violate anyone ’s rights , so there is no moral way the government of Canada can stop them .
They could use force , but that would violate the rights of the Quebecois , who would not be hurting anyone .
And if the Quebecois could do this , so could Disneyworld , or your neighborhood — or you individually .
There ’s no moral way to prevent peaceful secession — but if a state does n’t prevent secession , it soon disintegrates .
People always want to do things differently , and they would if the threat of force from the state did n’t stop them .
Brute force — although gussied up with myth , propaganda , and red , white , and blue bunting — is what holds the state together .
That force is ugly and corrupting .
No matter how benign a state might be , even one that found a way to fund all of its activities without resorting to force , it must still violate the fundamental human right of self - determination in order to preserve its own existence .
That ’s why the state is inherently a criminal organization — it must rely on force .
Even the best of them are never based entirely on consent of the governed ; there is coercion of the non-consenting minority .
And there are always some who do not consent .
Democracy is no solution — it ’s just 51 % bossing the other 49 % around .
For God ’s sake , Hitler was democratically elected .
Democracy is just mob rule dressed up in a coat and tie .

You and I do not consent to Obamacare , but we ’re forced to accept it .
Of course socialized medicine is totally counterproductive , as we discussed in our conversation on health .
I suppose I can live with the idea of a state , as long as there were about seven billion of them in the world — and everybody had one .
That would show that the whole idea of the state is just a scam , where everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else .
But the only people who really benefit are the guys on top .
L : The state ’s requirements for self - preservation are why people so often say that the state is a “ necessary evil . ”
It must violate some rights to exist , but people think that the state ’s protection and support of civil society , which is a great value , is worth the violation .
Doug : I find the concept of a necessary evil rather repugnant .
It ’s largely sophistry , usually trotted out to justify some type of criminality .
Can anything that ’s evil really be necessary ?
And can anything that ’s necessary really be evil ?
Entirely apart from that , people say the state is necessary because that ’s all they ’ve ever known .
But it ’s not , in fact , part of the cosmic firmament .
There have been times and places in history when central authority was so distant , or negligent , that the people did function — and prosper — in what was essentially a functioning anarchy .
David Friedman draws attention to medieval Iceland as one example of this .
I recommend his book The Machinery of Freedom for lots of great discussion on how society would work without the dead hand of the state suppressing it .
L : And the reality is that there are all sorts of private institutions that provide regulatory and governance systems , from private cities like Disneyworld , to Underwriter ’s Laboratories that puts “ UL ” seals on electronics they deem safe , to churches , some of which govern their members ’ most intimate life functions — all through voluntary subscription .
The Mormon Church , for example , exerts a very significant amount of regulation of the private behavior of its members .
I ’m not a Mormon , of course , but I ’ve lived in predominantly Mormon communities , and I have to say they tended to be cleaner , nicer , safer , etc .
I ’d say the Mormon religion exerts more control over its adherents than any state ’s laws have ever exerted over citizens — but those regulated like it .
They believe they benefit from it , and most important of all , they are physically free to leave any time they want .
Not so for the state .
This is why I ’ve said in the past that the state is not a necessary evil but merely necessarily evil .
Zippo Sons of Anarchy ... Buy New $ 10.77 ( as of 10:49 EST - Details )
Doug : Good example .
The Amish and Mennonites provide other examples , although religious communities are entirely too uptight to suit my taste .
And UL is a good one too , because people worry that businesses would all turn rapacious if the state were n’t there to regulate them .
But electronics producers are not required to get UL seals on their products .
They go to the extra expense of meeting UL standards because they know they ’ll make more money if their products have the UL seal of approval on them .
L : Best Western hotels are the same way .
Best Western does n’t own the hotels ; it ’s largely a private regulatory agency that inspects hotels and gives those that make the grade the right to put a Best Western sign out front , which is worth a lot to a small mom-and - pop joint .
Doug :
There are lots of private regulatory services .
Insurance companies also exert a lot of influence on the insured , who have to go by certain rules to stay insured .
And , of course , there ’s a huge private security industry used by those who want to protect their assets , rather than call 911 after they ’ve been robbed , etc .
All by subscription .
You do n’t need government for anything ; if something is needed and wanted , an entrepreneur will provide it for a profit .
And do so far better and cheaper than anything a government could possibly hope to .
The economic arguments for a free - market anarchy are overwhelming .
I ’m of the opinion we ’d already be living with the technology of Star Trek if it was n’t for the state slowing things down .
But that is n’t the reason I ’m an anarchist .
The real argument is moral and ethical .
L : You know , I keep sending “ unsubscribe USA.gov ” messages to Washington , but I never get a response .
Doug : Good luck .
To them , you ’re cattle .
They care only so much as you and all the others do n’t stampede .
Other than that , you exist for their benefit and have as much say in the matter as a steer .
L. Maybe that ’s true for most people , but I can still vote with my feet .
I ’ve done it before , and I ’ll do it again .
And so have you .
Which is why I was looking at property in your neck of the woods in Argentina .
Doug :
It makes a lot of sense to be in a place where they have to treat you as a guest , to be courted , rather than an asset to be exploited .
Of course , all governments are dangerous , destructive , and annoying .
But the ones that are incompetent and disrespected are easiest to deal with …
Anyway , love to have you as a neighbor .
This brings up another problem with the nation - state — it forces obligations upon you .
I ’m a big believer in being neighborly , but when the state tries to force you into a relationship with other people , it only breeds resentment .
I like communities that are self - selecting , where you can assume neighbors share some basic premises about the way the world works .
L : I loved the Estancia .
Those mountains would probably convince me if you and your friends did n’t .
But anyway , there are a million directions we could take this conversation , a million objections I could raise for you to answer , but I ’d like to move from theory to practice .
Even to those who agree with you , at least in spirit , this all sounds very theoretical — of no practical consequence since the whole planet , as you ’ve observed , is covered with nation - states .
I ’ve been your friend for the better part of 20 years , and I ’ve worked with you closely for most of the last six of those .
I know this is not all theory for you .
You live your philosophy .
I ’ve seen you get up in front of a large lecture hall with hundreds of people and tell them that the whole of the law should be : “ Do what thou wilt — but be prepared to accept the consequences . ”
They laugh or roll their eyes , depending on their beliefs , but I doubt many realize that you are not only completely serious , but that that is exactly how you live your life .
You ’re not shy , but you ’re not a braggart either , so I ’ll go ahead and say that I have watched you match deeds to words .
You routinely go in “ Out ” doors , you light up under “ No Smoking ” signs , you walk through metal detectors with your belt on , you get back on polo ponies regardless of what your doctors tell you , you leave your electronics on when all the other sheep on the airplane turn theirs off …
I could go on and on .
The beauty of it is that most of the time , nothing happens .
You did exactly as you pleased , hurt no one , and enjoyed life on your own terms .
On the occasions when some busybody does confront you , you usually respond calmly and say , “ Oh . Well , what should we do about it ? ”
The worst that happens when you are confronted is usually that you end up where all the submissive people put themselves to start with .
Sometimes you even fight back .
I ’ve watched you make fools of airport security guards or take your business to another hotel .
The important thing is that you start out doing what you want , not what the busybodies want .
You may end up penned in with the sheep sometimes , but not as often as most people would think .
And you start out doing things your own way .
I admire the heck out of that .
Doug : Well …
You ’re Don Lobo , a well - known anarchist in your own right — well known for not cooperating with the state .
But , like you , I ’m very easy going , and always try to observe others ’ rights to the fullest .
While it ’s true the most basic law is “ Do as thou wilt — but be prepared to accept the consequences , ” you can extrapolate that out , as a practical matter , to two others .
One , do all you say you ’re going to do .
And two , do n’t aggress against other people or their property .
Everybody understands those laws , and you do n’t need a corrupt , and corrupting , government to elaborate on them any further , as far as I ’m concerned .
The people I like to hang out with , like you , observe those things .
Besides that , I find you ’re quite good at keeping your cool while questioning minions of the state … maybe you do it just to see if there ’s actually a real human in that uniform they wear .
The Virtue of Selfishn ...
Ayn Rand Best Price : $ 1.86 Buy New $ 5.73 ( as of 03:50 EST - Details )
L : Okay , okay , but I do n’t want to comment in print on all the things I ’ve done .
The point here is not to flatter you , or myself , but to point out to people that submission is a choice , not a foregone conclusion .
Freedom is something you never get by waiting for permission but by exercising it as vigorously as your creativity and energy allow .
By pushing back against the barriers — like when you told the Inn at Aspen where to shove the city ’s “ No smoking in the bar ” rule , and that you ’d accept the responsibility if the mayor walked in .
In the most general terms , I think it ’s a mistake to think of freedom as a noun , rather than as a verb .
And your actions show the world the consequences of doing freedom , rather than waiting to be given freedom .
Doug :
Well , that ’s true .
And , not to pat myself on the back , it ’s worth noting that there have been times when I ’ve had my setbacks and even a substantial negative net worth — but it was my problem and nobody else ’s .
So not having any money is no excuse for not taking charge of your own life and living it the way you want to .
I was n’t given freedom by my parents or the government .
L : Hear , hear !
So… Investment implications ?
Doug : Attitude is everything , and that matters .
If you let yourself be treated like cattle or herded like sheep , you wo n’t invest so as to maximize your freedom .
There ’s a lot we could say about this , but we ’ve gone on long enough .
The place to start is with diversifying your assets across political jurisdictions , making it harder for each would - be Big Brother to corral you .
This is a rule almost everyone forgets — but it ’s the most important single thing in today ’s world .
I would like to recommend a book here .
Along with Rand ’s The Virtue of Selfishness , I ’d say it ’s the most important I ’ve ever read , and had the most practical effect on my thinking : The Market for Liberty by Tannehill .
It describes , clearly and precisely , how a society without government would likely work .
Best of all , it ’s now a free download from the Mises Institute ’s web site .
If you understand the basics , you ’ll feel much less obligated to support the destructive institution of government — because you ’ll know it ’s unnecessary .
L : As we covered in our conversations on currency controls and living abroad — and Argentina , of course .
What else ?
Doug :
Do n’t feel guilty about finding the lowest - tax jurisdictions for reporting your income , owning property , etc .
Shopping with your feet is not only your human right , it ’s a positive good for the whole world ; the more everyone shops for the least onerous governments , the more governments will have to compete for being less onerous , and the better off we ’ll all be .
L : And the easier it will be for people to exercise their freedom as you do .
What about trends ?

Doug :
Just the ones we ’ve already covered — but now the need to take action is getting more urgent .
I see that the new employment bill Obama just signed has new currency controls buried in its guts .
It does n’t necessarily prohibit anything new .
But it has new reporting requirements and penalties .
It ’s an overture to what ’s coming .
As Mencken said , nobody ’s life or property is safe while Congress is in session .
L : I figured you were right about this being in the cards , but I have to admit it ’s started sooner than I thought it would .
Doug : Sometimes I hate it when I ’m right .
And I still think things will get worse than even I think they will .
Remember my mantra : Liquidate , Consolidate , Create , Speculate .
L : No specific investments ?
Doug :
Nothing looks particularly good to me right now , except gold .
If you do n’t have a serious position in gold , you should build one post - haste — with as much as possible outside of the U.S .
L : Okay then .
See The Casey Report for details .
Doug : Right .
L : Very good .
Talk to you next week .
Doug : Yes .
Perhaps we should have a closer look at the implications of Obamacare .
L : Looking forward to it .
Doug and the other editors of The Casey Report tell it like it is — so you can see what ’s coming .
The government meddling in all sectors of the economy … systematic dollar devaluation … the state and fate of other countries around the globe … and the investment implications that can make or break your future wealth acquisition .

Hemingway was thought to have written the finest , very short , story .
It was a classified advertisement whose text was “ For sale .
Baby shoes .
Never worn . ”
I have always been attracted to very miniature versions of linguistic expression .
It is interesting to seek the minimum number of words for various categories .
So , for example , I have never found a better , shorter sentence that Ring Lardner , Jr’s “ Shut up , he explained . ”
For five words , I have Woody Allen ’s “ I am two with Nature . ” but once one has that many words available there must be many others .
Best short Seder text : “ They tried to kill us .
We won .
Let ’s eat . ”
For many years I have been collecting aphorisms , jokes , witty remarks , etc. for a someday - to - be published Common - Place Book .
It is divided into two sections . ; one on general Philosophy and the other on Morality .
I do not restrict myself just to short passages .
But I do tend to favor brief encounters .
Ideally the upper limit would be something like Nietzsche ’s limit on aphorisms .
“
It is my ambition to say in ten sentences what everyone else says in a book — what everyone else does not say in a book . ”
One of his best “ All truth is simple …is that not doubly a lie ? ” comes in at ten words .
So today I present a sampling , a taste , a nibbling of very short takes on Philosophy .
If there is sufficient interest I will follow up with material from the Morality section .
Where I know the source I give it .
Where I do not I welcome information as to the original .
I divide them , roughly , into categories although they are obvious enough that they could be omitted .

Andrew Kania Liberal Brampton West , ON
Mr. Speaker , “ Salaries at some charities make a mockery of the concept of charity ” .
That is a quote from the member for Mississauga East — Cooksville , and she is correct .
That is why I wish to congratulate her on introducing this bill which seeks to protect and stand up for donors , recipients of charitable funds , and taxpayers .
I am honoured to be a seconder of this bill .
The purpose of this bill is twofold : first , to limit the global compensation of employees of charities to $ 250,000 per year , which is a substantial sum ; and second , to allow full public disclosure of the incomes of the top five employees of charities .
In terms of the analysis of the bill and the $ 250,000 limit , the practical effect of imposing this , if it were to be exceeded by a charity , would be to provide the minister with the discretion to revoke the charitable status .
This would not be automatic .
It would allow the minister to use discretion in a particular circumstance if there were some reason that this should not take place .
As well , there is an effective date of 2011 for this bill to provide ample time for transition purposes .
There are multiple reasons to support this bill .
First , we must protect the recipients of charity , Canadians in need .
We must ensure they are not taken advantage of and that the money raised to help them actually reaches them to the greatest extent possible .
Every dollar spent on an executive that is in excess of what is reasonable is a dollar taken away from a recipient , and that must end .
Second , we must protect donors .
Most donors are ordinary people who dig deep into their pockets in order to help others .
It is simply unfair to these ordinary donors , ordinary Canadians , to allow such executives to abuse their generosity and , frankly , to earn far in excess of what most Canadians earn .
Third , we must protect charities and the charity system itself .
Every year Canadians dig deep and contribute billions to 85,000 registered charities .
They will not do so if they believe the system is broken , if their trust has been violated and , frankly , if their money is being wasted on exorbitant compensation packages for executives .
The SickKids example , which has already been mentioned in the House today , is relevant .
When the Toronto Star broke the story that the head of the SickKids Foundation took home $ 2.7 million in salary and severance in one year , people were rightly shocked and outraged .
Think about the average donor who is providing a donation of $ 30 or $ 50 , whatever it may be , digging deep to help .
Think about the recipients of charities who need that money to live .
When they hear that somebody is making $ 2.7 million from moneys that should be used to help , they are outraged and they should be .
What is important in terms of the integrity of the charitable system is that once the SickKids Foundation story broke , it hurt the foundation .
There was a backlash from donors .
The foundation had to set up a specific hotline to take questions and address concerns .
The SickKids Foundation received a 10 % decrease in donations and had to lay off 38 staff members .
I ask , how is it right that that individual received $ 2.7 million in one year , and then the foundation itself was hurt by a decrease in contributions and 38 innocent Canadians received a pink slip , a layoff notice ?
If this legislation had been in place at the time , it would have stopped this .
The foundation would not have been allowed to pay $ 2.7 million to that executive .
The SickKids Foundation would not have received a 10 % reduction in contributions , and those innocent 38 people would not have been laid off .
It is instructive to reflect upon the recent changes the Conservatives did make for disclosure provisions .
The disclosure provisions , although admittedly an improvement , are not enough .
The $ 2.7 million salary was only learned of because the foundation also operates in the United States and had to file there .
The changes that have been made by the Conservatives create a continuing problem , because despite the new filing requirements introduced by them , there are no exact salary figures or names of the highest paid individuals that must be disclosed .
Instead , charities must identify the number of people who earn a salary within a certain range , with a top range of “ $ 350,000 and over ” .
Using the SickKids Foundation as an example , if that foundation had not also operated in the United States where there are strict filing and disclosure requirements , and we only had the benefit of the new regime that the Conservatives introduced , the only thing we would have known is that at least one person , if not more , at the SickKids Foundation made more than $ 350,000 .
We would not have had the right to know that $ 2.7 million had been paid to an individual .
Although the changes introduced are an improvement , they do not go far enough .
This private member 's bill must be supported in order to ensure that we have full disclosure of this information .
The other reason we must support this bill is to protect taxpayers .
In the most recent year , the taxpayers of Canada contributed almost $ 3 billion in federal tax credits .
Every Canadian has the right to know the salaries of such executives and provide reasonable limits to these taxpayer - supported activities .
We are supporting these executives in their positions .
We have a right to know how much they are making and we have a right to set reasonable limits on what that income is .
In terms of integrity , it must be remembered that in 2007 , Canadians donated a total of $ 10 billion and volunteered 2.1 billion hours .
If that goes down because people do not believe that the system can be trusted and people are being treated unfairly , Canadians will suffer .
Six years ago , in 2004 , the United States recognized it had a problem regarding disclosure .
The IRS announced new enforcement efforts to identify and halt such abuses .
The IRS said :
We are concerned that some charities and private foundations are abusing their tax - exempt status by paying exorbitant compensation to their officers and others .
In Canada , nothing has been done to remedy the situation apart from the small change that I noted , which does not solve the problem .
This outrageous compensation is a serious problem in Canada .
It is not limited to the one example of the SickKids Foundation that I noted .
That perhaps is what broke the story , but it is not the only example .
One reporter stated :
It seems for some of Canada ’s best known charitable organizations , charity begins in the chief executive ’s office .
Some of Canada 's largest and best known charities pay some of their top officials more than $ 300,000 per annum , which is more than deputy ministers make .
Frankly , it is more than most Canadians make .
Chief executives at Plan International Canada Inc. , the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario and York University Foundation all were paid more than $ 300,000 last year .
The BC Children 's Hospital Foundation and Toronto General and Western Hospital Foundation paid top executives between $ 250,000 and $ 300,000 per year .
Some people will oppose this legislation , but I ask why .
First , why are they afraid of transparency ?
What are they trying to hide ?
Why would they not want to disclose what the top executives actually are making on an individual basis ?
Taxpayers have a right to know .
Donors who provide the money have a right to know .
Canadians who are receiving the benefit of these dollars have a right to know .
Second , is $ 250,000 not enough ?
It is enough , but more than that , setting a limit will level the playing field in Canada .
Tim Price , chairman of the York University Foundation board , said it paid CEO Paul Marcus $ 394,000 in salary and bonus last year and that the payment “ was in the context of the competitiveness of talent to be able to get a first - class person ” .
The foundation would not be required to have paid $ 394,000 to that individual if there was a cap of $ 250,000 .
Frankly , people would not be seeking to move around and drive up the cost of compensation packages if there was a limit .
Canadians who need these funds would actually receive them .
There are very large Canadian charities that already are compliant , such as Big Brothers Big Sisters of Canada , United Way of Canada and the Red Cross .
There is no reason that everybody cannot be compliant .
A Catholic priest from a rural parish west of San Antonio is accused in a lawsuit filed Thursday of sexually assaulting a 16 - year - old boy at gunpoint and during private catechism sessions two years ago .
The suit , which names outgoing Archbishop José Gomez as a defendant and claims he sought to conceal the matter , comes three days after the Vatican named Gomez as the next archbishop in Los Angeles .
He is transferring to California next month .
Gomez said recently through a spokesman that his five - year tenure involved no new sex - abuse allegations .
The suit claims that Father John M. Fiala repeatedly assaulted the youth from January to August 2008 while Fiala was working as administrator at Sacred Heart of Mary in Rocksprings .
That 's the county seat of Edwards County , which is about 110 miles west of San Antonio and is part of the Archdiocese of San Antonio .
The alleged victim , who last fall turned 18 and is unnamed in the suit , was a member of the parish along with his family and still lives in Edwards County .
Fiala also worked at nearby St. Raymond Mission in Leakey and St. Mary Magdalen Mission in Camp Wood .
Gomez removed Fiala from ministry in October 2008 and informed his religious order and the three congregations where he used to work , according to a statement issued Thursday .
The statement also said Fiala 's religious order , the Society of Our Lady of the Most Holy Trinity based in Robstown , has removed him from priestly ministry .
The archdiocese said it was acting on a complaint it received in the fall of that year that involved interference with child custody .
The archdiocese did not acknowledge receiving a sex - abuse complaint against Fiala .
The archdiocese said Thursday it has cooperated in the investigation , but it did not say whether it had reported any complaints against Fiala to police .
The young man 's attorneys said his mother told the archdiocese multiple times that she suspected Fiala was sexually abusing her son and was told to contact police .
Archdiocesan spokesman Pat Rodgers cited the pending lawsuit for not responding to questions , including the timing and nature of the complaints and their release to the public .
During a news conference Tuesday to announce Gomez 's new assignment , Father Martin Leopold , head administrator for the archdiocese , said only a couple allegations of sex abuse by priests had surfaced during Gomez 's tenure .
He said they involved claims from 20 and 30 years ago and were made public at Gomez 's request and in keeping with the standards of transparency codified by bishops in the aftermath of an explosion of sex abuse allegations earlier this decade .
" In the last five years , we 're blessed to not have had any allegations of new abuse , " Leopold said , reasserting programs and policies to protect from such abuse .
The Fiala case follows the same pattern of cover -up of sex - abuse complaints in the Catholic Church in the U.S. and Europe , said David Clohessy , national president of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests .
" Bishops are so quick to say that they have made changes , " he said .
" And the ones to pay the price are the young victims . "
Fiala is presumed to be living in his home state of Nebraska , but his exact whereabouts are unknown , Edwards County Sheriff Donald Letsinger said .
He said he expects to soon take findings of an investigation of aggravated sexual abuse against Fiala to a grand jury .
He confirmed that his counterparts in Harper and John Green counties had similar investigations under way .
He also said there could be multiple victims alleging the same abuse by Fiala .
Letsinger said he was contacted in 2008 by a family member of the teen with an initial claim of interference with child custody , but that it grew into an investigation of sexual abuse .
He also said the archdiocese has " been more than helpful " in cooperating with his requests .
Calls to Fred Hernandez , district attorney for an area that includes Edwards County , were not returned Thursday .
The lawsuit describes a relationship between a then - 16 - year - old and Fiala , starting at a basketball game in 2007 .
It says Fiala lavished gifts on the boy , including a laptop computer , cell phone , MP3 player , money and later a Chrysler Sebring .
He provided alcohol and manipulated the teen into private catechism classes on church grounds where the alleged sexual abuse took place up to twice a month , the suit says .
It also claims Fiala gave the teen a ride in a church truck to Big Spring for the teen to visit his girlfriend but stopped at a San Angelo Motel 6 .
There , he raped the teen at gunpoint in a room and said , " If you tell anyone what happened , I will hurt you and your family , " according to the suit .
On other occasions , the priest manipulated the teen into performing oral sex , once by leveraging his gift of a car and another time pulling a revolver on him , according to the suit .
The teen eventually ran away from home and attempted suicide , the suit says .
A school counselor learned of the alleged abuse and contacted the Sheriff 's Office .
Fiala is believed to be in his early 50s and was ordained in 1984 .
He spent his first 10 years in parish ministry in Nebraska before moving to the Diocese of Corpus Christi .
He also had assignments in Kansas , Missouri and then the San Antonio archdiocese , where he also was pastor and director of the World Apostolate of Fatima .
" One of the issues in this case is he had numerous transfers and periods of no assignments at all , " said the teen 's attorney , Tom Rhodes .
" That 's a pretty good red flag . "

Washington ( CNN ) -- Latino members of Congress Tuesday called on Arizona 's governor to kill a state bill that would require police to determine whether people are in the United States legally , arguing that it unconstitutionally authorizes discrimination .
" When you institutionalize a law like this one , you are targeting and discriminating at a wholesale level against a group of people , " Rep. Raul Grijalva , D - Arizona , told reporters .
Grijalva and Rep. Luis Gutierrez , the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Task Force on Immigration Reform , said Republican Gov. Jan Brewer should veto the measure , which the state Senate approved Monday .
The bill would require immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and require police to question people if there 's reason to suspect they 're in the United States illegally .
It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them .
Brewer , a Republican , has yet to take a public stance on the bill .
Grijalva , whose congressional district runs from the Mexican border to the outskirts of Phoenix , said the legislation " is not just mean - spirited , it is directed at a specific population . "
Gutierrez , D - Illinois , said the measure infringes on the federal government 's authority over immigration laws as well as being discriminatory .
" I'm Puerto Rican .
I was born in Chicago , and my family has been U.S. citizens for generations , " Gutierrez said .
" But look at my face , listen to my voice .
I 'd probably get picked up in Arizona and questioned .
Is that what we want in America ? "
Currently , officers can check someone 's immigration status if the person is suspected in another crime .
Critics argue the new law would foster racial profiling , saying that most police officers do n't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person 's legal status .
The bill is considered to be among the toughest immigration measures in the nation .
Supporters say the measure is needed to fill a void left by the federal government 's failure to enforce its immigration laws .
Its leading sponsor , state Sen. Russell Pearce , said , " Illegal is not a race , it 's a crime . "
" We 're going to take the handcuffs off of law enforcement .
We 're going to put them on the bad guy , " Pearce , a Republican , told CNN .
" You know , this is amazing to me .
We trust officers , we put guns on them , they make life and death decisions every day , " he added .
" They investigate capital crimes , they investigate sophisticated crimes , but we 're afraid they 're going to pick up the phone and call ICE [ U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ] . "
The tough rhetoric has angered immigration advocates , such as Isabel Garcia , an Arizona legal defender , who says the legislation " legalizes racial profiling . "
" I think this bill represents the most dangerous precedent in this country , violating all of our due process rights , " she told CNN .
" We have not seen this kind of legislation since the Jim Crow laws .
And targeting our communities , it is the single ... largest attack on our communities . "
The state Senate 's Democratic leadership slammed Monday 's vote , saying the bill does n't truly address Arizona 's real immigration problems .
Senate Bill 1070 " is exactly why the federal government must act on immigration reform , " said Democratic leader Jorge Luis Garcia in a written statement .
" We cannot have states creating a jigsaw puzzle of immigration laws .
This bill opens the doors to racial profiling with the provision that allows an officer to ask for citizenship papers from someone who only looks illegal . "
The bill is an unfunded mandate that is " turning police officers into ICE agents and opening departments to lawsuits allowed by this bill , " said Sen. Rebecca Rios .
Rios was referring to a provision in the bill that allows residents to sue their local governments if they feel the law is n't being enforced effectively .
Gutierrez is a leading supporter of a proposed overhaul of U.S. immigration laws , and said the Arizona issue shows why an overhaul is necessary .
He urged President Obama to " put his back into the push " and to let Arizona know that federal law trumps state legislation on the issue .

If you know what Char Siu Bao is , you already know how delicious these hot little buns are .
They can be baked or steamed , but both have soft , slightly sweet , pillowy dough wrapped around a savory and sweet filling of thick sauce and minced BBQ 'd pork .
I always eat more than I should , as they are fucking delicious .
I have to drive a ways to get good , hot fresh bao , and the frozen ones are full of preservatives and artificial ingredients .
I have 4 days off for Thanksgiving , so why not make some , I thought to myself ?
Please note that if you decide to make this , you will need several hours on multiple days to complete this .
The internet is deceiving , and while none of this is terribly difficult , it IS time consuming !
The pork needs many hours or days of marinating and refrigerating , and my dough took a total of 5 hours to rise .
That being said , if you love bao as much as I do , these will be worth it .
The recipe is straight out of Eileen Yin - Fei Lo's The Dim Sum Dumpling Book , I only doubled the ingredients in parts ( The original recipe only made 8 buns .
If you think I 'm gonna spend 3 days making 8 buns , you 're crazy , lady )
Makes 16 bao with leftover pork ( which is a good thing ) .
Step 1 : Make the Char Siu ( BBQ'd Pork )
Ingredients :
About 2 - 2.5 lbs of pork butt / shoulder
1 1/2 TB dark soy
1 1/2 TB light soy
1 1/2 TB honey
? tsp salt
1 1/2 TB Oyster Sauce ( make sure Oysters are actually in the ingredients )
2 TB whiskey
3 1/2 TB Hoisin sauce
pinch pepper
1/2 tsp five spice powder
Method :
Line a large roasting pan with foil .
Mix up all ingredients except the pork and set aside .
Cut your pork into 1 " x1 " strips , trimming away excess fat .
Place in the roasting pan and pour the sauce over the top .
Turn to coat , and let marinate for 4 hours or up to overnight .
When ready to cook , put your oven rack on the second closest position to the broiler and preheat the oven with the broiler for a few minutes .
Broil pork for 20 - 30 minutes .
Turn and baste at 8 minute intervals .
Pork is done when the thickest section is cooked all the way through ( no pink ) .
Watch for burning sugar , and some of the edges will and should get a little crispy .
If your pan turns dry ( mine did n't ) , add a little water a few TB at a time .
Looks like this when done :
Let cool to room temp , and refrigerate for 4 hours or up to overnight .
Now , this stuff is absolutely delicious on its own .
Use in stir - fries , sandwiches , chop up and put in soba , udon or ramen soup .
I will definitely make this again .
Step 2 : Make the filling
Ingredients :
4 tsp oyster sauce
1 1/2 tsp dark soy
4 tsp ketchup
1 TB sugar
pinch pepper
6 TB chicken broth
1 tsp sesame oil
1 TB peanut or vegetable oil
2/3 cup minced onions
1 cup roast pork
2 tsp Shao - Hsing wine or sherry
Method :
Mix oyster sauce through sesame oil and set aside .
Mince your onions and pork .
I decided to double the recipe halfway through this step , so the next few pics will show half the amount you need .
Get a wok or sauté pan hot and put in the oil .
Add onions , lower heat to low , and cook until onions start to turn brown , just a few minutes .
Add pork and raise heat to medium - high , stir - frying for a few more minutes until pork is heated through , about one minute .
Reduce heat to very low , add wine or sherry , and mix well , cooking for another minute or so .
Add sauce ingredients and stir - fry until mixture is thick and bubbly .
Remove from heat and put in bowl .
Let cool to room temp then refrigerate for 4 hours or up to overnight ( yes , again ! )
You can make the dough while you let this cool and rest in the fridge .
Make the Dough !
Ingredients :
3 tsp dry active yeast
1/2 cup plus 2 TB sugar
2/3 cup hot tap water
2 2/3 cups high gluten flour ( look for flour that says best for bread machines )
1 egg , beaten
7 1/2 TB peanut or vegetable oil
Method :
I have no pics of this part as I forgot , plus my hands were super messy with sticky dough , for a lot of it so I 'm sorry !
In a large mixing bowl , dissolve the yeast and sugar in the hot water .
Set aside in a warm place for 30 - 60 minutes ( the colder it is inside the longer it will take ) .
Yeast is ready when the top is foamy and light brown .
When ready , add flour , egg , and oil , stirring continuously with your hand or a wooden spoon ( I prefer the spoon ) .
Stir and knead for several minutes until dough is cohesive and sticks together instead of being a gooey gloppy mess .
You may need to add more flour , I think I added about ?
cup more a tablespoon or so at a time .
When you feel you can knead it without it sticking everywhere , turn it out onto a floured work surface .
Knead for 15 minutes , until smooth and elastic .
Re-flour and scrape up work surface as often as necessary to prevent sticking .
When ready to rise , put into a large , lightly oiled bowl , cover with a damp cloth , and let rise until about tripled in size , anywhere from 2 - 5 hours .
After rising ( you can see where I poked and lifted the dough with my fingers )
Making the bao !
You 'll need 2 large cookie sheets , and 16 squares of wax paper cut into approximately 4 " x4 " squares .
When the dough is ready , divide the dough in half , and put half on a work surface , and the rest back in the bowl with the damp cloth on top .
Knead the half you have out for a few minutes .
Divide into 8 equal pieces by rolling out into a log , and cutting in half , then cutting pieces in half until you have 8 equal pieces .
Roll the pieces into balls , and put back what you 're not using at the moment in the bowl under the cloth .
Make a well into your dough ball , like this :
Stretch / press to make a little bit bigger and make the edges thinner , and spoon a scant tablespoon or so of filling into the well .
Hold bao in one hand , and with the other , pinch two sides shut .
Turn the bao a half turn , and pinch the opposite two sides shut .
Now pull the other open corners shut together .
You 'll be pinching a total of 4 times .
Then do a final pinch , and kinda twist the whole bottom together to make sure it 's sealed .
Do n't make your dough too thin , or the filling will bust out when you go to bake it .
Place you bao sealed - side down on a wax paper square .
Repeat for all your bao .
Let rest in a warm spot for about an hour , or until they 've risen a bit .
A puffy , risen bao :
When risen , lightly mist the bao with water and using a pastry brush , brush the outside with a beaten egg .
Bake in a 350 degree preheated oven for 15 - 20 minutes , or until lightly golden brown on top .
Rotate trays 180 degrees about halfway through baking to ensure even baking .
Your patience is rewarded with a tray of golden brown , perfectly cooked bao :
Money Shot
Let cool for a few minutes before ripping into !
The finished product :
Notes
These were delicious .
I 'd probably increase the amount of sauce just a little bit as I like a saucy bao , but the dough was really , really good - very tender , soft , slightly sweet .
These can be refrigerated for a few days , although the author does n't recommend freezing them .
She recommends bringing them to room temp and baking them for 5 minutes at 350 degrees , but after all the time making them , I 'm lazy , and just microwave them for about 35 seconds .
I was really happy with how easy the dough was to work with , I thought I would struggle with making them perfect little sealed round buns , but they were surprisingly easy , and I was very pleased with how they would turn out .
I might make them again as they 're delicious , but they were a lot of trouble .
I will definitely be making the pork again , though .
These are absolutely incredible .
They do n't actually require that much prep time since a large majority is just letting things marinate or rise .
Be careful with the wax paper particularly if your bao are in any way leaky - they will stick more and more as they cool .
Make sure to immediately remove them from the paper while hot .
Variations
My friend told me that she wants to stop taking her anti-anxiety medication .
“ It ’s important for me to get off of it .
I want to try really , really hard to eliminate it from my life . ”
Bear in mind that this is a woman who has suffered from crippling anxiety for many years , to the point that she was n’t even leaving the house .
Countless therapy sessions did nothing .
Yoga , meditation , acupuncture , exercise , vitamins , you name it .
Nothing , nada .
She was a complete mess until she met her good friend , Mr. Paxil .
And then she was much better .
At least to the point that we could have this conversation in a bar and not simply through text messaging while she sat alone in her bedroom herunterladen .
Knowing this about her led me to get on my soapbox about her desire to stop her medicine , to the point that I was told by the bartender to either lower my voice or leave .
Apparently I can scream all I want when the Yankees lose – and believe me , I do – but I have to use my Indoor Voice when discussing matters of health .
Before being scolded , I listed for her several valid reasons that physicians and patients will stop a reasonably successful medication regimen :
1 ) Side effects : sometimes the benefits of the drug are simply offset by the cons that come with it excel for free mac .
Most of my patients tell me that many side effects go away after a few weeks , but whether it be significant weight gain , loss of libido , dry mouth , dizziness , etc. , some people decide that the gains are simply not enough to warrant continuing the medicine .
An extension of this would be when a patient ’s mental health medicines are contraindicated due to a physical issue such as pregnancy .
2 ) The issues or circumstances that led to medical intervention have been resolved : some patients need medication as a temporary band - aid to simply take the edge off or alleviate symptoms on a short - term basis .
I have plenty of clients who have panic attacks that are so agonizing that medicine gives them an almost - required relief .
They then go to therapy , learn the skills to control the panic and then make a conscious choice that they feel better equipped to deal with the issue outlook 365 shared folders .
At that point the drug is often removed .
Another example would occur when a patient loses a loved one and , for whatever reason , is unable to get out of bed in the morning or function throughout the day .
Anti-depressants are often prescribed to help the patient get to work and manage their daily tasks until they gain some control over their grief .
3 ) Cost : while most of my clients have some type of health insurance and can get at least generic versions of medication at a reasonable cost , this is not true for everyone .
Some patients simply do not have the funds needed to get the drugs that will help them .
And unless they have a doctor who will provide them will samples on an indefinite basis , some people simply can’t access what will help them apple tv dazn herunterladen .
4 ) Dependency : certain medicines such as Ambien or Klonopin have habit - forming properties and are often used only on a short - term basis .
Some patients need to stop taking these drugs after a period of time due to the risks involved .
“ I ’ve known you forever and none of those apply to you , ” I said .
“ So tell me the reason . ”
“ I do n’t like the idea of needing it , ” she said .
“ It ’s like , I ’m weak if I have to take the pill . ”
I ’ve heard this innumerable times from clients , friends and even Dr märchen ebooks kostenlosen .
Pete .
I almost always say the same thing in response .
“ So if you were diabetic would you bat an eyelash at taking Glucophage ? ”
My friend sighed , knowing where this was going , fully prepared to humor me .
“ No , doctor of sorts . ”
“ And would you even consider your own intestinal fortitude if you needed Zocor for high cholesterol ? ”
This time she rolled her eyes .
“ No , I would not , you pedantic dick . ”
“ So it ’s fine for you to have problems with your kidneys or heart .
In fact , I ’ll bet any organ gets a free pass as long as it ’s not the brain warzone kostenlos herunterladen ps4 .
Where did you even get this idea ? ” I asked .
“ Come on , ” she said .
“ You know the stigma .
You talk about it all the time on that stupid blog of yours .
It ’s just the way society looks at this type of thing . ”
Of course she ’s right and , while the stigma has weakened over the years , it still exists .
Many people ( most of whom probably do n’t read this site ) feel the same way as my friend : the brain is the sole organ that you are supposed to have full control over ndr-mediathek videos downloaden .
Unfortunately it does n’t work that way in real life .
The reality is that she does n’t have control over it and needs the medicine .
“ You ’re actually being very judgmental to both yourself and everyone else who needs these drugs , ” I said .
“ So what ’s going to happen ?
You ’ll stop the Paxil , become a screaming ball of anxiety again , and be ‘ strong ’ because of it ? ”
She threw back a bit of some pineapple - scented drink .
“ I do n’t know , maybe .
I suppose I could get lucky and the anxiety could go into spontaneous remission . ”
“ After all these years , I doubt it pspp mac .
How about , as an alternative , you remain a happier person with the medicine instead of being a martyr ? ” I suggested .
“ Or , ” she countered , “ how about you go fuck yourself ? ”
To solidify her request she stabbed me in the arm with a paper umbrella from her drink .
Although I think she agreed with me on an intellectual level , her gut was still telling her that ‘ mental health medicine = weakness . ’
And this is the case for so many people who rely on the drugs .
The point that needs to be drilled home is that , ironically , a weak person is the one who will not admit that she needs help .
Strength is the ability to say “ I ca n’t do this alone , it ’s not working . ”
You ca n’t allow your mind to wrap around the notion that it ’s a good idea to remove an agent that has improved your life immeasurably , only to return to a previously miserable state song on mac .
And all for the sake of falsely claiming strength .
Are some people in the world over - medicated ?
Yes .
Do some people use it as a ‘ quick fix , ’ a way to not have to address their problems ?
Of course .
Could our society strive toward a less biochemically - altered state ?
Absolutely .
But none of this is applicable to my stabby friend who never did apologize for her assault on me .
This is a psychological battle for her .
She has to resolve the fact that there is likely something going on in her skull that needs to be addressed through modern medicine zeit herunterladen .
I do n’t know as of yet what my friend is going to do .
We saw the violence she is capable of when her medicine is keeping her reasonably calm , so I ’m pretty sure she could kill me if she goes back to her former self .
That in and of itself should make the decision an easy one , but we ’ll see .

Press Release
The shocking size of Comet McNaught
13 - Apr-2010 , Plain html version .
Royal Astronomical Society Press Release
RAS PN 10/24 ( NAM 08 )
The shocking size of Comet McNaught
British scientists have identified a new candidate for the biggest comet measured to date .
Dr Geraint Jones of UCL ’s Mullard Space Science Laboratory will be presenting the results at the RAS National Astronomy Meeting in Glasgow on Tuesday 13th April .
Instead of using the length of the tail to measure the scale of the comet , the group have used data from the ESA / NASA Ulysses spacecraft to gauge the size of the region of space disturbed by the comet ’s presence .
Analysis of magnetometer data shows evidence of a decayed shockwave surrounding the comet created when ionized gas emitted from the comet ’s nucleus joins the fast - flowing particles of the solar wind , causing the wind to slow down abruptly .
In January and February 2007 , Comet C/2006 P1 McNaught became the brightest comet visible from Earth for 40 years .
Serendipitously , Ulysses made an unexpected crossing of Comet McNaught ’s tail during this time , one of three unplanned encounters with comet tails during the 19 - year mission .
The other encounters included Comet Hyakutake in 1996 , the current record - holder for the comet with the longest measured tail .
Ulysses encountered McNaught ’s tail of ionized gas at a distance downstream of the comet ’s nucleus more than 1.5 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun .
This is far beyond the spectacular dust tail that was visible from Earth in 2007 .
Dr Jones said , “ It was very difficult to observe Comet McNaught ’s plasma tail remotely in comparison with the bright dust tail , so we ca n’t really estimate how long it might be .
What we can say is that Ulysses took just 2.5 days to traverse the shocked solar wind surrounding Comet Hyakutake , compared to an incredible 18 days in shocked wind surrounding Comet McNaught .
This shows that the comet was not only spectacular from the ground ; it was a truly immense obstacle to the solar wind . ”
A comparison with crossing times for other comet encounters demonstrates the huge scale of Comet McNaught .
The Giotto spacecraft 's encounter with Comet Grigg - Skjellerup in 1992 took less than an hour from one shock crossing to another ; to cross the shocked region at Comet Halley took a few hours .
“ The scale of an active comet depends on the level of outgassing rather than the size of the nucleus , ” Dr Jones added .
“ Comet nuclei are n't necessarily active over their entire surfaces ; what we can say is that McNaught 's level of gas production was clearly much higher than that of Hyakutake . ”
Candidate shock features had been found in Ulysses magnetometer data from the Hyakutake encounter in 1996 but their identification was tentative , especially so far downstream from the comet 's head .
The discovery of similar features at McNaught suggests that this interpretation is correct .

FURTHER INFORMATION
ULYSSES
Ulysses , a joint ESA - NASA deep - space mission , was designed to study the heliosphere - the region of space influenced by the Sun and its magnetic field .
The primary scientific goal was to make the first - ever measurements of the unexplored region of space above the Sun 's poles .
Other areas of investigation include determination of the global properties and behaviour of the solar wind , the study of energetic particles of solar and interplanetary origin , measurement of the magnetic field of the Sun and the heliosphere , study of galactic cosmic rays , investigation of how the heliosphere interacts with interstellar space , and participation in a programme to identify the origin of gamma-ray bursts .
Ulysses was launched on 06 October 1990 and ceased operations on 30 June 2009 after becoming the longest running ESA - operated spacecraft .
The magnetic field investigation on Ulysses was led by a team from Imperial College London .

According to Jennifer Viegas , " New Written Language of Ancient Scotland Discovered " , Discovery News ,
3/31/2010 :
Once thought to be rock art , carved depictions of soldiers , horses and other figures are in fact part of a written language dating back to the Iron Age .
The ancestors of modern Scottish people left behind mysterious , carved stones that new research has just determined contain the written language of the Picts , an Iron Age society that existed in Scotland from 300 to 843 .
The " new research " is described in Rob Lee , Philip Jonathan , and Pauline Ziman , " Pictish symbols revealed as a written language through application of Shannon entropy " , Proceedings of the Royal Society A , in press .
The authors use an argument of the same general shape as the one used by Rao et al. in arguing for linguistic structure in inscriptions from the Indus Valley civilization ( " Conditional entropy and the Indus Script " , 4/26/2009 ) .
They calculate certain statistical measures for some known writing systems , for things that are clearly not writing , and for the inscriptions in question , and they find that in terms of these measures , the inscriptions look more like the writing sytems than like the non-writing sets .
The trouble with this form of argument is that it 's heavily dependent on the particular combination of statistical measure and comparison sets that we choose .
And the argument becomes especially unconvincing when there 's an obvious alternative choice of comparison set — generated by a simple random process — that would fall squarely on the side of the line that allegedly identifies " written language " .
That 's what Cosma Shalizi , Richard Sproat and I ( independently ) argued in the case of the Rao et al. article ( see here for details ) .
And it looks to me as if the Lee et al. article on Pictish has got similar problems .
Let 's take the first part of their argument , summarized in their Figure 2 :
This shows convincingly that the Pictish petroglyph symbols are not drawn randomly from a uniform distribution .
But symbols in writing systems are hardly the only phenomena whose statistical distribution is non-uniform .
For example , if we plot the outcome of rolling 7 6 - sided dice on the same graph , we get the red x shown below :
There are 36 possible outcomes ( sums from 7 to 42 ) , so that the x - axis value for the dice will be log2 ( 36 ) , or about 5.17 .
And these outcomes are not equally likely , since there 's only one way to roll 7 , but 7 ways to roll 8 , 28 ways to roll 9 , etc. — so if we calculate the entropy of the 36 probabilities , we get about 4.22 .
I certainly do n't mean to suggest that the ancient Picts generated their petroglyphs using throws of 7d6 .
The point is just that any process that is ( in effect ) sampling from a distribution with the right number of alternative outcomes ( about 35 to 40 ) and the right amount of non-uniformity ( around 20 % relative redundancy for unigrams ) will look similar on this measure .
And we do n't need to look very far to find a ( non-writing - related ) random process with these characteristics .
Lee et al .
go on to repeat the same form of argument using a number of more sophisticated ( or at least more complicated ) measures .
I have n't evaluated these in detail .
But the way that they present Fig. 2 is not a good sign , in my opinion .

People identifying themselves as representing Apple last week visited and sought permission to search the Silicon Valley address of the college - age man who came into possession of a next - generation iPhone prototype , according to a person involved with the find .
" Someone came to [ the finder 's ] house and knocked on his door , " the source told Wired.com , speaking on condition of anonymity because the case is under investigation by the police .
A roommate answered , but would n't let them in .
Apple 's vaunted wall of secrecy was smashed wide open when one of its developers lost a next - generation iPhone prototype sometime in March at a bar in Redwood City , California .
Another bar patron took the phone home and , having failed to find the owner , gave tech news site Gizmodo exclusive access to the device in exchange for $ 5,000 .
Gizmodo eventually returned the phone to Apple , but not before it published numerous photos and details .
San Mateo County police are now investigating , and they seized computers from Gizmodo writer Jason Chen 's home last week under a search warrant that Gizmodo is challenging as unlawful .
Police have also identified and interviewed the man who took the phone from the bar , the San Jose Business Journal reported Tuesday .
News of Apple 's lost iPhone prototype hit the web like a bombshell , but it was apparently an open secret for weeks amongst the finder 's roommates and neighbors , where the device was shown around mostly as a curiosity .
According to the source , who has direct knowledge of the Gizmodo transaction , the group of friends suspected this might be Apple 's new phone , but no one knew for sure .
" There was no effort to keep it secret , " the source said .
" There were a bunch of people who knew . "
The finder attempted to notify Apple and find the owner of the device but failed , even going so far as to search alphabetically through Facebook , the source said .
Thoughts then turned to contacting the press about the device to confirm its authenticity and help locate the owner , but early attempts to drum up interest went unanswered .
After a few days with no response , the finder expanded the search .
" The idea was n't to find out who was going to pay the most , it was , Who 's going to confirm this ? " the source said .
The finder at one point attempted to restore the phone by connecting it to a roommate 's Apple computer , but was unsuccessful .
News accounts depicting the $ 5,000 payment as a " sale " are incorrect , this person said .
Rather , the agreement with Gizmodo was for exclusivity only .
" It was made very explicit that Gizmodo was to help the finder return the phone to its rightful owner or give it back , " this person said .
" Gizmodo said they could help restore the phone . "
Wired.com received an e-mail March 28 offering access to the device , but did not follow up on the exchange after the tipster made a thinly veiled request for money .
Apple did n't return a phone call Tuesday .

A draft global copyright treaty released today could change the way Australian internet providers deal with pirates on their networks .
The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement ( ACTA ) draft , which took over two years of negotiation , has sparked fears of exposure to legal action in the internet industry .
The United States , the European Union and Australia have been instrumental in the draft 's completion , which could form the basis of a global intellectual property treaty affecting the way internet providers do business .
It sets out greater responsibilities on the part of intermediaries to provide copyright protection for all kinds of intellectual property .
The Internet Industry Association 's chief executive , Peter Coroneos , says it 's another step towards defining actionable copyright offences .
" We 're seeing a continued push for an expansion of enforcement measures to be taken against both individuals , and potentially also against intermediaries , for copyright infringement or at least alleged copyright infringement occurring over the internet , " he said .
Mr Coroneos says the agreement could subject internet service providers ( ISPs ) to legal action .
" The worst case scenario is that it could impose effectively an unmanageable legal risk on intermediaries , so that by virtue of the fact they 're making services available , their users may be doing the wrong thing [ and that ] puts them in a position where they 're not able to contain their own liability , " he said .
" This treaty is essentially forcing governments to strengthen existing laws to hold intermediaries themselves liable . "
Entertainment industry dream
Telecommunications and business law specialist Adrian McCullagh says it may be good news for the film and music industry .
" If it does get up as a convention , [ it ] will put an added pressure onto ISPs , " he said .
" It also gives some extra ammunition to the movie industry , the record industry and the gaming industry to combat piracy . "
In February the Federal Court found that ISP provider iiNet could not be held responsible for the copyright infringement carried out by its customers .
The decision is currently the subject of appeal and Mr Coroneos says the principles set out in the ACTA draft could override it .
" What the ACTA treaty seems to be doing is moving the goalposts a little bit here to create potentially a new head of liability for intermediaries themselves , by virtue of the activities of their customers , " he said .
But while a host of countries have been involved in the secret negotiations , two notable exceptions offer the world 's biggest markets - India and China .
" This agreement has been negotiated largely by countries that are already copyright - respecting nations and respect intellectual property rights and have good , strong , enforceable laws in place , " Mr Coroneos said .
" So we wonder what the reasoning is in creating a new international standard without the involvement of nations where copyright infringement really is a problem .
" Some people have speculated that really this is designed to create some critical mass to then enforce non-participating nations to sign up to an agreement that has already been concluded . "
Are n’t low short - term interest rates wonderful ?
If you are a bank , the answer is yes , particularly because the low rates are accompanied by somewhat higher longer - term rates .
If you are a saver , however , your view might be very different .
This month some interest rate spreads have reached record levels .
The difference between what the Treasury pays on a one - year bill — less than half a percentage point — and what it pays on 10 - year bonds — a little below 4 percent — expanded to the largest on record this month .
In banking jargon , that is a very steep yield curve .
For banks , that is a license to make money with very little risk , particularly since they can get people to open savings accounts that pay close to nothing .
This week I checked the Web sites of the four largest banks in the country — Bank of America , JPMorgan Chase , Citigroup and Wells Fargo — to see what they were offering on an ordinary savings account , say , one with $ 5,000 in it .
So my column for the magazine in a couple of months is on new approaches to air travel .
In the course of writing it , I spent a day with the pilots , engineers and designers of an aircraft that 's meant to bring about just that sort of new approach : the HondaJet , a fast , comparatively cheap five - passenger Very Light Jet that Honda hopes will not only appeal to the usual run of corporate - jet purchasers , but that will also promote an entirely new way of flying , one that 's capable of bridging the gap between cheap - but - unreliable commercial jet travel and swanky - but - expensive corporate jet travel .
What I saw makes me think that the Honda folks just may be onto something .
The HondaJet is the brainchild of Honda Aircraft president and CEO Michimasa Fujino .
Fujino told me that his first job in the United States was in Mississippi , back in the 1980s , and that he found that wherever he traveled by air — even elsewhere in Mississippi —he usually wound up having to change planes in Atlanta .
This seemed wasteful of time and fuel , and made travel iffier , since it created the risk of a missed connection .
To Fujino , the hub - and - spoke system makes sense for a country like Japan , where Tokyo is at the center of everything , but much less sense for a country as big as the United States , where important places are widely distributed .
For this , point - to - point travel is much better .
This is no secret , of course , to the people who travel by private jet now .
But private jet travel is very expensive , which is why it is the domain of CEOs , celebrities and the like .
The HondaJet represents an effort at changing all of that , by using technology and design to bring costs down and allow private - jet travel at costs that approach commercial ticket prices .
( Fully loaded , Fujino says , the cost per seat on the HondaJet should be roughly comparable to a first - class commercial ticket ) .
To keep costs down , the Honda folks have put a lot of thought into ways to make the plane as small and inexpensive as possible , without sacrificing comfort or speed .
This approach shows up in a lot of different places .
To save weight ( and hence fuel ) the HondaJet 's fuselage is all - composite construction .
( I held some of the components in my hand — they were very stiff , but felt almost weightless . )
The plane 's engines are mounted , unusually enough , above rather than below the wings .
This location change accomplishes two things :
It allows the wings to be lowered , opening up more cabin space , and it means that the engines are directly above the landing gear , reducing wing loading on touchdown .
( The over - the - wing placement also means that the wings baffle sound in flight , making things quieter on the ground ) .
The HF - 120 engines themselves are a new , lightweight , fuel - efficient design being codeveloped with General Electric .
Honda is also saving development money by taking advantage of modern computer power .
Fujino notes that it 's possible to do serious design work on a laptop nowadays , where not long ago it took an expensive engineering workstation .
And Honda is making heavy use of simulations , with a sophisticated whole - aircraft simulator that allows real parts to be swapped in and tested against virtual parts and vice versa , allowing many stages of refinement before parts ever reach the test - flight stage .
( When I flew the simulator , I noticed an antenna hanging over the plane : Turns out it transmits simulated GPS data to a real GPS receiver on the simulator , furthering Honda 's goal of keeping things within the simulation as real as possible . )
The interior is also carefully contrived to provide space and comfort in as little room as possible .
What Fujino says is that perceptions of luxury vary with time — the longer you 're in a plane , the more uncomfortable a given set of accommodations will seem .
( Even Air Force One , I 've heard , feels cramped after a while ) .
The HondaJet 's relatively high speed ( 420 knots / 485 mph ) means that trips will tend to be short , so the cabin was optimized for comfort over a 2 - to 3 - hour period .
I think it works .
I 'm a big guy — 6 feet 3 inches and over 200 pounds — but I was comfortable in the cabin and seats .
The built - in lavatory ( the Honda folks were very proud that it has a real door , not simply an accordion door as in some small jets ) was a bit tight for me , but adequate , and the lavatory ceiling features two skylights that provide a more spacious feel .
Overall , the interior reminds me of an upscale Audi ; when I mentioned that , the chief interior designer , Chris Osborne , told me that they had tried for a more Euro - style interior .
I think they succeeded .
The cargo compartment is surprisingly large too .
The design manages to get a lot out of a little , without being too obvious about it .
Overall , the HondaJet has a sleekness and a friendly , pleasing personality that reminds me of an iPhone , or some other cleverly designed bit of consumer hardware .
You just want to like it .
A high degree of automation shows up in the airplane 's glass - cockpit approach to controls ; the HondaJet is designed to be easy enough to fly that it can get by with a single pilot , also cutting costs .
How easy is it to fly ?
Well , I managed to take off and land , in the simulator , without wrecking it , though I had a few pointers from Honda 's chief test pilot , Warren Gould .
Still , anything that I can manage is , by definition , user - friendly .
What about the environment , though ?
Wo n't all these small jets zipping around be worse for emissions than a few big ones ?
The answer seems to be no .
Based on fuel consumption , speed and range , the HondaJet seems to be just about exactly as efficient per seat - mile as the ubiquitous Canadair CRJ - 200 regional jet .
But that probably understates things , because if I were flying from Knoxville to , say , Washington , D.C. , I 'd be traveling a straight - line distance of 353 nautical miles , while if I took a commercial flight , I 'd probably be going by way of Atlanta for a distance of 605 nautical miles .
( I 'd also have a travel time of about an hour on the HondaJet , rather than something like 4 hours traveling via Atlanta . )
So while the precise environmental impact of replacing hub - and - spoke commercial travel with direct - flight travel on the HondaJet is open to dispute , it seems unlikely that there will be much impact .
There 's also a national - security angle : Crashing a 757 , or even a Canadair regional jet , into a building would do a lot more damage than crashing a HondaJet into one .
It 's hard to weigh the importance of this factor , but it 's certainly worth noting .
Overall , I found the HondaJet very appealing , and if I had in the neighborhood of $ 4 million to drop on an airplane I 'd be sorely tempted .
But since I do n't — Popular Mechanics does n't pay quite that well , and neither does my day job at the university — the real question is whether people who do have the money will shell out .
That , obviously , depends .
Honda hopes that the plane will sell not only to the usual run of jet customers , but to air - taxi services , and , in fact , Fujino , who makes a point of calling the HondaJet an Advanced Light Jet rather than a Very Light Jet , tells me that they expect this to be a case of the product driving the market .
Although other efforts to build an on - demand air - taxi market at low cost have stalled with the current economic downturn , those efforts faced financial and technological problems that Honda expects to avoid , and by the time the HondaJets are rolling off the line at full speed , there 's a good chance that the economy will have recovered .
So the air - taxi model — where you got to a website , enter your destination , and have a small jet swoop down to pick you up , possibly at a small business airport rather than a big one where parking and security hassles are greater — may well have a chance .
I certainly would like to see something like that happen .
I fly coach myself ; I 'll occasionally spring for an upgrade to first class when the airline offers me a deal , but when I do take the upgrade I 'm usually underwhelmed .
To me , the problem with air travel as it exists now is n't a lack of free drinks , but a lack of convenient scheduling , and the risk of delays caused by missed connections .
( Ironically enough , a trip to Greensboro , N.C. , was nearly scrubbed by problems in Atlanta en route ) .
Free drinks are nice , I guess , but when your flight is canceled or delayed , the front part of the plane is just as inconvenienced as the back part of the plane .
I 'd be much more willing to pay first - class fare for a shorter flight that was more likely to get me there on time .
Are there enough people out there who feel the way I do ?
Honda thinks there are .
Speaking selfishly , I hope they 're right .

Today is Everybody Draw Mohammed Day , an event that was inspired by the recent death threats again " South Park " creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone after a ( censored ) attempt to depict the Prophet Mohammed in their cartoon .
A Muslim extremist website suggested that the two would " probably wind up like Theo van Gogh , " and linked to an image of the Dutch filmmaker , who was brutally murdered for his film " Submission " about the abuse suffered by some Muslim women .
The website called this " a warning of the reality of what will likely happen to them . "
The same post included the message " you can pay them a visit at these addresses , " listing the locations of South Park 's production company and Comedy Central , who quickly censored the episode .
It 's a terrifying story , and an experience that has been shared by numerous cartoonists who tried to draw or parody Mohammed , notably the Danish cartoonists involved the " Jyllands - Posten " controversy -- a series of Mohammed cartoons that were intended to address concerns about artists self - censoring images of the Prophet -- many of whom had to go into hiding because of death threats or attempts on their lives , and Swedish artist Lars Vilks , whose Mohammed cartoon has lead to death threats , assault , and a recent alleged arson attempt on his house .
In a Boing Boing interview before the recent death threats , Parker and Stone talked about depicting Mohammed in their cartoon before the Danish cartoon controversy , and the difficulty of trying to do so afterwards , in the atmosphere of fear and censorship that followed .
" Now , that 's the new normal .
We lost .
Something that was ok is now not ok , " said Stone .
" If everyone would have just ... printed the cartoons , everyone would rally together , " said Stone .
" Now that [ cartoonist ] has to be in hiding because ... everyone left him out to dry .
That 's a big problem when you have The New York Times and Comedy Central and Viacom basically just p--sying out on it .
That 's just sad . "
Asked whether they were scared of violent reprisals if they depicted Mohammed again , Parker said , " We would be so hypocritical against our own thoughts if we said , let 's not make fun of them because they might hurt us .
That 's messed up to have that kind thought process .
We 'll rip on the Catholics because they wo n't hurt us , but we wo n't rip on them because they might hurt us . "
And yet for many television channels , newspapers , book publishers , and other media outlets , that has become precisely the case .
So it 's not a total surprise to see cartoonists like the Pulitzer Prize - winning Mark Fiore stepping forward today to participate in Everybody Draw Mohammed Day .
Fiore devoted today 's cartoon animation to the issue of cartoonists under threat from extremists -- a cartoon that actually depicts Mohammed in a drawing , and a pretty bold statement in the current climate .
Many have expressed concerns that Everybody Draw Mohammed Day is anti-Muslim -- designed to offend not just extremists , but to hurt the feelings of the vast majority of Muslims -- and that it is needlessly antagonistic .
And while some individuals have probably used it as an excuse to be offensive for its own sake , in the face of a deadly campaign by extremists to terrorize us into feeling like we cannot speak and express ourselves in this particular way , and one that many has been surprisingly effective in silencing the media , I think there is very much a need to assert our right to do so .
I have great respect for the Muslim faith and those who believe in it , and while I think it would be childish and cruel to offend for the sake of offending , I believe that what is at stake here is more important than being polite or striving not to offend .
" Daily Show " commentator Aasif Mandvi -- a self - described liberal Muslim -- recently commented on the controversy , admitting that while depictions of Mohammed might give him offense , " here 's what 's more upsetting .
Someone , in the name of a faith that I believe in , threatening another person for doing it . "
And conversely there are plenty of recent examples of other faiths being mocked in cartoons in our culture ; there have been many , many images and cartoons during the ongoing child abuse scandal in the Catholic Church that would profoundly offend devout Catholics , but as a country that values free speech that is part of the deal that we all make .
There is no right not to be offended ; indeed , as part of offering free speech to all we must often endure the opinions and expressions of others that strike painfully at the very heart of our most deeply held beliefs .
And we , conversely , may tell those people exactly what we think of that in words just as strong , but there is absolutely no place in a free society for any group or figure or institution to claim the privilege of being exempt from ridicule , criticism , or depiction , and particularly to claim it on pain of death .
There is no room for allowing terrorism or intimidation to go unchecked and determine what we may or may not say .
When I was 21 years old , I was profoundly affected by the book " Step Across this Line , " a non-fiction collection by author Salman Rushdie , where he described the experience of living in constant fear of being murdered by extremists after a 1989 fatwa was issued by Ayatollah Khomeni of Iran , exhorting Muslims to kill Rushdie because of the way he depicted Mohammed in his book " Midnight 's Children . "
Rushdie was in many ways the original face of this particular type of terrorism against artists and writers , long before the Muhammed cartoon controversies , and he paid a very high price for speaking his mind : violent protests reminiscent of the Jyllands - Posten controversy took place , bookstores were firebombed , and even a failed assassination attempt .
Every year on February 14th , the anniversary of the fatwa , Rushdie still receives a " valentine " from Iran reminding him that they have not forgotten , and that he is still sentenced to die .
In " Step Across This Line , " he chronicles the worst years of the crisis he spent in hiding , and the mortal fear that became a constant companion .
He had this to say about to say about terrorism , and the way we must rise to meet it : " How to defeat terrorism ?
Do n't be terrorized .
Do n't let fear rule your life .
Even if you are scared . "
From the fatwa that devastated Rushdie 's life to the recent death threats against Trey Parker and Matt Stone , the intention of these extremists has been to silence us , to make these images and ideas not only taboo but literally deadly , and it is a terribly frightening thing .
And Rushdie is right about fear : the only way to defeat those who would try to terrify us out of our most fundamental right to freedom of expression is not to be afraid .
Even if we are .

When , in October 2009 , Christopher Hitchens explained to a Sydney crowd how religion poisoned everything , he opened with a little joke .
He 'd been delighted , he said , to discover his hotel situated in a locale where , if you took an evening constitutional , you could , without fear of embarrassment , ask a passerby , ' Am I heading for The Rocks ? '
The question had often previously occurred to him — but in Sydney , at least , the answer involved directions .
That was the first of several references to Hitchens ' legendary thirst during a lecture advertised with its speaker , cigarette in mouth , glaring belligerently from posters like a drunk at closing time .
Even with laughter still rippling around the hall , I found myself wondering why , in a talk about God , it should matter so very much that the audience knew that , yes , Hitchens really did like a drink .
But it was only later , after host Tony Jones insisted our lecturer recite — twice — Monty Python 's drunken philosopher 's song , that I thought I understood .
Hitchens was opening an event calling itself the Festival of Dangerous Ideas .
At some level , the organisers sensed that , insofar as the evening featured only a middle - aged Oxbridge - educated intellectual — indeed , one who'd recently been profiled in Vanity Fair , boasting , like every other tiresome baby boomer , about quitting smoking and embracing exercise — we might struggle to believe that much risk lay in an utterly conventional denunciation of a deity in whom scarcely any of us believed .
The arguments against God are , after all , sufficiently well established : as long ago as 1842 , Marx was comparing atheists who brayed about their intellectual courage to ' children assuring everyone who is ready to listen to them that they are not afraid of the bogey man ' .
How , then , might a self - styled contrarian provide the frisson required for an evening of danger ?
The more , perhaps , he hinted at whisky - soaked debaucheries ( ' without God , all things are permitted ' ) , the easier for us to persuade ourselves that we were all tremendously daring simply for listening .
Yet in 2010 , when a celebrity non-believer fulminates in the broadsheets , at a writers week or on the ABC , they 're staging , more often than not , a confrontation not with those listening but rather with those who are n't , a challenge issued not so much to our beliefs but to theirs , to doctrines , in other words , accepted by the kinds of Australians who do n't come to the Opera House .
Precisely because contemporary religion flourishes at the cultural margins ( in the outer suburbs , for instance , or among immigrant communities ) rather than amid the taste - setters and intellectuals , most New Atheist presentations contain more than a pinch of bien - pensant snobbery , so that the genteel crowd at a professorial demolition of some scriptural daftness or another leaves smugly satisfied with their superiority over those oiks for whom biblical fairytales still have meaning .
At the global rather than national level , the tendency becomes both more pronounced and more pernicious .
If religion consists simply of a risible set of falsifiable and ethically wrong - headed propositions , then its adherents are , almost by definition , stupid and dangerous — and the more ardently they cling to their delusions , the more their stupidity and dangerousness grows .
Furthermore , there are certain nations where , in these terms , the population seems very deluded indeed — and , would n't you know it , many of them can be found in the Middle East .
So if the wild - eyed fanatics chanting Allah akhbar were to be confronted by the pointy end of Western rationality , well , would that be so very terrible ?
Certainly , Sam Harris does n't think so .
In Australia , Harris might not be a name with which to conjure but in the United States he 's one of atheism 's big three , part of an unholy trinity with Richard Dawkins and Hitchens .
His breakthrough book The End of Faith begins as a general critique of God but morphs very quickly into a crass apologia for the war on terror and , precisely because Harris lacks Hitchens ' political sophistication , his argument repays closer examination , since it illustrates quite openly some of the implications of the New Atheist methodology .
Harris , of course , excels at exposures of the contradictions and cruelties contained in the various sacred texts .
He quotes , for instance , Deuteronomy on what believers should do if a family member proposes worshipping a different god :
Show him no pity .
Do not spare him or shield him .
You must certainly put him to death .
Your hand must be the first in putting him to death , and then the hands of all the people .
Stone him to death , because he tried to turn you away from the Lord your God , who brought you out of Egypt , out of the land of slavery .
As Harris says , this — and the many similar passages in which the God of Love casually commends rapine and murder — goes a long way towards puncturing assertions that religion necessarily provides a basis for morality .
But what follows from that ?
In reply to objections that only a loopy fringe worries about the wilder reaches of the Old Testament , Harris argues that moderation in religion is scarcely less dangerous than fundamentalism , since the moderate retains , simply by accepting an unprovable God , the anti-rational methodology of the literalist .
While moderation in religion may seem a reasonable position to stake out , in light of all that we have ( and have not ) learned about the universe , it offers no bulwark against religious extremism and religious violence …
The problem that religious moderation poses for all of us is that it does not permit anything very critical to be said about religious literalism .
We cannot say that fundamentalists are crazy , because they are merely practicing their freedom of belief ; we cannot even say that they are mistaken in religious terms , because their knowledge of scripture is generally unrivalled .
Yet for Harris , all religions might be bad but some are much worse than others — and there 's no prize for guessing which particular faith falls into the latter category .
' We are ' , he explains , 'at war with Islam ' since ' Islam , more than any other religion human beings have devised has all the makings of a thoroughgoing cult of death . '
Do those of the Islamic faith have any genuine reasons for looking upon the United States in a less than favourable light ?
Apparently not : Harris , inevitably , quotes Paul Berman to explain how ' in all of recent history , no country on earth has fought so hard and consistently as the United States on behalf of Muslim populations ' , while to explain Palestine , he defers to the equally loathsome Alan Dershowitz .
' No other nation in history faced with comparable challenges has ever adhered to a higher standard of human rights [ than Israel ] , ' Dershowitz tells us , ' been more sensitive to the safety of innocent civilians , tried harder to operate under the rule of law , or been willing to take more risks for peace . '
If the Iraqis do n't show sufficient gratitude to the Great White Father in Washington , if the Palestinians complain of slaughter in Gaza , it can only be because of their oogety boogety religion of murder :
In our dialogue with the Muslim world , we are confronted by people who hold beliefs for which there is no rational justification and which therefore cannot be discussed , and yet these are the very beliefs that underlie many of the demands they are likely to make upon us .
At this point , the careful reader might protest that Harris has already revealed the Bible and the Torah to be awash with rapine and slaughter .
Do Christians and Jews also belong to death cults ?
No , not so much :
Although we have seen that the Bible is a great reservoir of intolerance , for Christians and Jews alike — as everything from the writings of Augustine to the present actions of Israeli settlers demonstrates — it is not difficult to find great swaths of the Good Book , as well as Christian and Jewish exegesis , that offer counterarguments .
The Christian who wants to live in the full presence of rationality and modernity can keep the Jesus of Matthew sermonising upon the mount and simply ignore the world - consuming rigmarole of Revelation .
You might think that Harris thus flatly contradicts his earlier argument about religious moderation — and you would be right .
But , leaving aside the hypocrisy , a recognition that one can , after all , compartmentalise scriptural injunctions raises the obvious question of why particular verses take on especial significance in certain situations rather than others .
In the wake of a homophobic beating in the United States , for instance , some newspapers carried photographs of a young tough tattooed with the biblical injunction ' Thou shall not lie with a male as one does with a woman .
It is an abomination . '
The remarkable image crystallised the problem : why do US evangelicals concern themselves so much with Leviticus 18:22 and not at all with the equally strident Leviticus 19:28 ( ' Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead , nor print any marks upon you : I am the LORD ) , a verse generally taken to mean that God hates tattoos just as much as he hates haircuts ( Leviticus 19:27 ) .
Quite clearly , particular beliefs become activated in particular social and political settings : there 's a historical context for the embrace of biblical homophobia , which is why the fundamentalist campaign against gay marriage does not extend to , say , demanding the death penalty for anyone who curses their parents ( Leviticus 20:9 ) .
Harris , however , cannot acknowledge this most obvious of points , for his whole project depends upon understanding religion as a set of ideas divorced from history or culture or politics .
He sees ( in respect of Muslims , at least ) the various sacred texts as divine instruction manuals , determinative of how believers interact with the world .
That 's why he takes fundamentalists as his paradigm — and that 's why he explains away the conflicts in Palestine , the Balkans , Northern Ireland , Kashmir , Sudan , Nigeria , Ethiopia , Eritrea , Sri Lanka , Indonesia and the Caucasus as religious wars .
The inane insistence on religious doctrine as the explanation for all social behaviour runs throughout the New Atheist corpus , with even the much more genial Dawkins happy to wave away Ireland as a spat over God .
That 's why the movement really took off in the years following 9/11 .
' Why do they hate us ? ' asked George Bush .
If his answer ( ' They hate our freedoms ' ) appealed viscerally to conservatives , the New Atheist reply ( ' They hate us because of their religion ' ) provided an alternative rationale specially tailored for liberals .
Thus , in the wake of 11 September , atheism opened the door to an understanding of the war on terror as — of all things — progressive .
Here we were : sophisticated , democratic , secular ; there they were : medieval , hierarchical , superstitious .
Liberals who were too high - minded to invade Iraq for oil , and who found Bush 's braying jingoism phoney and crass , knew that beardie weirdies reading from holy books represented only ignorance and repression — and , on that basis , regime change seemed long overdue .
Now , there 's nothing inherently new about apologias for colonial adventures framed in terms of the backwardness of the natives and the foolishness of their religion .
During the classical age of imperialism , it was a very familiar liberal argument : the East India Company would overcome the prejudices of the dusky Hindoo , the despoliation of Africa would liberate the dark continent from animism and superstition , and so on .
Back then , however , the beliefs of the subjugated were generally contrasted not with atheism but the God of the West : decent chaps agreed , for instance , that sati , the practice in which widows were forced to burn on the funeral pyre of their husbands , would be overcome only by shepherding Hindus into Christianity 's kindly embrace .
But these days , as Terry Eagleton notes , God has shifted over from the side of civilisation to the side of barbarism .
Precisely because , in the West , the enfeebled mainstream churches do not present a credible alternative to anything much at all , the old rhetoric works better if Christianity appears in the deficit column of the ledger , an example of backwardness rather than an instance of progress .
By giving the traditional critique of native unreason an atheist twist ( in which , rather than being foolish for refusing Jesus , the darkies are foolish for believing in God at all ) , Hitchens can free the old trope from colonial connotations and drape it , more or less credibly , in the vestments of radicalism .
But the liberals who nod along judiciously to his bluster about the Islamo - fascist threat ( they 're setting up a caliphate , do n't you know ! ) rarely consider how an anti-religious conception of the war on terror leads Hitchens and the other imperial atheists to even more nakedly eliminationist positions than those adopted by the extreme right .
The most conservative elements in the Bush administration — the people who openly saw the conflict simply in terms of US geopolitical hegemony — could , at least in theory , arrive at some accommodation with those locals willing to knuckle down under occupation .
But if you interpret the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq as skirmishes in a broader struggle against an international death cult , any result short of extermination became tantamount to surrender : there is , as we have learned , no such thing as ' moderation ' in religion .
Hence Hitchens ' rejoinder to those who quailed at the bloodiness of the siege of Fallujah , which , according to non-government organisations , killed between 4,000 and 6,000 people , and destroyed 36,000 houses , 9,000 shops , 56 mosques and 60 schools .
' The death toll is not nearly high enough , ' he said .
' [ T] oo many [ jihadists ] have escaped . '
In 2003 , during the initial stages of the Iraq invasion , one of those pellets that Hitchens admires so much killed a 14 - year - old Iraqi boy named Arkan Daif .
Naturally , for the rest of world , Arkan 's demise did n't register amid all the other collateral damage in Iraq ( perhaps as many as a million excess deaths to date ) ; equally naturally , for his family , his death was all - consuming .
In his book Night Draws Near , Anthony Shadid describes how Arkan 's relatives turned , in their grief , to religion , with the traditional dictates of an Islamic funeral busying the family and providing a structure to cope with their anguish .
Since time immemorial , the loss of a child turns parents to the consolation of faith .
But in Iraq in 2003 Arkan 's death represented not a private tragedy but a particular manifestation of a generalised catastrophe .
Shadid explains :
The Muslim funeral rite was sadly routine in Iraq , but equally dignified and unhurried whenever it was performed .
During the bombing , in times so precarious , such traditions began to assume new meaning ; they were constants , filling time , busying and distracting relatives when their grief was greatest .
At once formal and intimate , like the Arabic language , the rituals brought consolation and solace as the world outside grew ever more threatening and unpredictable .
Under attack , with your house in ruins and your son casually slaughtered , it is not logic that you seek , for any rational assessment confirms that what 's happened can't be undone .
Now , as our New Atheists will bray , prayer really wo n't guarantee your family 's safety .
But with shock and awe raining down on the city , neither will anything much else — and , under such circumstances , miracles appeal precisely because they 're impossible .
Religion , says Marx , is the opium of the masses , a quotation that the New Atheists inevitably drag out , since it seems to confirm their approach .
They , of course , see God as a kind of spiritual chloroform .
For them , he 's a magician 's trick played on the weak - minded : that 's why , if you reveal the hidden trapdoor behind the theological stage , believers will simply melt away like an audience walking out on a bumbling conjurer .
But Marx 's argument was altogether different .
Here 's the notorious opium quote in context :
Religious suffering is , at one and the same time , the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering .
Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature , the heart of a heartless world , and the soul of soulless circumstances .
It is the opium of the people .
The passage expands and completes the metaphor .
As anyone who 's been to hospital knows , opiates are n't simply a source of befuddlement .
Whatever their side effects , they provide genuine relief from pain .
Accordingly , if you 're unhappy about a sick friend 's morphine habit , you begin by treating their underlying illness — you do n't simply snatch away their prescription .
If God does n't create us , then we create God — and we do so because something about how we live makes him seem indispensable .
Religion is n't overcome simply by demonstrating the intellectual fallacies that underpin it .
It 's overcome by changing the conditions under which God seems necessary : as Marx puts it , ' the struggle against religion is , therefore , indirectly the struggle against that world whose spiritual aroma is religion ' .
Insofar as religion is , in certain contexts , on the rise , it reflects , more than anything else , the failure of secular alternatives in the face of intolerable conditions .
That is what makes the self - satisfaction of the New Atheists so repulsive .
If , in Australia , happy clapping evangelists are making inroads among the youth , it 's not because the kids today are more stupid or gullible than their parents .
In fact , the Hillsong - style congregations tend to be entirely at home with technology , and the young men and women drawn to them have , via the wonders of the internet , more information at their fingertips than any other generation in the history of the human race .
Rather than smugly telling ourselves that the new religionists can't grasp our clever arguments , should we not consider another , less palatable , alternative : that they understand quite well what secular liberalism offers — and they do n't find it very attractive ?
To make the point another way , if , like Marx , we see religion as simultaneously an expression of alienation and a protest against it , where then does that leave the New Atheism ?
Do Hitchens and Harris and their ilk provide any kind of alternative to a lonely kid in the suburbs of Sydney ?
Or do they , with their Opera House lectures and their unholy enthusiasm for permanent war , counter the sigh of the oppressed only with the smug sneer of the oppressor ?
Respectable Australia in the 21st century considers all manner of things sacred .
But God , by and large , is not among them .
If you want to cause thoroughgoing offence , you might , for instance , try speaking up against the Israeli apartheid state and its Australian partisans , on the basis that a modicum of justice for the Palestinians would do more to counter Islamism than the umpteenth plonking repetition of atheistic arguments already old a century ago .
But that , of course , would be much less profitable than standing in the Opera House to tell the glitterati about how little you 're scared by the bogey man .

A man was charged with a felony Sunday for allegedly claiming that his sport utility vehicle was carjacked with a 6 - year - old asleep in the backseat , a story authorities say he told in hopes of expediting the return of his Lincoln Navigator .
The claim prompted an Amber Alert , and local police and the FBI spent several hours searching for the boy .
“ We were concerned about this child , ” said Houston homicide Sgt. M. Dillingham .
Darrell Dishon Jones , 35 , has been charged with filing a false report , a felony that could result in up to two years in state jail .
He allegedly claimed that a young cousin from New York named Kevin was in the back of his red 2000 Navigator when two armed Hispanic men forced him from the vehicle at a gas station in the 7700 block of Bellaire around 4:30 a.m. Sunday .
“ As the day went on , it was becoming clear this was a hoax , ” Dillingham said .
“ He made up a fairy tale to get his car back quicker .
There was a considerable amount of manpower put into this investigation . ”
Homicide officials launched an Amber Alert across several counties in Texas , fearing the child 's life might be in danger .
During hours of questioning , Jones was largely uncooperative , failing to show concern for the child and claiming he was unable to provide phone numbers of addresses for his family members , officials said .
“ He kept saying , ‘ Why is homicide involved ? ' ”

Atheist sentencing creates a new and dangerous blasphemy law
The sentencing of Harry Taylor to six months in prison ( suspended for two years ) for leaving anti-religious cartoons in an airport prayer room has been condemned by the National Secular Society as “ creating a new blasphemy law that will open the way for every religious extremist to persecute and prosecute their critics . ”
Terry Sanderson , President of the National Secular Society said : “ Regardless of the fact that this six month sentence has been suspended , it is still totally out of proportion for what Mr Taylor did .
Nobody can deny that he was being deliberately provocative in leaving these rather mild cartoons , cut from Private Eye , in the prayer room , but in the end he did n’t harm anybody and was simply making a point about the existence of such a facility .
The chaplain could quite easily have simply thrown the papers in the bin .
“ Instead , she claims to have been hurt and offended by this material , which makes her ultra sensitivity a dangerous thing indeed .
The professional ‘ offence takers ’ in religious communities will now feel that they have a strong new weapon to use against anyone who is critical or disapproving of them .
It is , in effect , a blasphemy law that covers all religions and is much more powerful than the one that was abolished only two years ago . ”
“ Religiously aggravated offences represent a new kind of blasphemy law , and the professional offence takers in religious communities wo n’t be slow to exploit this new avenue of restricting criticism and comment about their beliefs .
It is time for parliament to reconsider these provisions and remove them from the statute books . ”
Mr Sanderson said that Mr Taylor describes himself as a “ militant atheists ” who wanted to challenge the existence of the “ prayer room ” particularly as it was situated on John Lennon Airport in Liverpool – he maintained that John Lennon was an atheist and would not have approved of the presence of the prayer room .

The federal government is allowing online book seller Amazon.com to build a warehouse in Canada in return for the U.S. company 's promise to promote Canadian culture and to hire its first - ever Canadian employees .
The government said Monday it approved Amazon.com 's plan for a “ fulfilment centre ” warehouse after reviewing the proposal under the Investment Canada Act .
That law protects the bookselling business from foreign ownership because it is part of a cultural industry .
Canadian booksellers had opposed the warehouse proposal , saying it would harm the country 's cultural industry .
The review began in January after Amazon proposed to open its first warehouse on Canadian soil and aimed to determine if the investment would be a “ net benefit to Canada . ”
James Moore , the Minister of Canadian Heritage , said Amazon.com has shown its willingness to promote Canadian cultural products .
“ Our government is committed to strengthening Canada 's economy through all its sectors , especially arts and culture , ” Moore said in a statement .
“ Amazon has shown its willingness to promote Canadian cultural products , and we are pleased it is continuing to demonstrate this through this new investment . ”
Under the Investment Canada Act , foreign investment in book publishing and distribution has been limited to Canadian - controlled joint ventures .
The Canadian Booksellers Association has been vocal in its opposition to the warehouse , arguing it could set a precedent allowing “ American Goliaths ” to become a commanding presence in Canada .
But Amazon.com called the argument that a foreign owned retailer could n't be trusted to promote Canadian culture “ preposterous . ”
As part of the deal , Amazon will invest more than $ 20 million , including $ 1.5 million for cultural events and awards and for promoting Canadian - authored books abroad .
Amazon 's commitment also includes adding Canadian jobs , improving service for Canadian consumers , and increasing the visibility of Canadian and French - language products on its Canadian website .
Paul Misener , Amazon.com 's vice - president for global public policy , said the company believes a local fulfilment centre will enable it to better serve Canadian customers as well as those in other countries who seek out Canadian books and cultural products .
“ Amazon.ca ( the company 's Canadian web portal ) is enthusiastic to continue our long - time support of Canadian customers and culture , including continued support of cultural events and awards in Canada and the promotion of Canadian books internationally , ” he said .
The company will also establish dedicated staff to assist Canadian publishers and other suppliers of cultural products and make more Canadian content available on the Kindle e-reader .
In addition , it is creating a summer internship program for Canadian university and college students .

Canada had been the only country in which Amazon sells books online , but did not have a distribution centre .
Instead it used a third - party shipping service in Canada to get around the country 's foreign investment rules .
The government signalled in the throne speech last month that it is opening key sectors , including the satellite and telecommunications industries , to both venture capital and investment from outside the country , which could have implications for other industries .

Hate the Perl debugger ?
Want it to do more ?
I do .
For example , I hate it when I see this :

' => HASH ( 0x10088dfc0 ) ' this ' => ' them '
So I 've extended it to allow you to type xx $var :
DB < 2 > xx $ after { foo => [ 1 , 2 , 4 ] , guess => sub { my $x = shift @_ ; return $ x + 1 ; } , this => " that " , uno => { this => " that " , " what ? " => { this => " them " } } }
That 's the same data structure , but it 's much easier to read .
It 's build on top of Marcel Grünauer 's DB : : Pluggable , but I can't release it yet because we 've agreed that some of my work should be pushed back into the pluggable layer .
Later , I 'll make it more extensible , including changing serialisation options .
Android 2.2
Froyo in testing ; Google I / O release tipped
Google are tipped to be already testing the newest build of Android , “ Froyo ” 2.2 , on devices , with a release predicted to coincide with the Google I/O developer conference on May 19th .
Android and Me sifted through their visitor records and turned up numerous logs for Android 2.2. devices ; they also apparently heard from separate sources that Google are indeed trialling the updated software , prior to an OTA firmware update for the Nexus One .
Among the changes expected are multi-color trackball notifications , more available RAM to the user , and fixes that address persistent touchscreen glitches .
Froyo is also believed to allow more access to OpenGL ES 2.0 for developers , potentially permitting better gaming graphics , together with introducing the JIT compiler and perhaps even unlocking the Nexus One ’s rumored FM radio hardware .
While the Nexus One seems guaranteed to get Android 2.2 Froyo , there ’s also speculation that the Motorola DROID will receive the update at the same time ; that ’s based on the fact that Google will be giving out both Nexus One and DROID handsets to attendees of Google I/O .

You 've probably seen a Rube Goldberg machine in a science museum sometime , and watched with amusement while balls rolled down tracks or balloons inflated , triggering other mechanical events in a complicated chain reaction .
But we guarantee you 've never seen a Rube Goldberg machine quite like this .
When the rock band OK Go , justly famous for its treadmill dancing video , decided to make a new music video for its song " This Too Shall Pass , " the rockers tapped the artsy engineers at Syyn Labs to do something really special .
The result was this 4 - minute Rube Goldberg machine that plays part of the song , synchronizes with the beat , and involves the band members getting very messy .
It runs the length of a two - story warehouse , and the action was filmed in a single shot .
With no further ado , we give you :
The mother of all Rube Goldberg machines .
Update : Check out the newest OK
Go video , which warps time in many amusing ways .
It also features a charismatic goose .

I have spoken at length here about the insidiousness of derivatives and Credit Default Swaps .
So this new statistical reference frankly awed me .
It is from a Levy paper on the recent shift over the last 50 years to a shadow banking system , that has largely replaced bank balance sheet lending with Money Managers .
As I read this paper , while I am also reading ‘ This Time is Different – eight centuries of financial folly ’ , there is little to feel good about in the apparent economic rebound that the government keeps telling us about .
The data on derivatives is impressive .
JPMorgan Chase , for example , held derivatives worth 6,072 percent of its assets at the peak of the bubble in 2007 .
The other two giants , Citigroup and Bank of America , although still far behind Chase , had 2,022 percent and 2,486 percent respectively .
Goldman Sachs , the other giant , had an astonishing amount of derivatives on its balance sheets : 25,284 percent of assets in 2008 and 33,823 percent as of June 2009 .
Citigroup and BOA now have more of this risk on their books than before the crisis ( FDIC SDI database ) .
The part that awed me , is that BofA and Citi now have more derivative exposure than they did in 2007 !
Huh !
What is Timothy Geithner being paid for ?
I have to admit after TARP and the apparent hands on approach I like most assumed things were being fixed , but apparently not .
This simply adds to the point that despite all the histrionics and efforts in Washington , nothing has been learned and the American Banking system is now at least at as much risk now as in 2007 , pre crash .
Incidentally when trying to understand derivatives , simply assume off balance sheet debt .
There is all kind of rationale as to why that off balance sheet debt is not dollar for dollar , but the important point is that no - one argues that derivatives are worth zero .
There is an intrinsic liability that frankly few bankers can explain to you , so you must begin with the face value of the liability , and banks are guilty until proven innocent on that one .
As an accountant , the notion of off balance sheet debt is a contradiction in terms .
Is it a liability ?
If yes , it should be on the balance sheet .
Nato has admitted that its forces were responsible for the deaths of three women during a botched night - time raid in eastern Afghanistan in February .
It had already admitted killing two innocent men in the operation , saying they were shot dead when they came out of their homes carrying firearms .
Nato now says the women were killed by shots fired at the men .
Nato officials had previously suggested the women were killed by unknown assailants hours before the raid .
There was no immediate comment from the Afghan government .
Civilian deaths at the hands of foreign forces have been a source of increasing friction between it and Nato .
Some reports have suggested Nato soldiers tried to cover up the deaths of the women by removing bullets from the bodies .
' Protecting their families '
Nato initially denied involvement in the deaths of the women in the raid in the Gardez district of Paktia on 12 February , but now admits to having bungled the operation .
I want house searches to be stopped in Afghanistan
Afghan President Hamid Karzai
Mistrust imperils war on Taliban " While investigators could not conclusively determine how or when the women died , due to lack of forensic evidence , they concluded that the women were accidentally killed as a result of the joint force firing at the men , " a Nato statement said .
The statement said Nato officials would apologise and pay compensation to the family of those killed .
" We deeply regret the outcome of this operation , " said a Nato spokesman .
" The force went to the compound based on reliable information in search of a Taliban insurgent and believed that the two men posed a threat to their personal safety .
We now understand that the men killed were only trying to protect their families . "
One relative - whose two brothers , wife and sister were killed in the raid - said the family wanted the informant tried and put to death .
" Our demand is that this spy be executed in front of the people to ensure that such bad things do n't happen again , " he told the Associated Press news agency .
Karzai ' wants changes '
On Sunday , Afghan President Hamid Karzai called for an end to house searches by foreign troops .
Gen McChrystal ( left ) introduced new rules of engagement for Nato He was visiting the southern city of Kandahar with top US commander Gen Stanley McChrystal to win support for an anti-Taliban offensive there .
" When there 's an incident , he [ McChrystal ] comes and apologises , " Mr Karzai told tribal leaders in the city , the birthplace of the Taliban .
" There 've been changes in behaviour with the arrival of this new general , but we are still not convinced .
I want more changes , " Mr Karzai added .
Nato admits that its killing of civilians has undermined support for its mission in Afghanistan .
But it points out that far more people are killed in attacks by the Taliban and other militants .
United Nations figures show the number of civilians killed by foreign and Afghan forces fell by 25 % in 2009 compared with 2008 .
The UN says the vast majority of the 2,412 civilian deaths in 2009 were caused by militant attacks .
Gen McChrystal has introduced changes to Nato tactics aimed at cutting the risks to civilians .
Measures include reducing the number of air strikes and night raids .

5 Bilder Gestrandet auf dem Festland : Briten holen ihre Landsleute auf die Insel zurück
Alice Miller , a psychoanalyst who repositioned the family as a locus of dysfunction with her theory that parental power and punishment lay at the root of nearly all human problems , died at her home in Provence on April 14 .
She was 87 .
Her death was announced Friday by her German publisher , Suhrkamp Verlag .
Dr. Miller caused a sensation with the English publication in 1981 of her first book , “ The Drama of the Gifted Child . ”
Originally titled “ Prisoners of Childhood , ” it set forth , in three essays , a simple but harrowing proposition .
All children , she wrote , suffer trauma and permanent psychic scarring at the hands of parents , who enforce codes of conduct through psychological pressure or corporal punishment : slaps , spankings or , in extreme cases , sustained physical abuse and even torture .
Unable to admit the rage they feel toward their tormenters , Dr. Miller contended , these damaged children limp along through life , weighed down by depression and insecurity , and pass the abuse along to the next generation , in an unending cycle .
Some , in a pathetic effort to please their parents and serve their needs , distinguish themselves in the arts or professions .
The Stalins and the Hitlers , Dr. Miller later wrote , inflict their childhood traumas on millions .
“ The Drama of the Gifted Child ” struck a chord with mental health professionals .
“ Clinically , she is almost as influential as R.D. Laing , ” the British psychologist Oliver James told The Observer of London in 2005 .
“ Alice Miller changed the way people thought . ”
The real smoking gun behind ClimateGate
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet.com
Tuesday , November 24 , 2009
Although the majority of the attention around ClimateGate has focused on emails exchanged between CRU scientists , the real smoking gun proving deception and fraud can be found in the code of climate models which prove that temperature numbers were “ artificially adjusted ” to hide the decline in global warming since the 1960’s .
Attempts on behalf of the establishment media to characterize the scandal as “ rancor ” amongst scientists completely obfuscates the real issue , which is the fact that man-made climate change proponents gamed their data models to make them produce the results they wanted .
Not only do we have emails where CRU Director Dr. Phil Jones talks about pulling tricks in climate models to “ hide the decline ” of global temperatures , but within the code of these models we also find blatant evidence of manipulation .
“ People are talking about the emails being smoking guns but I find the remarks in the code and the code more of a smoking gun .
The code is so hacked around to give predetermined results that it shows the bias of the coder .
In other words make the code ignore inconvenient data to show what I want it to show .
The code after a quick scan is quite a mess .
Anyone with any pride would be to ashamed of to let it out public viewing , ” writes Steve Mcintyre .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
Mcintyre highlights the following programmer comments ( emphasis mine ) , which are inserted into climate models to indicate where data has been excluded .
Plots 24 yearly maps of calibrated ( PCR - infilled or not ) MXD reconstructions
; of growing season temperatures .
Uses “ corrected ” MXD – but should n’t usually
; plot past 1960 because these will be artificially adjusted to look closer to
; the real temperatures .
This shows that scientists “ artificially adjusted ” temperature data to hide the decline in temperatures after 1960 .
The graphs cited by global warming advocates to argue for continued man-made global warming in the modern era are therefore largely fraudulent .
This is not about “ rancor , ” “ debate ” or “ insults , ” as the media spin machine would frame it , this is about hardcore evidence of deliberate deception .
As Anthony Watts writes , “ You can claim an email you wrote years ago is n’t accurate saying it was “ taken out of context ” , but a programmer making notes in the code does so that he / she can document what the code is actually doing at that stage , so that anyone who looks at it later can figure out why this function does n’t plot past 1960 .
In this case , it is not allowing all of the temperature data to be plotted .
Growing season data ( summer months when the new tree rings are formed ) past 1960 is thrown out because “ these will be artificially adjusted to look closer to the real temperatures ” , which implies some post processing routine . ”
“ Spin that , spin it to the moon if you want .
I ’ll believe programmer notes over the word of somebody who stands to gain from suggesting there ’s nothing “ untowards ” about it . ”
“ Either the data tells the story of nature or it does not .
Data that has been “ artificially adjusted to look closer to the real temperatures ” is false data , yielding a false result . ”

“ There are only two hard things in Computer Science : cache invalidation and naming things . ”
— Phil Karlton
Over the past couple weeks I ’ve been working on a Django app to do automated caching and invalidation .
The basic usage follows like this :
Photo.objects.cache().filter( user=user , status=2 )
Anything I would say here would mostly be a repeat of the documentation I wrote , so you should just check it out for yourself :
http://github.com/dziegler/django-cachebot
Be sure read the caveats .
We ’re using this in production at mingle.com , but it ’s an early stage project so it ’s possible that there are edge cases that I ’ve missed .
That being said , since we ’re using it in production , I will try to fix any bugs as soon as I can .
If you ’re familiar with Django internals or feeling adventurous , feel free to take a look at the source and send me some feedback on how it could be improved .
Also , as a followup to Phil Karlton ’s second point , I was thinking of naming this Sir - Cache - a - Lot , but thought that would be too hard to import , so I went with django - cachebot .
Scarface , to say the least , is not a movie for children .
Between the guns , chainsaws , piles of cocaine and women who apparently look like tigers , it 's not material that you would generally share with elementary school children .
Unless you want to put it on as the school play , in which case I say be my guest .
A new video has popped up on Break and appears to be a school production of the Brian De Palma gangster film .
No , I do n't know where this was filmed or who actually allowed it to happen , but , really , why do you care ?
They are using popcorn instead of happy powder , stick figures for security cam footage and simple replacing the word " fuck " with " fudge " in all instances .
It 's hard to believe that this is actually real , but screw it .
It 's awesome .

Arrested Development fans : this is as close to New Warden as we 're ever going to get .
The average Microsoft Windows user has software from 22 vendors on her PC , and needs to install a new security update roughly every five days in order to use these programs safely , according to an insightful new study released this week .
The figures come from security research firm Secunia , which looked at data gathered from more than two million users of its free Personal Software Inspector tool .
The PSI is designed to alert users about outdated and insecure software that may be running on their machines , and it is an excellent application that I have recommended on several occasions .
Stefan Frei , Secunia ’s research analyst director , said the company found that about 50 percent of PSI users have more than 66 programs of installed .
“ Those programs come from more than 22 vendors , so as a first order estimate the number of different vendors you have on your box is the number of different update mechanisms you have to master , ” Frei said .
“ This is doomed to fail . ”
Secunia chief security officer Thomas Kristensen said his company is just a few months away from releasing a free , new tool that will automate the installation of software updates for dozens of commonly - installed third party programs .
Kristensen said the tool will allow users to exclude certain applications , in the event that they do n’t want to automatically update specific programs .
Such an application , if done right , broadly adopted , and not resisted by third - party software vendors , could well reduce the number of Windows users whose machines get trashed by drive - by downloads , as all of these malicious or hacked sites try to silently install malware by targeting security holes in third - party software , such as Flash and Adobe Reader .
If I seem excited about the availability of a free meta - patching tool , it ’s probably partly for selfish reasons .
Such a tool would almost certainly spell relief for anyone who is unlucky enough to be the appointed tech support guy for their family and friends , since fewer vulnerable applications means fewer compromised PCs , and hopefully less frequent pitiful pleas for help .

Being born the year Thatcher became Prime Minister of Britain , I ca n’t remember a time the Conservatives ( Torys ) were popular in Scotland .
To this day Thatcher is a dirty word up here , particularly where I live .
Frankie Boyle summed up the hatred for this Woman ( and party ) up here when he was talking about the issue of her getting a state funeral .
He said something along the lines of ‘ £ 3 million pound for a state funeral !
Why not just buy everyone a spade in Scotland .
We ’ll dig a hole so deep we can hand her over to Satan himself !’.
So I thought I ’d share some Tory billboards that have been vandalised .
The site where I found these pictures stated that they were from Scotland though there ’s a chance they were from around the UK .
Enjoy :)
A heap is a container supporting the insertion of elements and the extraction of the minimum element .

It has been proved correct using the Coq proof assistant .
An article in today ’s New York Times spins a speech given today by Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at the anniversary of the nation ’s revolution anniversary as a “ pugnacious ” declaration of “ capacity to make weapons - grade nuclear fuel , ” even though Ahmadinejad never made any such claims in the speech .
The article , entitled “ Iran Boasts of Capacity to Make Bomb Fuel , ” intersperses a handful of allegations about the Iranian nuclear program with a healthy dose of unrelated claims about protests elsewhere in Tehran today .
It centers itself around the translated quote “ please pay attention and understand that the people of Iran are brave enough that if it wants to build a bomb it will clearly announce it and build it and not be afraid of you . ”
However , it downplayed the rest of that sentence , which was “ but we have no intention of making a bomb . ”
It also glossed over the bulk of the speech ’s nuclear content , which was that they told the US and Russia they were ready to buy fuel for the Tehran research reactor , but a shortage of the fuel meant they only had 2 - 3 months to secure such fuel or would have to attempt to make it themselves .
An estimated 850,000 Iranians rely on the reactor ’s isotopes for nuclear medicine .
Iran announced their intention to begin 20 percent enrichment last weekend , and began doing so on Tuesday .
According to the IAEA , which is on - site , Iran has only converted a very small portion of its enrichment capacity to the production of 20 percent enriched uranium .
The rest remains configured at 3.5 percent , the amount needed for its nuclear power plant in Bushehr .
20 percent enriched uranium is useful only for civilian purposes , and though it is perfectly legal under the non-proliferation treaty Iran has repeatedly said it will abandon even this level of enrichment if they can find overseas supplies of fuel for the Tehran reactor .
The hypothetical production of a nuclear weapon would require Iran to enrich the uranium to above 90 percent , but IAEA inspectors have continued to verify that Iran is not diverting any of its uranium to non-civilian purposes and would be able to immediately confirm if Iran attempted to enrich any of its uranium above 20 percent .

Kai was outraged by the conviction of Dr Peter Watts , the Canadian science fiction writer who got out of his vehicle while crossing back into Canada to ask a US border guard why his car was being searched , and was clubbed , gassed , charged with a felony , and left in wet clothes in an unheated cell overnight during a snow - storm .
So Kai made this sign warning unwary travellers of what they might expect the next time they cross into Canada at Port Huron .

Two of US F1's trailers have been seized under a High Court order issued by a UK creditor and have been put up for sale on auction website eBay .
The American squad , granted an entry for 2010 , failed to make it to the grid this season and has already closed down .
Now two of the team 's trailers , bought from Brawn GP , have been put up for sale to the highest bidder .
" As a keen motorsport fan , it is certainly one of the more interesting seizures we 've made , " said David Carter , Director of The Sheriffs Office , responsible for enforcing the High Court writ .
" The trailers were recently bought from Brawn GP by the judgment debtor and really are something special .
We 've already has a lot of interest and are now selling them via eBay . "

To celebrate the Sydney International Food Festival , the flags of participating countries were recreated using popular local foods from each nation .
Picnic Day has its origins in the University Farm Picnic in the early half of the last century .
The University of California , Davis , will host the 101 edition of Picnic Day , its annual open house and oldest honored tradition , on Saturday , April 18 , 2015 .
Picnic Day has an expected attendance of 125,000 visitors and is believed to be the largest student - run event in the nation .
In 2007 –2008 an estimated 100,000 people attended and reports for the UC Davis Centennial ( 2008 –2009 ) place attendance anywhere between 125,000 and 150,000 .
Current and prospective students , alumni , staff , faculty , and people from everywhere are invited to attend this festive day that showcases the talents , achievements and history of the university .
With more than 150 free events throughout campus , Picnic Day provides fun and education for all ages .
Picnic
Days are documented at :
A double decker bus A tractor in the parade
Yet another tractor in the parade
Also see the Whole Earth Festival , another large campus festival .
Picnic
Day is the day every April when anybody who has ever lived in Davis or attended UC Davis comes back to town and wanders around Campus and Downtown .
There 's a giant parade in the morning and events and exhibitions all over the place .
The parade starts with words from the Chancellor and the Picnic Day parade marshals and then a terrific performance by the California Aggie Marching Band - Uh .
Three of the highlights of Picnic Day are the Doxie Derby , the Fashion Show , and the Battle of the Bands .
The battle of the bands always features both Band -uh and The marching lumberjacks .
Student bands and dance groups can be seen on any of the various stages .
The event tries to capture many things that are quintessentially Davis .
It is an agricultural showcase and open house for school organizations .
In 2004 there were two Battle of the Bands events , one being marching bands from all over California and the other being local rock bands ( this was called the Davis Rock Challenge ) .
The winner of the Davis Rock Challenge was Doug Douglas .
In 2005 the organizers of Picnic Day decided to reduce the amount of live music offered and not have the Davis Rock Challenge , but rather host a dance competition called the Davis Dance Revolution ( DDR ) .
DDR is open to all registered student organizations to enter and is co-hosted by Campus Unions , SPAC , and Picnic Day .
Many students love Picnic
Day because they wake up in the morning and start drinking .
Their love is shown in their drunken appearance wandering the streets and the massive amounts of garbage that line their party districts the next morning .
This has led to conflict with the community , including the Sterling Riot in which early Picnic Day celebrations turned violent .
Picnic Day Themes & Parade Marshals
As the campus ' premier event and oldest tradition , prominent members of the UC Davis Community are often honored for their contributions as Parade Marshals .
They typically get to ride int he Wells Fargo Wagon

Organization
Picnic Day is run by 16 students who form the Board of Directors .
Each director handles a separate area or event .
Picnic
Day planning for the next year begins shortly after the end of each year 's event .
Each director usually has 1 - 3 assistants who help in the planning and execution of Picnic Day each year .
Picnic
Day dates are chosen 7 - 8 years in advance .
The Picnic Day Chair is nominated by the ASUCD President and confirmed by the ASUCD Senate .
Other members of the board are hired at the sole discretion of the Chair .
The event is sponsored by the University and ASUCD , in fact ASUCD put $ 20,519 into the 2004 Picnic Day budget .
( Whole Earth Festival , another University event and ASUCD unit is not subsidized at all . )
Picnic
Day 's funds support communications ( radios & sound for stages ) , equipment , printing ( posters , flyers , schedule of events etc. ) , technical support ( web and sound equipment for stages & classrooms ) , hiring multi-cultural Entertainment / performers , the Multi-Cultural Children 's Faire , stage rental from another ASUCD unit , food and t- shirts for the volunteers , among many other things that must be paid for to bring Picnic Day to UC Davis .
The money helps Picnic Day remain free from being overly commercialized ( meaning where Picnic Day would be dependent on sponsorships or dependent on selling items to make money instead of focusing on being the university 's open house ) , and allows student organizations to fundraise through selling food and other items .
It is estimated that the University provides for nearly 75 % of the cost of running Picnic Day , with ASUCD contributing the remaining 25 % .
Picnic
Day although not as commercialized as Whole Earth Festival benefits from various community sponsorships .

2010 Cancellation Threat
On April 21 , the Sacramento Bee reported that campus and community leaders are considering canceling UC Davis ' annual Picnic Day due to the high number of arrests and mayhem during Picnic Day 2010 .
A Save Picnic Day - UC
Davis Students Facebook
Page was created and gaining upwards of 7,000 members since its creation , just when the canceling threat was reported .
There is another Facebook page for alumni .
There is also a petition going around asking the city council to pass an ordinance that would restrict the sale and serving of alcohol on picnic day .
White Family Day
Some people refer to Picnic Day as White Family Day , a play on the university 's Black Family Week / Black Family Day .
The phrase is meant to draw attention to some sort of racist undercurrent in Picnic Day .
References to this term have been found in Aggies The California Aggie as old as 1986 .
However 2005 's Picnic
Day featured a variety of cultures , including an all - black color guard / percussion squad , as well as the Jewish Student Union , which participates in Picnic Day every year and advocates diversity in culture .
Also , since Picnic Day 2002 , there has been a Multicultural Children 's Faire ( MCF ) held at Hart Hall where children can make crafts from all over the world .
Although it is unclear whether this refers to the mistaken perception that the word " Picnic " has racist overtones , most modern etymologists agree that the roots of the word do not .
The Picnic Day Board of Directors is a broad cross-section of the community .
In recent years some ethnic student groups or centers have refused to participate or attend , which may in itself create a self - fulfilling prophecy .
Nevertheless , today Picnic
Day is an event for the entire community and provides every opportunity for everyone to participate .
Is this really a suborg of ASUCD ?
I thought it was affiliated , but not entirely under the control of ASUCD as the head of this entry suggests .

It 's pretty much under the direction of ASUCD , but Student Affairs lends a lot of support to Picnic Day .
That 's why it 's called the " nation 's largest student run event " — BrentLaabs
Actually Picnic
Day is shared by SPAC & ASUCD , and ultimately falls under the supervision of Student Affairs .
The student board is supervised by a SPAC advisor .
When I worked for Picnic Day , our Chairwoman seemed to deal with ASUCD for some financial business , hiring personnel , and to fight over office space with other ASUCD units .
The majority of our support came from SPAC , Student Affairs , and various other departments including the Alumni Association and the Chancellor 's Office .
At the time Picnic Day was the unwanted step- child of the ASUCD Senate & Executive Office who completely missed the point of the open house concept and wanted to cut Picnic Day because it was n't " a money maker " .
This issue seems to come up in various forms every other year or so depending on the slate in power .
FYI - Picnic
Day is called the largest student run event in the nation because , as far was anyone knows , it is the largest student run one - day open house event in the U.S.
When it 's sunny Picnic Day attracts between 50,000 - 60,000 visitors to campus .
It 'd be kinda cool if someone could scientifically confirm both the " largest student run event " claim and estimate the number of visitors to the next event .
The City of Davis does not co-sponsor Picnic Day .
The city does n't contribute any money , people power , or help with the planning of the event .
Bob Bowen , the City Events Manager , is quite helpful but it is suspected that his motivation comes from his fondness for Picnic Day as a UC Davis Alumnus and Picnic Day Student Board Alumnus .
The city does n't do much other than allow the Parade to happen downtown and complaining about the mess and police problems .
The merchants of Davis who conduct business on Picnic are the big winners of the day .
StevenDaubert thinks that the coolest things about picnic day is the police dog show [ which I 'm pretty sure is now defunct cause the ARC is on the field that the show used to be on ] and the weiner dog races that take place in the rec hall
The copper doggers are still shown , they do them on the ultimate field behind the new tennis courts near the MU .

As someone who has served both in ASUCD and Picnic Day , it is frustrating when certain factions in ASUCD refuse to fund or increase funding for Picnic Day .
Sure there is a lot of drinking on campus , but Picnic Day is not merely a huge party .
It is the annual open house for the campus .
Alot of prospective students come to visit on Picnic Day and indeed more than a few decide to come because they get a good feel of the campus from Picnic Day .
Other than the CoHo , Unitrans and the commercial units , Picnic Day is the most efficient ASUCD event / program .
When you consider how much money other ASUCD units such as Entertainment Council or various programmatic commissions gets ( over $ 70,000 for EC ) and the number of people who attend those events they pale in comparison .
Picnic
Day only gets around $ 15 K - $ 20 K from ASUCD to put on a campus - wide event that more than 100,000 people attend .
That 's pretty good .
Also , for those who are very " socially - oriented " , Picnic Day is a great way to showcase the university and a great recruiting tool .
Additionally , considering that the event has jumped from 50,000 to 100,000 in a relatively short period of time and has resulted in a rising costs to put on the event , ASUCD funding for Picnic Day barely keeps up with the increase in inflation .
It is not for a lack of money .
Other units , which affect far less people have been created ( and sometimes disbanded ) or given larger budgets in a significantly short time in comparison to Picnic Day .
Although this certainly raises another issue that I do not wish to debate here , but just purely as an example Lobby Corp which was created in 2002 has gone from a budget of $ 6,000 to a budget of over $ 25,000 in just a few years .
In addition , ASUCD does not even pay for a majority of the cost and they are always talking about how they want everything student - run .
As you can tell , I am very passionate about this particular topic .
So I hope that ASUCD stops giving Picnic Day so much trash and recognizes the benefit of Picnic Day .
Picnic Day is THE oldest ASUCD unit and it will outlast everything else .
It is a solid event that deserves its fair share .

According to this and many other articles :
An end to Picnic Day in Davis — WesOne72
I myself do not drink , but if there is an ordinance limiting the sale of alcohol in Davis , what is stopping people from stocking up the week before or driving up to Costco and getting some ridiculous amount of booze ( after of course signing an agreement not to sell the booze ) .
People have gone great lengths and risked much to get drunk in the past , a little ordinance limiting sales probably would not stop people from getting drunk before noon .
At most , it might allow more minors to get some alcohol ( bars and stores will not sell to minors , but people do hand out booze pretty carelessly ) .
— hankim
Nothing .
I 'd bet that if there were an alcohol ban , people would either get it from out of town , or buy it in advance .
Such a ban might have no effect at all .
Or , it might help to distribute it from massive parties with hundreds of people to smaller , less wild parties .
There might be other options , such as the city 's noise ordinance , public endangerment , or any existing law that makes illegal behavior , well , illegal .
Do we know what the arrests on picnic day were actually for ?
Were the problems caused by alcohol , or were people just using it as an excuse to behave badly regardless ?
— IDoNotExist
Whether the problems were caused by alcohol or not , in my opinion a limit on the sale of alcohol would not solve the huge demand for law enforcement that was created this year .
My other problem with limiting sales is that people might move from less shady sources of alcohol to more shady sources which might create a rise in slightly more serious crimes .
— hankim
Well , part of that is clearly caused by the huge number of people around on picnic day .
I 'm not sure what you mean by a " shady " source of alcohol ?
— IDoNotExist A person who does not work in a bar or establishment who might have ulterior motives for offering alcohol .
— hankim
Those are always there ...
— IDoNotExist
But with an ordinance limiting sales by businesses , more people will move to those people .
Umm...OK .
so then you will have drunk people instead of drunk people .
But probably fewer drunk people .
What 's the problem ?
— IDoNotExist
I had similar thoughts to hankim .
I guess it depends on who really caused the problems .
Some people blame the out - of - towners , some blame students , some blame both .
An ordinance limiting the sale of alcohol in Davis would not stop the students from drinking ( for the reasons that Han gives ) , but it would stop the out - of - towners ( unless the fraternities and open parties supplied them ) .
As for downtown businesses , my impression is that the restaurants , bars , and hotels benefit from Picnic Day , but that other businesses suffer .
— CovertProfessor
Bistro33 was doing VERY well .
They had hundreds of people partying there .
On the other hand , the Farmers Market was almost deserted .
— IDoNotExist Was it ?
I got there a bit late .
It seemed a little quieter than usual , but all the tables were taken , my two favorite strawberry vendors were already sold out , and the popcorn line was longer than I felt like waiting on .
— cp I was there around 12 or 12:30 , when it is usually very crowded .
There was n't a line at places that usually have them .
Hardly anyone was on the grassy area .
— IDoNotExist
One thing that was mentioned by the owner of the bar I work at now was a similar option like the Davis Debit Card used not too long ago .
The city sets up a mandatory fee for legal drinking ( a portion of that fee to be divided amongst participating bars .
For this fee you recieve a wristband allowing you access to every bar in town .
No bracelet means no access to a bar for you .
This helps to limit the amount of drinking problems at bars , increases the capitol available to pay for increased law enforcement and makes it easy to see who is legit and who is not right off the bat .
Say they charge $ 30.00 per wristband , 20 - 30 % divided amongst participating bars , and assume we get another 75,000 people next year of which a good 50 % purchase the wristbands ( being a little leniant in that assumption and not overstepping though I would think there are more responsible people than this )
This would give the city $ 787,500.00 in additional funds to pay for the extra police / maintenance / clean - up required .
It also puts another $ 337,000 + back into the bars to make up for some of the losses they will take from not allowing non-wristband wearers into the bars .
It works for everyone economically and also seems to make it easier to recognize many of the problems faster .
On top of this , those who do cause difficulty at the bars they patron lose the wristband thanks to the due diligence of responsible bouncers .
— Wes - P
2011-04-17 21:37:33
Wes , that has too many flaws : if people pay $ 20 - 30 for a wristband , they 're not going to be compelled to tip their bartenders .
Bartenders will be working themselves to the bone ( many work 12 - 18 hour shifts on Picnic Day ) for practically minimum wage .
If the bartenders of Davis were looking at little - to - no tips on Picnic Day as a result of a wristband system , no one would be getting anywhere near the service they want .
It also encourages people to drink more because they 'll have absolutely no way of keeping track of what they 've " paid " for .
Credit card receipts or cash help many drinkers keep track .
Many students take cash with them to the bars and when they 're out , they 're out .
On top of that , some bars ( like Bernardo's ) have a specific draw while others ( like Bistro ) do massive amounts of business due to their size .
There would be no way to fairly distribute money between bars .
This also does nothing for the extra security hired by the bars to handle crowds .
Does a wristband entitle you to well drinks only , or does it include top shelf ?
How do you prevent people from sharing wrist bands ?
How do you fairly divide profits ?
How do you make sure that an underage student has n't stolen a wrist band ?
Far too many flaws , and that 's only what I could think of in the span of 2 minutes .

Just want to express my shock and sadness about the cancellation of Picnic Day 2020 .
To me it 's a magical event .
To me , this was ( is ) Davis , all of it .
I was there all the editions since 2012 .
But I guess the quite recent suspension of the Aggies Band - Uh was a bad omen hanging dark cloud already .
How can the Battle of the Bands ever be or feel the same ?
And after this year , if there will be a new edition , will it ever feel the same ?
I guess not .

Bacon and machine guns : these are the pillars on which the great US of A were built upon
Trust me , I got a B in college history without even blowjaying the professor ( GTA 's do n't count ) .
And finally , somebody has combined America 's love of firearms and fatty pork INTO A WAY TO COOK BACON .
I 've discovered a new way of cooking bacon .
All you need is : bacon , tin foil , some string , and .. oh whats it called ?... oh yeah , an old worn out 7.62 mm machinegun that is about to be discarded , and about 200 rounds of ammunition .
* sniff *
It 's enough to bring a tear to my eye .
Like a bald eagle shat in my face , but even more patriotic .
Hit the jump for pictures of the whole process .

The euro has risen against the dollar as Greece unveiled a new series of austerity measures to cut its debt .
The euro rose 0.6 % to $ 1.3698 , but was slightly lower against the pound at 90.70 pence .
On Tuesday , the currency fell to its lowest level against the dollar for 10 months amid continuing concerns over Greece 's debt crisis .
Persistent worries over Greece 's 300bn euro ( $ 419bn ; £ 259 bn ) debt have weighed on the European single currency .
The pound rose against the dollar , trading at $ 1.512 .
Protests
The Greek government approved an austerity package of tax rises and spending cuts worth 4.8bn euros , hoping to convince financial markets that it can pay off its debts and persuade European leaders it is doing enough .
The Greeks have three cards up their sleeve [ and ] behind the scenes they are playing them for all they are worth
Stephanie Flanders , BBC economics editor
Flanders : Advantage Greece Q&A : Greece 's economic woes Why Greece 's problems matter Greece has pledged to reduce its deficit from 12.7 % - more than four times eurozone rules - to 8.7 % during 2010 .
The measures include raising VAT to 21 % from the current rate of 19 % , and cutting civil servant bonus payments during holidays - which has annoyed union leaders .
But the austerity measures already proposed - such as freezing public sector pay , raising taxes and changing the pension system - have provoked huge street protests .
" The fiscal measures announced by Greece today should allow the government to ease the short - term pressure on its finances with a bond issue and may lead to firmer support from other countries , " said Ben May , European economist at Capital Economics .
Greece needs to sell bonds in the coming weeks .
It has to raise 20bn euros in order to pay off maturing debt in April and May .
Greece 's Prime Minister George Papandreou is due to visit German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Friday , in what could be a key meeting to decide what , if any , European assistance Greece receives .
He will visit France to meet President Nicolas Sarkozy soon afterwards .
European investigation
The European Commission announced that it intends to question banks and regulators over the role played by credit - default swaps in the Greek debt crisis , and how these financial instruments might be regulated in future .
Credit - default swaps are similar to insurance contracts , and allow banks and other institutions to buy financial protection against the risk that a borrower is unable to repay its debts .
However , the swaps have also been used by hedge funds to speculate against Greek debt , and make money if Greece 's standing in the markets deteriorates .
Despite the Commission 's concerns , the chairman of the Financial Services Authority , the UK 's financial watchdog , played down the importance of speculators .
Adair Turner said it is more important to keep the confidence of long - term buyers of Greek government bonds .
" It is important that even if we look at this issue we do n't overstate it , " added Mr Turner , who said that swaps speculators only comprised around 3 % to 4 % of outstanding Greek debt .
" A fundamental issue that can drive volatility on spreads on Greek bonds is a whole load of long investors not being willing to buy . "

Authentic Japan Airline outfits sell for as much as £ 11,000 on the black market .
They are in high demand for sex role play .
New Japan Airlines ( JAL ) uniforms have long been in demand in the local sex industry for customers keen on role - playing fantasies , while rare specimens that have actually been worn are hugely sought after by fetishists and are worth their weight in gold .
Countless shops will sell a very credible imitation for a few thousand yen , but the real thing can fetch a fortune .
Historically , says Yu Teramoto , the owner of a specialist costumier in the Akihabara district of Tokyo , real JAL outfits have been virtually impossible for buyers to lay their hands on .
However , the post - bankruptcy prospect of huge layoffs at JAL — especially among uniform - wearing air - crew — raises the prospect that former staff will attempt to sell their outfits for a profit .
" It is hard to say but it is at moments of confusion and anger like this that the black market for uniforms should do well , " he said .

Ferrari wagon - izations and hypercars bathed in magnetizing yellow are just a couple hints the Sultan of Brunei is perhaps the most Jalopnik head of state in the whole world .
Like us , he seems to have a maddening obsession with odd cars .
However , what sets him apart is his seemingly unending pot of money with which to manifest his wildest automotive fantasies .
Although word on the streets of Bandar Seri Begawan is his fiscal fortunes have depleted as of late , before he sold off some of his assets , he and his family created what may be the most impressive car collection the world has ever seen .
Although we already knew this , it was n't until we were surfing the pages of our fave super car photo site that we realized the sheer height of awesome the collection truly achieved .
Not only did they gather production cars , they commissioned the creation of entirely new models from manufacturers like Ferrari , Aston Martin , and Bentley .
Hit the jump as we walk you through the crème de ' le ' crème of the massive collection of automotive exotica found in the garage of the Sultan of Brunei .
Advertisement
Here 's a perfect example of the type of asks the Sultan would make to automakers .
The V8 Vantage of the '90s was an awesome piece of brutish British muscle .
In our mind , the only way to make it more badass was to add more doors , and it would appear the Sultan was of the same mindset as the Brunei royals ordered Aston Martin to convert some Virages to Lagonda - badged sedans and wagons .
Some were even converted to Vantage technical specification .
Advertisement
Done in - house by Aston Martin Works , the Aston Martin Special Series 1 was styled to look like the classic DB4 Zagato .
But while the old DB4 had to make do with an inline - six , the Series 1 rode on a V8 Vantage platform complete with twin - supercharged V8 power .
Because when you 've got the money to make it happen , you make it happen .
Where the Series 1 was pure retro , the Series 2 was the culmination of contemporary .
Striking a nice balance between elegant and aggressive , the Special Series 2 was also believed to be based on the V8 Vantage .
Sounds like a nice way to counter - balance the design of the Series 1 .
Or at least the Sultan seemed to think so .

The AM3 was the most non-traditional design of all the custom Astons .
Perhaps this was because it was bodied by Pininfarina in Italy .
The lights were given a smoked treatment to blend in with the black plastic front fascia .
And like all great contemporary designs , it still looks modern today .
Although the AM4 was much more conservative than the AM3 , it too was designed by the denizens of the clay workshops of Pininfarina .
Also on the V8 Vantage chassis , we think it looks something like a big DB7 .

Before the Porsche Cayenne or Cadillac Escalade , if you wanted an SUV with a stuck - up sense of over - built purpose , there was only the Range Rover .
Unless you were the Sultan , in which case you 'd commission Bentley to construct a batch of SUVs with a unique Bentley chassis and Range Rover 4WD systems .
At least they did n't ride on 24 " spinners .
Originally the Java was a concept to show what a Bentley based on a BMW 5 - series might look like .
Apparently the Brunei royals liked it enough they had Bentley build a convertible version of the show car .
The gleefully exorbitant brand - bastard madness did n't stop with the drop - top , as it appears he had some wagons built as well .
Though from what we understand they did n't actually use a BMW for these functioning examples of concept gone crazy .
Advertisement
We told you this guy loved wagons — and an extended - end Bentley is certainly an expensive way to show that love .
While we 're not too keen on the I 'm - Lovin ' - It McDonald 's themed interior on the jaundice - colored Bentley , we adore the styling on the silver one .
What 's better , if you believe the badges , these were equipped with four - wheel - drive .
Think of it as a Volvo wagon — except symbolizing the opposite of every ideal of the Swedish brand .
Back when all Bentleys were styled starting with Lego models , the Rapier was designed to be a modern and forward - thinking interpretation of the brand .
The flowing lines are still more sleek that the current lineup from Crewe .
Although now , the front view might cause people to initially confuse it for a Jaguar XF .
Advertisement
The BMW 850CSi was the best you could get from Bavaria , but that was n't good enough for the Sultan .
This version of the big coupe is tuned by Alpina and called the B12 .
In addition to those fancy stripes and vents , the car had a V12 pumping out about 350 HP .
Yes , that 's right , with a 16 - cylinder engine made from two V8s stuck together , the Cizeta - Moroder V16T was one of the most ambitious hypercar projects ever attempted .
The engine was mounted in a Fiero - like sideways fashion , instead of the longitudinal way you 'd expect in a Lamborghini .
Even the headlights were over - the - top , it had two flip - up lamps on each side .
Advertisement
Known as the Dauer 962 Le Mans , it 's an extremely limited edition street - version of Porsche 's dominant 962 race car .
It 's also said up to five of these once lived in the Brunei royal garage , but we 're told this yellow example was apparently the favorite .
At one time , they were arguably the fastest road cars in the world .
That is , if you actually consider them " road cars . "
The Ferrari 456 is arguably the most elegant car to come from Maranello in recent years .
That being said — why stop with mere elegance when you 're a Sultan .
No , a Sultan demands indulgence .
Which we 're assuming is why he built himself a four - door sedan and wagon version of the Italian stallion .
With a wave of his hand , he commissioned design - shop Pininfarina to build some super - sized versions .
We 're even told the Sultan reportedly had them set up shop on the royal grounds , just for this sort of special project .
Must have been why they tossed in that sexy drop - top 456 Spider at no extra cost .

The Ferrari F40 only came in red , right ?
Not if you 're the Sultan .
It 's ironic to see the most exciting car of its day in the most drab color imaginable , but we think it 's awesome .
Obviously , this was n't the only McLaren in the garage , but where else are you gonna find one in yellow ?
And we all know what yellow is good for .
We can see it now — the Sultan cruising — one chick magnetically sealed to each side due to the raw yellow magnetism of the McLaren .
Yeah , or else he had so many credit cards in his pockets , the stripes on the back actually became magnetized .
Whatever the reason , we 're assuming the man does n't need a yellow McLaren .
But we 're also assuming that was n't his reasoning behind the color either .

Essentially a re-bodied SL , the Argento Vivo design was originally a Honda concept car by the same name .
But what sets a Honda concept apart from a Mercedes is all about what 's under the hood .
In this case , an AMG 7.3 - liter V12 , the same engine used in the Pagani Zonda .

Yet another awesome wagon , the special S - class Touring model was designed just for the Sultan .
Of course , it never hurts to have some extra power to drag around all that extra cargo room , so AMG installed another one of their 7.3 - liter V12s under that pretty hood .
No , that 's not just a sheet - metal restoration .
It 's been restored by HWA , the people that made the CLK - GTR , and was given modern underpinnings from a ( then ) new S - class .
Style of the old , power of the new .
We like that combination .
The Sultan did n't just use HWA for the 600 above .
Like many tuning houses , the Sultan of cars had them take a swing at a few four - wheeled wonders .
Like the Mercedes above .
Sure , it looks just like a normal 300 SL , but it 's got a modern drivetrain .
That gives it plenty of " go " to match the gullwing " show . "

Ok , so this was n't actually called " The Panty Dropper " or " The Shaggin Wagon " but it might as well have been .
Why else would you have a yellow Mercedes Sprinter with a red interior ?
We 're wondering if those seats fold down conversion van -style .
What happens in Brunei , stays in Brunei , right ?
What could be better than the Rambo - Lambo ?
How about a wagon version ?
Just looking at this thing pumps enough testosterone into our system to make us want to go on a Lion - hunting expedition .
In the middle of a war zone .
Think Jaguar 's XJ220 is just too ugly ?
Of course not .
So why would you have one re-styled by Pininfarina ?
Because you can , and because the end result looks absolutely fantastic .

Nowadays , it 's common to see stretched Escalades and Navaigators , but this Range Rover was stretched long before big SUVs were played out .
We wonder how it'd do off - road ?
Our bet is we 'd find out right about the first time we tried to scale a rock taller than a foot .
Styled by Bertone , this one - off Roller dubbed the Majestic is distinct enough to be noticed by those in the know , but subtle enough to be overlooked by most everyone else .
Much less vulgar than say , a current Phantom .

What collection would be complete without a basic stretched Rolls - Royce ?
We 're sure the Sultan had plenty of limos like these , but something about this Roller just gives it the quintessential " rich guy " flavor .

Matt MacKellar examines two points in the Chicago housing spectrum , and makes the case for community support against the current eviction proceedings against Carol Vialdores and her family .
Now , I knew I had a good housing situation , but I did n’t know quite how good until I met Carol Vialdores .
We both live in apartments on the north side of Chicago , but my building is owned and run by a personal friend of mine ; her federally - subsidized apartment is owned by a corporation — Northpoint — which is in turn owned by an even larger corporation — Aimco .
When a maintenance issue arises in my apartment or building , the landlord usually fixes it that day .
Recently , when the woman who lives upstairs from me ( and has two small children ) had her water heater break , our landlord took the next day off from his day job in order to replace it so that she could get on with raising her family .
When Carol submits a work order for something in her building or apartment , it is ignored and she is treated with hostility and suspicion by management .
My rent — which is below market - price , I might add — goes to support my landlord ’s father in his assisted living home , his father having owned and run my building for most of his adult life .
Carol ’s rent — both what she pays and what comes from public money and together adds up to market - price for her unit — goes to support a corporate bureaucracy ( including the three lawyers who are being paid to try to evict her ) and to pad the bottom line of a nation - wide corporation .
Thus , financial officers in distant cities try to squeeze every penny of profit they can out of Carol ( including by ignoring work orders and / or trying to intimidate residents into fixing things with their own money ) , while my landlord — who lives across the hallway from me and whom I see every day — tries to provide both a decent place for tenants to live and sufficient funds to support his father .
When the father of Carol ’s children comes over to visit and help out with the children , management makes wild accusations that he ’s living there while not being on the lease .
My landlord greets my child by name and gave her a little stuffed animal when we moved in .
When Carol began to help organize her fellow tenants who are facing similar mistreatment , Northpoint made unsubstantiated accusations that she was “ verbally abusive ” towards a member of management and began eviction proceedings ( this despite the fact that she ’s lived there for 16 years , paying rent and becoming a pillar of the community ) .
My landlord talked with me about concerns and issues regarding our building over a beer as we watched the Superbowl together .
Now , I know my situation is unusually good and Carol ’s is ( somewhat ) unusually bad , but I think these two extremes can illustrate another contrast : that between housing as a right and a relationship versus housing as a commodity .
You see , my landlord recognizes the inherent good in people having decent housing , and he provides that for me and three other families through a personal relationship of integrity .
The corporation that owns Carol ’s apartment sees housing as just another way to make money , and thus they squeeze her for every bit of profit they can get and just cast her aside as one more row on a spreadsheet when she begins to make “ trouble ” ( as in asking them to spend money on repairs and organizing others to resist their mistreatment ) .
And this raises one of a whole set of other issues that could be addressed : Northpoint / Aimco does n’t know Carol as a person ( and does n’t care to ) , particularly as a person trying her best to raise her five children and be an anchoring influence in her community .
Having a stable home and being able to stay in their community and school is but the first thing that goes into raising a healthy family , and yet this is threatened by Northpoint / Aimco ’s arbitrary use of power in pursuit of profit only .
Further , when the children ’s father is involved in their lives , the management tries to use this against Carol , again undercutting her familial well - being .
I surely do n’t have anyone looking over my shoulder or making accusations if I visit my child when she happens to be at her mother ’s home !
Finally , part of Northpoint / Aimco ’s profit comes from federal money — public money designated to help people out with housing .
But they are using that money to pay fancy lawyers instead of fix broken security doors or backed up sewers .
And while they are happy to take your money paid in taxes , they are not accountable to you and exercise their power arbitrarily .
And the coup de grace is that if Northpoint / Aimco is successful in getting Carol evicted , she will then become ineligible for subsidized housing in the future .
Given her current circumstances , this almost certainly means that she and her children will be homeless .
But it seems an outrage that a private , for - profit company that is not accountable to the public and has no claim to neutrality or objectivity in this case can get someone permanently banned from eligibility for public help with housing !!
To my mind , that is analogous to a bank with whom you have a dispute being able to disqualify you from your Social Security benefits !
But these outrages will not be allowed to stand .
Carol is a strong woman who is standing up for herself and her family , and she is fighting this while continuing to help organize her fellow tenants .
Also , many supporters , activists , and friends of Carol are standing with her and demanding that she be able to be housed with dignity , fairness , and safety rather than intimidation , disrepair , and eviction .
And you can help !
First , sign the online petition at ( citizenspeak.org/node/2010 ) .
Every one of these that are signed will go directly to Ed Hinsberger , a local director of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD — the folks who disburse the federal money to Northpoint / Aimco ) and to Shaun Donovan , the federal director of HUD .
Sign it and share it with your friends and family .
Second , if you live in the Chicago area , you can help us petition out on the streets and raise awareness of Carol ’s situation .
To find out more information about these actions , either contact us through this website , or — if you ’re on Facebook — look for the “ Support Northpoint Tenants ” group , where we regularly place updates about actions in this ongoing and rapidly developing campaign .
Lastly , come join us down in the Loop on Monday , May 3 , at 11 am at 77 W Jackson St. This is the Chicago headquarters of HUD , and we will be there protesting the unfair eviction of Carol and her family , as well as calling attention to issues of eviction more generally and the abuses of Northpoint / Aimco specifically .
We are also striving to get as much press coverage of this event as possible in order to shame HUD and Northpoint / Aimco into doing the right thing !
Carol goes to court on Thursday , May 6 , so we have but a little time to make this happen — but we will !
We have successfully fought the unfair eviction of another Northpoint resident six months ago .
Carol too has a right to be treated as a person and not a number or a problem , to have her housing be a fair relationship rather than an power play in pursuit of profit , and to provide a stable home for her family rather than facing eviction and homelessness !

( CNN ) -- A Mississippi lesbian Tuesday won a judge 's backing for her contention that her First Amendment rights were violated when her high school refused to allow her to attend her prom with her girlfriend .
But U.S. District Judge Glen H. Davidson refused to order the Itawamba County School District in Fulton , Mississippi , to hold the dance it had canceled over the matter .
In his 12 - page order , Davidson also ruled that Itawamba Agricultural High School 's denial of 18 - year - old Constance McMillen 's request to wear a tuxedo to her prom was a violation of her rights .
" The record shows Constance has been openly gay since eighth grade and she intended to communicate a message by wearing a tuxedo and to express her identity through attending prom with a same - sex date , " Davidson wrote .
" The court finds this expression and communication of her viewpoint is the type of speech that falls squarely within the purview of the First Amendment . "
When school officials told McMillen she could neither take her girlfriend to the prom nor wear a tuxedo to the event , the senior went to the American Civil Liberties Union , which demanded the school change its policy .
In response , the school district canceled the prom altogether .
Davidson denied a motion for an injunction filed by McMillen against the school district 's superintendent , the school 's principal and its assistant principal asking the court to order that the April 2 prom be reinstated , saying that parents were planning a private event to be held on that date for all students , including McMillen .
Requiring school officials " to step back into a sponsorship role at this late date would only confuse and confound the community on the issue , " he said .
Read the judge 's opinion ( PDF )
Both sides in the dispute were happy with the outcome .
" It vindicates Constance 's rights , " said Christine Sun , senior counsel with the ACLU 's lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender project .
" It sets a legal precedent for gay and lesbian students all over the country that they have the right to bring a same - sex date to the prom and also to wear gender - nonconforming clothes to the prom .
We were looking for a ruling that what the school did was violate her rights , " Sun said .
School board attorney Michele Floyd said the school district was also pleased with the decision .
She said the parent - sponsored event , which may be called a ball instead of a prom , is to be held in Tupelo , 19 miles away .
But ACLU 's Sun said McMillen had not received an invitation .
" We have n't heard anything about this private prom other than what this school district has told us , " she said .
" It remains to be seen whether she will be able to attend the private prom . "
McMillen 's case is going forward on a damages claim and the ACLU 's request for attorneys ' fees , she said .
" She got what she wanted , and now it 's just a question of what the damages might be in her case . "
" I never thought the school would try to cancel the prom and hurt everyone just to keep me and my girlfriend from going together , " McMillen said last week in an ACLU news release .
" A lot of people have made really generous offers to pay for a prom somewhere else , which I really appreciate .
But all I 've ever wanted was to be able to just go to my own school 's prom with my girlfriend . "
At the center of the lawsuit is a February 5 memorandum from the school to students that said prom dates must be of the opposite sex .
Superintendent Teresa McNeece also told McMillen that she and her girlfriend could be ejected from the prom if other students complained about their presence , according to the documents .
MONTREAL - Bloc Quebecois Leader Gilles
Duceppe says the days are long gone when Canada could offer a deal like the Meech Lake accord to keep Quebec from becoming sovereign .
Duceppe says in an interview with The Canadian Press that Quebec would n't be satisfied with being recognized as a distinct society now because it's a distinct nation .
The Bloc leader will be taking the pulse of Canadians on the idea of sovereignty during a cross-country tour during the next two weeks .
He says it 's important because independence is inevitable .
Duceppe says he has always been given a good reception in the rest of the country and he 's interested in knowing what people have to say .
Meech Lake , which was proposed by the government of then - prime minister Brian Mulroney in the late 1980s before it officially died in 1990 , would have given Quebec the status of a distinct society .
Duceppe says even though the issue of Quebec sovereignty is on the back burner in the province , support for the option always hovers at around 40 per cent .

A FEW weeks ago , two Republican House members asked Ben Bernanke , the chairman of the Federal Reserve , whether the Fed knew  before Lehman ’s bankruptcy examiner revealed it  about the bookkeeping scam at Lehman known as “ Repo 105 . ”
This scam allowed Lehman to disguise how much debt it was carrying , right up until it collapsed .
Lehman got new loans to pay off old loans , pretended the new loans were “ sales , ” and through a complicated series of steps made both the old and new loans disappear just in time for its quarterly reports .
Mr. Bernanke said the Fed had known nothing about this .
After all , he explained , the Fed was n’t Lehman ’s regulator  the Securities and Exchange Commission was .
The Fed had placed some people at Lehman  not as many as the S.E.C. had  but they were there only to ensure that Lehman paid back money it was borrowing from the government .
Ca n’t lay this on him .
Meanwhile , the S.E.C. insists that it could not have known what Lehman was up to because it was “ understaffed ” and “ ill - suited ” to run a voluntary oversight program .
But , the commission says , since the Lehman bankruptcy examiner ’s report it has sprung into action , investigating whether other banks might also have cooked the books .
Any minute now , expect to hear that the Treasury , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  our other federal bank regulators  were just as shocked that Lehman used make - believe sales to hide its ocean of red ink .

Raider uses movie - style mask to disguise himself
As a gambit , it could have come straight out of a movie such as Mission : Impossible .
A white bank robber fooled police by carrying out a string of raids wearing a Hollywood - style rubber special effects mask and gloves that made him look like a black man .
Conrad Zdzierak , 30 , targeted four banks and a chemist within the space of three hours by slipping in and out of the sophisticated disguise .
Disguise : Police claim Conrad Zdierak , left , wore an African - America full face ' Hollywood ' mask , right , to carry out six robberies in Ohio
The mask was so professional that police released security video footage from one of the banks with an urgent appeal for information from anyone who recognised the apparently black suspect .
Zdzierak was even arrested after one of the raids and charged with carrying a concealed weapon - but he was freed on bail because officers had no reason to think he was anything to do with the sudden spate of robberies in the area .
Cashiers held up in Ohio said they did not have a clue they were being duped because the mask covered Zdzierak 's neck and even showed hair on a black chest .
Fooled : CCTV footage of Zdzierak allegedly wearing the mask while carrying out a bank robbery
He also used life - like gloves to cover his hands and forearms .
Zdzierak carried out six audacious raids in total , five of them on the same day , April 9 .
Camouflage :
The special effects mask costs about £ 450
Local TV stations nicknamed him the ' hairless bandit ' because he appeared to be bald and clean - shaven .
The silicon disguise , advertised in fancy dress costume shops as ' The Player ' , cost £ 450 .
It was only when police spotted a Volvo parked outside a motel with its interior splattered with tell - tale red dye from a bag planted in the stolen money that they learned the truth .
Officers fired at Zdzierak 's pitbull when it attacked them as they broke into his motel room in Springdale , Ohio , on Wednesday .
They then found him hiding in the toilet .
On the bed they found the mask , clothing worn in the robberies and money with serial numbers matching the stolen cash .
Lieutenant Michael Mathis , of Springdale Police , said he believed Zdzierak took off the mask as soon as he carried out one robbery , driving to his next target as a white man before putting his disguise back on to pose as a black man again .
Zdzierak is now being held on six counts of aggravated robbery .
How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bubble Don't Fight the Fed
I keep reading the words of doom and gloomers , sitting in their gold - lined Wall Street caves , pointing fingers at the mongers of debt and the godheads of big government .
They preach " fiscal responsibility " from the corner office .
They cry " moral hazard " from the elderberry bushes .
They point to Greece and stammer , red - faced and mouth agape , " That will be us ... "
The Last Great Bubble
Of course , these market prophets are entirely correct .
And in time , they will have their due .
The only problem is that there will be a massive bubble between now and that time — and you'd be foolish not to participate .
There is an old Wall Street platitude that goes " Do n't fight the Fed . "
It is good advice .
And right now , the Federal Reserve has its foot on the gas pedal and its hand on the nitrous tank .
The recent minutes from the March 16 Fed meeting were released yesterday .
They stated that most board members think that rates should be kept low " for an extended period . "
The Fed is more worried about deflation than inflation ...
Even the Dallas Fed President , Richard Fisher — who is known as an inflation hawk — thinks there is far too much under - capacity in manufacturing and slack in the system due to unemployment .
" Because of the enormous slack in the system , and as you know I tend to be very vigilant about inflation , we 're just not seeing price pressures right now .
If anything , the tail risks are on the deflationary side , " Fisher says .
When Fisher looks at big picture , acknowledges that we have $ 99 trillion in unfunded liabilities as a country , and says deflation is the problem ... well then , strange things are afoot at the Circle K .
Bubbles Though Time
Most of you are old enough to remember the late 1990s .
In 1998 we had a global currency crisis that threatened to bring down the economy .
That , coupled with a fear of the Y2 K computer glitch , induced then Fed Chief Alan Greenspan to inject a mere $ 50 billion into the economy .
This spurned on what seemed like a massive bubble at the time .
Companies like Amazon , Yahoo ! , Oracle , and Internet Capital Group went up 10 % a day — every day — for weeks .
The NASDAQ 100 doubled in less than a year .
Stupid companies whose sole product was advertising puppets went up 500 % through sheer speculation .
The trend was your friend .
Teenagers and chat - room umpires became multi-millionaires .
It was lots of fun until it was n't .
The now knighted Sir Alan Greenspan tried to reign in the bubble by hiking rates .
It worked .
There was a dot - com crash .
But not to worry ...
Two years later , in the aftermath of the attacks of 9/11 , Greenspan stepped on the gas again and cut the Fed Funds rate down from 6.25 % in 2001 to 1.5 % in 2004 .
This created the second bubble , this time in housing and commodities .
Housing prices went up 200 % or more .
In Canton , a yuppie part of Baltimore , two - bedroom rowhomes went from $ 50 k to $ 300 k in less than five years .
McMansions sprouted in cornfields , everyone bought a Subzero , and former bartenders opened mortgage companies and got silly rich .
The Fed tried jacking interest rates back above 4.5 % .
And indeed that hike slowed the economy down ; it worked much like the wall at Daytona .
And now we are on to round three .
According to the Fed itself , interest rates are at 0.25 % for the foreseeable future :
Not only are rates low , but a couple of trillion in extra TARP and Stimulus I , and Stimulus II , and health care , and car buyers , and home buyers , and , and , and ...
All of this feeds the market .
Moral hazard or not , it 's how the game is played .
You should accept it .
Heck , George Soros did ... and went on to make $ 3.3 billion betting on bailed out banks in 2009 .
John Paulson made $ 2.4 billion with the same strategy .
David Tepper made $ 4 billion from AIG last year alone .
But bubbles are n't just for the Big Boys .
Anyone can play .
My readers have done rather well themselves .
Just last week , I recommended a company that makes high priced jeans in Crisis and Opportunity .
It is up 30 % since I wrote the article .
Some of my readers told me that they made 251 % in five weeks on a biotech recommendation ...
An oil explorer is up 106 % in two months ...
A drug maker is up 43 % and climbing ...
Welcome to Bubble 3.0 .
These are the days of easy money .
Do n't be that guy who remains skeptical and buys at the top .
Even Greenspan 's first $ 50 billion bubble lasted for more than two years .
The housing bubble lasted for five .
But this is the mother of all bubbles , and it is just getting started ...
You will be paying for the subsequent crash ... so you might as well get in on the easy money while it lasts .
Sincerely ,
Christian DeHaemer

The US manufacturing sector expanded in March at its fastest rate for six years , a report has said .
The Institute for Supply Management 's ( ISM's ) purchasing managers index rose to 59.6 points last month , up from 56.5 in February .
A figure of 50 or above represents growth , and March was the eighth month in succession that US manufacturers have increased their output .
It comes after China and European nations also saw higher factory output .
UK manufacturing activity grew at its fastest for 15 years in March , according to a survey by Markit and the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply .
Elsewhere , growth in Germany 's manufacturing sector last month was the strongest for almost 10 years , while France 's expansion was the best since November 2006 .
Improving economy
The ISM 's latest monthly figure for the US was better than market expectations of 57 , and comes as the wider economy is continuing to recover from recession .
The institute said growth was strongest among clothing manufacturers .
Recent official US economic data showed that consumer spending rose in February , but at its slowest rate since September last year .
Meanwhile , the overall economy grew at an annualised rate of 5.6 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 , the Commerce Department said last week , slower than the previous estimate of 5.9 % .

Perth - based ISP refutes AFACT 's claims the ISP industry is unwilling to negotiate with content providers
Perth - based ISP , iiNet , has fired back at the Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ’s ( AFACT ) claims that ISPs wo n’t talk with copyright holders over how to distribute content legally online .
The comments were made by the anti-piracy group ’s executive director , Adrianne Pecotic , to Australian IT in which she claimed ISPs are refusing to negotiate for a voluntary code of conduct urged by the Federal Government .
Pecotic was calling the Government to follow in the footsteps of Britain and France by enforcing tougher laws to combat move and TV piracy .
iiNet has blasted back , stating ISPs have always been open to discussion with content holders .
“ The Internet industry and copyright holders had been in detailed discussions for a number of years before AFACT and [ Pecotic ] , called off negotiations in August 2007 to commence their unsuccessful legal proceedings against iiNet in the Federal Court , ” the ISP said in a statement .
iiNet was accused of authorising movie piracy of its users by AFACT but the Court awarded victory to the ISP .
The case is being appealed .
AFACT could not be contacted at the time of publication .
If you want to know why this is happening now , that 's why .
The franchise has not played a meaningful game since 2002 .
I guess I should say won a meaningful game , since I 'm ignoring the catastrophic collapses of 2003 and 2006 .
But it always seems a little weird to me to refer to a past team 's performance when we 're not talking about the same line - up , or even management .
It 's just the Kings logo that did those things .
This Kings team has never played a game that made any difference to anybody , other than the possibility that they might upset someone else 's playoff chances , or increase their own draft position .
But none that are meaningful in the sense that playoffs are meaningful , or a playoff race is meaningful .
Frolov , Brown , Kopitar , Quick , Doughty , Simmonds , Parse , Clune , Harrold , Johnson , Drewiske , Quick and Ersberg have never been to the playoffs .
Only Frolov and Brown were here in ' 06 , for that great tent - folding .
Frolov was a rookie for the '03 reverse - classic .
No one from management was around for those .
They 've have success for other organizations , but for this management team , with these players , this is all new territory .
Silver Lining ?
If there 's a silver lining in the way the last several games have gone , it 's this : the Kings have an opportunity to learn how to win games that matter , in an environment that is something less than all - or - nothing .
They really only need five points out of their last seven games .
That 's how many points they 've earned from the previous seven , and they sucked .
So this is doable .
But to do it , they 're going to have to un - hex themselves from the spell that says , " hey , you do n't belong here ; you suck and everyone is about to figure that out , and they will point and laugh . "
There are different versions of it .
There 's the " everyone 's going to figure out I 'm too old " or " figure out I can't repeat what I did in ' 05 , " or " figure out that I 'm not really a great leader , " or " figure out I 'm not Jagr , " or " franchise goalie . "
Etc. Etc. Imposter Syndrome .
But that 's why we have veterans , right ?
To counter - act such effects .
Smyth , Stoll and Greene went to the finals four years ago .
Williams went the same year with the team that won .
Modin got his name on the cup in '05 .
SOD in '07 .
Scuderi in '09 .
Richardson played nine playoff games for the Avs , four years ago .
Halpern has about 25 playoff games under his belt .
Jones , probably has a few games , too , but I 'm too lazy to look it up .
And there 's also Terry Murray , who is 20th all - time in wins and 24th in playoff wins .
So he knows something about it .
( p.s. note to all the people calling for Terry Murray to be fired : hahaha .
Murray was on the short - list for Coach of the Year until the last five games .
The Kings have 90 points .
The Kings are likely to be going to the playoffs for the first time in eight years .
Etc. , etc.. )
So I have to believe that the Kings know what the plot is and know what they have to do .
I hope they 're not just babbling about " intensity " and " desperation " or whatever other boilerplate cliches that I think just confuse things .
Look , basically , the Kings are having a group panic attack .
It does not help a person having a panic attack to tell him he needs to be more desperate or intense .
And they do n't need false confidence , either .
What they need is trust .
That sounds stupid , does n't it ?
Trust in what ?
THE SYSTEM .
They need to stop thinking and redouble their efforts to play the system .
Because they do n't have to worry about anything else when they do that .
They do n't have to decide whether or not they deserve to be here , whether everyone 's going to figure out they are no good with one foot in the KHL or Switzerland .
They do n't have to do anything big .
They just have to do several very specific little things with every ounce of guts and ability they can muster .
*****
A couple of days ago , I said somewhere in the comments that I thought Lombardi should bring up Moller , scratch Halpern , and give Quick half the remaining games to show he 's back on track , after which , if he 's not , bring up Bernier and ride him .
I still think they should bring up Moller .
I believe he can use even the paltry five minutes a game to inspire his teammates with his willingness to gnaw at the ankles of giants .
I do n't know what Halpern is doing , but it 's not helping .
As for Bernier , I expect he 'll play the next two games and if he wins those he will keep getting starts .
I do n't think there 's anything wrong with Quick .
I just rewatched the goals from last night .
Not his fault .
Even if they were , he 's exhausted ( see new baby ) , and I 'm pretty sure everyone knows that Murray would have played Ersberg more if he had n't been so iffy this season .
The blame for this little crap - out goes to the Brown / Kopitar disappearing act .
They 're freaking themselves out .
And that 's freaking everyone else out .
If you look at all our losses this season ( and last season ) , the common denominator is that in most of them those two players were shut down .
Teams know this and key on them .
Would n't you ?
The last thing to keep in mind is this : randomness .
Hockey games are affected by randomness more than other sports .
You 're going to lose some games .
Slumps happen .
And it 's up to the team 's leaders to shake it off .
That 's how you turn things around .
One year after a controversial moratorium on new bars on the street was passed , much on Ossington Ave. has seemed frozen in time , with no new eateries and few new shops .
Other than the growth in gallery space , that is .
More than ever , the Ossington art hub is alive and vibrant .
Jamie Angell 's Angell Gallery relocated to the foot of Ossington from 890 Queen St. W. , moving from 700 square feet to a cavernous 4,000 .
With its grand central space and satellite wings , it is n't hard to imagine Angell as a bustling bistro .
Instead , it 's now one of the bright lights of a booming creative nexus .
Further north on the strip , Meta Gallery is busily renovating their new space – formerly the eclectic art , market , concert , and event venue Rolly 's Garage – for their grand opening on April 2 .
The most impressive newcomer to the neighbourhood , the Artscape Shaw Street Centre , will add a mind - blowing 75,000 square feet of dedicated gallery and working space for artists to the area when it opens in 2012 .
A repurposing of the beautiful century - old Shaw Street School , which had been shuttered for a decade before Artscape bought it in January , the centre will be the largest project to date for the not - for - profit urban development organization behind the Wychwood Barns art community in the St. Clair and Christie neighbourhood .
Artscape 's request for expressions of interest from artists – due Thursday – is helping them envision how the space will be used .
The prospect of all that room , however it 's used , seems likely to lure more artists and arts businesses to the area .
" Galleries could be a part of it , " says Liz Kohn , director of communications for Artscape .
" Also , music or performance or theatre .
The options are endless , really . "
The bar moratorium , put in place by ward councillor and now mayoral candidate Joe Pantalone , had split residents – who complained about late - night noise – and business owners , who said the ban penalized people who wanted to open daytime restaurants and bakeries .
Council since replaced that ban with more permanent rules : new bars , cafes , restaurants , bakeries and takeout places are limited to the ground floor and 175 square metres ( 1,800 square feet ) .
Fears voiced by locals that the strip would wither under the restrictions , however , do n't seem to have materialized – for galleries , in any case .
" It 's like a village between Dundas and Queen , " says Angell , whose gallery has its official launch April 3 .
" I personally think it is easier for galleries to grow on Ossington . "
Angell more than quadrupled his floor space by moving to Ossington while only doubling his rent .
He also moved to the area himself , with an apartment above his gallery .
" Much more space enables me to have three distinct galleries , " he says – a dramatic main wing for group shows and up - and - coming artists , an east wing , and a project space where visitors see more inventory .
The high - ceilinged white rooms elegantly show off the work of talented locals such as Geoffrey Pugen and Alex McLeod .
It is n't just the space , however .
One of the most distinctive additions to the new Angell Gallery is a permanent video room .
The mini - theatre , with a flat - screen video monitor , speakers and space comfortable for about four to six people , is unique among smaller galleries , which usually install screens temporarily for specific exhibits .
" It 's a serious medium , " says Angell .
" But how many galleries have the space to dedicate to it ? "
Jody Polishchuk , owner of Meta Gallery , says he 's happy Ossington did n't become a club district .
" People were worried it was going to turn into a kind of Richmond Street , " he says .
" It 's such a gem and it would be a shame for it to go that way . "
He says he looked for spaces along Dundas West – theorized by many as the new , new art district – before settling on Rolly's .
He 's happier to think of Dundas West as part of a giant art nexus that includes Ossington and the Shaw complex , anyway .
The new Meta seems likely to become a strip destination : though it will be a gallery in the main , it plans to retain some of the events that made Rolly 's Garage such a creative hotspot – such as its unique Night Market , where local vendors sold hand - made designer goods while shoppers drank and socialized .
It has even hired Phil Terry , the same contractor who has worked on the Drake Hotel , W Burger Bar and Mercatto restaurants .
Not that it will get a permanent liquor licence .
" As if Ossington really needed another bar , " says Polishchuk .

Architect Breck McFarlane owns the building at 9 Ossington , which houses electronic media arts centre InterAccess and Imperial Tattoo .
He agrees that galleries seem to have emerged from the moratorium unscathed .
And he is happy to remind newcomers that the street is a long way from what it was when he bought the property in 2001 .
" It was like a country road , " he says .
" I think there were tumbleweeds , honestly .
It 's got to be a 25 - fold increase in foot traffic ( since then ) . "
Many small business owners along the strip are far less sanguine about life since the ban , however .
They say the moratorium did n't stop kids from drinking – and it hurt daytime retail .
" I'm the newest vintage store and I 've been here for a year , " says Lindsay Fernlund , who owns Silver Falls , across from Angell .
She says without places to have lunch , shoppers simply do n't linger on the street .
" Restaurants would get foot traffic going , " says Tim Hanna , the owner of Ossington bookstore Frantic City .
He says that when Pizzeria Libretto opened nearby , he stayed open late and benefited from more walk - ins .
Two daytime restaurants and a bakery have closed since Pantalone 's moratorium was put in place – businesses that have n't been replaced .
The councillor says eateries and bars are welcome if they comply with the new rules ; what 's wanted , is variety , not just a bar strip .
" Art galleries , clothing stores and food stores are particularly needed in this area to add to the diversity , and their absence was actually creating a problem to both the business people and the residents , " he told the Star 's Bruce DeMara last week .
There is also a danger that the new rules and the drop in daytime traffic will make the art community also sour on the street .
" There is not another strip in the city that has so many restrictions , " says Gary Hall , executive director of Gallery TPW , which relocated to 56 Ossington in 2006 after 20 years at 80 Spadina Ave .
He says the gallery will " consider all its options " – including the idea of the Shaw Street Centre – when their lease expires in three years .
Others are already thinking about life after Ossington – west of it , that is .
Next month will see the opening of Parts +
Labour on Queen West near Sorauren Ave. , masterminded by owners from The Social and Oddfellows , two hectic hipster hubs within blocks of the Queen / Ossington axis .
The group gutted a huge old building that housed a hardware store for decades and spent months creating a slick restaurant and live music venue .
What results is sure to transform a forlorn stretch of street – and finally , perhaps , Parkdale .
While Ossington galleries continue to thrive , only time – mainly the summer and its crowds – will tell what the future of the strip holds .
A prominent refugee resettlement organization has enacted a policy that requires new employees to be Christian , triggering staff complaints and departures by those who see it as discrimination .
World Relief , a global evangelical Christian charity that receives federal funds to resettle refugees , said the policy simply establishes a routine that has been in place for years .
“ We felt we needed to put a formal policy in place that reflects a 65 - year history of hiring according to our faith , ” said Stephan Bauman , senior vice president of programs for the Baltimore - based agency .
“ The policy is really just to galvanize our organization . ”
But staffers do n’t necessarily see it that way .

“ As a Christian , I feel it is my duty to advocate for the most vulnerable , ” said former legal aide Trisha Teofilo , who left because of the policy .
“ I believe Jesus would not promote a policy of discrimination . ”
Under the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 , the policy is legal .
But opponents , including current and former employees , say it is hypocritical for an agency to discriminate when its mission is settling refugees -- many of whom have fled religious intolerance in their home countries .
“ It ’s legal , but it ’s ridiculously wrong and un-Christian , ” said Delia Seeburg , the director of immigrant legal services in World Relief ’s Chicago office .
She plans to leave for a new job in April .

Although current employees do n’t have to be Christian , they risk termination if they do n’t affirm the organization ’s Christian mission statement “ to follow Jesus by living holy , humble , and honest lives . ”
Mohammed Zeitoun , a Muslim employment counselor , is searching for a new job because he refused to affirm the Christian mission .
“ To ask us to change who we are , it ’s not right , not in the country of the United States of America -- the land of the free , ” said Zeitoun , who was born and raised in Jordan .

The Classics Rock
Is the study of classical history pointless ?
What useful knowledge will I glean from reading about some dead Roman governor of Britain ?
How will studying what the Delphic oracle had to say about the Persian advance into Greece help me in my future job at the State Department ?
I hear such questions often in my seminar on Thucydides and other classical writers , which I teach at Johns Hopkins University ’s School of Advanced International Studies in Washington .
My students — future policymakers , pundits , and managers — approach the class with a good dose of skepticism about the value ( aside from mere amusement ) of reading about ancient times .
Thucydides ’s history of the Peloponnesian War — in particular the Melian Dialogue , a quintessential tale of the small , neutral Melians defending themselves against the strong Athenians — is relatively common reading among budding wonks .
But Tacitus , Herodotus , Julius Caesar , Plutarch ?
Most students favor the latest tome on the rise of China over the insights of these long - dead writers .
My students ’ predilections reflect a wider skepticism about the present - day relevance of old texts .
For modern academics and policy analysts , ancient authors are guilty of adopting an unscientific approach , relying on anecdotes , and showing a primitive fear of natural events .
What good does it do the reader to know that before battle the Romans often consulted a pullarius , a chicken - feeding augur ?
Such texts say nothing about modern life , critics say , and certainly will not help one get a job at Goldman Sachs or the Pentagon .
The ancients were not worried about the movement of the IS and LS curves .
But that ’s precisely the point .
Reading Thucydides ’s description of the revolution in Corcyra , Tacitus ’s praise of Agricola , or Julius Caesar ’s tale of Vercingetorix ’s uprising is refreshing because these works do not simplify human affairs to logical models .
These books are full of contrasts and contradictions , showing above all that not everything can be understood .
Human affairs cannot be fully understood through a single lens , whether politics or economics ; we are often at the mercy of incomprehensible and uncontrollable forces .
Events can sometimes only be appreciated when taken as they are .
With that understanding , let me relate 11 ancient lessons relevant to today ’s world .
1. Superstition bests logic .
Today ’s leaders , like those of ancient times , do not think exclusively in terms of gains and losses , balance sheets , costs and benefits , and legal constraints .
Rather they are moved by hearsay , superstitions , and dreams .
Consider , for instance , the Athenian general Nicias , who spent more time in divination than pondering how to extricate his troops from Sicily .
He took a fateful decision to stay at Syracuse because of a nocturnal eclipse of the moon and ended up being executed by the Sicilians .
2 . Theology is far more important than economics .
People are humans , not cash registers .
And humans , even today , tend to hold strong beliefs about the Supreme Being , eternity , and what happens when you drink the waters of the Lethe River .
They act here and now on the basis of those beliefs .
Many will be led to great sacrifices , incomprehensible to those without an appreciation for the divine , in defense of their faith .
Witness the Jews who refused to allow Caligula ’s statue in the Temple and were spared his full wrath only by his timely and violent demise .
Others , notably the early Christians in Rome , were not so lucky , and their bodies littered imperial streets and stadia .
3. Political leaders care about public opinion , but they also care about history and their place in it .
They might be willing to trade present public support and admiration — or even the survival of their city or army — for a shot at immortality and a place in history books .
As a British rebel put it to encourage his men to fight the Roman legions , " Think of those that went before you and of those that shall come after ! "
Well , they lost , and , in Tacitus ’s description , an " awful silence reigned everywhere . "
But he fought not as much for that day as for the past and the future .
People engage in politics and war sub specie aeternitatis , with all of its consequences .
4 . Money is not the sinews of war .
Men are .
Wealth is nice , but an enemy ’s center of gravity is his soul , character , mind , and faith , not his arms or his cities .
As Xenophon wrote , " It is not numbers or strength that bring victories in war .
No , it is when one side goes against the enemy with the gods ’ gift of a stronger morale that their adversaries , as a rule , cannot withstand them . "
On another occasion , the Persians ate on tables of gold and still had a hard time defeating 300 Spartans who ate porridge .
Persia ’s large reservoirs of money and manpower could not bend the Greeks ’ disdain for the Medes and love of independence .
The Greeks never surrendered .
5 . Thus , to conquer an enemy , change him .
Julius Caesar , when expanding the Roman Empire across Gaul and Britain , knew he needed to sap his new and unwilling constituents ’ desire to rebel .
Calgacus in Caledonia and Vercingetorix in Gaul could be defeated on the battlefield , but the Romans had to assimilate the British and Gauls to rule .
Thus , Caesar made the enemies into Romans , providing them with things like schools .
Tacitus described the result : " The unsuspecting Britons spoke of such novelties as ‘ civilization , ’ when in fact they were only a feature of their enslavement . "
6 . Fear is powerful , but love can overcome it .
Our modern understanding is that fear motivates individuals and states .
( Thank you , Thomas Hobbes ! )
Politics is then the attempt to calibrate fear to achieve stability , deterrence , or whatever other desired outcome .
Yet the ancients teach that love of one ’s brother in arms , family , city , nation , honor , prestige , justice , and god will make one do things deemed impossible or even suicidal .
For instance , the Melians ’ faith in justice and their gods led them to naively believe that Sparta would help them against Athens .
7. States are fragile , no matter how wealthy , strong , or cohesive .
The " school of Hellas , " Athens , collapsed into a whirlwind of violence when the plague struck its people .
The Athenians ceased to fear their gods and respect the law and " coolly ventured on what they had formerly done in a corner , " as Thucydides wrote .
In fact , even families , the rock of societies , can fall apart .
In the " bloody march of the revolution " in Corcyra , as Thucydides put it , fathers killed their sons , and there " was no length to which violence did not go . "
Polities may break up unexpectedly , and the beastly state of nature is always around the corner .
8 . Expect the unexpected ; not everything makes sense all the time .
A respected , beloved , and experienced general can be , in a key moment , a pusillanimous and superstitious leader whose actions border on the treasonous .
The Athenian general Nicias , mentioned earlier , refused to retreat speedily at the end of the siege of Syracuse — for no clear reason at all .
Much can not be understood .
The ability to comprehend is limited .
Live with it .
9 . For some , war is not a means to an end , but a goal in and of itself .
Some fight because they love the glory of the battlefield , the pleading of the defeated , the plunder , the women , the gold , and the social cohesion of the battalion .
For some , war is a way of life and peace the beginning of the end .
Take , for instance , Julius Caesar , who loved the Germanic soldiers who fought on his side even though their fellow tribes were threatening Roman imperial interests from across the Rhine .
They simply enjoyed a good fight .
Similarly , Tacitus describes a Roman officer who " exulting less in the prizes that danger wins than in danger for its own sake , … sacrificed the assured gains of the past to a novel and hazardous gamble . "
Or , as Achilles put it in The Iliad , " What I really crave is slaughter and blood and the choking groans of men . "
10 .
Technology extends man ’s power over nature , but nature is powerful too .
An earthquake stopped a Spartan invasion of Attica ; a plague devastated Athens and upset its political order ; and Julius Caesar barely made it back from Britain to Gaul across the British Channel .
Nature can redirect history in unexpected and uncontrollable ways .
11 . Success is elusive .
Sometimes naiveté , arrogance , and dumb luck turn the most powerful into a loser .
( Looking for a Ph.D. dissertation topic ?
" Stupidity as an independent variable in international relations " would be useful and rare . )
Accept this as a tragedy of the human condition .
You will never engineer the perfect political administration .
Often a group of brilliant generals can lead to a disaster , as the Athenians found out in Sicily .
In the end , we will never fully comprehend power , war , or life .
The biggest danger for modern leaders and students of politics is that we think we know more than we do and that we can play with political realities as if they were hard sciences .
Reading these classical texts is a good antidote to modern arrogance .
Politics is an art , after all .
On February 3 , 2010 , after a sham trial , the Department of Justice announced Siddiqui 's conviction for " attempting to murder US nationals in Afghanistan and six additional charges . "
When sentenced on May 6 , she faces up to 20 years for each attempted murder charge , possible life in prison on the firearms charge , and eight years on each assault charge .
In March 2003 , after visiting her family in Karachi , Pakistan , government Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agents , in collaboration with Washington , abducted Siddiqui and her three children en route to the airport for a flight to Rawalpindi , handed them over to US authorities who took them secretly to Bagram prison , Afghanistan for more than five years of brutal torture and unspeakable abuse , including vicious beatings and repeated raping .
Bogusly charged and convicted , Siddiqui was guilty only of being Muslim in America at the wrong time .
A Pakistani national , she was deeply religious , very small , thoughtful , studious , quiet , polite , shy , soft - spoken , barely noticeable in a gathering , not extremist or fundamentalist , and , of course , no terrorist .
She attended MIT and Brandeis University where she earned a doctorate in neurocognitive science .
She did volunteer charity work , taught Muslim children on Sundays , distributed Korans to area prison inmates , dedicated herself to helping oppressed Muslims worldwide , yet lived a quiet , unassuming nonviolent life .
Nonetheless , she was accused of being a " high security risk " for alleged Al - Qaeda connections linked to planned terrorist attacks against New York landmarks , including the Statue of Liberty , Brooklyn Bridge and Empire State Building , accusations so preposterous they never appeared in her indictment .
The DOJ 's more likely interest was her supposed connection , through marriage , to a nephew of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed ( KSM ) , the bogusly charged 9/11 mastermind who confessed after years of horrific torture .
US authorities tried to use them both - to coerce KSM to link Siddiqui to Al - Qaeda , and she to admit his responsibility for 9/11 - something she knew nothing about or anything about her alleged relative .
Her trial was a travesty of justice based on the preposterous charge that in the presence of two FBI agents , two Army interpreters , and three US Army officers , she ( 110 pounds and frail ) assaulted three of them , seized one of their rifles , opened fire at close range , hit no one , yet she was severely wounded .
No credible evidence was presented .
Some was kept secret .
The proceedings were carefully orchestrated .
Witnesses were either enlisted , pressured , coerced , and / or bought off to cooperate , then jurors were intimidated to convict , her attorney , Elaine Whitfield Sharp , saying their verdict was " based on fear , not fact . "
Awaiting her May 6 sentencing , Siddiqui is incarcerated in harsh maximum security solitary confinement at New York 's Metropolitan Detention Center ( MDC ) , denied all contact with friends and family , no mail or reading materials , or access to her previously allowed once a month 15 minute phone call to relatives .
Justice for Aafia Coalition ( JFAC )
In February 2010 , Muslim women in America , Britain , Canada , and Australia united in outrage over Siddiqui 's treatment and bogus conviction , demanding her release and exoneration .
March 28 was the seventh anniversary of her abduction , commemorated by a global day of protest , JFAC saying it was " to have events , demonstrations , letter - writing campaigns , khutbahs ( sermons or public preaching ) , etc. in towns and cities all over the world in solidarity with Aafia " - for justice , against sadism and barbarity against an innocent woman , guilty of being a target of opportunity , not crimes she did n't commit .
JFAC published a transcript of the March 26 Kamram Shahid - conducted Pakistan Front Line TV interview with Siddiqui family members , including her mother , Ismat , sister , Fowzia , and young son , Ahmed , who asked " why have they imprisoned her and why did they imprison me ? "
In response to whether he'd like to give his mother a message , he said : " I love you and I am waiting for you ( to ) come back soon , if Allah permits . "
Ismat confirmed some of Aafia 's torture in shocking detail , saying :
She endured a lot , some of the worst of it including " six men .... strip( ping ) her naked .
All her clothes would be removed .
She told this to the Pakistani senators too , that they would strip her naked , then tie her hands behind her back , and then they would take her , dragging her by the hair .
You cannot imagine the cruelty they have done to her .
They would take her like this to the corridor and film her there . "
" After that , they observed that she would read the Qu'ran , from memory and from the book .
They again would send six , seven men , who would strip her naked and misbehave etc .
They took the Qu'ran and threw it at her feet and told her that only if you walk on the Qu'ran will we return ( it ) to you .
She would cry and shout that she would not do it .
Then they would beat her with their rifle butts so much that she would be bloodied .
All her face and body would be injured .
Then they used to pull out her hair one by one , just like this .... They threatened ( to ) take her to the court like this , naked . "
After " beat ( ing ) her so much that she bled .... they made her lie on a bed .
Then they tied her hands and feet - hands and feet both tied so that she ( could ) not even ... scratch her wounds .
Then they applied torture to the soles of her feet and head .
They put her in some machines to make her lose her mental stability .
They gave her such injections on the pretext of medical treatment . "
When she pleaded not to do it , " they would make her unconscious and then give them to her .
Such is ( their ) cruelty . "
" This epic cruelty - and look at ( the ) Islamic world .... They are all silent and making their palaces in Hell ....
She was not even a criminal in their law .
And she has done no crime .
They did not accuse her of terrorism .
She is not a terrorist . "
Her sister Fowzia said " It is all on tape .
I am not making this up .
They are sadists or whatever .
All the strip searching was video - taped .
( She called Aafia ) a poster child for this torture and rendition , " one of many others brutalized in American prisons .
Court testimony revealed that her children were also tortured , Ahmed later released on condition he say nothing , two still missing and presumed murdered .
" I think even Genghis Khan did not do this , " said Fowzia .
In an August 2008 address to Pakistan 's Senate , Fowzia explained that " Aafia ( can't ) get justice in the US .... They are sure to make her out to be a major terror figure to mask the five years of torture , rape and child molestation as reported by human rights groups . "
Her case is much more important than " my sister or one woman .
Her torture is a crime beyond anything she was ever accused of ( which was basically nothing ) and this is a slap on the honor of our nation and the whole of humanity .
The perpetrators of those crimes are the ones who need to be brought to account .
That is the real crime of terror here . "
Fowzia appealed for Aafia 's extradition to Pakistan , despite little hope of expecting a government complicit in crime to cooperate beyond rhetoric .
At first , it denied knowledge , then , after meeting with family , interior minister Faisal Saleh Hayat and other officials promised to work for her release , still denying complicity for what happened .
Because her ordeal sparked nationwide protests , Pakistan 's government is in damage control , apparently wants to shift blame to Washington , investigating officer Shahid Qureshi , in a report to the judicial magistrate , saying " FBI intelligence agents without any warrants or notice " committed the abduction - knowing full well about ISI 's complicity .
During conflnement , the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said Siddiqui had a kidney and her teeth removed .
Her nose was broken and not properly set .
Her gun shot wound was improperly treated .
Reuters reported that she lost part of her intestines and still bleeds internally from poor treatment .
Those around her notice she 's deathly pale because of extreme trauma and pain .
After years of horrific torture and abuse , a federal Bureau of Prisons psychological evaluation diagnosed her condition to be " depressive type psychosis " besides the destructive physical toll on her body .
World Outrage and Support The Muslim Justice Initiative ( MJI ) said Siddiqui's " recent guilty verdict .... shocked and outraged masses across the globe " in announcing an April 2 online webinar discussion on her behalf , featuring her brother Mohammed , sister Fawzia , noted UK journalist and Siddiqui advocate Yvonne Ridley , and Tina Foster , Executive Director of the International Justice Network ( IJN ) .
Information on the event can be found at muslimsforjustice.org .
On February 3 , Siddiqui 's conviction date , IJN said the following :
It " represents the family of Dr. Aafia Siddiqui in the United States , " its attorneys " monitoring her trial , which began on January 19 and ended with a guilty verdict today in US Federal Court in the Southern District of New York . "
" Today marks the close of another sad chapter in the life of our sister , Dr. Aafia Siddiqui .
Today she was unjustly found guilty .
Though she was not charged with any terrorism - related offense , Judge Berman permitted the prosecution 's witnesses to characterize our sister as a terrorist - which , based on copious ( exculpatory ) evidence , she clearly is not .
Today 's verdict is one of the many legal errors that allowed the prosecution to build a case against our sister based on hate , rather than fact .
We believe that as a result , she was denied a fair trial , and today 's verdict must be overturned on appeal . "
Himself victimized by US torture , including at Bagram , author of " Enemy Combatant : A British Muslim 's Journey to Guantanamo and Back , " Moassam Begg ( like others ) , called Aafia " the Grey Lady of Bagram because she ( was ) almost a ghost , a spectre whose cries and screams continue to haunt those who heard her . "
So much so that for six days in 2005 , male prisoners staged a hunger strike in protest .
After sentencing , her next journey may be to isolated life confinement in federal Supermax hell - according to the US Department of Justice National Institute of Corrections , intended for the most dangerous criminals , guilty of " repetitive assaultive or violent institutional behavior , " the worst of the worst who threaten society or national security .
Hardly the place for a woman called shy , soft - spoken , deeply religious , polite , studious , thoughtful , and considerate of others , especially persecuted Muslims being brutalized in America 's global gulag , courtesy of an administration that pays lip service to ending torture but practices it as sadistically as George Bush and the worst of history 's tyrants .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - An Internet startup called Fashion Stake launching in coming weeks aims to shake up the fashion industry , just as peer - to - peer file sharing changed the music industry .

Stake will allow customers to directly fund fashion designers by browsing on - line collections and buying a stake in a collection in return for credits to buy clothes .
Patrons can also share ideas with designers and vote on collections .
The model , inspired by Internet - based social media networks like Twitter and Facebook , taps into a growing business model called crowd sourcing where entrepreneurs go directly to customers for content , funding , and distribution .
Daniel Gulati , the firm ’s chief executive and a student at Harvard Business School where the project was born , says creative , high margin industries are moving away from a “ gatekeeper ” model where executives decide what the public consumes .
“ We think this can be a real game changer , ” he said .
“ What we ’re basically doing is redirecting the margin to fans and cutting out the retailer altogether . ”
Advocates of crowd sourcing say it offers consumers a cheaper , more flexible alternative and frees artists from having to get past big corporations .
New York - based designer Althea Harper says the new model could help her find funding , scarcer after the financial crisis , as well as bypass buyers at retail outlets .
“ It ’s hard getting the retailers to trust in you as a new designer , ” she said .
“ I ’ve seen them pick up horrible lines from more established houses just because they ’ve got the reputation . ”
Olga Vidisheva , a former model and Goldman Sachs equity analyst , who is Gulati ’s classmate at Harvard , is looking forward to using Fashion Stake .
“ You usually do n’t have access to the starting designers .
There ’s a lot of pain that they go through until they can sign with Saks or Bloomingdales , said Vidisheva , who spends “ several thousand ” dollars a year on clothes .
POWER TO THE CROWD !
Recent years have seen a rapid growth in interactive business models and Internet - based social media , or so - called Web 2.0 .
Global communities centered around services like Facebook and Twitter are millions strong .
Peer - to - peer lending , linking individual lenders with borrowers , has taken off in the U.S. through companies like Prosper , while so - called open innovation companies like NineSigma allow corporations to outsource problems to networks of innovators .
“ You can crowd source , you can crowd fund , you can get economies of scale , and you can customize the output to deal with local markets , ” said Alec Karys , a consultant advising Fashion Stake .
Gulati , a former analyst at investment bank Macquarie , sees creative industries , such as publishing and journalism , with strong fan bases , as a prime target for crowd sourcing .
He points to Spot.
Us , a website that allows users to select and fund journalistic work that conventional media might overlook .
“ Why should we leave it up to just a couple of people to decide what the public wants ?
Let ’s actually just go straight to the crowd , ” he said .
“ It ’s a two way conversation between brands and their fans .
It ’s not a one way type of logic anymore . ”
Harvard Professor Thomas Eisenmann , who studies platform - based businesses that exploit network effects , says the trend toward interactive business models is accelerating .
“ You ’ve got a whole bunch of businesses that worked well in Web 1.0 , and those businesses either need to add social media - social networking functionality - or they ’re at risk of getting leapfrogged by newcomers that do this , ” he said .
However , Eisenmann says crowd funding has limits where curatorial choice is still desirable , for example at certain newspapers and media organizations that people turn to for editorial insight .
“ I do n’t think the old models are going away , ” he said .
“ I think you ’ll see a lot of incumbent players add ( network ) functionality as an option . ”

As we 've pointed out repeatedly , poor design decisions in YouTube 's " Content ID " system have resulted in over - blocking of videos that remix copyrighted materials .
Today we got perhaps the most vivid example of the problem : the " silencing " of a lecture by Prof.
Larry Lessig about the cultural importance of remix creativity .
This is just the latest of many examples .
We 've been on YouTube 's case for more than two years about this problem , and it's high time for YouTube to fix the Content ID system to respect the kinds of fair uses that are at the heart of remix creativity .
How did Prof. Lessig 's video trigger the Content ID block ?
He included " snippets " ( I use that word intentionally , as Google does in the context of its own Book Search product , to refer to small portions that should qualify as a fair use ) from several remix videos .
As a result , the audio track of his lecture included excerpts of several well - known songs .
Apparently at least one of those songs is owned by Warner Music , which has chosen to automatically mute the audio track of any video when the Content ID system detects the presence of those songs .
It 's not clear which song triggered the block — the Content ID system does n't tell you that .
Of course , in close cases , reasonable minds can differ about whether a particular use of a song qualifies as a fair use ( although some cases are easy ) .
But that 's no excuse for the automated Content ID filter to block them — if a copyright owner has a good faith belief that any particular remix video crosses the line , it is free to send a formal DMCA takedown notice .
Sending a notice is not hard , nor expensive , as demonstrated by the fact that copyright owners routinely send hundreds of thousands of these notices to YouTube .
YouTube 's Content ID system even will flag all the videos for the copyright owner 's review .
But unlike the automated Content ID blocking , DMCA takedown notices at least put a human into the loop , and these humans must take fair use into account before issuing the notice .
In contrast , an automated match by the Content ID system results in an automated removal , even where the copyright owner does not object to the use ( and , as poorly behaved as Warner Music has been in the past , I can't imagine it really wants to censor Prof. Lessig 's lecture ) .
Fortunately , YouTube permits users to " dispute " automated Content ID removals , and that 's why Prof .
Lessig 's video is once again available .
But that 's not nearly good enough .
First of all , YouTube 's procedures for " removing " videos have created considerable confusion and consternation among users , and it's a fair bet that most YouTube users are n't aware of their ability to " dispute " these removals .
Second , the thousands of lawsuits brought by record labels against individuals for file - sharing has created an atmosphere of fear that makes many YouTubers hesitant to go toe - to - toe with a major record label .
There 's just no excuse for the Content ID system to be blocking remix videos .
There 's nothing in the law that requires YouTube to do this .
In fact , section 512 ( m ) ( 1 ) of the DMCA makes it clear that service providers do not need to install filters or monitor their services at all , much less allow copyright owners to use filters to block remixes .
Nor is there any engineering reason why the system should be designed this way .
The filter can fix this problem by insisting that the audio and video tracks both come from the same copyrighted work and that the entire ( or almost entire ) video is drawn from the same copyrighted work .
Unless these conditions are met , " block " should not be an option available to copyright owners .
If a copyright owner wants to take down a remix video , they should have to follow the rules Congress established in the DMCA .
This is exactly what EFF , joined by numerous other public interest groups , asked YouTube to do in 2007 in our Fair Use Principles for User Generated Content .
It 's a shame that YouTube , a company that has become synonymous with remix creativity , can't find the time to fix its own Content ID system to protect remixers from unnecessary censorship .
Last June , after 129,000 vials of Novo Nordisk ’s long - acting insulin were stolen from a parked truck in North Carolina , the Food and Drug Administration warned diabetes patients not to take drugs with the stolen lot numbers .
But it was too late .
The vials turned up in a Texas medical center .
Because the insulin had not been refrigerated , patients who used it developed unsafe blood - sugar levels .
The authorities have recovered only 2 percent of the missing vials .
Vials of stolen or diverted drugs can also wind up in the hands of counterfeiters , who may relabel them or even replace their contents with cheaper ingredients .
Such counterfeits also find their way into the legitimate supply .
In 2002 , Timothy Fagan , a 16 - year - old on Long Island , experienced painful spasms after getting a diverted dose of Epogen to treat his anemia after a liver transplant .
The drug had been relabeled , stored in the back of a strip club and ultimately resold to a national wholesaler and dispensed by a pharmacy .
In the wake of the Connecticut theft , Eli Lilly tried to reassure consumers by asserting that the American drug distribution system is “ tightly controlled and monitored , making it extremely difficult for stolen product to make it to patients through legitimate channels . ”
Yet common sense tells us that you do n’t steal a big volume of anything unless you know you can resell it .
Pharmaceuticals account for only 5 percent of all cargo thefts , according to FreightWatch International , a freight security company .
This is far less than electronics , the most - stolen kind of cargo , which account for almost a fourth .
But drugs are in first place in the category of value per incident .
Last year , while the average electronics theft amounted to $ 814,000 , the average pharmaceutical theft was worth $ 4 million .
Since 2006 , the number of drug thefts has quadrupled .
Consumers could be protected from this .
Track - and - trace technology can put a unique code on each bottle , even each pill produced .
Unfortunately , Eli Lilly ’s psychiatric drugs left that Connecticut warehouse with neither .
Drug companies are apparently reluctant to pay the nominal cost of tagging pills and bottles ( only about 25 cents a bottle , after an initial investment of $ 1 million to $ 2 million ) .
Unlike consumers , they are protected from theft by insurance .
The F.D.A. should require that drug makers tag every bottle .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - More than 10 million pieces of trash were plucked from the world ’s waterways in a single day last year .
But for Philippe Cousteau , the beach sandals that washed up in the Norwegian arctic symbolized the global nature of the problem of marine debris .

“ We saw flip - flops washing ashore on these islands in far northern Norway near the Arctic Circle , ” Cousteau , a conservationist and grandson of famed oceanographer Jacques Cousteau , said in a telephone interview .
Cousteau was commenting on marine debris statistics released Tuesday by the Ocean Conservancy group .
“ People do n’t wear flip - flops in the Arctic , at least not if they ’re sane , ” Cousteau said .
“ I think people are starting ... to realize that this is a global problem . ”
The report detailed the amount and kind of trash that volunteers gathered on one day in 2009 along coastlines of six continents and the banks of inland waterways , stressing that as much as 80 percent of marine litter starts on land .
“ Trash travels , and no beach , lakeshore or riverfront is untouched -- no matter how remote , ” Vikki Spruill , Ocean Conservancy ’s CEO , wrote in the report ’s introduction .
Last year , 10,239,538 pieces of junk were retrieved from shorelines on one day , September 19 , 2009 , by about half a million volunteers in the conservancy ’s annual international coastal cleanup .
This year ’s cleanup day is September 25 .
More than 40 percent of that total was collected in the United States , including everything from bottle caps and plastic six - pack holders to cigarette butts , washing machines , construction materials , diapers , condoms and medical waste .
The United States had the most volunteers , nearly triple the number in the Philippines , which had the second - most .
Nearly 20 percent of the items collected threaten public health , including bacteria - laden medical waste , appliances , cars and chemical drums , the report said .
Some debris is a threat to marine animals , which can become tangled in dumped fishing nets and line or ingest floating plastic junk .
As plastics break down in the oceans , they look a lot like organisms called plankton that form the base of the food chain , Cousteau said .
“ Fish and other animals are ingesting them and in so doing ingesting the toxins that these plastics absorb , ” he said .
“ And then guess who eats the fish ? ”
Cousteau said these plastics contain high levels of dioxins , PCBs and other chemicals that can affect hormones , and also lack any nutritional value , so marine creatures can die with stomachs full of plastic .
Coastguard Rear Admiral Mary Landry oiutlines rthe scale of the Gulf of Mexico oil slick Reuters
Five times more oil a day than previously believed is spewing into the Gulf of Mexico from the blown - out well of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig , the US coastguard has said .
Coastguard Rear Admiral Mary Landry said National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) experts now estimate that 5,000 barrels a day of oil are spilling into the gulf – far more than the previous estimate of 1,000 barrels a day .
Robot submarines have so far failed to shut off the flow , 1,500 m ( 5,000 ft ) below the surface , but the coastguard said a test burn on an isolated area of the spill was successful .
The revision came after a new leak was discovered and strong winds were forecast which NOAA said would push the oil towards the US shoreline .
However Doug Suttle , chief operating officer for BP , disputed the new estimates yesterday , pointing to a diagram that plotted the leaks and saying he did not believe the amount of oil spilling into the water was higher than earlier approximations .
Landry stuck to the NOAA estimate and said it was based on aerial surveys , study of the trajectory of the oil slick and other factors .
Landry added that the US president , Barack Obama , had been briefed on the revised estimate , and said the government had offered to have the defence department help contain the spill and protect the US shoreline and wildlife .
Both Landry and BP said the first test burn had been successful , although neither gave any indication as to when further burns were planned .
Crews had planned to use a 150 m fire - resistant boom to collect several thousand gallons of the thickest oil on the surface , tow it to a remote area , set it on fire , and allow it to burn for about an hour .
When the flames go out hardened tar is left in the water , which can be removed using nets or skimmers .
BP said more than 30,000 m of boom had so far been assigned to contain the spill , with an additional 87,000 m available and 97,000 m on order .
The oil spill response team had recovered 16,311 barrels ( 2.5 m litres ) of an oil - water mix , and 69 response vessels were being used , the company added .
" We are attacking this spill on all fronts , bringing into play all and any resources and advanced technologies we believe can help , " said Tony Hayward , BP chief executive .
" Our action plan is safety - focused , multi- layered and has the full resources of the BP Group behind it . "
He added : " The scale of the surface response is truly unprecedented , both for BP and for the oil industry . "
BP said it had begun preparations to drill a relief well , approximately half a mile from the main well , however NOAA said this would not be complete for several months .
NOAA said workers had finished fabricating the containment chamber of a " collection dome " which would be used to collect oil as it escaped from the well .
" Work will now begin on the piping system that brings the oil to the surface for collection ; this method has never been tried at this depth before , " the organisation said .
It said evaluations were under way to assess the damage caused by the oil to fish , marine mammals and sensitive resources , and warned the spill was on the move .
" Winds are forecast to become strong ( 20 + knots ) and blow from the south - east starting tomorrow and continuing through the weekend , which will continue to push surface oil towards shore , " NOAA said .
BP said costs for containing the spill were running at $ 6 m ( £ 3.9 m ) a day , and it would spend a further $ 100 m drilling the relief well .
Industry officials say replacing the Deepwater Horizon , which was owned by Transocean Ltd but operated by BP , would cost up to $ 700m .
American troops raked a large passenger bus with gunfire near Kandahar on Monday morning , killing as many as five civilians and wounding 18 , Afghan authorities and survivors said .
The attack could harm public opinion before perhaps the most important offensive of the war , a campaign that is intended to take control of the Kandahar region from the Taliban this summer .
Hundreds of demonstrators gathered around a bus station on the outskirts of Kandahar , shouting anti-US slogans and blocking the road for an hour , according to people in the area .
The US military confirmed the shooting but there were disputes over details , including whether the troops who fired on the bus had first shot flares and warned the driver to stay back .
One of the bus passengers and a man who identified himself as the driver said that an American convoy about 70 yards ahead of the bus opened fire as the bus began to pull to the side of the road to allow another military convoy traveling behind to pass .
The two convoys and the bus were on the main highway in Sanzari , about 15 miles from Kandahar city .
Troops opened fire on the bus just after daybreak as it was taking dozens of passengers to Nimruz Province , said Zalmy Ayoubi , a spokesman for the Kandahar provincial governor .
Some of the wounded were in critical condition , and the toll could rise , local officials said .
Ayoubi said five civilians had been killed , including one woman .
The Interior Ministry in Kabul issued a statement saying four civilians had been killed and 18 wounded , blaming " NATO forces " for the shooting .

Goldman is under political pressure in the US and beyond
When news broke that Goldman Sachs had been charged with fraud by the US financial watchdog , its shares plunged , wiping about $ 11bn ( £ 7.1 bn ) off the value of Wall Street 's most famous shop .
And that was before the UK 's regulator announced it was planning an investigation of its own or that its German equivalent was said to be mulling its options .
On the face of it , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) charge relates to a deal worth $ 1bn .
That is the amount UK and German taxpayers have had to cough up to cover losses that their banks made on " Abacus 2007 - AC1 " - the sub - prime mortgage instrument that the watchdog alleges Goldman sold fraudulently .
In the grand scheme of things , that $ 1bn liability is not a huge amount .
After all , the sub - prime mortgage market grew to some $ 1.3 trillion at the peak of the credit bubble in March 2007 , while the £ 500 m loss on Abacus that landed in the UK 's lap is less than half a per cent of the government 's total deficit of £ 167bn ( $ 255 bn ) this year .
Goldman itself made profits of almost $ 3.5 bn in the first three months of 2010 alone .
I expect everybody will jump on the bandwagon now
Richard Bove
Equity analyst , Rochdale Securities
But the issues raised by the SEC 's charges are a lot bigger than just this one collateralised debt obligation ( CDO ) - and throw open the sort of questions that worried investors when they rushed to sell shares in Goldman and other Wall Street giants .
The questions being asked are many : After Abacus , how can clients trust Goldman or indeed any other Wall Street firm ?
Is Abacus just the tip of the iceberg ?
How many other deals could be challenged by the SEC if it succeeds in prosecuting this case ?
And what does it mean for investment banker practices which , up until now were assumed to be perfectly legitimate ?
Litigation worries
One risk is that the SEC 's move has opened the floodgates for a plethora of investors to sue the firm over money they lost on sub - prime debt they bought from it .
Failed insurance company AIG was quick to announce that it was considering doing just that .
" I expect everybody will jump on the bandwagon now , " says Richard Bove , equity analyst at Rochdale Securities , who thinks that the cost to Goldman of defending lawsuits could be enormously expensive over the next few years .
And it is not just Goldman .
JP Morgan , for example , took the unusual step of setting aside $ 2.3 bn of cash in the first quarter to cover possible mortgage - related lawsuits .
That is compared with total profits of $ 3.3 bn .
JP Morgan 's chief financial officer is particularly worried about litigation by the government - sponsored federal home loan banks .
Goldman 's boss , Lloyd Blankfein has defended the reputation of his bank Should Goldman be worried about the damage this case will cause to its reputation ?
The SEC says that the Wall Street firm told Abacus investors what amounted to a lie about the interest in the deal of a hedge fund , Paulson & Co. Goldman flatly denies this , although the firm does concede that the main purpose of the CDO was to help Paulson speculate on the collapse of the sub - prime mortgage market - something the investors in Abacus were apparently unaware of .
Valuable services
What matters is that Paulson was allowed to have a say over what mortgages went into the CDO .
ACA Capital - the insurance company that was the main investor in Abacus - says it thought Paulson was batting on the same side , and naively accepted some of the hedge fund 's recommendations .
But instead , Paulson was actually picking the very worst mortgages it could find , knowing that it stood to profit when the deal went bad .
So does this mean that investors should no longer trust Goldman and other investment banks to take care of their interests ?
According to Mr Bove , this is not the right question when it comes to Goldman , because in his view the Wall Street firm is simply too dominant .
" The services it provides in the trading sector are not easy to replicate , " he says .
" There is no other company that could jump up and take its place . "
So whatever Goldman 's clients may think of its behaviour , it seems they are not about to desert the firm in droves .
Broader attack ?
All the same , Goldman undoubtedly still wants to be trusted - and liked .
But for investment banks , " trust " is a narrowly defined term when it comes to their dealings with big sophisticated investors such as banks or insurance companies .
Certainly , it precludes outright lying , or using inside information , or manipulating prices , and other obvious no - no's .
But at the same time the investment banks would insist that they do not have any so - called " fiduciary " obligation to do only what is in the best interests of their big sophisticated clients .
This is something that the law only requires when they are dealing with ordinary members of the public .
Chaos in the US housing market lies at the heart of the Abacus deal Another concern for the investment banks is that Abacus may just be the first step in a broader attack by the SEC on Wall Street .
There were plenty of other CDOs which , like Abacus , were designed to help hedge funds speculate against the market .
In fact , it was common practice for the investment banks to use CDOs to offload risk they did not want , or to speculate .
It is unclear exactly how many other cases could follow if the SEC is successful with Abacus .
But considering the size of the market , and the amount of investor anger , there could be quite a few .
Next in the SEC 's firing line may be a series of deals arranged for hedge fund Magnetar Capital .
Unlike Abacus , Magnetar 's trades were structured so that - legally speaking - the hedge fund really was the equity buyer .
But the substance of the trades was exactly the same - like Paulson , Magnetar would gain if the mortgages became worthless .
So the question for the SEC will be whether Magnetar was allowed to choose the mortgages in its deals , without this being disclosed to investors .
Magnetar , for its part , says it had no view on which way the market would move .
Reputational risk
The defence that Goldman and others will rely on is that companies such as ACA and IKB were capable of assessing the risks involved , and they should not be relying on anyone else to do this for them .
Indeed , the presentation sent by Goldman to IKB about Abacus - which has been leaked to the press - contained no less than eight pages of small - print detailing the risks and disclaiming the investment bank 's responsibility .
And many questions can be asked about the investors ' own culpability .
As the CDO manager , ACA was legally responsible for giving its blessing to every mortgage that went into Abacus .
So why did it rely on Paulson 's judgement ?
Moreover , if both of these investors were confident in their investment nouse , and had looked carefully at the mortgages in Abacus , why should they even have cared if a relatively unknown hedge fund such as Paulson held the opposite view to them ?
Both were heavy investors in US sub - prime mortgages , quite apart from the Abacus transaction .
And the big losses they took on all these investments sunk both of them later that year .
So perhaps the biggest question for them is why , despite their supposed sophistication , why did they not see what Paulson apparently saw coming ?
Fraud commonplace
The answer is that there was a giant flaw at the heart of the entire CDO business .
It had forgotten one of the basic ingredients of traditional lending - the relationship with the borrower .
Because ACA and IKB never met a single one of the US home - buyers who ultimately borrowed their money , they were blind to what was really happening .
They did not see that by 2006 , fraudulent mortgage applications had become commonplace in California and elsewhere .
Nor did they see how rising food and fuel bills during 2007 stretched their borrowers ' finances to the breaking point .
Yet both Paulson and Goldman were smart enough to see all this early on .
Fabrice Tourre , the Goldman employee at the centre of the SEC 's case , said in one private email that " the whole business is about to collapse anytime now " .
But he was under no legal obligation to disclose his view to the Abacus investors .
Goldman and Paulson are certainly not guilty of acting on inside information .
All the information about the wretched state of sub - prime borrowers was publicly available in the Spring of 2007 , if only the investors were willing to go and look for it .
All of which begs a simple question : did investment banks have the right to exploit the naivety of their big and supposedly sophisticated clients in this way ?
Legally speaking , the answer may well be yes .
Unlike ordinary members of the public , big investors are expected to do their own homework and understand the risks they are taking .
And they are also supposed to accept that the investment banks they are dealing with may not be acting in their best interests .
But perhaps that is something that regulators such as the SEC , not to mention legislators , want to change now ?

Mr Brown said the world could not rest until poverty and injustice were tackled Gordon Brown has said ending global poverty is one of the " great causes left " , as party leaders set out their plans on international development .
Speaking in London at an event to mark World Poverty Day , Mr Brown said the ambition of enabling every child around the world to go to school was possible .
The Lib Dems said nations must fulfil previous aid commitments , while the Tories praised the work of charities .
All three parties back a goal to spend 0.7 % of national income on aid by 2013 .
The UK currently spends 0.56 % of GDP on aid annually , according to the Department for International Development .
Speaking to a crowd in a Methodist churchyard , Mr Brown urged everyone to make " common cause " to tackle global inequality and injustice .
" None of us will rest , none of us will be resting on our laurels , none of us will relax , none of us will give up , until we have made this world a world where everybody can see that justice reigns and justice rules , " he said .
Schooling goal
The prime minister said he had written to all aid charities to set out his vision for global co-operation in the area .
He highlighted the drive to allow every child to get some form of primary education by 2015 , saying this was a " basic right " for people in " every country , in every continent " .
Mr Brown said , if re-elected , he would also work hard to secure a further £ 130bn pledge on aid from the international community when the G8 group of leading industrialised nations next meets .
There is hope if we do what we say , if we honour our commitments , if we provide a level playing field
Nick Clegg
Brown steps up attack on Lib Dems Conservative leader David Cameron emphasised his commitment to international development - one of two areas he has ring - fenced from future spending cuts - on a visit to an aid charity in Birmingham .
Earlier on Sunday , the Conservatives faced criticism from some development figures for their plan to distribute aid directly to people in the form of vouchers .
Four former senior figures in anti-poverty organisations , including ex-Oxfam chairman Lord Joffe , wrote to the Observer to call the proposal a " crude attempt to export failed ideological or populist policies " .
Meeting commitments
But Shadow International Development Secretary Andrew Mitchell said two of the signatories had strong links to the Labour Party and vouchers were already being used to promote healthcare and education in south east Asia .
" We are completely un-ideological about how you get clean water , sanitation , basic health care and education to the people at the end of the tracks who do n't have it , " he said .
Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg said the best thing rich countries could do was to keep their promises on aid .
" There is hope if we do what we say , if we honour our commitments , if we provide a level playing field , " he said during an address at a church in south London .

Decades of heat and humidity damaged only known copy of 1948 release , and film was close to being lost forever
It was a masterpiece of India 's cinematic golden age , a surreal blend of comedy and dance that told the story of a struggling writer 's attempt to break into the movies .
But decades of tropical heat and humidity severely damaged the only known copy of Kalpana , and the film was close to being lost forever .
Now it has found an unlikely saviour : Martin Scorsese .
The American director 's World Cinema Foundation , set up to preserve classics of film history around the globe , plans to start restoring the neglected classic within months .
News that the director of Mean Streets , Raging Bull , Taxi Driver and Goodfellas has thrown his weight behind the project provoked delight among south Asian film buffs .
Satish Kaushik , the respected Indian film actor and director , said : " I was really thrilled when Martin Scorsese told me he was interested in all these old Indian dance classics .
It 's really good news .
It 's a great opportunity for a new audience in India and elsewhere to see these wonderful works . "
Another Indian director , Deepa Mehta , who sits on the board of the WCF , confirmed Scorsese 's personal interest and said it was important that such films were not lost .
" We have become so overcome by Bollywood that Indian classic films get left by the wayside , " Mehta said .
Kalpana , a Hindi- language comedy - drama influenced by modernist trends in Europe , was directed by Uday Shankar , the elder brother of the famous Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar and a pioneer of Indian modern dance .
Released in 1948 , the film starred Shankar and used dance , drama and dream sequences to tell the story of a writer pitching a movie to a film producer .

" It is a cutting edge film , very forward looking , " said film critic and author Anupama Chopra .
" It got so badly damaged that most of it was destroyed and they are trying to re-create it before it is totally lost so it can be shown to new audiences . "
Despite recent efforts , India risks losing much of its cinematic heritage as original celluloid deteriorates .
When Chopra was researching a book on the seminal 1975 Bollywood mega-hit Sholay , she found only one copy of the original screenplay and no trace of the costumes or the original recordings of the songs .
" Until very recently the Hindi film industry has never had any culture of preservation , " she said .
Films that have been entirely lost include India 's first talkie , Alam Ara ( The Light of The World ) , made in 1931 .
Contemporary film - makers have also suffered .
Mrinal Sen , a leading Indian director , was reported to have declined an offer from the Cannes film festival to hold a retrospective because he had no good quality prints of his major works .
Partial prints of what is left of the original of Kalpana have been duplicated by the National Film Archives of India ( NFAI ) and are now stored in temperature - controlled vaults in a purpose - built facility near the city of Pune , but Scorsese 's foundation hopes to reconstitute the film in its original version for general release .
" Digitalisation and restoration is required , " said Vijay Jadav , director of the NFAI .
" With anything more than 50 years old , it 's a real problem .
They have not been looked after and once the film starts deteriorating and the chemical reactions are under way it is very difficult to stop . "
The decade after India 's independence in 1947 was of huge importance for Indian cinema , he said .
" There was enormous growth and huge technical , cinematographic and narrative innovation .
Kalpana is absolutely unique . "
More than 2,500 titles have been stocked in the Pune facility since it was opened two years ago .
They include the first Indian feature film , Raja Harishchandra , directed by Dadasaheb Phalke and released in 1913 , and two minutes of a panorama of the city of Calcutta shot in 1896 .
NEW DELHI : If you think that cricketers ' wages in the Indian Premier League do n't measure up to what English Premier League footballers make , think again .
According to the inaugural Annual Review of Global Sports Salaries to be published later this week by sportingintelligence.com , the second highest - paid league , based on first - team salaries on a pro-rata basis , is our very own IPL Second only to the American National Basketball Association ( NBA ) league , whose annual average salary is 2.62 million pounds , the IPL 's average salary , calculated over a year , is 2.5 million pounds .
It must be remembered that the league is only played over a six - week period , making what cricketers earn for playing Twenty20 matches astounding .
The third highest - paid is American Major League Baseball MLB ) , at 1.82 million pounds while EPL comes in fourth , at 1.46 million pounds .
In the 211 - team list currently monitored by average first - team pay , Royal Challengers Bangalore comes in at 12th , at an average of 57,833 pounds a week , standing two places above Manchester United According to a review of global sports salaries , and the IPL boasts of three teams within the top - 30 bracket .
The IPL has edged the English Premier League , who has two teams in the list - Manchester United and Chelsea .
RCB is No. 12 ( £ 57,833 per week ) , and others on the list are Kolkata Knight Riders ( £ 56,445 ) and Chennai Super Kings ( £ 55,526 ) .
At No. 1 is the MLB's New York Yankees ( £ 89,897 ) .
All data is taken from seasons played or ending in 2009 except for European football clubs .
Another day , another mind - numbingly horrid data point from the Un - Recovery , this one courtesy of the bull market in foreclosures that rages right alongside the bull market in stocks …
From Calculated Risk :
RealtyTrac® … today released its U.S. Foreclosure Market Report™ for Q1 2010 , which shows that foreclosure filings — default notices , scheduled auctions and bank repossessions — were reported on 932,234 properties in the first quarter , a 7 percent increase from the previous quarter and a 16 percent increase from the first quarter of 2009 .
One in every 138 U.S. housing units received a foreclosure filing during the quarter .
Foreclosure filings were reported on 367,056 properties in March , an increase of nearly 19 percent from the previous month , an increase of nearly 8 percent from March 2009 and the highest monthly total since RealtyTrac began issuing its report in January 2005 .
Yeah , yeah .
I know .
Lagging indicator .
Fine , so will it lag forever and ever ?
Or is there an eventual end to the displacement of families and devastation of neighborhoods ?
OK sorry , get back to flipping stocks and carbon credits .

Throughout the day , I like to check Tom Gulliti ’s Fire and Ice Blog .
The Bergen Record reporter usually provides some great reporting , and one of those stories struck me today .
You can check out the entire post here , but what it said was that Devils ’ coach Jacques Lemaire does n’t plan to rest Martin Brodeur in any of the remaining six games .
The 37 year old veteran , who has already played 71 games this season , will never admit to being tired or overworked .
But Marty might need a break .
The reasoning behind Lemaire ’s statement is clear .
The Devils currently sit one point behind the Pittsburgh Penguins for third in the conference .
Winning the Atlantic Division means guaranteed home - ice advantage during the first round of the playoffs .
It also might give the Devils an easier road to the conference finals , because the team could avoid Washington in a potential second round matchup .
Brodeur believes he ’s fresher this season than in years past .
“ I feel good , ” he said to Gulliti .
“ It ’s weird .
I just do n’t feel like I ’ve played a lot of hockey right now compared to other years for whatever reason .
The way the schedule has been , it has n’t been that hard on me at all . ”
Brodeur might feel fresh , but he ’s said that time and time again .
In the past few years , however , the Devils playoffs exits have been early .
And one of those reasons may be the over - reliance on Brodeur during the regular season .
I went back to the last time the Devils won the Stanley Cup , in 2002 - 2003 .
I wanted to see how Brodeur ’s regular season workload might be affecting his playoff production .
What I found could be reason for Lemaire to pause before marching Brodeur to the blue paint night after night .
Here ’s a breakdown of the stats :
Year Regular Season Games Played Regular Season Wins Regular Season G.A.A. Regular Season Save % Playoff Wins Playoff G.A.A. Playoff Save % 2003-2004 75 38 2.03 0.917 % 1 2.62 0.902 % 2005 – 2006 73 43 2.57 0.911 % 5 2.25 0.923 % 2006 – 2007 78 48 2.18 0.922 % 5 2.44 0.916 % 2007-2008 77 44 2.17 0.920 % 1 3.19 0.891 %
Almost every single year , Brodeur has performed worse in the playoffs than in the regular season .
There was one year , 2005 - 2006 , where he outperformed the regular season .
But , his consistent heavy workload during the regular season seems to have a negative effect on his performance .
While it may not be the be-all , end - all reason for Brodeur ’s struggles , I ’m sure it adds to the playoff decline .
So what ’s the solution ?
Clearly , I think the Devils should look to rest Brodeur in these final six games .
But they ’re also sitting in fourth , and the second seed is a better position .
Brodeur ’s play is significantly better since the Olympic break , but the team around him is struggling .
The last few games , Brodeur has needed to be the Devils best player on the ice .
Putting the extra stress on him now can have adverse effects in the future .
While it ’s important to win the second seed , it ’s more important to give Brodeur some rest to keep him fresh for the playoffs .
BEIJING — China ’s accelerating economic recovery without signs yet of a surge in inflation may give the government some leeway in making two crucial decisions : raising interest rates and revaluing the Chinese currency .
But the government cautioned that risks remained , like high unemployment and booming real estate prices .
China ’s gross domestic product jumped 11.9 percent in the first quarter , the government said Thursday .
That growth rate , the highest in three years , not only surpassed most economists ’ forecasts but it also handily beat the 10.7 percent expansion recorded for the final quarter of 2009 .
China ’s National Bureau of Statistics also reported that the consumer price index rose 2.4 percent in March from a year earlier and that the producer price index was up 5.2 percent .
Those figures were generally in line with analysts ’ expectations .
12:48 pm : Heyman tweets that an agreement has been reached , with only medicals pending .
We 'll do a fresh post once this trade is official .
To reiterate : the Yankees get Curtis Granderson , the D'Backs get Edwin Jackson and Ian Kennedy , and the Tigers get Max Scherzer , Daniel Schlereth , Austin Jackson , and Phil Coke .
Sherman notes that the Yankees managed to pull off the Granderson acquisition without giving up Phil Hughes , Joba Chamberlain , or Mike Dunn .
12:35 pm : Olney now says this deal is close .
Sherman says medical records are being exchanged on Granderson .
In another tweet Sherman says there 's no deadline on the deal , but one source says it 's " on the goal line . "
He adds that removing Dunn from the deal was key for the Yanks .
Tyler Kepner of the New York Times says the deal is " very close , " and would be Austin Jackson , Coke , Scherzer , and Schlereth to the Tigers , Edwin Jackson and Kennedy to the D'Backs , and Granderson to the Yankees .
12:19 pm : Rosenthal says the revised deal has the Tigers getting two players from the Yanks rather than three , with Coke or Dunn out .
AOL FanHouse 's Ed Price tweets that the D'Backs and Tigers are awaiting signoff from the Yankees , and expect an answer within 40 minutes .
11:51 am : Morosi sees progress being made , while MLB.com 's Steve Gilbert thinks this thing is close ; the Arizona Republic 's Nick Piecoro agrees .
11:24 am : More from Olney – the D'Backs are aiming to get Edwin Jackson and Kennedy in the deal .
Olney speaks of " growing confidence on at least two of the sides " involved , and his sources have the odds of a deal in the 20 - 30 % range .
One Heyman source said 50 % .
11:15 am : Rosenthal and Morosi note that the Yankees and Tigers are open to making a Granderson deal and leaving the D'Backs out of the discussion .
Still , the three - team talks are ongoing and fluid , with the Tigers requiring a " high - ceiling , close - to - the - majors center fielder " as part of the Granderson package .
Austin Jackson could be that player .
ESPN 's Buster Olney says it 's the Tigers that re-ignited the three - way talks , and they 've lowered their asking price .
10:33 am : Heyman tweets that this deal is " back with a chance . "
Mark Feinsand of the New York Daily News agrees , noting that the Tigers " may be caving " on the price for Granderson .
He says the Yanks would likely downgrade one of the pitchers , most likely Dunn .
Would n't be the Winter Meetings without three - team trade scenarios and the constant back - and - forth .
10:30 am : Just to add a little intrigue , ESPN 's Buster Olney says " one idea raised " was the Yankees getting both Granderson and Jackson .
Regardless , two of the teams involved backed out of this three - team mess .
8:29 am : SI 's Jon Heyman tweets that this one " looks very unlikely . "
In his scenario Heyman had Daniel Schlereth , Scherzer , and more going to Detroit .
He adds that the Yankees are saying no to the deal , which would 've cost them the four prospects named below .
Similarly , Morosi now finds the chances of this one to be " not good " because the Yankees balked at the price .
7:35 am : Buster
Olney adds that the talks progressed to the point where only one team liked the deal ; he 's not sure whether talks can resume or not .
TUESDAY , 7:00 am : Morosi tweets that the deal is still a possibility as of this morning , according to one source .
MONDAY , 11:23 pm : Joel Sherman of the New York Post hears that the Tigers were never satisfied with the blockbuster talks .
10:05 pm : The D'Backs pushed for a blockbuster three - way deal with the Yankees and Tigers today , only to see one of those two teams veto it , according to Jon Paul Morosi and Ken Rosenthal of FOX Sports .
However , the teams are discussing the following scenario .
The deal would send Curtis Granderson to the Yanks , along with a prospect or two from the D'Backs .
Arizona would obtain Edwin Jackson from the Tigers and Ian Kennedy from the Yankees .
The Tigers would obtain Max Scherzer from the D'Backs and Austin Jackson , Phil Coke and Michael Dunn from the Yanks .
Talks are apparently at an " impasse " now , though the D'Backs continue to push for a trade .

RON OXBURGH , breezily pushing his bicycle through a clot of journalists outside the press briefing he had just given , is a busy man happy to hurry .
Critics of his investigation into the scientific probity of the Climatic Research Unit ( CRU ) at the University of East Anglia will hold that haste against him .
In his time Lord Oxburgh has been head of the earth sciences department at Cambridge , chief scientific adviser to Britain 's defence ministry and , briefly , chairman of Shell .
In March he was asked to lead an inquiry into the CRU 's key scientific findings , a matter of much debate ever since hacked e-mails from the unit were made public less than five months ago .
That he has reported so soon , and in a way that supports the CRU researchers , will be seen by many critics as de facto evidence of a whitewash .
Lord Oxburgh and his colleagues were not concerned with whether CRU 's scientific findings , which are based on records of temperature change from instruments and natural proxies , were correct .
They were looking to see if the analysis had been biased and manipulated .
The inquiry panel looked at 11 CRU publications from the past 20 years , spent days talking to the researchers and looking at other documentation , and concluded that if there was any malpractice at CRU they would have detected it .
They found no such thing .
Instead they found “ dedicated if slightly disorganised researchers ill - prepared for public attention ” .
The panel did express considerable surprise at the fact that the unit did not collaborate closely with professional statisticians .
This is despite the fact that their work was “ basically all statistics ” , as one member of the panel , David Hand , of Imperial College , London , put it .
The report found that the CRU scientists would , had they been more comfortable with statistics , have done some things differently .
But the panel doubted that using better methods would have materially changed their results .
Bloggers and others , mostly outside academia , who criticise CRU 's work and other climate science tend to lay much stress on statistical shortcomings .
Dr Hand , who has a particular interest in scientific and financial fraud , has read a lot of this work .
Dr Hand admires the meticulous work of Steve Mcintyre , a mining consultant and blogger , who unearthed statistical problems in another climate analysis .
This was a 1998 paper , not produced by CRU , that is now known as “ the hockey stick ” .
Those problems served to enhance the prominence of recent warming in a thousand - year reconstruction of the northern hemisphere 's temperature , and have become a cause celebre among sceptics .
When the report refers to the possibility of “ inappropriate statistical tools producing misleading results ” , it is the hockey stick that it has in mind .
But Dr Hand said he had seen no evidence of anything that worrying in the CRU work .
His concerns centred mostly on questions about the selection of data sets and the need for studies that showed how sensitive the results were to different selections of data .
These are , in effect , what some critics are offering ( though with what the report calls “ a rather selective and uncharitable approach ” .
This antagonism irritates Dr Hand , since he thinks proper statistical scrutiny would have improved the work with little fuss .
“ What I want to do ” , he says , “ is bang their heads together and say sit down together and work out what 's going on . ”
The panel expressed concern that , although the CRU scientists were careful with caveats , people who subsequently made use of their results , including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , sometimes oversimplified the issues , underplaying possible errors .
It also noted that the CRU should have archived data and algorithms better , but that this was a conclusion more easily drawn in hindsight .
Having been in both academia and industry , Lord Oxburgh said he has no doubt that in industry , where companies , not researchers , own the data , the record - keeping would have been looked after better , but that the team would have done much less good research .
And looking back on his own academic work he showed a certain solidarity with his own subject 's sloppiness .
He says he is “ very grateful that the isotopic composition of helium has not become a key matter of public interest . ”

Oscar Freire ( Rabobank ) claimed his third and most emphatic victory in the Italian Classic , Milan - San Remo , on Saturday afternoon .
The Spaniard positioned himself perfectly for a sprint finish from a select group of 25 riders to defeat race favourite Tom Boonen ( Quick Step ) and Alessandro Petacchi ( Lampre - Farnese Vini ) .
Despite several spirited attempts by riders to get away on the ever - decisive Poggio , the favourites all regrouped in the three - kilometre dash towards the finish .
Liquigas entered the final kilometre at the front , but it was a cagey Freire who benefited most from the lime green lead - out as he leapt out from third wheel to finish a bike length clear of Boonen .
" I think I deserved to win my first win Milan - San Remo because Zabel was n't the same rider he had been , " said Freire , as he compared his 2004 and 2007 wins with his latest title .
" The second Milan - San Remo went really went and I did a great sprint .
This year it was the same .
I think I had good form .
I was scared of the finish because it was n't on the Via Roma , which I prefer .
Fortunately it went well . "
Snap , crackle and pop on the Poggio
The sprint finish defied pre-race predictions of late attackers being able to stay away , though , it was not for lack of trying .
A nervous - looking peloton appeared willing to delay hostilities on the Cipressa , and despite a move by Alexandr Kolobnev ( Katusha ) towards the top of the penultimate climb , it was n't until the Poggio that all - out war commenced .
A bold move by Yoann Offredo ( Francaise des Jeux ) on the descent off the Cipressa was met just kilometres later , on the Poggio , with a stampede from a Stefano Garzelli - led peloton .
As the Acqua & Sapone man swung off , Michael Rogers ( HTC - Columbia ) tore off the front of the race , with Philippe Gilbert ( Omega Pharma - Lotto ) and Filippo Pozzato ( Katusha ) launching their own counter - attacks .
Pozzato led the race over the summit , but as he began the descent , the proximity of his rivals made it clear that a sizable group was going to make it to the finish .
Vincenzo Nibali ( Liquigas ) led a hair - raising descent into San Remo and although he took Pozzato , Gilbert , Thor Hushovd ( Cervelo TestTeam ) and Matti Breschel ( Saxo Bank ) with him , the race once again came back together as the terrain flattened out for the final kilometres .
Freire admitted afterwards that this regrouping was key to his eventual victory .
" The most difficult moment for me was on the descent of Poggio , " he said .
" Pozzato got a gap with five or six others .
I was scared they 'd stay away .
Then when he attacked I knew I had to just find a good wheel because I could n't chase him .
That was the only way I could win was in a sprint . "
A final flourish from Nibali was answered by Pozzato , who went clear with two kilometres to go .
After a moment 's hesitation by the pack , Liquigas took responsibility for drawing the Italian Champion back once more as its team led the way into the final kilometre .
Around a minute later , Freire slid out of their slipstream and sprinted across the line for yet another famous victory at La Classicisma .
" The statistics say that Milan - San Remo finishes more often than not in a sprint and so the sprinters have to wait for the sprint .
There are always attacks , for sure , but there always are a lot of sprinters who want a sprint finish .
A team like Liquigas could have done everything , go on the attack or wait for the sprint .
They opted for a sprint but we all took advantage of that .
" When I started the sprint I knew I was in a good position and had good legs for it , " he said .
" I 'd been worried about being blocked in like two years ago but this time the right people were up there for the sprint and I found the right wheel .
Bennati went , but I do n't think he had the legs today . "
And so it begins
Just under seven hours earlier , the peloton had left a drizzly Milan for their journey to the coast .
With the flag pulled in , the customary early attack followed just three kilometres down the road .
Unsurprisingly , it was an all Italian affair as Fabrice Piemontesi ( Androni Giocatolli ) , Aristide Ratti ( Carmiooro NGC ) and Diego Caccia ( ISD - Neri ) used the outskirts of Milan to make good their escape .
With almost 300 kilometres on the day 's agenda , the trio were given a wide berth .
Lampre - Farnese Vini , Liquigas - Doimo , Katusha and HTC - Columbia were the teams patrolling the front of the peloton behind , but their tempo was tranquil enough to allow the leaders to push out to over 22 minutes .
However , as they approached the Passo del Turchino the leaders ' time gap commenced its gradual retreat .
Quick
Step now making themselves visible at the front of the main group , the time gap began to drop .
The leaders began the climb with 16:25 and they finished it with a little over 12 minutes .
There was no rush to shrink that gap further , and the leaders were still out in front on the slopes of Le Mànie , with 100 kilometres to go .
But their advantage was now a meagre two minutes .
While the leaders had been making their way between the Turchino and Le Mànie , the race behind had split after a crash on the descent of the Turchino , with reigning champion Mark Cavendish caught in the latter selection .
The Briton 's HTC - Columbia squad immediately came to the front in order to limit the damage .
While Cavendish 's men set to work , Murilo Fischer ( Garmin - Transitions ) , who had also crashed in the incident , left the race with a broken collarbone .
As attention focussed on the gap between the pelotons , the leaders were brought back by the front section of the grim - coated group at 81 kilometres - to - go .
Caccia , who had spent more than 200 kilometres out in front , had clearly developed a penchant for that position in the race .
The Italian took point duty at the front and controlled the tempo of the 30 - strong group for another five kilometres .
With no - one in the mood to push the pace in the front group , the two halves of the peloton reformed .
But at 60 kilometres to go AG2R - La Mondiale 's Maxime Bouet decided to attempt mission impossible as he fired off the front .
The young Frenchman quickly built a 20 - second buffer , which he gradually stretched out towards 40 seconds .
Dimitri Grabovskyy ( ISD - Neri ) was one of the first to answer the move as seven riders attempted to bridge across to the lone leader .
Grabovskyy was the only one able to catch Bouet .
He made brief contact before storming past the AG2R rider on the Capo Berta .
Unfortunately for the Ukrainian , the peloton had started to sharpen the pencil and it was n't long before he too was recouped after the town of Imperia , with 37 kilometres to go .
With Grabovskyy caught and the peloton once again back to status quo , Milram led onto the Cipressa and into what would be a fantastic finale for Freire .

Nico Mattan on Milan - San Remo :
Some people were surprised that Oscar Freire won Milan - San Remo but I was n't .
The riders went so easy on the Poggio , that it was going to be a bunch sprint and he knows how to win after 298km .
I know Gilbert gave it a go but you could see he was not at 100 % and was never going to get away .
Pozzato was probably the strongest but there was n't much he could , with everybody else wanting a sprint finish .
Anyway , cycling is not like 15 years ago when riders attacked on the Poggio and stayed away .
Now everyone is at a similar level and so Milan - San Remo is not as spectacular .
It will probably always end in a group sprint now unless they add an extra climb or move the finish to the top of the Poggio .
In races over 250 km , Freire is the best sprinter out there , that 's why he won three world titles and now three Milan - San Remo .
Boonen was there but he's not really a sprinter like Freire , Cavendish or Petacchi , he 's a cobbled classics rider who has a fast finish .
Freire also wanted it more .
He 'll never win on the cobbles , he does n't like them , and so he put everything on winning Milan - San Remo .
Now it 's up to Boonen to prove he's as hungry for another win at the Ronde van Vlaanderen and Paris - Roubaix .
In the early spring of 2009 , a team of doctors at the Lucile Packard Children ’s Hospital at Stanford University lifted a 2 - year - old into an MRI scanner .
The boy , whom I ’ll call Bryce , looked tiny and forlorn inside the cavernous metal device .
The stuffed monkey dangling from the entrance to the scanner did little to cheer up the scene .
Bryce could n’t see it , in any case ; he was under general anesthesia , with a tube snaking from his throat to a ventilator beside the scanner .
Ten months earlier , Bryce had received a portion of a donor ’s liver to replace his own failing organ .
For a while , he did well .
But his latest lab tests were alarming .
Something was going wrong — there was a chance that one or both of the liver ’s bile ducts were blocked .
Shreyas Vasanawala , a pediatric radiologist at Packard , did n’t know for sure what was wrong , and hoped the MRI would reveal the answer .
Vasanawala needed a phenomenally hi-res scan , but if he was going to get it , his young patient would have to remain perfectly still .
If Bryce took a single breath , the image would be blurred .
That meant deepening the anesthesia enough to stop respiration .
It would take a full two minutes for a standard MRI to capture the image , but if the anesthesiologists shut down Bryce ’s breathing for that long , his glitchy liver would be the least of his problems .
However , Vasanawala and one of his colleagues , an electrical engineer named Michael Lustig , were going to use a new and much faster scanning method .
Their MRI machine used an experimental algorithm called compressed sensing — a technique that may be the hottest topic in applied math today .
In the future , it could transform the way that we look for distant galaxies .
For now , it means that Vasanawala and Lustig needed only 40 seconds to gather enough data to produce a crystal - clear image of Bryce ’s liver .
Compressed sensing was discovered by chance .
In February 2004 , Emmanuel Candès was messing around on his computer , looking at an image called the Shepp - Logan Phantom .
The image — a standard picture used by computer scientists and engineers to test imaging algorithms — resembles a Close Encounters alien doing a quizzical eyebrow lift .
Candès , then a professor at Caltech , now at Stanford , was experimenting with a badly corrupted version of the phantom meant to simulate the noisy , fuzzy images you get when an MRI is n’t given enough time to complete a scan .
Candès thought a mathematical technique called l 1 minimization might help clean up the streaks a bit .
He pressed a key and the algorithm went to work .
Candès expected the phantom on his screen to get slightly cleaner .
But then suddenly he saw it sharply defined and perfect in every detail — rendered , as though by magic , from the incomplete data .
Weird , he thought .
Impossible , in fact .
“ It was as if you gave me the first three digits of a 10 - digit bank account number — and then I was able to guess the next seven , ” he says .
He tried rerunning the experiment on different kinds of phantom images ; they resolved perfectly every time .
Candès , with the assistance of postdoc Justin Romberg , came up with what he considered to be a sketchy and incomplete theory for what he saw on his computer .
He then presented it on a blackboard to a colleague at UCLA named Terry Tao .
Candès came away from the conversation thinking that Tao was skeptical — the improvement in image clarity was close to impossible , after all .
But the next evening , Tao sent a set of notes to Candès about the blackboard session .
It was the basis of their first paper together .
And over the next two years , they would write several more .
That was the beginning of compressed sensing , or CS , the paradigm - busting field in mathematics that ’s reshaping the way people work with large data sets .
Only six years old , CS has already inspired more than a thousand papers and pulled in millions of dollars in federal grants .
In 2006 , Candès ’ work on the topic was rewarded with the $ 500,000 Waterman Prize , the highest honor bestowed by the National Science Foundation .
It ’s not hard to see why .
Imagine MRI machines that take seconds to produce images that used to take up to an hour , military software that is vastly better at intercepting an adversary ’s communications , and sensors that can analyze distant interstellar radio waves .
Suddenly , data becomes easier to gather , manipulate , and interpret .
How Math Gets
the Grain Out Compressed sensing is a mathematical tool that creates hi-res data sets from lo-res samples .
It can be used to resurrect old musical recordings , find enemy radio signals , and generate MRIs much more quickly .
Here ’s how it would work with a photograph .
1 Undersample A camera or other device captures only a small , randomly chosen fraction of the pixels that normally comprise a particular image .
This saves time and space .
2 Fill in the dots
An algorithm called l 1 minimization starts by arbitrarily picking one of the effectively infinite number of ways to fill in all the missing pixels .
3 Add shapes
The algorithm then begins to modify the picture in stages by laying colored shapes over the randomly selected image .
The goal is to seek what ’s called sparsity , a measure of image simplicity .
4 Add smaller shapes
The algorithm inserts the smallest number of shapes , of the simplest kind , that match the original pixels .
If it sees four adjacent green pixels , it may add a green rectangle there .
5 Achieve clarity Iteration after iteration , the algorithm adds smaller and smaller shapes , always seeking sparsity .
Eventually it creates an image that will almost certainly be a near - perfect facsimile of a hi-res one .

Compressed sensing works something like this :
You ’ve got a picture — of a kidney , of the president , does n’t matter .
The picture is made of 1 million pixels .
In traditional imaging , that ’s a million measurements you have to make .
In compressed sensing , you measure only a small fraction — say , 100,000 pixels randomly selected from various parts of the image .
From that starting point there is a gigantic , effectively infinite number of ways the remaining 900,000 pixels could be filled in .
The key to finding the single correct representation is a notion called sparsity , a mathematical way of describing an image ’s complexity , or lack thereof .
A picture made up of a few simple , understandable elements — like solid blocks of color or wiggly lines — is sparse ; a screenful of random , chaotic dots is not .
It turns out that out of all the bazillion possible reconstructions , the simplest , or sparsest , image is almost always the right one or very close to it .
But how can you do all the number crunching that is required to find the sparsest image quickly ?
It would take way too long to analyze all the possible versions of the image .
Candès and Tao , however , knew that the sparsest image is the one created with the fewest number of building blocks .
And they knew they could use l 1 minimization to find it and find it quickly .
To do that , the algorithm takes the incomplete image and starts trying to fill in the blank spaces with large blocks of color .
If it sees a cluster of green pixels near one another , for instance , it might plunk down a big green rectangle that fills the space between them .
If it sees a cluster of yellow pixels , it puts down a large yellow rectangle .
In areas where different colors are interspersed , it puts down smaller and smaller rectangles or other shapes that fill the space between each color .
It keeps doing that over and over .
Eventually it ends up with an image made of the smallest possible combination of building blocks and whose 1 million pixels have all been filled in with colors .
That image is n’t absolutely guaranteed to be the sparsest one or the exact image you were trying to reconstruct , but Candès and Tao have shown mathematically that the chance of its being wrong is infinitesimally small .
It might still take a few hours of laptop time , but waiting an extra hour for the computer is preferable to shutting down a toddler ’s lungs for an extra minute .
Compressed sensing has already had a spectacular scientific impact .
That ’s because every interesting signal is sparse — if you can just figure out the right way to define it .
For example , the sound of a piano chord is the combination of a small set of pure notes , maybe five at the most .
Of all the possible frequencies that might be playing , only a handful are active ; the rest of the landscape is silent .
So you can use CS to reconstruct music from an old undersampled recording that is missing information about the sound waves formed at certain frequencies .
Just take the material you have and use l 1 minimization to fill in the empty spaces in the sparsest way .
The result is almost certain to sound just like the original music .
With his architect glasses and slightly poufy haircut , Candès has the air of a hip geek .
The 39 - year - old Frenchman is soft - spoken but uncompromising when he believes that something is n’t up to his standards .
“ No , no , it is nonsense , ” he says when I bring up the work of a CS specialist whose view on a technical point differs — very slightly , it seems to me — from his own .
“ No , no , no , no .
It is nonsense and it is nonsense and it is wrong . ”
Candès can envision a long list of applications based on what he and his colleagues have accomplished .
He sees , for example , a future in which the technique is used in more than MRI machines .
Digital cameras , he explains , gather huge amounts of information and then compress the images .
But compression , at least if CS is available , is a gigantic waste .
If your camera is going to record a vast amount of data only to throw away 90 percent of it when you compress , why not just save battery power and memory and record 90 percent less data in the first place ?
For digital snapshots of your kids , battery waste may not matter much ; you just plug in and recharge .
“ But when the battery is orbiting Jupiter , ” Candès says , “ it ’s a different story . ”
Ditto if you want your camera to snap a photo with a trillion pixels instead of a few million .
The ability to gather meaningful data from tiny samples of information is also enticing to the military : Enemy communications , for instance , can hop from frequency to frequency .
No existing hardware is fast enough to scan the full range .
But the adversary ’s signal , wherever it is , is sparse — built up from simple signals in some relatively tiny but unknown portion of the frequency band .
That means CS could be used to distinguish enemy chatter on a random band from crackle .
Not surprisingly , Darpa , the Defense Department ’s research arm , is funding CS research .
Compressed sensing is n’t useful just for solving today ’s technological problems ; the technique will help us in the future as we struggle with how to treat the vast amounts of information we have in storage .
The world produces untold petabytes of data every day — data that we ’d like to see packed away securely , efficiently , and retrievably .
At present , most of our audiovisual info is stored in sophisticated compression formats .
If , or when , the format becomes obsolete , you ’ve got a painful conversion project on your hands .
But in the CS future , Candès believes , we ’ll record just 20 percent of the pixels in certain images , like expensive - to - capture infrared shots of astronomical phenomena .
Because we ’re recording so much less data to begin with , there will be no need to compress .
And instead of steadily improving compression algorithms , we ’ll have steadily improving decompression algorithms that reconstruct the original image more and more faithfully from the stored data .
That ’s the future .
Today , CS is already rewriting the way we capture medical information .
A team at the University of Wisconsin , with participation from GE Healthcare , is combining CS with technologies called HYPR and VIPR to speed up certain kinds of magnetic resonance scans , in some cases by a factor of several thousand .
( I ’m on the university ’s faculty but have no connection to this particular research . )
GE
Healthcare is also experimenting with a novel protocol that promises to use CS to vastly improve observations of the metabolic dynamics of cancer patients .
Meanwhile , the CS - enabled MRI machines at Packard can record images up to three times as quickly as conventional scanners .
And that was just enough for 2 - year - old Bryce .
Vasanawala , in the control room , gave the signal ; the anesthesiologist delivered a slug of sedative to the boy and turned off his ventilator .
His breathing immediately stopped .
Vasanawala started the scan while the anesthesiologist monitored Bryce ’s heart rate and blood oxygenation level .
Forty seconds later , the scan was done and Bryce had suffered no appreciable oxygen loss .
Later that day , the CS algorithm was able to produce a sharp image from the brief scan , good enough for Vasanawala to see the blockages in both bile ducts .
An interventional radiologist snaked a wire into each duct , gently clearing the blockages and installing tiny tubes that allowed the bile to drain properly .
And with that — a bit of math and a bit of medicine —
Bryce ’s lab test results headed back to normal .

A New Jersey Superior Court judge gave a man who suffers from multiple sclerosis the lowest possible jail term for growing marijuana plants outside his home two years ago .
But that penalty is still five years behind bars for 37 - year - old John Ray Wilson .
" We 're pretty disappointed , " Chris Goldstein of the Coalition for Medical Marijuana said of the sentence .
Wilson could qualify for Intensive Parole Supervision after four to six months in prison , but the jail sentence still pains the man whose lawyer says cultivated the crops only to alleviate his suffering .
At Wilson 's trial in Somerville , attorney James Wronko told the jury that his client grew and used the marijuana solely to relieve the pain of his MS .
Jurors found Wilson not guilty of a charge of operating a medical marijuana facility , but convicted him on separate manufacturing and possession charges .
The state had asked for a 7 - year prison term for Wilson 's conviction on growing more than 10 marijuana plants , as well as possession for psilocybin mushrooms .
Jurors told NBC New York after Wilson 's December conviction that they had asked the judge to go easy on Wilson .
Goldstein quoted Judge Robert Reed as saying " John does not represent the heartland of cases of growing marijuana " in explaining why he gave him the minimum sentence .
Former Gov. Jon Corzine signed the Compassionate Use Medical Marijuana
Act in January , making New Jersey the 14th state in the country to legalize marijuana for medical use .
But the program likely wo n't be implemented until the end of the year .
Wilson could n't argue he used the drug for medicinal purposes because there was no such provision in the state at the time of his arrest .
He was n't even allowed to mention his medical condition at trial .
Now , according to Goldstein , even if Wilson were to get out on probation later this year , it 's not clear if he could use the program for years to come , since parolees are usually banned from using any controlled dangerous substances -- a list that includes marijuana .
" We 'll support him as much as we can , " said Goldstein , who added that Wilson " will probably have better medical care in prison " than on the outside because he does n't have health insurance .
Wilson said he grew his own marijuana because he could n't afford the high - priced drugs sold by pharmaceutical companies .
Va. Del . Bob Marshall ’s recent remarks echo the anti-choice theme for women :
Do not forget that your reproductive and sexual capacities are wholly - owned and operated by the Christian right .
When Virginia Del .
Bob Marshall publicly stated his desire to defund Planned Parenthood in his state ( they receive a whopping $ 35,000 in Medicaid reimbursements NOT for abortions , but for primary reproductive and sexual health care for women , men and young people ) , he used his interpretation of certain Biblical passages to justify his positions .
He said :
“ The number of children who are born subsequent to a first abortion with handicaps has increased dramatically .
Why ?
Because when you abort the first born of any , nature takes its vengeance on the subsequent children , ” said Marshall , a Republican .
“ In the Old Testament , the first born of every being , animal and man , was dedicated to the Lord .
There ’s a special punishment Christians would suggest . ”
In other words , a disabled child is a punishment from God doled out to the child ’s mother for having had a prior abortion .
Putting aside the fact that his claim that “ the number of children who are born subsequent to a first abortion with handicaps has increased dramatically ” has no basis in reality and no evidence - based studies to back it up , let ’s examine what these remarks are meant to convey .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

What so many have found offensive is the insensitivity he ’s displayed towards disabled children and their mothers .
Disabled children are a punishment ?
And women , these children ’s mothers , are characterized as receivers of a “ special ” type of vengeance ?
Although his comments seem particularly hurtful as they pierce the hearts of mothers and disabled people everywhere , this meme is exactly what we ’ve come to expect when it comes to issues surrounding women ’s bodies , health , and lives .
From placing blame upon the victims of rape and sexual assault to declaring that breast cancer is bestowed upon those women who dare to remain childless to deciding that women who do n’t remain celibate outside of marriage must pay for their decisions to have sex by carrying a pregnancy to term against their will , right - wing , ultra - extremist Christians have staked their claim on what women can and cannot do with our bodies by endlessly repeating the “ you get what ’s coming to you ” line .
In essence , women ’s sexual and reproductive capacities are inherently evil and must be delicately controlled by the steady hand of the men who know best .
When it comes to pregnancy prevention and the use of contraception , for example , the Christian right is clear : if women have sex outside of marriage , we must “ pay the price . ”
It ’s framed as “ living with the consequences of one ’s decision ” so the paternalistic desire to control women ’s bodies is brilliantly turned into a call for women to take personal responsibility but the underlying premise is clear : women must know where our free will begins and our options end .
If you are a woman and you commit the “ sin ” of sex for pleasure , you have given up the “ privilege ” of bodily autonomy .
In fact , fundamentalist Christian and far - right ideology ( which includes the anti-choice movement ) is not only against access to abortion .
It has become , in recent years , vehemently anti-contraception as well .
However , in the various scenarios and protests about these issues , it is never the married , heterosexual woman who is targeted because they are abiding , however superficially , by Judeo - Christian principals .
It ’s the young woman , not married , who dares to engage in sex - for - pleasure or finds herself the victim of a rape or sexual assault who is in the cross -hairs of the ultra - right wing ’s weapon of choice : shame and blame .
It is the woman in Texas in 2004 , the victim of a rape , who comes face - to - face with a pharmacist who refuses to fill the legal prescription because “ his religion says she should n’t have it . ”
If women dare think we can “ get away ” with engaging in sex outside of marriage ( regardless of ones ’ sexual preference ) , or that we think we are not responsible in some way for the assault upon our body , we are mistaken .
For our sins , the wrath of an almighty , angry God will appear in the form of an unintended pregnancy that we should be forced to carry to term .
It ’s an odd juxtaposition with the public messaging put forth by the ultra- conservative , Christian right that says that no matter what – babies are always a blessing , and that anything we do to prevent that blessing from being bestowed upon us is wrong .
It takes only a moment of reflection to realize that what they are really saying is : unintended pregnancy for women who have sex outside of marriage , forced or not , while using birth control or not , is a curse disguised as a blessing for those women who sin .
In a similar sentiment , the spate of bills and laws popping up around the country from Utah ’s bill proposed and pushed by right - wing , conservatives that seeks to criminalize women who have miscarriages to “ feticide ” laws stemming from our Unborn Victims of Violence
Act that have been used around the country to punish women who may dare to wittingly or not place their fetus in danger , we codify the Christian right ’s patriarchal , anger towards women .
While we may be shocked at Virginia Delegate Bob Marshall ’s callousness , it should not surprise anyone who pays attention to the right - wing , anti-choice , Christian conservative messaging and agenda for the women and girls of this country :
Do not forget that the reproductive and sexual capacities of the female body are wholly owned and operated by the Christian right acting as ambassadors of a God on the side of the patriarchy .

Crinolina is a collection of lights which evokes the shape of oldfashioned skirts .
The defining feature of the lights is the diffuser with its perfectly balanced arrangement of filled and empty sections .
Whatever angle the light is seen from , it appears asymmetrical , yet at the same time it is the perfect fusion of opposites .
The diffusers are in PVC painted gold on the inside , reflecting the light and making the room warm and inviting , and covered with cotton chintz on the outside , which comes in three different colours ( anthracite grey , white and purple ) .
The structure is in epoxy powder coated steel in the same colours as the diffusers .
There 's something I call the human pattern : someone gets a good idea , puts it into action , and momentarily rises above the herd .
Then , suddenly , all the fakers rush in .
They do n't understand the idea , but they understand it makes them look good .
So they make inferior versions and eventually destroy it .
I wish I had more time today to add examples and citations , but heed this if you love underground metal : the revival in old school black metal and death metal is being turned into a retro- trend , mainly by clueless Europeans .
If it 's not old school in spirit and execution , not just one of the two , it 's not old school .
A small Canadian town has been obsessed with all things Star Trek for as long as anyone can remember , but denizens always felt something - or someone - was missing .
Until the weekend .
Leonard Nimoy , who will forever be known as Mr Spock from the 1960s sci-fi TV series , finally fulfilled the dreams of the farming community that shares the name of the character 's home planet by paying a visit .
His remarks to Vulcanites , many decked out in their homemade Star Trek uniforms , were , well , logical .
" I have been a Vulcan for 44 years - I figured it was time I came home , " the 79 - year - old actor said to cheers at a ceremony at the centre of the town .
Vulcan , a community of 2,000 people about 100 kilometres south - east of Calgary , has for years identified with Star Trek .
It has become a tourist drawcard , especially for hard - core Trekkies .
There is a model of the USS Enterprise spaceship at the turn - off from the highway .
Pictures of Spock as well as space scenes adorn buildings downtown .
Town officials look for any opportunity to put on their uniforms and pointy ears and the town 's annual summer fair is known as Spock Days .
The council had tried for years to attract Nimoy , who played the half - Vulcan , half - human first officer Mr Spock known for his logical solutions to crises facing Captain James Kirk , played by William Shatner , and his crew .
Nimoy did n't stay long , but for Vulcan , his weekend visit tops all other events .
Locals are calling it " the Holy Grail moment " .
" It 's an opportunity to welcome Spock home , to welcome Leonard Nimoy back to Vulcan - his home community , his home planet , " Mayor Tom Grant , Vulcan ears affixed , said as he strolled down the main drag behind an Enterprise - theme parade float .
Nimoy left his handprint - fashioned in a Vulcan salute - for the town to cherish and he unveiled a bronze bust of himself as Spock .
He listed numerous honours bestowed on him over the years for his work in the famous role , most recently being inducted into the US Space Foundation Hall of Fame .
But he said the tribute paid to him by the town of Vulcan was the most touching of all .
" Wait until Bill Shatner hears about this , " Nimoy joked .

Humanity has thought up a lot of bad ideas .
Some lost a few investors a little bit of money and some wrought disasters far - reaching enough to destroy a major civilization .
Some bad ideas are only obviously bad in hindsight ; others cause the observer to wonder what , or if , the people were thinking .
Sometimes you ’re lucky and you recognize a bad idea for what it is beforehand , and sometimes you ’re unlucky and realize it only just after that point of no return where you ’re forced to watch helplessly as the calamity unfolds .
No matter what though , people love bad ideas ; we ’re drawn to them , we ca n’t shake them and we sometimes cling to them desperately long after we know just how bad they are .
So here , in no particular order , are ten of the worst bad ideas yet unleashed upon humanity .
“ Black Slavery ”
What do you do when you find a whole new continent that needs to be farmed , but shipping peasants over from Europe would be prohibitively expensive and no one really wants to come over anyway ?
You enslave the new land ’s population is what you do .
Except , in this case , the population has already been wiped out by virulent diseases you brought over .
What you do then is you find another continent , vastly expand its slave trade and ship slaves over to the new continent to be the backbone of your new agrarian economy .
Turns out someone did this back in the 16th Century .
It worked well and at the time seemed like a good idea ; except that after a couple of centuries all the areas without slavery and rich , cash crop agrarian economies compensated by industrializing .
And , hey , y’know what ?
It turns out that industrial regions can wallop agrarian ones economically and militarily .
Plus , after slavery is over , all the former slaves end up sticking around as an angry underclass gifted the delights of racism and it takes another couple centuries before anyone ’s anywhere near equal .
Sure , you colonists got someone to cut your sugarcane for you on the cheap and you ’re dead now , but was it really worth that crap economy , social unrest , and mass slaughter of your descendants ?
Probably not .
“ Operation Barbarossa ”
It ’s 1941 .
You ’re Hitler and you ’ve just conquered Europe .
The end of the war is in sight , in fact , and all you have to do is turn your full military might against the one enemy you have left and finish them off for good .
Luckily for you , that one enemy is the United Kingdom ; broke , ill - prepared , militarily weak and ripe for the plucking .
But instead of a quick and easy victory , perhaps the greatest victory in the whole history of warfare , you ( Hitler ) decide you ( Hitler ) have an idea .
A bad idea .
Invade Russia and fight a two front war .
In fact , it was such a bad idea that you ( Hitler ) yourself had warned against it in Mein Kampf .
In the end the bad idea costs thirty million people their lives , loses the Germans the war and cedes Eastern Europe to the Soviet Empire leading to the Cold War and the threat of mutually assured nuclear destruction .
That ’s a bad idea .
“ Failing to Adopt the Steam Engine ”
Remember in 200 AD when the Roman ironclads sailed up the Yangtze and the Roman Legions conquered the Han Dynasty and set up a new province with the capital in Pekinginium ?
No , you would n’t remember that at all because it did n’t happen .
The Romans never adopted the steam engine even though toymaker Hero of Alexandria demonstrated a working model of it in 62 AD .
Granted , even with Hero ’s steam wheel it probably would ’ve taken a few generations before you could take a first class rail coach along the Appian Way , but we ’ll never know , will we ?
Of course , this is one of those bad ideas that was only obviously a bad idea after seventeen centuries of hindsight , but still you think someone would ’ve noticed , after seeing steam power being used to move things , that steam power could be used to move things .
You know what they adopted instead of the steam engine ?
Hero ’s vending machine .
Even that they did n’t use for long .
“ Abandoning Vinland ”
When your homeland consists of tundra , unaerable forests and a few fjords that are warm for some of the summer months , you ’d think you ’d jump on the sort of real estate deal the Norse found around 1000 AD .
Instead of eking out a desperate existence in foggier , glacier strewn northern wastelands , they could have had New Foundland and New England ; both cold , but still almost infinitely better than Greenland .
Instead of settling and bringing more people over though , the Vikings decided to stop off for a bit to make use of local timber for ship repairs .
Failing to do what 500 years later would get Columbus a national holiday and two state capitals named for him , the Vikings stayed a couple of months and then left , never to return again despite the abundance of grapes .
Perhaps they did n’t realize that they had discovered a vast new continent or perhaps they were just scared of Skraelings .
Ooh …Skraelings .
“ Hunting the New World Megafauna into Extinction ”
It ’s understandable that after trekking across Asia , the Bering Land Bridge and the Yukon , you ’d be kind of hungry .
Who would n’t be ?
And apparently saber - toothed tigers , mammoths , horses , gazelles , elephants , giant land sloths and armadillos are like potato chips .
You ca n’t eat just one .
So the new Americans , who were n’t quite yet native , killed all the big animals from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego .
Thus the Incas were forced to eat guinea pigs for lunch .
Plus they never had horses for cavalry or work teams and making the same out of llamas was just a pain in the ass .
What ’s worse is that later , all the Americans died from a infestations of crowd diseases likely because they never had close contact with big animals like the Europeans did and getting near llamas was to risk your neck .
It ’s likely that Urgo and Mathop , as they killed the last of the giant ground sloths , never thought their actions would lead directly to the fall of the Aztec Empire millennia later .
The good idea would have been to keep at least a couple of those big sloths around in case of emergency .
“ Cancelling Firefly ”
After Joss
Whedon created one of the big hits of television history , the Fox network picked up his new show : a cowboy western , space opera type thing called Firefly .
The network executives , realizing that they gave this guy a slot because he had already produced one of TV ’s most memorable shows , decided that he must have known nothing about television .
So , they showed a few of the episodes they had paid for , aired them out of order and then canceled it after a few weeks .
Of course , since Joss Whedon must have known nothing about writing a television show , he had legions of die - hard fans who made Firefly the most popular canceled TV series since Star Trek .
Whedon eventually made a financially successful movie based on the canceled show , and instead of what could have been one of the most profitable TV shows in history , Fox got Oliver Bean , The War at Home , John Doe , Titus , Andy Richter Controls The Universe , Keen Eddie , Undeclared , and Cedric the Entertainer Presents .
And Firefly fans , each year , hold conventions and Serenity viewings year after year at which they , incidentally , spend loads of cash .
“ Excommunicating Galileo ”
For some damn reason , the Catholic Church was opposed to the idea of the Earth going around the Sun.
Perhaps it contradicted Biblical literalism , or perhaps they did n’t like some upstart astronomer horning in on their monopoly on Truth turf .
Either way , they were obviously happy to murder a fellow because he happened to write down what he observed of the natural universe .
Galileo was a smart guy .
Not only was he smart enough to deduce that the Earth moved around the Sun and that Jupiter had moons , he was also smart enough to recant it all when angry soldiers showed up at his house and told him they ’d torture and kill him horribly and painfully if he did n’t deny it all .
And what did Mother Church get out of all this ?
Not much .
They shut up Galileo for a few years , but they could n’t shut up everyone and in the end , five hundred years later , after a long , slow retreat of their power and influence , they had to admit they were wrong .
Unfortunately , they also spawned this whole ridiculous pseudo - science concept where some Christians believe they have to deny science if it disagrees with their view of Biblical literalism .
Many of the greatest discoveries of science were made by religious people seeking to understand God ’s handiwork , but thanks to the Catholics , now many Christians see science as the enemy of faith and happily wander down the path of idiotic superstition .
“ Communism ”
Back in the 19th Century it seemed , to Marx and Engels , a good idea that the workers should directly control the means of production .
It seemed like a good idea to them and to a few others as well .
The only problem is that it ’s not a good idea .
In fact it ’s a rather bad idea because the means of production do n’t spring from nowhere .
Someone has to buy them .
Someone has to invest capital in building a factory before the workers can punch in .
In fact , the capitalist has to pay for that punch clock before anyone can actually punch in .
That works in a capitalist society where you can kill the capitalist after he ’s paid for the factory and then take it over and introduce communism .
But , it never worked that way .
Communism , in fact , only took hold in countries like Russia , China or Cuba , where no one had ever bothered to spend the money to build a lot of factories .
That meant that someone had to build the factories and pay for the machines and time clocks , and that meant that the leading communists had to steal from the people to build the factories .
Unfortunately , the leading communists made a habit of stealing from the people and the worker ’s utopia never quite worked out .
Marx may have said a class revolution was inevitable , but it was n’t .
Instead it was just another bad idea .
Capitalist workers , on the other hand , can buy a share of that factory they work in .
No , really , it ’s called a stock .
Look into it sometime , Karl .
“ Pre -1920s Medicine ”
For perhaps millions of years people have been getting sick , injured and dead .
For at least ten thousand years other people have been trying to help out the sick , injured and even the dead .
But , until about 1920 they were not doing a good job at all .
In fact , what they were doing was basically guessing .
Just guessing , not even educated guesses , not even guestimates .
Just random , shot in the dark , guess work .
Needless to say , it did n’t work very well .
The main bad idea , beyond just the usual tinctures and potions ( which often involved dung ) , was to remove blood from the sick person ’s body .
Apparently they had never seen anyone bleed to death .
No one from Socrates onward thought that it might be a good idea to emphasize the keeping of blood inside the body .
Yeah , everything from stabbing people with needles , to dunking them in water , to sawing off limbs , to running electrodes through them was a bad idea that should n’t have required the benefit of hindsight .
Someone probably should have perhaps examined a sick person or looked a few feet over to the pile of dead ex-patients before sticking another needle in someone ’s brain in another ill fated attempt to cure the common cold .
These are just bad ideas and it should n’t have taken twenty centuries or more to figure them out .
“ That Girl ”
You know her .
She ’s got no job , steals your money , is insane , jealous and vindictive .
Chances are she ’ll screw you over and then screw your friends and then screw them over .
Not only that , but she is n’t that smart , she is n’t that interesting , she ’s manipulative , and she cries in public just to get attention .
And yet , you ca n’t help yourself , can you ?
You just dive right in , time and time again .
Even though you know she ’s a bad idea from day one , it does n’t matter because she ’s hot and she ’s easy .
And she ’s a train wreck and a terrible idea .
No , she ’s never brought down an empire , but as far as bad ideas go , That Girl still ranks up there .
But , she is hot .
A “ little rebellion now and then is a good thing , and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical , ” is one of the better - known quotes of Thomas Jefferson , who was born this day in 1743 .
It ’s not hard to imagine which side he would take in today ’s battles over the increased centralization of power in government .
Were he alive today , would Jefferson support the Tea Party movement and others who object to President Barack Obama ’s health care bill , stimulus programs and increased spending and debt ?
“ Yes , ” Jack Pitney told us .
He ’s a professor of American politics at Claremont McKenna College .
“ Jefferson was deeply suspicious of the centralization of power .
He was also suspicious of elites , even though he belonged to the educated and social elite of his time . ”
Mr. Pitney added that Jefferson was “ sometimes prone to populist rhetoric .
And by today ’s standards , his opponents would accuse him of inciting violence ” – as shown by the quote at the beginning of this editorial .
Jefferson – the principal author of the Declaration of Independence and the third president – also is relevant to another controversy of our times : nullification , in which states say they wo n’t follow federal laws .
Although sometimes identified solely with the antebellum South and South Carolina statesman John C. Calhoun , nullification also was practiced by Northern states objecting to the U.S. government using fugitive slave laws to capture slaves .
And today , nullification is a major issue right here in progressive California .
In 1996 , voters passed Proposition 215 , which legalized medical marijuana in this state , setting off a continuing battle with the federal government , which does n’t recognize the legality of medical marijuana .
The nullification issue could intensify in November if voters pass a new initiative to decriminalize marijuana for any purpose , not just as medicine .
In 1798 , during the administration of President John Adams , Jefferson took the lead in opposing the new Alien and Sedition Acts , which made illegal criticism of the federal government .
Jefferson wrote the Kentucky Resolutions , which stipulated , “ [ B]ut , where powers are assumed [ by the federal government ] which have not been delegated [ by the Constitution ] , a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy : that every State has a natural right in cases not within the compact … to nullify of their own authority all assumptions of power by others within their limits . ”
Jefferson “ believed that as soon as government went beyond the delegated powers listed in Article I , Section 8 , of the Constitution , government would essentially become a vehicle for legalized plunder , ” Thomas DiLorenzo told us ; he ’s an economics professor at Loyola University Maryland and author most recently of “ Hamilton ’s Curse , ” a book critical of Jefferson ’s arch - nemesis , Alexander Hamilton .
Jefferson , Mr. DiLorenzo added , “ was the founding father of the states ’ rights philosophies of nullification and secession as remedies to tyrannical government . ”
And , he said , Jefferson “ opposed Hamilton ’s Bank of the United States and corporate welfare . ”
So it ’s not hard to see what position Jefferson would take in the ongoing federal bailouts of large banks .
Jefferson also would have collapsed if someone would have told him that the federal government he headed from 1801 - 09 would , by 2010 , have run up a current national debt , according to the National Debt Clock ( www.brillig.com/debt_clock), of $ 12,838,257,257,768.56 , as of Monday .
Our wise founder warned , “ Loading up the nation with debt and leaving it for the following generations to pay is morally irresponsible .
Excessive debt is a means by which governments oppress the people and waste their substance . ”
But , despite our departure from Jefferson ’s counsel , we have his wisdom to guide America back to fiscal and political health .
As he showed during the bloody years of the Revolution and the difficult years that followed , it just takes his immortal principles of liberty – and the bravery to fight for them .

Our earlier post noted the regulatory capture of the SEC by Wall Street .
Later in the WSJ piece we referenced , SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro hinted that the issue might be even worse .
She blamed the agency ’s ineffective oversight of Lehman Brothers was partly due to insufficient staffing .
So that set me off looking for how the SEC staff and funding levels have changed over the past few decades relative to their workload .
What I found was deeply disturbing :
Over the past 30 years , the financial world has grown exponentially in size , breadth and complexity of products , trading volume , and total assets under management .
In terms of personnel , assets under management , numbers of trader , managers , sales people , and mathematical PhDs. , who work on the street increased dramatically .
The SEC did not .
Indeed , almost by design , the SEC has done a mediocre job keeping up with the finance sector over the past few decades .
Their budgeting and salary allowances was far outpaced by Wall Street .
The bodies the SEC can throw at any problem are dwarfed by what Wall Street manages .
Consider that there are 1,000s of quants working on Wall Street .
At the SEC , there are approximately zero .
The SEC appears to have suffered from what can be best described as a benign neglect .
However , if you conclude it was malignant congressional intent , you wont get much of a fight out of me .
The agency was all but abandoned
Consider this March 2002 GAO report to Congress on the SEC .
To summarize their conclusion :
“ U. S. securities markets have grown tremendously and become more complex and international .
As a result , SEC ’s workload has increased in volume and complexity over the past decade .
As illustrated below , around 1996 , SEC ’s workload ( e.g. , filings , applications , and examinations ) started to increase at a much higher rate than SEC staff years devoted to this workload .
Although industry officials said that they respect SEC as a regulator , they said that SEC ’s limited staff resources have resulted in substantial delays in SEC regulatory and oversight processes , which hampers competition and reduces market efficiencies .
In addition , they said information technology issues need additional funding , and SEC needs more expertise to keep pace with rapidly changing financial markets .
Finally , the officials said that SEC ’s reliance on a small number of seasoned staff to do the majority of the routine work does not allow those staff to adequately deal with emerging issues .
The GAO also identified other budgetary related issues : Low salaries , inexperienced staff , high turnover , outdated equipment , etc .
The charts tell all :
>
Percent Change SEC Staff Workload : 1991 – 2000
All charts sourced via GAO analysis of SEC data

This leads us to asking Congress to accept responsibilty for the ineptness of the SEC .
Congress failed to provide adequate funding for the agency .
It did n’t require tax dollars , it could have been funded through SEC action , fines and settlements .
Congress did not need to deregulate Wall Street — they only had to defund the SEC –which is what effectively happened .
Hence , the chief cop on the Wall Street beat was outgunned , overmatched , undermanned and out - lawyered by the industry they were supposed to be regulating .
How can that possibly have been any good for investors . . . ?

April 12 , 2010  -- Alexandra Noailles ' son does n't want just toys .
Julien covets merchandise from the animated film " Cars " and Nintendo 's Wii video game system .
When it comes to yogurt , he opts for Dannon 's Danimals .
And when he wants fast food , more often than not it 's McDonald 's that he asks for .
Barely five years - old , Julien has developed some pretty specific brand preferences .
" I figure he just picks it up in commercials , " Noailles , of Peekskill , N.Y. , said .
For years , understanding brands and logos was thought to be the province of older children , but a recent study has found that the preschool set also has the ability to identify and distinguish among different corporate products .
" Young children are ready learners and are learning about their brand environment just about everywhere , " said T. Bettina Cornwell , a professor of marketing and sports management at the University of Michigan .
Cornwell and Anna R. McAlister , a lecturer at the University of Wisconsin , published their study " Children 's Brand Symbolism Understanding " in the journal Psychology and Marketing last month .
The study , which involved 38 Australian preschool children ages 3 to nearly 5 years old , found that while the children were not yet able to read , they often knew exactly which logo corresponded with which brand .
Certain logos -- including those for fast food chains ( McDonald's ) , entertainment companies ( Disney , the parent company of ABC News , and Warner Brothers ) and cars ( Toyota ) -- proved especially recognizeable .
Others , including those for clothing ( Nike ) and personal care ( Kleenex ) , fared considerably worse .
( No children in the study recognized the Kleenex logo .
Kleenex spokesman Joey Mooring said he was unfamliar with the study but added that Kleenex 's " primary consumer demographic " is " moms . " )
The researchers were especially surprised to find children identifying brands whose marketing does n't appear to target kids , including Toyota , which was recognized by 80 percent of the study 's participants , and Shell , which was recognized by nearly 53 percent .
McAlister had a couple of theories to explain why brands like Shell and Toyota get kids ' attention .
For the former , children might associate trips to the gas station with stops for treats at a gas station convenience store , she said .
For the latter , children may recognize car brands because they 've learned to distinguish between their parents ' cars and those of others .
Before ABCs , Toddlers Learn Toyota , McDonald's , Disney
" My feeling is that a lot of this has to do with positive emotions -- children recognize things that are self - serving and enjoyable , " McAlister said .
McDonald 's was the most recognized brand , with nearly 93 percent of children correctly identifying the restaurant chain by its golden arches .
But here 's a detail that may come as a surprise to parents and proponents of the recent " Retire Ronald McDonald " campaign :
During the study , children were never shown pictures of Ronald McDonald , the McDonald 's clown mascot who critics say encourages unhealthy eating habits among kids .
It turns out they did n't need Ronald to clue them in to the allure of Mickey D's .
When children were asked to assess how popular certain brands were among their friends , they gave answers like " McDonald 's has a playground so you can play there and everyone likes you . "
( To the clown 's credit , McAlister said she 's since showed children pictures of Ronald McDonald 's red boots and striped socks -- omitting the rest of his body -- and found that some could identify the mascot by just his legs and feet alone . )
Of course , recognizing a brand and liking it are two different things :
Not even McDonald 's received universal approval among kids .
McAlister said one child declared that you will have no friends if you go to McDonald 's " because all they have is hamburgers and you 'll get fat and nobody likes you . "
Some children in the study were able to demonstrate not just why they personally liked or disliked a brand but also what the brand might mean to others .
" Kids this young are using brands as indicators of popularity or success , " McAlister said .
McAlister and Cornwell are performing similar studies in the U.S. today , including one that tracks how children 's attitudes towards brands change over time .
The researchers hope their work will ultimately inform both parents and policymakers considering the issue of advertising to children , including ways to improve the marketing of healthy food options to kids .
Their research involving young children shows that " the power of communication is not lost on them , " Cornwell said .
" It can be used to forward public policy aims . "
Or Spinning to Escape Blame
The statements being made this week before the Financial Crisis Inquiry Committee by our financial leaders look and sound like apologies .
But are they really ?
Alan Greenspan testified last week : " I was right 70 percent of the time , but I was wrong 30 percent of the time . "
The next day , Chuck Prince , former chairman and CEO of Citigroup testified : " I 'm sorry that the financial crisis has had such a devastating impact on our country .
. . .
And I 'm sorry that our team , starting with me , like so many others , could not see the unprecedented market collapse that lay before us . "
And then Robert Rubin , former Treasury secretary and former director of Citigroup , went on to say : " We all bear responsibility for not recognizing this , and I deeply regret that . "
What exactly is being regretted in these statements ?
Greenspan seems to suggest that his mistake was not being infallible .
Prince says he and his team failed to see into the future , while Rubin seems to regret that everybody was wrong .
This may play well on TV , and it may be enough to blunt public outrage .
But as some in the press have noted , these statements actually fall short of being true apologies .
For one thing , as The New York Times pointed out in an editorial , it 's simply not true that everybody was wrong , or that there was no evidence of reckless behavior .
The Times concludes : " the ‘ apologies ' are distractions . "
( See , " Who 's Not Sorry Now . " )
As a psychologist , I would like to add that in addition to being inaccurate and overly general , key failures in any real , these statements lack the stamp of .
There is a total absence of remorse , or even .
They acknowledge mistakes and limitations , not personal failures .
And they provide absolutely no indication that those same mistakes could n't happen again - and again .
Any parent , truly concerned for the moral integrity of his or her child , could not possibly be taken in by such statements .
So what purpose do they serve ?
What do they seek to distract us from ?
I suspect that what they are trying to ward off is " " in the form regulatory oversight and consumer protection .
The general apologies might suggest to an ambivalent Congress and a distractible public that the lessons of past mistakes have been learned and will be corrected .
Nothing more need to be done .
When we wake up and realize that we have been " spun , " it may be too late to act .

when the real world just is n’t enough …
According to the Huffington Post , teaching kids science is the same as brainwashing and should be considered a form of abuse .
After talking to the NCSE ’s Steve Newton for this blog and following his articles defending science and good scientific education , I know he has a tough job .
And recently , this job involved taking on a pervasive force in left wing woo and New Age platitudes : the Huffington Post .
Aside from serving as a repository of barely coherent alt med quackery , hosting Deepak Chopra ’s vapid pontifications , as well as his most absurd tryouts for the role of an anti-science Don Quixote , while giving lazy philosophers a platform to spout off pseudoscientific nonsense , HuffPo is also a popular news blog , which is why scientists feel the need to correct the woo that ’s been so utterly permeating the site ’s op - ed section .
And in this case , Mr. Newton had to tackle a doctor using his column space to let loose with such vapid inanities , you can literally feel the flames of what can only truly be described as weapons grade imbecility trying to burn your corneas .
Yes , it really is that horrendously awful .
According to the doctor in question , Larry Dossey , science teachers trying to explain the scientific method and bloggers like me who try to tackle claims and questions about the natural world with hard science in a format that kids could stumble upon , are actually damaging and brainwashing children , forcing them to give up their identity , and doing nothing less than engaging in child abuse .
Really ?
Teaching science is child abuse ?
Not even Deepak Chopra with his seething hatred of all things scientific and a typical post - modernist mind - way - too - open attitude ever sank to such a low .
And it shows .
Virtually every comment in reply to Dossey ’s inanity is a dismayed or passionate disagreement across all points , complete with chants for HuffPo to build a science section to be staffed by real scientists writing about actual research and discoveries ; a commendable notion , but one highly unlikely given the blog ’s current management which eagerly gives bandwidth to anyone hoping to indignantly rant about the “ cold sterility of modern science and medicine , ” or let fly with conspiracy theories about vaccines .
Viewed in this context , Dossey ’s ridiculous screed stuffed to the gills with Mike Adams quality nonsense seems right at home .
Now , I could try and address the offending column point by point , but since Mr. Newton already did just that so thoroughly that any attempt on my part would be redundant , I ’m going to pursue an important tangent instead .
Over the last year , this blog took apart attacks on science by those who either do n’t understand the scientific method or just loathe it with a primal , visceral passion .
Many of these anti-science crusaders happen to be from the far right and devoted to religious dogma over actual facts , but despite often having numbers on their side in any Quixotic quest against scientific education , they do n’t have a monopoly on utter disregard for what scientific advances offer society .
Just replace “ faith ” with “ spirituality ” and “ the necessity of God ” with the “ need for open - minded exploration , ” and you ’ve successfully turned an Evangelical fundamentalist ’s fuming into the vague platitudes of wannabe New Age shamans .
Both have equal disregard for the facts and to both , the idea of being able to describe the mechanical processes of the world around us is equally terrifying .
Unable to see how knowledge does n’t necessarily take away the beauty or the excitement of the universe we inhabit , they ’re fighting with reality itself , looking for some sort of grand , divine meaning without which they can’t imagine their lives .
And that ’s what it ’s really about to both fundamentalists and post - modernists .
On both sides , humans are seen as unique and our evolution is considered to be a predetermined outcome of the last 13.7 billion years .
Yes , it ’s pretty arrogant to think that more than 100 billion galaxies with trillions of planets spinning around hundreds of billions of stars , stretching for over 558 billion trillion miles were made especially for us , and every single event that has ever happened in the history of the universe was just a warm up to our appearance .
But then again , when you picture yourself at the center of all existence and pretend that it makes you somehow humble to do so , of course you ’ll look back at every facet of scientific knowledge with a selfish bent , focused for all the ways that you might ’ve never gotten here to tackle each and every mutation and coincidence that lead to your existence as some sort of sign that you ’re meant to be alive here and now .
Going solely by science , which shows that in the grand scheme of things you ’re a random organism on a speck of a planet floating in the nearly unimaginable vastness of space , seems so cold and alien by comparison .
And to appreciate our good fortune to exist while possessing the capacity to understand important insights about the universe around us is just not the kind of humility that our anti-science zealots would want to consider …
Cell division is a crucial but dangerous business .
It unfolds in a cycle of many steps , including DNA replication , spindle formation , mitosis and others , and they must happen in the right order to prevent abnormal cell death and cancer formation .
New research from Rockefeller University examines the activity of two proteins at the heart of the cell - cycle control system and finds that the cycle has not just one , but several independent processes that help to maintain order .
The work suggests that autonomous oscillating proteins may coordinate the events of the cell cycle through a phenomena called " phase - locking , " similar to how our circadian rhythm syncs to the light - dark cycle of our environment .
" Our research suggests that the modern eukaryotic cell - cycle may start from multiple oscillatory modules , " says Ying Lu , a former graduate fellow in Frederick R. Cross 's Laboratory of Yeast Molecular Genetics , who led the research .
" That modularity may provide a functional robustness to cell division . "
At the center of the cell - cycle control system is a protein called cyclin - dependent - kinase ( Cdk ) ; Cdk 's independent oscillating activity can establish the pace and order of cell cycle events .
The researchers , led by Lu , reasoned that if Cdk oscillation was the only cycle - setting pacemaker in the cell , blocking it would cause the cell cycle to stall .
In experiments published recently in Cell , they tested the hypothesis by watching what happens to another important protein in the cell cycle known as Cdc14 , which normally moves away from the nucleolus , activates and begins antagonizing Cdk as the cell exits mitosis .
Using quantitative time - lapse microscopy , the researchers were able to capture the transient Cdc14 movement and activation process .
They then blocked Cdk oscillation and overt cell - cycle progression , and surprisingly found that the periodic Cdc14 activation / inactivation continued just as it would in a normally dividing cell .
They also discovered a negative feedback pathway underlying this Cdc14 oscillator , a finding which indicates that the cell cycle may be composed of multiple autonomous pacemakers .
The existence of these pacemakers raises another question , says Lu , who is now a postdoc in Marc Kirschner 's lab at Harvard University .
How do oscillators with different intrinsic frequencies coordinate with each other to form a coherent cell cycle progression ?
The experiments suggest that , although Cdc14 activity oscillated at constant Cdk levels , its frequency was controlled by several different Cdk activities , which indicates that autonomous cell - cycle oscillators may coordinate each other through a phenomena called phase - locking .
Such a system , which is analogous to day - night cycles entraining our circadian clocks , would help explain the evolution of the cell cycle , and to ensure its accuracy and reliability .
" We think multiple oscillators , as they exist independently in the cell cycle , could achieve coherence through interactions affecting their frequencies , " Lu says .
AUSTIN , Texas – Kick - Ass made its blood - spurting , cringe - inducing , gut - busting debut at South by Southwest here Friday night , and a packed house ate up the movie 's mix of over - the - top violence and foul - mouthed humor .
" Did we kick your ass ? " asked actor Christopher Mintz - Plasse , who plays Red Mist in the film , after the screening at The Paramount Theatre .
The crowd roared its approval .
The R-rated movie , based on the gritty and smart comic book series by Mark Millar and John Romita Jr. , focuses on dorky teen Dave Lizewski ( played by Aaron Johnson ) , who dons a goofy - looking wetsuit and hits the streets of New York to battle criminals as Kick - Ass .
After getting his own ass thoroughly kicked , Lizewski inadvertently becomes a media sensation and gets drawn into a high - stakes battle between two serious costumed crime - fighters and a criminal enterprise .
It 's an energetic and extreme take on the superhero genre , lurching back and forth between brutal fight scenes , high - school jokes and revenge fantasies .
Throughout the wild ride , 13 - year - old actress Chloe Moretz , aka Hit Girl , steals the show .
Whether goofing with her father – the Batman - like Big Daddy , played by a thoroughly entertaining Nicolas Cage – or cutting off a bad guy at the knees , she 's delivers the best lines with zip and self - assurance .
There 's something truly special ( and unsettling , really ) about her portrayal of a pint - size killing machine so at ease with blades , guns and other weaponry .
Her onscreen chemistry with Cage is engaging , and the inventively choreographed fight scenes in which Hit Girl devastates her opponents are wildly fantastic
While she commanded the screen , Moretz did not show up at the film fest to field questions after the screening .
Johnson , Mintz - Plasse , Millar , Romita and director Matthew Vaughn did .
Vaughn , who previously helmed Layer Cake and Stardust , complained about the sound at the Paramount and the aspect ratio of the projection .
Millar , the Scottish writer who created Kick - Ass as well as the Wanted comic book that also became Hollywood fodder , explained the genesis of his amateur superhero story .
" Tragically , it 's autobiographical , " Millar said , recounting his own mad teenage quest to become a caped crusader .
He and a friend hit the gym and trained for a year , he said .
" At the very last minute we came to our fucking senses , " Millar said .

Former President Bill Clinton got into trouble with conservatives after he compared today ’s political climate with the climate preceding the Oklahoma City bombing .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich seems to be having a moment of his own : in a little - noticed appearance Wednesday , he suggested that the Tea Party will become the “ militant wing of the Republican Party . ”

But this time , conservatives are n’t up in arms .
While speaking at an event in York County , Pennsylvania Wednesday , Gingrich left some in the audience scratching their heads .
According to the The York Dispatch , Gingrich said the movement is a “ natural expression of frustration with Republicans and anger at Democrats , ” which is “ more likely to end up as the militant wing of the Republican Party ” than a third party .
A resident who attended the speech disagreed .
“ I would n’t use the word ‘ militant , ” she said .
While liberals may be surprised at Gingrich ’s characterization , Politics Daily D.C. Bureau Chief David Corn thinks that Gingrich did n’t see it as an insult .
“ I think there ’s always been a split personalty between the newt that wants to see himself as a statesman and the newt that wants to see himself as a bomb thrower , ” Corn told MSNBC ’s Lawrence O’Donnell Thursday .
“ But the important thing you hear is that he ’s talking about the Tea Party as an extension of the Republican Party .
Which polls show , it is , ” said Corn .

Bill Clinton recently warned that Tea Party anger could incite right wing extremism .
“ Before the bombing occurred , there was a sort of fever in America , ” Clinton said at a symposium on the bombing ’s 15th anniversary .
“ Meanwhile , the fabric of American life had been unraveling .
More and more people who had a hard time figuring out where they fit in , it is true that we see some of that today . ”
Conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh fired back at Clinton , saying that he’d be to blame if right wing extremists became violent .

“ I ’m going to state right now , if there is a future incident such as Oklahoma City the blame is squarely on the shoulders of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama , ” Limbaugh said .
Limbaugh has been silent on Gingrich ’s remarks .

Tens of thousands of people gathered Sunday on the National Mall in Washington to observe the 40th anniversary of Earth Day and to urge Congress to pass climate and energy legislation .
Major stars were on the roster , including Sting , John Legend , the Roots and Jimmy Cliff , as well as some newer figures like Passion Pit and Joss Stone .
( Thursday was the official Earth Day anniversary . )
Some environmental campaigners came dressed as melting polar bears .
Others embraced a 1970 theme , wearing tie - dyed shirts or arriving shirtless and shoeless .
Word that senators would delay the unveiling of a climate bill , originally planned with much fanfare for Monday , did not seem to dampen the day , which attracted some 150,000 people over eight hours , according to Tiffany Shipp , a spokesman for the Earth Day Network , the rally ’s organizer .
Denis Hayes , who helped mobilize the first Earth Day in 1970 with a small group of environmental activists , said he was gratified by the growing international attention to climate change .
But he complained that lawmakers for the bill that was to be introduced this week — by Senators John Kerry , Democrat of Massachusetts ; Joseph I. Lieberman , independent of Connecticut ; and Lindsey Graham , Republican of South Carolina — caved to the interests of the coal , oil and transportation industries .
( Mr. Graham , angered by the Democrats ’ focus on immigration , pulled out of Monday ’s announcement , leading to the bill ’s deferral . )
Mr. Hayes said the intensity that led to watershed environmental changes decades ago like the Clean Air Act had faded .
While dollars flow from lobbyists on both sides of the issue in Washington , he said , American environmentalists must marshal more grass - roots pressure on Congress .
“ The whole strategy is inclusivity — there ’s something on this stage for everyone today , ” he said of the rally .
“ But , really , recently , we ’ve failed on the outside - the - Beltway crowd . ”
The Rev. Jesse Jackson ; Representatives Chris Van Hollen , Democrat of Maryland , and Ed Markey , Democrat of Massachusetts ; and James Cameron , director of the movie “ Avatar , ” were on the agenda to address the crowd .
What is your view of the nation ’s environmental trajectory over the last 40 years ?
And what kind of climate and energy legislation , if any , would you favor ?

You inevitably pull out in front of me when there 's no one behind me , and you could 've waited another 15 seconds to not make anyone slam on their brakes on ice and snow .
You then continue to drive really slow , say less than half the speed limit .
No one in their right mind would pass someone on roads with a 2 ft snow drift in the median during a snow storm .
So , I 'm stuck behind you until you pull into whatever casino , bingo hall , party , or wherever you 're headed that 's OK be late to .
Yes , I realize that driving on slippery roads and in low visibility can be scary , so I appreciate you driving within your limits .
However , do n't pull out in front of a car when you know you 're not going to at least go the speed limit !
Just wait another 30 seconds maybe ( since you obviously are n't in a hurry anyway ) , and you wo n't ruin someone elses ' day .
Also , when you see a line of cars 30 - 50 deep trapped behind you , you do n't have to speed up , no , but you SHOULD pull over to let some by .
You 're obviously doing a really shitty job of setting the pace on this " not - safe - for - passing " road .
Do us ALL a favor and let us get to our families , jobs , and real obligations , and pull the fuck over for fuck 's sake !
It 's a common courtesy .
If the shoulder has been replaced by a 14 ft wall of plowed snow ( as we all know happens up here ) , find a decently plowed side road to pull on to for a minute .
Do n't be surprised or offended when you get 25 middle fingers and 37 horns out of the 50 cars you fucked for the last hour and a half that are now passing you .
Here are some tips for you that will make both of our lives easier : 1 .
Your winter driving confidence will grow 10 fold if you get rid of that 1994 Buick front wheel drive and get something with all wheel drive .
You do n't need a huge truck or SUV , but just something that actually gets some traction .
Try a used Subaru .
They 're all wheel drive , cheap , and fuel efficient .
2 .
Go practice in an empty parking lot , and see what exactly your limits are and those of your vehicle .
You wo n't get arrested for sliding around an empty parking lot Sunday evening outside of town .3 .
You do n't want to give up your front wheel drive Buick ?
Get some snow tires !
At least for the front two wheels , but better yet all of your wheels could use them .
You will be amazed at what a good set of snow tires actually do for your driving and confidence .
There 's a reason why they 're popular up here .
4 .
Wait until the last car passes before pulling on to the road .
See above .
Shit ! 5 .
Stay the fuck home !
Visibility to low ?
Too windy ?
Icy roads ?
Then do n't drive to the casino to lose another $ 200 bucks out of your $ 300 paycheck and jeopardize the roads for the rest of us .
Stay home and watch game shows and beat your wife / husband / dog or whatever you sleep with at night .
6 . Do n't like option # 5 ?
Take a cab !
Believe it or not , these guys are good at winter driving .
They do this for a living and they 're really quite nice people .
Besides , the cab ride to the casino or bingo hall will only cost a fraction of what you 'll lose once you get there .
Plus you save the embarrassment of getting flipped off by grandma in the Ford Expedition while passing you .
7 .
Move to the South .
I bet you 'd fit in there anyway .
Not sure what their casino scene is like , but you 'll find some other unintelligent way to lose money .
You can keep your Buick , too !
I realize the people who are actually the offenders are probably not going to read this , at least not many of them .
First you have to get a computer .
Then resist the urge to pawn it for casino money .
If you know any of these assholes , tell them what you think about following them at 20 mph on Highway 41 or M28 for two goddamn hours .
Thanks !
I 'll see you on the road !
Posted by John , March 24th , 2010 - under Women workers , Women 's liberation , Women 's oppression .
Sexism affects every aspect of our lives .
We ca n’t help but be affected by the inequalities between men and women , and the stereotypes that arise from these inequalities .
It ’s a common idea that all men benefit from women ’s oppression .
Anne Summers , for example , has argued that women ’s lower wages benefit men by lowering women ’s likelihood of participating in the labour force , and reinforcing their domestic role .
Heidi Hartmann argues in her article “ The unhappy marriage of Marxism and feminism ” that men universally exploit and benefit from women ’s domestic work in the home .
These arguments can only lead to confusion and disunity among the oppressed .
In this article I will outline how the interests of both men and women workers are bound up together , and why fighting for these interests requires a struggle for women ’s liberation .
Gender oppression is structured into the workforce – but working - class men do n’t benefit from it
The source of women ’s oppression under capitalism is not the individual behaviours or actions of working - class men , however sexist they may sometimes be .
Rather , the source of gender oppression is the way in which capitalism exploits working - class women in the workforce and in the home .
The capitalist class gains from the oppression of women by systematically underpaying whole industries whose labour force comprises mainly women workers .
Undervalued industries include aged care , child care , teaching , and health and community services – all traditionally female - dominated .
Women generally earn less than men , even when we compare people working in the same industry .
Over her lifetime , the average woman will earn one million dollars less than a man doing the same job .
Women are now almost half the labour force – so these savings to the system are critical , especially in a period of economic crisis in which bosses are scrambling to cut wages .
Despite women ’s increased participation in the labour force , they are still economically disempowered compared to men because they tend to work fewer hours and in less stable jobs .
Women ’s jobs are more often casualised , and women ’s work is more often unskilled .
But to argue that working - class men gain anything from the systemic devaluation of women ’s labour is nonsensical .
Suppose a man lives with his partner , a female child - care worker .
He does not benefit from the fact that her job is undervalued and underpaid .
Her lower wage means that they both have a lower standard of living .
The sexist structure of the workforce has an even broader impact than its immediate effects on individuals .
Under capitalism , our labour power is a commodity , and our wages are subject to the price of this commodity on the market .
Holding down the wages of one section of workers lowers the price of labour - power in general .
Historically , bosses and their representatives have used sexism to drive down women ’s wages , and hence undercut men’s .
This is why it ’s ridiculous to suggest that men benefit from sexism because they earn more .
This is completely misleading .
The fact is that sexism drags down men ’s wages as well .
The most class - conscious sections of the working class – male and female – have long recognised the benefits to all workers of equal pay .
During the campaign in the Australian labour movement for equal pay in the late sixties and early seventies , it was the stronger and more militant unions , not necessarily the unions with more women in them , that made the best efforts to win this demand .
Women ’s oppression in the family , and its effects on working - class men
The nuclear family , and women ’s unequal role in it , interacts with and supports the gender oppression in the workforce .
For production to run smoothly , the working class must have their basic physical needs met .
They also need to produce more workers – that is , to have and raise children .
The upkeep and regeneration of the working class is an absolute necessity if profits are to be made .
Despite this , capitalists are not willing to invest capital in reproduction .
In fact , they actively resist doing so .
In March , when Tony Abbot proposed his parental leave scheme – to be funded by a levy on Australia ’s top 3,200 companies – bosses and industry groups around the country were livid .
Overall , the working class itself bears the costs of housing , childcare and other regenerative needs , through the privatised nuclear family unit .
For individual family members , this could mean performing domestic labour in the home , bringing in a pay packet to sustain dependents , or ( usually ) both .
It is the interaction between the nuclear family and the inequalities in the workforce that forms the material basis for women ’s oppression .
Sexist ideology helps to bind working - class women into their gender roles as caregivers , mothers and nurturers .
The inequalities in the workforce cement the fact of women ’s unequal role in domestic life .
Even for couples committed to gender equality , it makes sense for the partner with the highest earning power to keep working , and for the lower - waged partner to take time out of the labour market or postpone their career to work a casual job with more flexible hours .
It should be clear from this analysis that although the family gives rise to sexist stereotypes about women , it is not set up to serve the needs or desires of ordinary men .
It is set up to further the interests of capital .
What about housework ?
We can clearly see that all workers share the same overall interests in getting rid of capitalist exploitation .
But surely men benefit from having their laundry done , having their meals cooked , and not being burdened with child care ?
It ’s true that while social trends show a gradual convergence of the amount of domestic work men and women perform , women still do more than men .
An Australian Bureau of Statistics time - use survey in 2006 found that women spent , on average , double the amount of time spent by men on domestic work .
But this really does n’t equate to a male “ benefit ” from women ’s oppression .
The types of domestic tasks where inequalities are the greatest mostly involve caring for children , which benefits capitalism – it has nothing to do with ordinary men .
And when we factor in that the men in the survey worked longer hours in paid employment , over all , they had only about half an hour more leisure time than women did .
This is hardly a situation of male privilege .
The family is unequal – but this inequality does n’t benefit men .
Sexual and psychological “ benefits ”
Nor do men benefit from the way in which women ’s sexuality is constrained and stereotyped by capitalist ideology .
Men are socialised to believe that they can demand sex from women ; women are socialised to believe that being sexually pleasing to men is more important than their own desires .
But this means the sexuality of all workers is restricted and stunted .
Because of sexism and inequality , relationships are less fulfilling and sex is transformed from something that should be mutual into a commodity .
As well , the need to avoid being seen as effeminate affects men in a negative way .
Anyone who has set foot in a high school would know that young men are under constant pressure to establish and re-establish their masculine credentials .
Young men who fail to display an appropriate level of masculinity might be verbally and physically bullied .
The fear of being seen as “ feminine ” also contributes to homophobia and to men repressing homosexuality or restraining their sexual and emotional expression .
The idea proposed by some feminists that men gain any kind of psychological benefit from being able to beat and rape women is particularly loathsome .
Domestic violence dehumanises abusers as well as survivors .
Studies of the demographics of family violence show that strong predictors are poverty , alienation and community breakdown .
That a minority of men try to alleviate their frustrations by abusing the women in their lives should never be thought of as an advantage .
We might as well say that women benefit from the oppression of children , as it is women who are the most frequent physical and emotional abusers of children .
So who does benefit from women ’s oppression ?
Once we understand that the family is set up to service the needs of capitalism , and that the constant barrage of family - values ideology binds this structure together , it is easy to see that the ruling class are the only ones who benefit .
The needs of capital change over time , and with these needs , the organisation of the family changes correspondingly .
For example , as the population of Australia increased throughout the 19th century , the colonial administrators and the ruling class began to consciously enforce the working - class family as a means of social control , and to stabilise the growing capitalist system .
Caroline Chisholm had the interests of the ruling class in mind when she advised the British government :
“ For all the clergy you can despatch , all the schoolmasters you can appoint , all the churches you can build , and all the books you can export , will never do much good without what a gentleman in that Colony very appropriately called ‘ God ’s police ’ – wives and little children – good and virtuous women . ”
Ordinary men had no say in being pushed into family units , and often resisted it .
Contrary to some theorists ’ arguments that men benefit from women ’s role in the family , supporting a wife and children actually had the effect of lowering men ’s living standards .
The simple fact of the division of labour between men and women did not create a benefit for working - class men .
Furthermore , capitalism continually restructures the family , and sometimes almost rips it apart when it suits the needs of the capitalist class .
During the two World Wars and the Depression , men were sent to die , or had to travel around the country in order to find work .
Capitalism did not care to check with them to ask if they might prefer to be “ serviced ” by their wives .
This shows that it is the needs of the system that govern our domestic arrangements – not the desires of working - class men .
In fact , men and women of the ruling class benefit from these arrangements , as ruling - class women also have a stake in the system and participate in the accumulation of profits .
They share in the exploitation of low - waged women workers , and gain from unpaid domestic labour in the home .
Their oppression as women means that they are restricted from participating in running capitalist production to the same extent as ruling - class men , but they still prefer to maintain the status quo rather than do anything to fundamentally challenge women ’s role in the family .
After all , with enough money , many of the worst aspects of women ’s oppression can be dealt with – ruling - class women can pay others ( usually very low - paid women ) to take care of children and do domestic work .
And even in a country like the United States , where abortion rights are continually under attack in the most horrific ways , discreet and safe abortions are accessible for those who can afford to pay .
For this reason , working - class women and men form the only group that is capable of fundamentally challenging women ’s oppression .
Theories that attempt to identify “ men ” as the source or the beneficiaries of women ’s oppression can only lead us to confusion and disunity .
They do nothing to further the interests of workers , and in fact make it harder to unite .
We need to highlight the collective interests of the working class as a whole , and to show how an attack on one part of it is an attack on all .
Divisions in the working class undermine this consciousness and make it harder to fight for our rights .
So capitalism does its very best to foster all kinds of oppression to sow these sorts of divisions and thus divide and conquer the working class .
People swayed by arguments about male “ benefits ” would do well to remember the trade union slogan : “ Touch one , touch all . ”
And male workers who think it ’s okay to denigrate and trivialise women should think about how this weakens our struggle against the bosses who are our common enemies .
This article , by Kate Jeffreys , first appeared in Socialist Alternative .
In the midst of the Supreme Court nominations last spring , Focus on the Family took a curious position .
Jeff Sessions , a conservative southern Senator , claimed he would be open to a nominee with “ gay tendencies . ”
The Evangelical powerhouse surprisingly agreed .
Their judicial analyst told The Plum Line ’s Greg Sargent that their verdict on the nominee would depend on “ whether they are a good judge or not . ”
A judge ’s sexual identity , he claimed , is “ not even pertinent to the equation . ”
Well , apparently that was a mistake .
It is quite pertinent now .
As another seat on the high court opens up , the group has made an abrupt about - face .
Tom Minnery , the organization ’s Vice President of Public Policy , clamored to undo last year ’s position , calling the conversation with Sargent one they would “ like to ‘ do over . ’ ”
“ We can assure you , ” he said in released statement , “ that we recognize that homosexual behavior is a sin and does not reflect God ’s created intent and desire for humanity . ”
A homosexual nominee , Minnery continues , inherently lacks the “ character ” and “ moral rectitude ” necessary for the court .
With the imminent departure of Justice Stevens , this summer is likely to see a repeat of the contentious battle over Obama ’s nominee .
Abortion will undoubtedly be at the center .
Although is usually peripheral to the Court , sexual identity could be a divisive issue with the potential for the first ever openly gay Justice .
One Republican Senator offered wavering support for the possibility yesterday .
But the firm stance of groups from their conservative Christian base may enable politicians to come out against the prospect of a GLBT nominee .
In today ’s statement , Focus on the Family unleashed stringent , Dobson - era language that seems to counter their recent savvier , stealth evangelism .
“ Sexual behavior , ” Minnery concludes , “ be it heterosexual or homosexual–certainly lies at the heart of personal morality . ”

Your monthly credit card bill got a makeover in 2009 — thanks to lawmakers and federal banking regulators .
The monthly statement makeover is part of a much larger series of credit card regulation reforms approved by the Federal Reserve Board in December 2008 .
Whether you get your credit card statements in the mail or online , the documents have taken on a new look since the Credit Card Act of 2009 took effect .
The Act was implemented in three phases , with the first phase requiring card issuers to provide customers a 45 - day notice period before implementing any changes to the card ’s terms .
That went into effect in August 2009 .
And new design and disclosure requirements mandated by the Credit Card Act took effect in February 2010 .
The third phase , which involved an amendment to Regulation Z of the Truth in Lending Act , became effective in August 2010 and addressed unreasonable late payment and penalty fees .
More user - friendly
Statement designs have become more reader - friendly since then to help credit cardholders easily find important information on their monthly statements — namely , when payments are due , the amount owed , the consequences of making late payments and how much they are paying in fees and interest on different types of accounts .
Another feature warns consumers about the cost of making only minimum payments each month .
Each credit card bill also has a box that states how long ( in months or years ) it will take to pay off the entire balance if the cardholder makes the minimum payment compared to how long it might take to pay it off when making higher payments .
The box also states the total dollar amount cardholders would pay when both interest and principal is factored in .
The results have certainly been eye - opening for some borrowers .
The previous standard for credit card disclosure was the so - called Schumer box , which required key terms to be listed in a table and included in credit card offers , applications and monthly statements .
The current standard is like the Schumer box on steroids , with much more details about terms and what they mean — and more tables .
Consumer feedback influenced implementation
The Fed conducted consumer tests of credit card statements to determine what worked best when providing key information .
Users complained that wording on the old statements was confusing , the type too small and key information missing .
Testers said they liked information presented in boxes that they could clearly read .
Capital
One had also conducted consumer tests before redesigning its statements .
“ We wanted to maintain some consistency with statement usability to ensure our customers did n’t get lost in the new statement , ” said Pam Girardo , a spokeswoman for Capital One .
“ We showed a variety of statement designs to understand what resonated and what did n’t and to make sure consumers understood the information . ”
Here ’s an explanation of some of the features of the updated statements , based on the Federal Reserve Board ’s samples .
Your statement may not look exactly like this ; each credit card issuer uses its own .

As with many genres , chef 's memoirs – these hard - boiled tales of " sex and chopping " – are instantly recognisable by their covers .
The formula that seems to have begun with Anthony Bourdain 's Kitchen Confidential continues with Marco Pierre White 's The Devil in the Kitchen and , most recently , Cooking Dirty , by Jason Sheehan ( who is notable within the genre for his relatively low status as a cook – Sheehan is a successful food writer and multiple James Beard award - winner , but was never especially successful as a chef ) .
A black - and - white photo of the chef in his whites , holding a somewhat threatening looking knife , glowers from under big , block lettering in black and red .
And the blurbs are scattered with references to dope , drink , and deep fat fryers .
Of course , the common ground shared by these books is n't visible only on the book jackets .
They 're all stuffed equally full of anecdotes about terrible injuries inflicted by vats of boiling fat , signing for deliveries of cocaine and heroin at the same time as ones of fresh fish and vegetables , three - pack - a - day cigarette habits and some pretty revolting details ( Sheehan describes the chefs ' practice of " making pancakes " – pouring cornflour down their trousers to soak up the sweat , the phrase describing the resulting pats that form around the genitals ) .
A recent offshoot of this genre is that of chef - ' sleb memoir – Gordon Ramsay 's Humble Pie and Playing With Fire , or Driven by James Martin , for example .
The covers of these books reflect the entirely different slant of their contents – close - ups of the chef 's faces , smiling rather than glowering ; bright backgrounds ; snappy suits .
The focus here is firmly on the fame , with the kitchen bringing up second place – perhaps even third , to the tale of their difficult but uplifting childhood ( in the harder - edged memoirs , the chefs ' childhoods tend to be viewed through a sharper lens .
In Cooking Dirty , Sheehan tells a story about a gift his mother gave him as a rebellious teenager , as part of her attempts to get him to stop smoking : a pack of Marlboro Reds , with a picture of his dead grandfather laid out in his coffin glued to the inside of the lid .
On each cigarette she had written , carefully , in biro , ' Hi , Grandpa ! ' ) .
These are books about celebrities who happen to be chefs .
What the two types have in common is that neither of them are really about food .
It 's not entirely invisible , but if you 're after detailed descriptions of dishes , you'd be better off looking to writers such as Ruth Reichl or Jeffrey Steingarten , to name but two .
These books are about the life : the highly - pressurised atmosphere that exists in professional kitchens ; the camaraderie that grows between a group of guys ( and it is mostly guys ) who are cooking on the line .
They 're about hard work and harder partying .
They 're war stories .
Which is perhaps a big part of the reason why they 're appealing to readers who are n't cooks themselves , who are n't even that interested in food .
A friend of mine devoured Kitchen Confidential , despite the fact that her freezer is usually fully stocked with ready meals , and she eats out only occasionally .
Why ?
Because , like the best books of any genre , when done well , these memoirs and biographies open the door to a world that 's normally closed to us ; they let us peer beyond the pass , into the smoke - and steam - filled kitchen to catch a glimpse of the weary chef wiping his knife on his apron as he prepares his mise - en - place ; or bloodying his knuckles in a brawl with the potwasher .
In a conference call yesterday , reproductive rights leaders pointed out the anti-choice targeting of black women for what it is : a right - wing effort to " drive a wedge into the African - American community and into other communities of color . "
Advertisement
Those were the words of Dr. Loretta Ross , National Coordinator of the SisterSong Women of Color Reproductive Justice Collective .
She joined Dr. Melissa Gilliam , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Chicago Medical Center , and Dr. Vanessa Cullins , Planned Parenthood 's Vice - President for Medical Affairs , in a call sponsored by Women , Action & the Media .
The three women convened to discuss the billboards posted by Georgia Right to Life that call black children " an endangered species , " and the related Georgia legislation that seeks to criminalize " the performance of an abortion based on the race , color , or sex of the unborn child or on the race or color of a parent of that child . "
The bill ( Georgia HB 1155 ) — which will get its third hearing in the Georgia House of Representatives today at 1:30 pm — and the billboards presuppose that a conspiracy is afoot to abort black babies and thereby reduce the black population .
But our nation 's not in the midst of an ethnic cleansing campaign — minority births may outnumber white ones in 2010 , and as several panelists point out , black women 's fertility is comparable to that of other groups .
And Ross maintains that the welfare of the black community is n't really what anti-choicers care about .
She says ,
It is very hard to persuade African - American women in the city of Atlanta that this legislation headlined by rural white Republicans is truly about saving black or South Asian children .
These are the same legislators when we look at their voting records that have fought against improving our schools , getting guns off the streets , getting children in the SCHIP program — I mean , these are not people whose votes indicate that they care about children of color once they 're here .

Slate 's William Saletan made a similar point last week :
[ T] here 's something odd about the billboards .
The child who appears beside the text is fully born .
Abortion does n't kill such children .
What kills them , all too often , is shooting .
If you wanted to save living , breathing , fully born children from a tool of extermination that is literally targeting blacks , the first problem you would focus on is guns .
They are killing the present , not just the future .
But the sponsors of the " endangered species " ads do n't support gun control .
They oppose it .

So if Georgia Right to Life and its allies do n't really care about saving black children from a supposed racist conspiracy ( and Ross also handily rebutted their claim that Margaret Sanger was a proponent of black genocide ) , then what do they want ?
Ross says the goal is not only to stir up opposition to abortion , but to build " a broader base of support in communities of color " and " to thwart the Obama agenda about implementing things like healthcare reform and immigration reform and reforming the financial institutions and climate change . "
She adds ,
I actually see this as an opening salvo , because if the right can deliver this bill in the state of Georgia [...]
I think it will embolden them to believe that around the country , they can drive a wedge into the African - American community and into other communities of color .

She also mentions that the Georgia bill — which could bar abortion clinics from even providing information about their services , discriminate against women of color by asking them questions white women are n't asked , and endanger doctor - patient confidentiality — already has a counterpart in Arizona .
The call ranged over a variety of topics in women 's health — Cullins , for instance , talked about Planned Parenthood 's retraining in response to Lila Rose 's recordings of staffers appearing to accept racially - motivated donations .
And Gilliam stressed that the real crisis in the African - American community was lack of adequate health care , not the abortion rate .
But perhaps the take - home message of the entire call was that the anti-abortion movement 's strategy of linking abortion with race is just that — a calculated tactic motivated by politics , not a real desire to help women .

Spirit Airlines to charge $ 45 for carry - on luggage
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Spirit Airlines will soon be the first of the major U.S. airlines to charge passengers to carry on their luggage .
Beginning in August , the carrier will slap on an additional fee of up to $ 45 for any bags placed in overhead bins , the carrier said Tuesday .
If you pay online in advance , it will cost you $ 30 to stow your carry - on in an overhead bin , but if you wait until you get to the gate , it will cost $ 45 .
Passengers may still place one personal item under the seat in front of them , free of charge .
The new carry - on fee went into effect Monday and applies to flights booked for Aug. 1 or later .
Fliers who pay in advance for their carry - on luggage will be the first to board the airplane , Spirit said .
" In addition to reducing fares even further , this will reduce the number of carry - on bags , which will improve inflight safety and efficiency by speeding up the boarding and deplaning process , all of which ultimately improve the overall customer experience , " Chief Operating Officer Ken McKenzie said in a statement .
At the same time , Spirit will lower fees for checked luggage .
Spirit Airline members will pay $ 15 for their first and second bags if they pay online , instead of the $ 19 and $ 25 that was previously charged .
Non-members , however , will pay more :
The first bag is $ 25 online and $ 45 at the airport ; $ 30 for the second bag .
While many other airlines also charge for checked luggage , they still allow passengers to stow carry - on luggage for free .
David Castelveter , a spokesman at Air Transport Association , which represents the leading U.S. airlines , said he 's not aware of any ATA members charging for carry - on luggage .
JetBlue ( JBLU ) lets passengers bring a carry - on bag as well as a personal item aboard with no extra fee .
Customers are also able to check their first bag for free , but a second checked bag costs $ 30 .
Other major airlines , including Delta ( DAL , Fortune 500 ) , Continental ( CAL , Fortune 500 ) , Frontier and United , all let passengers carry on one bag and one personal item for free , but charge fliers around $ 20 for the first checked bag and $ 30 for the second .
On a cold late - January evening , the emergency call lit up a phone line at the St. Louis Fire Department 's dispatch center .
A woman in her forties required immediate transport to a hospital .
The patient was unresponsive .
She lived in a second - floor apartment in south city .
And she weighed more than 500 pounds .
[ Editor 's Note : A correction ran concerning this paragraph ; please see end of article . ]
Jheree Coleman , a 26 - year - old EMT , was part of the emergency team that arrived within minutes aboard one the city 's thirteen ambulances .
" That second floor made it complicated , " she recalls .
" It took me , my partner , my supervisor — and four others in the fire truck — to get her down those stairs .
Must have taken us 30 minutes .
This is dangerous work . "
Tracy Barker has been an EMT with the city fire department for sixteen years and says the ranks of the grossly overweight are expanding at astonishing rates .
She 's seen it firsthand , and oh , yes , does she have stories to tell .
" We have a regular we 're always transporting , a lady with an abdomen so large that she has to rest it on a footstool in order to breathe .
" We 've had calls from patients — perpetually sick because of their weight — completely panicked because they can't reach the TV remote .
That 's how big they are .
You wonder who 's feeding them , enabling them .
" We see people so large that their skin can't stretch anymore , and so it cracks and begins to weep .
Some wait to call until they 're really , really sick because they know the ordeal of what it takes to carry them out and all the embarrassment of that .
And when you get there , they do n't smell so good .
Oh yeah , the smell can be overwhelming . "
Barker , 40 , goes on : " We got patients too weak to walk , so we have to put several sheets under them and slide them down the stairs .
We 're afraid the stairs are going to collapse — and we wonder to ourselves , ' Why do you live on the second floor ? '
" When I started , we had stretchers that accommodated 350 pounds .
Then it went to 500 pounds .
Now , it 's 700 pounds !
People are so big they can't even leave their homes .
We never used to see that before .
Never . "
Mario Montero , captain of the city fire department 's rescue squad , remembers a patient , his girth so vast , that the staff at Barnes - Jewish Hospital had to strap several mattresses together with duct tape in order to move him to another room .
Montero adds that it's not unusual for his three - person rescue unit — because the patients ' living quarters are so tight or the stairway so narrow — to extricate the super - sized hulks from their second - story window in what 's called a Stokes basket , a metal wire cage often used in search - and - rescue missions .
Ben Moss , a paramedic with Abbott Ambulance , a large medical - response company with a fleet of more than 100 ambulances operating in Missouri and Illinois , recalls a 1,000 - pound woman they carted home from a hospital not long ago .
The weighty chore could n't have been accomplished without the help of Abbott 's lone bariatric ambulance , a highly specialized vehicle equipped with reinforced shock absorbers and a motorized winch to lug a loaded gurney into the back .
Says Moss : " She was aware of her weight , and she , like a lot of bariatric patients , had a very great fear of being dropped . "
At his peak , Robert Earl Hughes tipped the scales at 1,041 pounds , had a 122 - inch waistline and a chest size of 124 inches .
In 1958 , when he died of congestive heart failure at the age of 32 , Hughes was thought to be the heaviest person on Earth , according to the Guinness Book of World Records .
Legend has it that the big man from Fishhook , Illinois , ( a farm hamlet about 20 miles southeast of Quincy ) was placed in a packing case made for a grand piano .
It took a crane to lower him into a grave behind a tiny church in Benville , Illinois .
In June 2007 a four - foot - tall monument was dedicated to Hughes .
It 's located near the feed store on Fishhook 's main street .
There 's a picture of him and an inscription that reads : " Robert Earl Hughes : The World 's Largest Man . "
Hughes was an oddity , of course , a freak of nature , who actually received celebrity treatment .
Now , more than a half - century later , " the big ones , " as medical responders have come to refer to the unpleasantly plump , are not at all uncommon — at least the ones weighing between 500 and 800 pounds .
Still , the problem is difficult to quantify , as there are a few hard statistics available .
In St. Louis , for example , no one measures what percentage of the 60,000 to 80,000 calls to the fire department 's Emergency Medical Services involve the morbidly obese , patients with a body mass index ( a ratio of weight to height ) of 50 or more .
Most of the information is anecdotal .
As William Barnett , a paramedic since 1975 , puts it : " All I know is that they 're getting bigger and bigger .
Some of them do n't even fit in the ambulance . "
Beyond the sometimes nauseating testimonials from emergency crews , there are a number of indicators that do in fact point to a burgeoning number of hugely overweight people in need of near constant medical attention .
As a result , not only are backs being strained by hoisting hundreds of extra pounds of blubber , but so , too , are city and municipal budgets , as expenses to move society 's most corpulent individuals to and from hospitals continue to spike .
Robert Hardy III , who heads up Emergency Medical Services , says the St. Louis Fire Department over the past five years has been forced to purchase expensive $ 6,000 stretchers , which can handle the heaviest of the heavy .
At the same time , the department has all but mothballed its smaller , van -size ambulances in favor of full - size trucks .
From 2000 to 2005 , according to a RAND Corporation study , the U.S. obesity rate increased by 24 percent .
But the number of people with a BMI over 50 grew 75 percent .
The Washington Post reported last month that the sales of stretchers designed for the extra large were expected to hit $ 50 million in 2012 , up from $ 29.6 million in 2004 .
Meanwhile , in Independence , Missouri , American Medical Response , one of the nation 's largest ambulance companies , recorded more than 60 transports in its bariatric ambulance in May 2009 .
That 's double the number from May 2008 and triple the number from January 2008 , the Kansas City Star reported last year .
The Star also noted that in 2007 , MAST , the city 's sole emergency medical services provider , carried only a couple of patients heavier than 400 pounds each month .
In 2009 , it averaged more than twenty such calls per month .
To all of this , EMS ' Chief Hardy can only sigh .
" I do n't know what to think , " he says .
" Society is just getting larger .
It 's a problem we just got to deal with . "
Correction published 3/9/10 : In the original version of this story , we erroneously stated that the St. Louis Fire Department ’s Emergency Medical Services operates 24 ambulances ; it operates 13 .

Controversial games streaming service OnLive will launch in the US on June 17th backed by Electronic Arts , Ubisoft , Take - Two Interactive , THQ and Warner Bros.
Interactive Entertainment .
Details for the cloud - based gaming service , which was unveiled amidst much attention at GDC last year , are to be given in a Wednesday keynote this morning at the GamesBeat one - day event at the 2010 Game Developers Conference .
The serivce launches on PC and Mac , and costs $ 14.95 a month , the firm told our sister magazine MCV .
That price " provides access to an ever - increasing library of high - end , new release game content and a host of exclusive community feature such as Brag Clips and massive spectating , " said COO Mike McGarvey
" Individual titles will be available for purchase or rental on an a la carte basis .
Specific game pricing , including rentals , purchases and loyalty programs , will be announced prior to the consumer launch event at E3 .
We ’ll also be announcing additional loyalty and discount programs for consumers in the coming months . "
Major publishers have already backed the service – and while specific titles , pricing and revenue share models will be made public closer to the E3 launch , McGarvey told us that a few of the launch games include Ubisoft ’s Assassin ’s Creed II and Prince Of Persia : The Forgotten Sands , as well as THQ’s Metro 2033 .
At GDC , the firm is also courting independent developers to help hem understand the benefits of distributing their games through OnLive as well as traditional retail and increasingly - prominent download channels .
" We ’re seeing the pace of title commitments accelerate dramatically as we approach our consumer launch , " said McGarvey .
" We ’re very pleased with the degree of publisher support received to date and have seen a rise in publisher interest in the OnLive Game Service as their focus begins shifting dramatically toward digital distribution . "
OnLive effectively streams game content direct to computers , without the need for a game download , and effectively cuts down the digital distribution process to its simplest essence .
The service launched in a closed beta late last year .
But what about the Micro Console – a small unit which plugs into a TV for those who do n’t just want to play on computers – which the firm touted at GDC last year .
And when does the service head to Europe ?
The MicroConsole has n’t been forgotten , said McGarvey – but the firm is focusing on the PC and Mac version first : " For the initial rollout of the consumer service , we are focusing on delivering high - performance games to PCs and Macs and we will be making an announcement regarding our plans for the MicroConsole rollout later on in the year . "
As for Europe : " We are very focused on launching the service in the US at the moment , but stay tuned on our European plans , " McGarvey told MCV .
A full interview with McGarvey will appear over on MCV very soon .
MOSCOW — Lawmakers pelted the podium with eggs and catcalls before stalking across the aisle , putting their colleagues in headlocks and engaging in other tactics not exactly covered by Robert ’s Rules of Order .
Smoke bombs were set off in the chamber .
Glue was poured into voting machines .
The legislative leader directed the session behind umbrellas held by his aides , to protect him from projectiles .
Ukraine ’s Parliament was supposed to conduct a weighty debate on Tuesday revolving around the country ’s sovereignty and relationship with neighboring Russia , but the proceedings often seemed more like a food fight in a high school cafeteria .
At issue was whether to ratify an agreement to extend the lease on a Russian naval base on the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine by 25 years .
In the end , it was narrowly approved , with 236 votes out of a possible 450 , but not before the Parliament appeared to do some damage to its own reputation .
The two sides even got into a shoving match and tug of war over a giant Ukrainian flag .
Ukrainian politics are contentious , and the Parliament is often rowdy .
Even so , Tuesday ’s session in the capital , Kiev , was exceptional , offering a glimpse of the raw emotions surrounding the country ’s divisive relations with Russia .
Mike Donahue is a hard worker
Lots of people are making fun of financial adviser Mike Donahue 's cry for understanding , and for lower tax rates .
I will join them .
Since I graduated in 1983 , I have been in straight commission sales and have had many 60 - to 70 - hour work weeks .
No secure salary , no big promotions , no pension — just me profiting through helping others while being subject to the swings of the economic cycle .
The first 20 years were tough , but it 's finally starting to pay off ...
I have more than most only because I 've worked harder than most and because I am a saver .
" Just me profiting through helping others . "
And profit Mike did :
Now he makes more than $ 250,000 .
I do n't want to get into a long argument about the role of luck in outcomes .
Suffice to say that Mike -- who 's pictured above -- is a white guy in a rich country who graduated from college and rode a series of unsustainable booms in the financial sector that ultimately did terrible harm to the economy .
But one of the things that people need to think harder about when they pop off about this stuff is the difference between comparing the incomes of people in the same sector and comparing the incomes of people in different sectors .
Hard work might account for some of why Mike makes more money than other financial planners .
But yesterday , I rode in a cab driven by an African immigrant who works during the day at a printing press .
Hard work does n't account for why Mike makes more money than that guy .
What does account for it , in part , are rules .
The rules of the game help decide who wins the game .
If basketball hoops were five feet tall , then the sport would n't be dominated by giants .
Same goes for policy rules .
The Bush tax cuts , for instance , made Mike richer than he would 've been if , say , he was a financial planner in Denmark .
Alan Greenspan 's low interest rates contributed to Mike 's financial well - being .
Government policy that encouraged the spread of universities helped Mike .
And if you look at the demographics of Congress , the rules are made by , well , people like Mike .
Andy Stern got at this well in our interview yesterday .
For people at the top , since they get to make the rules , the rules work really well , no matter how hard they work .
Whether you were born rich and the estate tax is reduced to virtually nothing , or you get legacy admissions into elite universities , there 's a lot of history and self - perpetuation of the rich to continue to be rich that has nothing to do with hard work .
Later in the op-ed , Mike drops a bomb .
" My patience and pocketbook are reaching the breaking point , " he complains .
" I am not for equal outcomes regardless of effort .
I 'm tired of being the mule .
Maybe I will quit and live on the dole for awhile . "
Maybe .
But if he thinks $ 250,000 is an equal outcome , he should give living on the dole a try .
He 'll soon learn that the rules written for people who are n't like him do n't feel all that equal after all .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2010 February 7
Explanation : Most galaxies have a single nucleus -- does this galaxy have four ?
The strange answer leads astronomers to conclude that the nucleus of the surrounding galaxy is not even visible in this image .
The central cloverleaf is rather light emitted from a background quasar .
The gravitational field of the visible foreground galaxy breaks light from this distant quasar into four distinct images .
The quasar must be properly aligned behind the center of a massive galaxy for a mirage like this to be evident .
The general effect is known as gravitational lensing , and this specific case is known as the Einstein Cross .
Stranger still , the images of the Einstein Cross vary in relative brightness , enhanced occasionally by the additional gravitational microlensing effect of specific stars in the foreground galaxy .
HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER HEALTH UPDATES ON TWITTER Frequent alcohol consumption by teenage girls may increase the chances that they will develop non-cancerous breast disease in their 20s and possibly breast cancer later in life .
Research published online April 12 in the journal Pediatrics found that girls who drank the most alcohol during their teen years — daily or nearly every day — were five times more likely to develop benign breast disease as young adults than were their peers who never drank or drank less than once a week .
Benign breast disease ( BBD ) includes a number of nonmalignant conditions .
Fibroadenoma , a noncancerous tumor , is the most common in those aged 30 and younger .
Study co-author Catherine Berkey , a biostatistician at Harvard Medical School in Boston , said that benign breast disease is known to boost the risk for breast cancer .
So does that mean that teens who drink alcohol are increasing their breast cancer risk early in life ?
" Our study may suggest that teen drinking increases the risk for breast cancer , whether in all females or in those who go on to develop BBD , but longer - term follow - up is certainly required " to confirm it , she said .
A unique aspect of Berkey 's study was that the girls assessed their drinking habits while they were teenagers .
Other studies have based their conclusions on adult women 's recalling their teenage drinking many years later .
" Our new study is the first in which alcohol data were collected during adolescence , with continued follow - up in the females as they develop disease , " she said .
The study involved 6,899 women who had become participants in the " Growing Up Today Study " when they were 9 to 15 years old .
Information on alcoholic beverage consumption was collected in a follow - up survey when the participants were 16 to 23 years old , and a survey done when they were 18 to 27 years old included questions on breast disease .
In all , 147 participants reported having benign breast disease , with 67 cases having been confirmed by biopsy .
When Berkey and her colleagues looked at the diagnoses of benign breast disease and drinking , they found that risk for benign breast disease rose along with the frequency of alcohol consumption : from a 1.5 increased risk for drinking one or two days per week , to a three times greater risk for those drinking three to five days per week , and to a 5.5 times greater risk for drinking six or seven days per week , when compared with those who never drank or who drank less than once per week .
Even once - a - week drinkers may not be absolutely safe , Berkey noted .
" I suspect there may be some small additional BBD risk for even small amounts of alcohol consumed during adolescence , " she said .
Teen years are a critical time for potential cancer - producing exposures , she said , because the mammary glands are undergoing rapid growth during that period .
Berkey said she suspects the link is due to alcohol increasing total estrogen levels , raising the likelihood of benign breast disease .
" For me , this is not a surprise , " said Dr. Patricia Ganz , director of cancer prevention and control research at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California , Los Angeles .
Regular alcohol consumption is known to increase a woman 's risk for both breast cancer and benign breast disease , she said , and " certain forms of BBD increase the risk of breast cancer . "
And though she described the new study as excellent , she cautioned that the sample size was relatively small .
" I would n't scare ( teens ) and say , ' You are going to get breast cancer if you drink , ' " Ganz said .
But , on the other hand , she added : " The public health message is , these young girls should n't be drinking anyway . "

Im used to doing cookies with a very doughey batter .
When i finished mixing all my cookie ingredients and saw how liquidy and gooey my batter turned out i panicked !
it looked more like a cake batter !
but just have faith and trust the pros sometimes ... its possibly the best cookies ive done so far ... so chewy and yum yum staright to the tum !
Rating : 5 stars I have made these cookies with pecan pieces & Nestles salted caramel chips instead of the extra chocolate chunks .
Always a hit .
My son and his friends scarf these up .
I make them ahead of Christmas by chilling dough , scooping them with an ice cream scooper and freezing them in ziploc bags .

Oh , I totally have a new favorite cookie recipe !
( And I 'm awfully good at baking cookies . )
I did take the excellent advice of those who came before and followed directions exactly , with the addition of some chopped walnuts , which are standard procedure with me .
I also found the dough far less sticky and troublesome after resting in the fridge for a day .
I baked them 13 minutes and may try to add an extra minute to the next batch , but I did enjoy the gooey center , so the jury 's still out .
Wonderful chocolate explosion in each bite !
Rating : 5 stars Cookies are perfect and have made these several times .
It helps to melt the chocolate over double broiler over very low heat .
It also helps to place the dough in the fridge for about an hour to firm it up .
I then shape them into small balls and place them on parchment paper and let them firm up again in the fridge .
Place them in ziplock bags in the freezer and bake whenever I need them .
Rating : 5 stars OMG !
I ’m in love !
These are my new favorite cookie .
My batch came out perfectly .
They were chocolately , fudgey , with slightly crisp , shiny tops .
What more could you want ?

Rating : 5 stars I loved this recipe and so did my classmates , I make them about once a week in one of my baking classes .
one problem I did have were the fats separating in the oven .
but thats easily fixed by mixing longer .
Rating : 5 stars Delicious and rich and moist and chocolatey .
My alterations : I added a lot of toasted walnuts .
I suggest baking one cookie by itself at first so you can determine how long to bake it for proper results .
I overbaked ( burnt ) the first tray because it was so hard to tell if the cookies were done or not .
Also , if you refrigerate the dough , it will firm up a great deal , and you should know that the chilled dough will not spread in the over , so shape the dough in the shape and thickness you want the baked cookie to be .
Overall this is a delicious recipe that I will make again .
Rating : 5 stars I followed the recipe exactly , they came out wonderful !
I used Plugra unsalted butter at room temp . , for the melting chocolate I used Scharffen Berger 70 % , for the chunks I used half Scharffen Berger and half Nestle semi sweet chips .
I was confused about the beating the eggs to light and fluffy .
I beat for about 2 minutes and added my melted chocolate , mine was still warm as I did n't see the review about cooling it ; seemed to be fine .
My dough was not really thin , it was more gooey and sticky .
I baked for 12 min. and made sure to rotate 1/2 way through .
They came out just like the picture !
They are rich , I think I 'll enjoy them with a glass of port , hubby will enjoy with milk .

This is one of my favorite cookie recipes .
I 've made them several times , and they always turn out great , and I get lots of requests for the recipe .
Here 's my super - secret tip for getting cookies that look just like the picture : READ and FOLLOW the instructions .
I find the comments below stating " The batter was runny .
I had to add more flour to make it more like a cookie dough " to be very frustrating .
The recipe specifically states the batter will be thin .
When the cookies are prepared following the instructions , the resulting cookies have a wonderful , unusual texture .
If you add extra flour , you 're altering the not only the texture , but also the taste of the cookies .
By the way , if your cookies turned out grey and bland , you used poor - quality chocolate .
Chocolate features quite prominently in the recipe .
If you use good - quality chocolate , you are obviously going to get a better - tasting cookie .
If your cookies turned out " thin and burnt " , that 's entirely on you .
Almost all of the negative reviews below are due to a lack of reading comprehension , an inability to follow directions , or an inexperienced baker .
Also , it 's been said many times , but some people still do n't get it .
If you are reviewing a recipe , review the original recipe as written , not the mess that you made by altering it beyond recognition .
I have no problem with tweaking recipes to your own tastes , and I even enjoy learning the creative changes other cooks have made to the recipe and how they turned out .
I , myself , like to use this recipe as the base for Black Forest cookies by adding cherries , cherry brandy , and some almond flour .
However , the rating of the recipe should always reflect the results of following the original recipe .
Rating : 5 stars
These cookies are to die for .
I did add some oatmeal , honey almonds , chopped until super fine in my processor to make 1 /2 cup .
I use the best Belgium Chocolate in both the chopped and morsels .
All I can say is that if you add 1 /2 teas of dried expresso ( instant ) that it brings these up to a major gourmet level .
This was a trick that the head chef shared with me years ago from Neiman Marcus that they use in their Chocolate Chip Cookie that they are known for .
Sorry I am not trying to change the recipe but I like that little extra crunch you get with adding a few of the above ingredients .

Remember to rotate your cookie sheet and do n't overcook .
12 minutes is just the right amount in my oven .
I find an entire pckg of chocolate chips too much , so I use about 2/3 bag .

This is the best double chocolate cookie recipe ever !
The cookies are moist and super fudgy .
If you are a chocolate lover you can't go wrong with these .
Follow the baking & cooling instructions carefully ( the cookies are a bit delicate before cooling ) .

This is exactly the moist , chocolaty treat I 've been craving .
For those of you who were dissatisfied I can only suggest you whip the egg mixture for 3 minutes , and use a very high quality chocolate .
I used dark chocolate couverture 64 % cacao pistoles as my melting chocolate and high quality milk chocolate chips at the end .
The cookies were shiny and cracked a bit around the edges when we took them out of the oven but still soft in the center and only needed 10 minutes .
Wonderful !

I was looking for a way to use up the grated chocolate I was given and needed to make a cookie .
I only found ones calling for cocoa powder .
This was such a blessing .
I used peanut butter chips instead of the chocolate chunks and they were great !!!

My husband & I have been making these cookies since 2006 including last night .
Usually as a triple batch ' cause you can never have too many cookies .
It is sometimes hard to find the Chocolate Chunks but I 've never struck out .
Rating : Unrated I made these cookies - LOVED THEM !
They came out amazing and tasted amazing !
I had to triple the recipe to make enough for my friends at school ( who are in love with me because of my cooking he - he ) and for my family !
They came out exactly like the recipe said they would !
Oh , and I only added the chunks in at the end .
I put the batter on the cookie sheets and added the chunks to each individual scoop of batter so each cookie had at least 3 chunks in it .
Rating : Unrated Sincere review ...
This recipe turned out awful .
I followed all directions to a T , even with my grandmother helping me ( a baker ! ) .
The cookies turned out a dull gray , not like the picture .
The first few cookies turned out okay but they were n't sweet or tasty , just tasted like the choc chunks inside .
They just LOOK okay , not taste good .
And all the rest burnt bc it did n't specify parchment paper or to grease the cookie sheet .
I am upset bc the ingredients were expensive and it was all wasted .
Rating : Unrated
Okay so I burnt the first batch to a crisp , let 's see how the second one looks .
( By the way , I 'm sure you 're mumbling and muttering how unprofessional I am but take into consideration that I 'm only 14 years old , LOL )
Rating : Unrated I agree with MaryLouH .
I followed the recipe to the letter and they came out great !
Pale color not flat and delicious .
Perhaps add some King Arthur Black Cocoa and will have a deeper chocolate color .
Rating : 5 stars Based on other reviews I was very hesitant to try this recipe - but so glad I did !
I 'm happy to say the cookies came out wonderful .
For others who had problems w/ them being flat I 'm going to venture to guess that the likely culprit / issue was not really beating the eggs - I was worried that I may have over beaten them but I 'm an experienced baker and I think that was key - along w/ letting the melted chocolate cool before adding it in .
These will be my go to choc cookie from now on !

However , like many reviews said that I tried to ignore because I wanted to try them so bad they are right .
These cookies are nothing but outrageously awful .
They are thin , flat , dry and chalk like .
There is no gooey goodness in any part .
I followed the recipe step by step and even read reviews that gave extra directions to ensure a great cookie but still they were awful .
These cookies are a letdown

This is a fantastic cookie !
The recipe is easy and the results are addictive !
Love that you can make these ( sorta last minute ) without having to wait for butter to come down to room temperature .
One of my top five cookies now -- people request them !

These are easy , delicious and look just like the photo .
I have been substituting 1 / 2 of flour with either almond flour or cashew flour ( I used cashew this time ) ,
It gives great flavor and added fiber .
This recipe did n't require a special trip to the store for any exotic ingredient , and turned out like professional quality cookie .
So sorry for those that did n't have luck , keep trying .
Also , all cookies require either parchment or grease .
I used parchment .

Rating : Unrated Made these today , and voila - DELICIOUS DISASTER !!!
It did not mention to GREASE the baking sheet or use of parchment paper .
Cookies came out runny , thin and flat as pancakes .
Once they cooled , they hardened and needed to be CHISELED OFF the baking sheet .
From reading other peoples reviews chocolate has to be completely cooled before adding to the batter and that is the only thing that I can think of that made them so runny .
However recipe SHOULD State GREASED sheet or PARCHMENT paper .

Made these delish cookies a few days ago and they came out perfect !
I followed the recipe exactly and baked them on a regular cookie sheet lined with parchment paper and had no problems .
They were crisp and glossy on the outside and soft and chewy inside and quite rich and chocolatey !
Yum !
I gifted a few to friends who wanted to know when I would be making them again - a big hit with everyone .
Add a glass of ice cold milk and you have heaven in your mouth : )

These cookies are VERY special .
I baked them for just 12 minutes and a day later they are still gooey and delicious on the inside .
This recipe achieves the cookie perfection I 've been trying to produce for some time .
Be warned though .
They are intensely chocolatey ( which for a chocolate fan is no complaint ! )
I took them in to work today and oohs and aaahs of cookie pleasure were heard throughout the office - try them out for yourself !

These are quite possibly the best cookies I have ever made .
Rating : Unrated Wanted a well received chocolate cookie and this one had so many positive reviews .
Was worried , as others mentioned , about the batter being too thin but did find that when the chips were added - an entire bag - that the dough thickened right up .
Mine were done at six minutes and eight minutes .
depending on the pan used .
( The dark , non -stick cooked more quickly . )
So , I would definitely check them and take them out when firm to the touch .
Added pb and chocolate chips , yum !
( and a dash of espresso )

These cookies are so amazing !
Instead of using chocolate chunks I used chocolate chips and it did n't really make a difference , they came out shiny and crackly , looking just like the recipe .
I realized that when the brown sugar and eggs are mixed together it does not become fluffy .. just in case any of you were wondering about that .
I also used 1 / 4 of a cup more brown sugar .

These cookies are AMAZING !
I bake cookies quite often , and these are by far the best chocolate cookies i have ever made .
The recipe is easy to make and comes out exactly as pictured .
The batter did seem extremely thin before mixing in the chocolate chunks .
I added about 1/3 cup extra flour just to thicken it up .
I definitely reccommend this recipe to the novice or experienced baker !

We all went nuts over this cookie !
Days later the chocolate chips were still melty and the cookie was delightfully soft inside .
I thought that the chocolate chips would be too decadent for me , so at the end I substituted about 2 ounces of semi- sweet chips for white chocolate ones - it perfectly balanced out the deep , chocolate taste of the cookies .
Rating : Unrated I am just finishing up with recipe and I type this .
My cookies look like the picture provided .
To those who have had trouble , you may have not whipped the egg and sugar mixture enough .
Another thing to check is to make sure that your baking powder is fresh and not expired ... simple , I know .
Also , I hand mixed the flour in .
It is more like a brownie batter , but it thickens as it sits .
I added a teaspoon of peppermint extract instead of vanilla and it is a great addition !

My all time favorite chocolate cookie recipe .
Do n't worry about batter seeming flat - 1/2 way through the cooking process the cookies will " fluff . "
Oil works in place of butter if needed .
Cookies are lighter in color than pictured .
Any type of chocolate chip ( chunk , morsels ) will work .

These cookies were to die for !!!
The key to making these cookies look just like the ones in the picture is : A ) making sure you melt the chocolate first and giving it time to cool down B ) make sure you REALLY BEAT your egg mixture or else the dough will be too thin C ) making sure you do n't over cook the cookie , if the dough is the texture of a brownie dough and you monitor its cooking time , the cookies should come out perfect !
Hope these tips helped and that you all enjoy !

Okay so I attempted twice to make these cookies , first time I thought the flour measurement was wrong so i added more flour , they tasted good but then i read the little note that said not to worry that they were runny .
Second batch i made I followed the recipe and they came out like flat pancakes and i had to scrap them off the cookie sheet ,
They are good but disappointing that they did n't turn out like the photo !!!
Ca n't say that I will be trying it again !
Rating : Unrated Okay , just made these amazing , dreamy cookies and be sure to use the recommended 2/3 cup flour .

To get scoopable dough , you must be VERY careful with your chocolate temperature .
If it 's just a few degrees too warm , you 'll get a loose batter instead of dough .
The chocolate should be the consistency of thick frosting before you add it to the flour mixture , so cool it off ( stirring often ) if necessary before that step .
Rating : Unrated
If the dough came out too runny , add 2 medium eggs instead of 2 large eggs .
I made this recipe twice .
First time came out perfect , second time the dough is too runny so I add a bit more flour instead of substitute with 2 medium eggs .
It came out great too .

Also if you want them to look just like the picture , reserve 1/ 2 c of the chocolate chunks and once you 've formed the cookies on the cookie sheet before baking , press some of the chunks into the top of each one .

If the batter turns out too runny , it 's most likely because you did n't beat the eggs sufficiently .
The eggs need to be beaten until light and fluffy - I had to beat mine on my stand mixer for about 4 minutes or so on medium to get enough air incorporated in them .
I followed the recipe to the letter and my dough came out gooey , yes but not runny .
I had no problem piling the dough high to make the cookies .
Rating : Unrated Sorry , this keeps cutting off my post !

My cookie " dough " was very runny , more the consistency of cake batter than a cookie dough .

Democracy and fair elections in the US are in grave danger .
What are we going to do about it ?
The Supreme Court 's recent Citizens United ruling removed restrictions on the amount of money that corporations can use to campaign for their preferred candidates .
The five justices who voted for the ruling endorsed the idea that corporations should enjoy the same constitutional rights as human beings .
Why is this ruling a threat to America ?
Corporations are not human .
They are legal creations .
They do n't eat , breathe the air , depend on health care , or do many of the other things that humans do .
They exist to make a profit .
Because of their wealth and size , corporations are far more powerful than humans .
The Citizens United ruling affirms the power of corporations to control the processes of regulation , taxation , and public policy , and to avoid accountability to the public .
For a hundred years , we 've had laws limiting the power of corporations over our government , because government in a democracy exists to serve the people .
Now that corporations can spend unlimited money to help candidates who serve their interests , politicians will more and more make decisions based on the demands of lobbyists rather than the people who elect them .
Real health care reform ?
Reducing greenhouse gas emissions to curb global warming ?
Fair wages , benefits , safer workplaces ?
Forget about it .
Republican and Democratic politicians already take millions in corporate contributions .
The Supreme Court 's decision will cement the Democratic and Republican parties ' status as subsidiaries of Wall Street , oil companies , defense contractors , insurance firms , media conglomerates , and other top corporations .
Election years will become the season of endless ads on TV and radio for candidates preferred by corporations .
Candidates who speak for the public interest wo n't have a chance against the flood of misleading corporate propaganda .
( If you think campaign ads are bad now .... )
What can we do to bring back democracy ?
" � Click !
Your TV remote is a powerful weapon .
You do n't have to listen to corporate lies and propaganda .
When you see corporate - sponsored political ads on TV , press the mute button .
Get your information about candidates from more reliable sources -- from newspapers , news web sites , and other sources that you trust .
Do n't believe the hype .
Stay informed ( read below for more background on corporate personhood and power ) .
" � Take the ' Democracy For Humans ' pledge : " I will vote for no candidate who takes corporate money . "
Let 's elect candidates who work for our own best interests and ideals .
Let 's declare our independence from political parties and politicians who depend on corporate campaign contributions .
" � Amend the US Constitution : demand a new amendment declaring that rights belong to people , not to artificial legal creations ( corporations ) , that money is not speech , that everyone has the right to vote and every vote must be counted .
Call your US Senators and US Representative , tell them to sponsor , promote , and vote for a ' Democracy For Humans ' amendment -- or you 'll never vote for them again .
More information : www.movetoamend.org
( Sign the petition )
" � Demand that Congress pass fair election laws .
Congress can require that campaign advertising include full disclosure and reveal who paid .
Congress can require TV and radio stations that use the public airwaves to broadcast ads by candidates who are n't swimming in corporate money .
State legislatures can pass ' clean election ' laws that assist candidates who do n't take corporate checks .
" � Help make ' corporate personhood ' a major political issue .
Write letters to the editor , call talk shows , post information online , challenge candidates at forums and debates .
Talk to your family , friends , and neighbors .
" � Urge your local city council to pass a resolution opposing corporate personhood .
Arcata , California , and other cities and towns have already passed such resolutions .
" � Use street theater : public rallies , with puppets and other kinds of spectacle are a great way to educate the public .
Corporate Power vs. Democracy
Are corporations evil ?
Should we hate them ?
A corporations is an association , authorized by a charter , for a specific purpose .
Corporations are by nature neither good nor evil .
They often perform necessary functions , such as manufacturing , services , and trade .
A business corporation should be accountable to the public , not just to major stockholders , CEOs , and profit margins .
When it betrays the public trust or commits a serious crime , a corporation should have its charter revoked and be dissolved .
When Exxon - Mobil , Lockheed Martin , Goldman Sachs , General Electric , Halliburton , Blackwater , or Disney have overwhelming power to determine the decisions of elected officials , our freedoms , rights , and well - being are in danger .
When Wall Street firms insisted that Congress strike down regulations like the Glass - Steagall Act , their recklessness caused the recent economic crisis , with milliions of lost homes and jobs .
When they press Congress to reduce , privatize , or abolish successful safety - net programs like Social Security , they place millions of older Americans and others at risk of destitution .
When big - box chain stores like Wal - Mart are allowed to take over a town 's economy , small businesses go under , Main Street falls into ruin , and minimum - wage no -benefit positions replace jobs with livable wages and good benefits .
When insurance companies can deny health coverage and medical treatment , people suffer and die .
When corporate polluters win exemptions from greenhouse gas emission laws , they endanger future generations .
When energy companies demanded control over oil resources in Iraq , the US went to war based on baseless claims about WMDs and other deceptions .
The Myth of Corporate Rights
A corporation is not human .
A corporation is a thing .
It 's a legal fiction , subject to the definition in the corporation 's charter and restrictions imposed by law .
A car is a thing , too .
Can a car possess rights ?
No .
A car does not have the right to drive down the street .
It has no will of its own , so the idea of rights for cars is absurd .
Instead , the car 's driver has the right to drive the car down the street , within certain restrictions .
The driver must have a driver 's license and obey traffic rules .
It 's just as absurd to say that a corporation has ' rights . '
When we say a company has the right to advertise its goods or services , what we really mean is that we recognize that advertising is part of the normal function of a business corporation , just as transportation is the normal function of a car .
Like a car without a driver , a corporation has no will of its own .
Its actions are guided by CEOs and other managers , owners and stockholders , a board of directors , or some combination of these people .
They profit through the corporation , by receiving salaries and bonuses or through their investments in the corporation .
When those who control the corporation use it to break the law , abuse their power , or violate the corporation 's own charter , then the corporate charter should be revoked -- just as the driver who violates traffic rules may lose the use of his or her car .
Corporations have become enormously powerful .
Who benefits from this power ?
Obviously , the CEOs , owners , stockholders , etc . ( Employees may work for a corporation , but they have no say in how it is run , except through the influence of independent unions -- which have become increasing powerless in recent decades . )
What does it mean when a corporation can influence government to act on its behalf , even when such actions are harmful to the public or to its own employees ?
It means that the CEOs , owners , stockholders , etc. enjoy power far beyond what the rest of us possess as individual citizens .
Those who defend corporate personhood , corporate rights , and the Citizens Unlimited decision are arguing for an inequality that threatens the basis of our democracy .
They support a new kind of aristocracy , an oligarchy of elite citizens who get their power from corporations .
CEOs , owners , stockholders , et al. already have the same constitutional rights as the rest of us .
When they use their corporations , armed with the myth of corporate rights , to expand their power so much that they dominate political campaigns , legislation , and the public debate on important issues , then our democracy is doomed ....
...unless
We the People take back our democracy and our election system .
Where did Corporate Power Come From ?
When the US Constitution was written , there was no mention of corporations .
The writers and signers of the Constitution remembered how Great Britain had given the East India Company , Hudson Bay Company , and other firms enormous power over the colonies .
For the first 100 years of US history , corporate power was restricted .
Corporations were chartered for a limited period of time and did not have limited liability .
They existed to serve the public good .
After the Civil War and the Emancipation Proclamation , Congress passed the 14th Amendment in 1868 , which was intended to give freed black slaves equal protection under the law .
But around the same time that racist Jim Crow laws were enacted , the protections of the 14th Amendment were in effect transferred from former slaves to corporations in a series of landmark Supreme Court decisions , beginning with Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad ( 1886 ) .
Hundreds of 14th Amendment cases were brought before the Supreme Court between 1890 and 1910 . 19 of them involved the rights of Black Americans and 288 addressed the rights of corporations .
The court sided with the corporations in more than 200 of these cases .
These decisions helped set off the Robber Baron Era of unrestrained corporate power , when factory workers suffered inhumane work conditions and farmers were at the mercy of unscrupulous banks and railroad companies .
Many Americans fought corporate power during the Robber Baron Era , seeking reforms like the eight - hour work day , job safety , and an end to child labor .
Groups like the Populist Party and , eventually , progressives like Teddy Roosevelt were able to get laws passed restraining corporate power .
Throughout most ot the 20th century , unions fought for and won the 40 - hour work week , benefits , workplace safety laws , job security , and good wages .
Congress passed laws preventing the excesses that led to the Great Depression and enacted Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid .
By the middle of the 20th century , millions of Americans enjoyed an unprecedented degree of prosperity because of these battles .
Corporations resisted these reforms every step of the way .
Many reforms were reversed in the 1980s and 1990s , when Presidents Reagan , Bush , and Clinton signed legislation striking down many regulations on corporations .
They used rhetoric about ' big government ' and manipulated fears about socialism to satisfy the interests of corporate lobbies , while wages and financial security for working people began to decline .
During the George W. Bush administration , corporate honchos actually wrote new legislation for Congress to pass .
Companies like Enron used ' corporate personhood ' to claim that the government had no right to open up their books after they swindled people .
Despite promises of change , President Obama appointed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , financial advisor Larry Summers , and others who espouse many of these same policies .
The result has been multi-trillion - dollar bailouts for the Wall Street firms responsible for the current mortgage crisis and economic meltdown , with minimal help for suffering homeowners and people who 've lost their jobs .
The Citizens United ruling eliminates one of the most important restrictions on corporate power and puts America in danger of a new Robber Baron Era .
The End of Democracy ?
The Citizens United decision comes nine years after a similar 5 - 4 Supreme Court majority delivered the politically biased Bush v. Gore ruling , which voided legitimate votes , handed the White House to George W. Bush , and held that the Constitution does n't guarantee anyone the right to vote .
Republicans benefit from the Supreme Court 's recent ruling -- but so do many ' moderate ' Democrats .
In 2008 , for the first time in recent history , the budget for lobbying , grassroots outreach , and advertising of the US Chamber of Commerce has surpassed the spending of both the Republican and Democratic National Committees .
' Moderate ' Democrats and Republicans share a bipartisan addiction to corporate contributions and a dedication to the idea that government should primarily serve big business interests instead of the people they were elected to represent .
In 2009 , they made sure that any health care reform plan placed before Congress would protect insurance and pharmaceutical manufacturing companies and do as little as possible for people in need of medical treatment .
They declared Medicare For All ( single - payer national health care ) " off the table " and sabotaged the public option .
These politicians should n't be called moderate .
They 're extremists who subscribe to an ideology of corporate power , profit , and privilege .
Media commentators and broadcasters like Rush Limbaugh have praised the ruling .
Their goal is an America far different from the one envisioned by our Founding Fathers and Mothers and by all those who 've fought for human rights , freedoms , and fairness for working people and those who are powerless .
They 've duped too many Americans into believing that what 's good for insurance companies , Wall Street firms , defense contractors , and other behemoths is good for America .
" We the People " does not mean corporations .
Unless we act now to defend the principle that free speech and other constitutional rights and protections belong solely to human beings , our democracy will be history .

It 's like they just can't help themselves .
OKLAHOMA CITY — The Oklahoma Senate approved several bills Monday that opponents say would make it more difficult or uncomfortable for women to get abortions , including one that would require women seeking the procedures early in their pregnancies to undergo an invasive form of ultrasound ... [ The law ] would require doctors to use a vaginal probe in cases where it would provide a clearer picture of the fetus than a regular ultrasound .
Oklahoma is one of the few states in the nation that already requires a woman seeking a legal medical procedure to undergo an ultrasound before having said legal medical procedure , whether she wants to or not .
But that 's not enough for the legislators of Oklahoma , so they want to make sure she has to look at a really , really good picture of the fetus before undergoing a legal medical procedure .
For her own good , of course .
Even if it 's completely unnecessary , invasive , and painful .
That 's how much they care about women down in Oklahoma .
" You 're going to force someone to undergo an invasive medical procedure , " objected state Sen.
Andrew Rice , D - Oklahoma City , who voted against the bill .
" You have to invasively put an instrument inside the woman .
This could be your 15 - year - old daughter who was raped . "
Yeah , but who cares about your 15 - year - old daughter ?
We 're talking about informing women !
State Sen. Anthony Sykes , R- Moore , who sponsored the ultrasound bill , said the goal was to provide women seeking an abortion with as much information possible before they had the procedure .
And that 's why one of the other bills heading to the governor 's desk would require women to disclose private information to the state before obtaining a legal medical procedure .
For their own good .
Another bill would require a woman seeking an abortion and her doctor to complete a 38 - question form that asks , among other things , the woman 's age , race , education , number of previous pregnancies and reason for seeking an abortion .
The bill would also require women to disclose to the state their marital status and method of payment for the legal medical procedure .
Because it 's super important for the state to have this information to figure out how to reduce abortions impose further restrictions on women 's access to a legal medical procedure .
What 's next ?
A law that requires women to write a 100 - word essay from the perspective of the fetus before they 're allowed to obtain this legal medical procedure ?
You know , just to make sure they have all the necessary information .
On Morning Joe , Karl Rove 's ex-dancing partner David Gregory is asked whether President Obama will be seen as courageous for sticking to his guns if the health care bill passes .
There are so many things wrong with his response it's hard to know where to begin , but I 'll just start with how completely , utterly ridiculous it is to compare invading another country that was not a threat to us to passing this health care bill , no matter how flawed it might be .
And Bush was " courageous " ?
Really David Gregory ?
And Iraq is in a " better place now " after we bombed the hell out of that country and caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of refugees ?
Are you f-ing kidding me ?
And surprise , surprise he throws in a bit of fear mongering Republican rhetoric that the government can't run anything for good measure .
Gregory : Look Bush was courageous too on Iraq .
He stuck to his guns on Iraq and that did n’t work out so well .
Even if Iraq is in a better place now it did n’t help him politically .
He certainly stuck to his guns .
I think health care is different and I think Tom is right because the White House does make an argument that once you get it passed , once you have the achievement it starts affecting people ’s lives , then they see some of the benefits of it .
But it ’s how long that takes and look this is also not happening in a vacuum .
It ’s not just that we ’re waiting for health care reform .
There ’s a lot of things that are happening all at once the government is involved in .
The lack of trust in government is what ’s so ah… really the backbone of this argument against Washington and whether Washington is broken right now .
Americans do n’t trust government to run complex systems .
They need to just move this whole show over to Cluster Fox and be done with it .
I keep twisting and turning my iPad with childlike wonder while reading the familiar tale of the adventures of a girl named Alice .
For the first time in my life , I 'm blown away by an interactive book design .
Advertisement
Alice for the iPad is a cute app which contains a slightly interactive version of a beloved story .
It 's not interactive to the point of annoyance and tackiness , but instead full of clever little touches like mushrooms that you can toss around a room with a twist of your iPad or an Alice who grows and shrinks as you move your gadget around .
The app is available for $ 9 or as a free " lite " version .
And while it does n't seem to be intended for adults , I could n't be more fascinated by it .
It 's quite possible the cleverest book I 've seen so far and exactly how I dreamed books would look one day .

At Libreplanet 2010 , I was in a discussion with the MonkeySphere and EFF folks about how to encourage every website to offer ssl by default .
The general idea is to stop local traffic snooping and provide more security by default .
During the discussion , it came up that I disable all of the Certificate Authorities in my systems and selectively trust the ssl certificates from individual websites .
I 've been doing this for years .
Apparently my admission was a shocking statement to many .
The group asked me to document my Firefox setup and what life is like without any trusted CAs .
Seth from the EFF has a quick post about possible concerns over the CAs in your browser .
I used to rely on the Certificate Patrol Firefox Extension to monitor changing certs .
I generally use FreeBSD and Debian - based linux distributions for my operating systems .
After I install firefox , I rename libnssckbi.so to something else ( like libnssckbi.so.saved ) .
Restart Firefox ( see below for option two ) .
Firefox should no longer validate ssl certs automatically .
Browse to a secure website , like https://torproject.org/.
You should get the intentionally scary " This Connection is Untrusted " certificate error page .
However , you should expect this error as there are no more CAs to validate against .
Click " I Understand the Risks " .
Click " Add Exception " .
Firefox should retrieve the certificate .
Click " View " .
This is where it gets interesting .
How do you validate the certificate ?
It depends on the other end .
For sites I worry about , like my bank or favorite shopping stores , I call support and ask for the SSL fingerprint and serial number .
Sometimes the support person even knows what I 'm talking about .
I suspect they just open their browser , click on the lock icon and read me the information .
Generally , it takes some work to get the information .
Further , I 'll compare the cert received through Tor and through non-Tor ssh tunnels on disparate hosts .
However , you only have to do this checking once per cert .
Once you have it , Firefox stores it as an exception and , if the cert does n't change between visits , does n't interrupt you with the cert error page .
Am I too paranoid or dis-trusting of CAs ?
Probably .
I have a few concerns about this process , too .
Does the list of certs in my browser open me up to unique fingerprinting in some way ?
Would I notice if a Packet Forensics device was used ?
Unless someone screwed up , I doubt it .
And a seldom asked question is , have I ever caught ssl certs being faked or changed by a man - in - the - middle ?
Yes I have .
What would I like to see rather than implicitly trusting centralized CAs ?
I very much like the model used by gpg and the web of trust .
I think it 's completely infeasible right now for the vast majority of people using the Internet today .
However , using computers was infeasible for the vast majority of people merely a decade ago .
Progress happens quickly .
( option two )
I generally remove all of the CAs as well , even though I think it 's just a display issue at this point .
To do so , go into Preferences , Advanced , Encryption tab , click View Certificates .
Then just manually cycle through the remaining CAs and delete them all .
I started writing a script to do this automatically , but it seems to change in each version of Firefox .
If someone has a better / more automatic way to do this , I 'd like to hear about it .
Now you have no CAs .
The key service sector is continuing to drive the economy forward
The UK economy is forecast to outstrip its G7 peers in the second quarter of this year , says the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .
The OECD predicted the UK would grow at an annualised rate of 3.1 % in the second quarter of 2010 .
Such a rate would put the UK ahead of the US , Japan , Germany , France and Italy - but not Canada .
The British Chambers of Commerce also said the UK had avoided a double - dip recession in the first quarter of 2010 .
However , the BCC warned that the UK 's recovery was weak and there remained risks of setbacks in the future .
' Fragile ' recovery
On a global level , the OECD cautioned that overall growth would be slower in the main industrialised nations during the first half of 2010 .
" Despite some encouraging signs on activity , the fragility of the recovery , a frail labour market and possible headwinds coming from financial markets underscore the need for caution in the removal of policy support , " its report said .
ANALYSIS By Hugh Pym , Chief economics correspondent
On the face of it here is some good news for the UK economy and the government defending its record .
The UK may have come out of recession later than most of the other leading economies .
But now the OECD is forecasting that it will grow at a faster rate than the average for the eurozone giants , Germany , France and Italy in the first half of this year .
Germany , according to the OECD , will lurch back into negative territory with falling output in the first quarter .
But the think tank says the overall picture is fragile .
Continued weakness in the UK's main European trading partners will be no cause for celebration here .
British exporters will find life tougher and that could dampen the UK 's own growth prospects .
Eurozone growth lowered to zero
The British Chambers of Commerce survey of 5,500 UK businesses suggested the service sector was the main bright spot in the UK economy .
A separate report on the service sector , in the form of the purchasing managers index ( PMI ) , suggested that it slowed down in the last month of the quarter , although that was compared to a particularly strong figure in February .
The two are not strictly comparable .
Unlike the BCC , the PMI does not include retailers and also only covers the month of March .
Where the two reports do agree is that the economy is brightening , although it remains patchy and fragile .
The director general of the BCC , David Frost , told the BBC : " Any thoughts we may have slipped back have not materialised , but the recovery needs to be nurtured . "
It warned that the recovery was weak and " serious risks of a setback remain " , with the manufacturing sector still struggling .
Paul Smith , senior economist at Markit , which co-produces the PMI , said : " The UK recovery remains on track , with the service sector posting a pace of expansion consistent with those seen at the end of 2009 . "
Manufacturing orders for the first three months of this year were little higher than in the previous three months , according to the BCC , but new orders continued to fall and employment in the sector suffered a setback after an encouraging fourth quarter in 2009 .
The UK economy emerged from recession in the final quarter of last year , after six consecutive quarters of contraction .
The latest official figures show the economy grew by 0.4 % in the last three months of 2009 , up from the original estimate of 0.1 % .

A U.S. court issued a summons in January for North Korean Foreign Minister Park Ui-chun over allegations that the North was involved in the abduction of South Korean pastor Kim Dong - shik and Hezbollah attacks against Israel , according to Voice of America .
VOA 's report was based on a Certificate of Mailing obtained from a federal district court in Washington D.C. Kim 's family filed a compensation su it against North Korea in April last year after the pastor , a U.S. resident , died following his kidnapping by North Korean agents in China in 2000 while helping defectors there .
Also , 30 Americans filed a lawsuit against North Korea in April last year claiming that North Korea supplied weapons to Hezbollah , which used them to attack Israel in 2006 .

Hi everybody –
After 11 years of operating Fliiby and more than 200 millions visitors globally we ’re shutting down the service today .
What happened ?
Many things led to this decision .
11 years … .
Fliiby lived , Fliiby died .
It was an OK service , one of first - mover 's in the file sharing industry , that tried to organize worlds first file library by directly supporting the content creators .
Some people liked it , some did n’t , but that does n’t matter anymore .
The world evolved and so have we .
We had ups and downs , we were a passionate bunch , we had fun and we were very , very lucky — until we were n’t so lucky anymore , but we did n’t quit .
We focused on new things and that ’s now where we want to dedicate all our efforts .
This is why this story ends today , with no regrets and much learnings .
Thank you to all of you who worked with us !
Our users , employees , investors , friends and family .
Till next venture ...

If depression has an evolutionary purpose , it ’s certainly not obvious .
Depression makes people consider suicide and less interested in sex , which does not encourage the species ’ survival .
But two evolutionary psychologists theorize that depression ’s purpose is enhanced mental skills .
Sadness focuses the brain ’s attention on a conflict , and makes you better - equipped to make good decisions .
A fascinating New York Times magazine article entitled Depression ’s Upside explains that the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex ( VLPFC ) is the part of our brain that controls what we pay attention to .
Several studies found an increase in brain activity ( as measured indirectly by blood flow ) in the VLPFC of depressed patients .
Most recently , a paper to be published next month by neuroscientists in China found a spike in â€œfunctional connectivityâ€ between the lateral prefrontal cortex and other parts of the brain in depressed patients , with more severe depressions leading to more prefrontal activity .
One explanation for this finding is that the hyperactive VLPFC underlies rumination , allowing people to stay focused on their problem . [ … ]
Human attention is a scarce resource â€ ” the neural effects of depression make sure the resource is efficiently allocated .
Therefore , when you ’re depressed , your brain kicks into total - focus mode , and sets you into a cycle of rumination on the problem at hand .
The downcast mood and activation of the VLPFC are part of a â€œcoordinated systemâ€ that , Andrews and Thomson say , exists â€ œfor the specific purpose of effectively analyzing the complex life problem that triggered the depression .â€ 
If depression didnâ€™t exist â€ ” if we didnâ€™t react to stress and trauma with endless ruminations â€ ” then we would be less likely to solve our predicaments .
Wisdom isnâ€™t cheap , and we pay for it with pain .
Not everyone agrees with the positive spin on why depression exists , mostly because there are so many different types of depression –some triggered by events and problems , and others that persist for years without an obvious cause .
Ed Hagen , an anthropologist at Washington State University who is working on a book with Andrews , says that while the analytic - rumination hypothesis has persuaded him that some depressive symptoms might improve problem - solving skills , he remains unconvinced that it is a sufficient explanation for depression .
â€ œIndividuals with major depression often donâ€™t groom , bathe and sometimes donâ€™t even use the toilet , â€  Hagen says .
They also significantly â€œreduce investment in child care , â€ which could have detrimental effects on the survival of offspring .
The steep fitness costs of these behaviors , Hagen says , would not be offset by â€œmore uninterrupted time to think.â€ 
Still , those who suffer from depression do get the benefits of enhanced mental skills .
Joe Forgas , a social psychologist at the University of New South Wales in Australia , has repeatedly demonstrated in experiments that negative moods lead to better decisions in complex situations .
The reason , Forgas suggests , is rooted in the intertwined nature of mood and cognition : sadness promotes â€œinformation - processing strategies best suited to dealing with more - demanding situations .â€ 
This helps explain why test subjects who are melancholy â€ ” Forgas induces the mood with a short film about death and cancer â€ ” are better at judging the accuracy of rumors and recalling past events ; theyâ€™re also much less likely to stereotype strangers .
These mental boosts are often responsible for quality creative output .
In a survey led by the neuroscientist Nancy Andreasen , 30 writers from the Iowa Writersâ€ ™ Workshop were interviewed about their mental history .
Eighty percent of the writers met the formal diagnostic criteria for some form of depression .
A similar theme emerged from biographical studies of British writers and artists by Kay Redfield Jamison , a professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins , who found that successful individuals were eight times as likely as people in the general population to suffer from major depressive illness .
( Emphasis mine . )
Even though I quoted it at length , this whole article is worth the read , especially for folks who tend toward depression .
Knowing about the ways sadness can benefit you just might make you feel a little better .

Facial Flushing Causes
Flushing is nothing but an allergy that occurs due to skin dilates in the blood vessels and also flushing can occur due to the activity of nerves in the blood vessels due to sweating agents in our intake food that acts directly on the blood vessels and causes flushing .
There are many causes for flushing in the face let us see each and every causes in detail ,
Intake of alcohol .
Food addictives .
Eating habits .
Neurological problems .
Drugs .
Other causes of fleshing .
Flushing due to alcohol :
Asian people are prone to attack by flushing because of alcohol that cannot be cured unless they stop drinking it because for people who are drinking alcohol gets allergies in their face and a well known in this category is face flushing .
Tyramine and histamine are substance in certain beverages like beer and wine that can cause flushing in the face .
Flushing may also occur due to certain chemical reaction by drinking beer and expose to certain chemical vapor that are produced in the industry such as trichloroethylene vapor , N , N dim ethyl form amide can cause flushing .
Certain drugs can cause flushing to the people drinking alcohol .
Let us see that drugs that causes flushing in the face : they are disulfiram , chlorpropamide , calciumcarbamide , phentolamine , and metronidazolea .
For some flushing comes because of mushrooms also i.e. when they eat mushroom with alcohol they prone to this .
Flushing due to food additives
Monosodium glutamate which is used as a preservative in the Chinese restaurants may also cause flushing so it is known as Chinese syndrome .
Sodium nitrite is another preservative that is used in certain foods like cured meats , bacon , salami , ham may also cause flushing in the face accompanied with a headache .
Sulphides that is present in certain products like beer , wine , desserts , fried and frozen vegetables , prawns , milk products may also cause face flushing for certain people .
Flushing occurs with eating :
It is very common that at certain weather condition foods which are common may cause flushing such as spicy food and also hot beverages may cause flushing .
Flushing can come one sided for certain people because of some sweating agents .
Gustatory flushing is another type of flushing that can occur along with excessive salvation , tear production and nasal secretion that come with no history of parotid gland injury .
Patients who are suffering from flushing should not in take chili pepper that can cause flushing immediately .
Face flushing is associated with dumping syndrome which can is caused due to racing heart , tummy upset .
Which can also occur due to a surgery in the face and also syndrome becomes worst after menopause .
Neurological flushing :
Anxiety may cause flushing .
Brain tumors may also cause flushing .
Migraine headache causes face flushing .
Hyper tension also causes flushing .
Drugs causes flushing :
Calcium tablets can cause flushing on the face for some people .
Morphine may cause flushing because body will not accept these kinds of drugs for some people .
Thyroid releasing hormone may also cause face flushing .
Systematic steroid can cause more side effects and also it leads to flushing .
Other causes for flushing :
Headache , sickness , vomiting may cause flushing as well .
Diarrhea can produce flushing .
Characinoid tumor can cause fleshing to the people .
Treatments for facial flushing :
Beta - blocker :
Beta blocker is a different combination of drug that can be used to block certain hormones that can cause flushing in the face and some other parts .
These drugs act on the nervous system and can help us to block the hormone .
Let us see propanolol which is used for treating migraines .
SSRI :
SSRI is a type of drug that can be used as an antidepressant medication tool that can be used widely to treat depression , anxiety disorders and personality disorders .
[ youtube gXLaa74Dzlc 425 344 ]
The powerful substances that is present in the drug acts on the brain to work properly .
Serotonin is a substance that is present in the brain and when it is in low level it can cause depression that can be treated using SSRI drug .
These drugs can also stop flushing .
EREDICANE :
Eredicane is a drug which is used to treat flushing by in taking one pill per day that can produce considerable effects by reducing the effects of flushing but if we intake more pills that can produce more flushing in the body so the dosage should be taken carefully .
Certain drugs like aspirin can produce good results but it is not widely recommended because it is used for treating migraines that cause more trouble to the people who are affected by this disease .
Flushing can be stopped by taking proper medications .

Now comes the time that we need to address actual characteristics of different frequencies , as well as the different octaves that humans can hear .
( As in , how many are there actually ? )
As always , let ’s follow the flow of logic .
The simple question first :
How many octaves are there in the human hearing range of 20 - 20kHz ?
The answer is 10 .
If we take the lowest frequency humans can hear , which by now you know is 20 Hz , and then simply double that number until we reach the 20 k range , we ’ll end up with 10 total octaves encompassing the 20 - 20 k Hz range .
Here is the exact break down :
20 Hz | Octave 1 40 Hz | Octave 2 80 Hz | Octave 3 160 Hz | Octave 4 320 Hz | Octave 5 640 Hz | Octave 6 1280 Hz | Octave 7 2560 Hz | Octave 8 5120 Hz | Octave 9 10240 Hz | Octave 10 20480 Hz
Now , here is a little side note : I ’m sure you have all heard the terms “ 1 octave ” , “ 1/3 octave ” , or even “ 2/3 octave ” EQs .
Let ’s keep it simple and not over - think it .
Those are just more subdivisions between octaves to get more accurate or surgical tone shaping from an equalizer .
I ’m sure all of you at some point have worked with equalizer units of some sort , so I wo n’t muddy everything up here by detouring into an EQ tutorial ; suffice to say , everything that happens , no matter how small the subdivision , is all between 20 Hz - 20k Hz .
Those 10 octaves are our focus .
Continuing with our overarching theme of frequency training , I would be grossly negligent if I did n’t give you the basic “ characteristics ” or “ tonal qualities ” of our 10 octaves .
This is where you must recall the homework assignment in which you had to document the sonic qualities heard in your own “ shorthand ” .
If you did n’t do it before , please take 10 minutes to go back and do it now – it ’s important !
Now then , time to compare notes :
Characteristic Sounds : Bands 1 -
5
I ’ll preface this by saying that although there are countless sounds and tones in our world ; they all do share similar qualities .
Let ’s hone in on some of those !
We ’ll focus on the lowest 5 octaves for now and the latter 5 for the next article in the series .
Octave 1 ( 20 - 40 Hz )
This is your sub low region .
Notes here are felt more than actually heard .
VERY high end speakers will reproduce this range … but it will still be largely inaudible !
Octave 2 ( 40 - 80Hz )
Now this is where you audible musical low end is found .
This is where you EQ a kick drum for more oomph .
Same for a bass guitar .
BUT …. be careful !
Too much , and you risk turning things into a rumbling mess , AND you are wasting all that energy which will cost you overall volume !
FYI : This is one of the first places we ( mastering engineers ) trim back to balance your mix and get more overall volume .
Excessive low end requires tremendous power .
It ’s very easy to get carried away in this frequency area .
Let ’s face it …. it feels great when you can , well , feel the music !
Octave 3 ( 80 - 160Hz )
We are still in the bass range here .
( More “ upper bass ” actually ) I really like this area , since you can dial in a lively punchy bassy sound , AND avoid the dreaded excessive low end rumble .
Hint : GREAT place to lock bass guitar and kick drum together .
Also wonderful for distorted low tuned guitars .
Octave 4 ( 160-320Hz )
This range has many un- flattering names which I wo n’t utter here .
It is a transitory octave , and sadly highly misunderstood .
This is the crossroads between upper bass and low midrange .
Too much boost in this area and you have sludge filled , murky , and wooly sounds .
Too little , and your music sounds thin and lifeless .
This region is also a common meeting ground for a lot of musical instruments ’ fundamental or dominant frequencies .
Look back at all the past articles ’ examples …
That last sentence is why this octave is so misunderstood and misused .
Consider this octave a “ tie - in ” point for your whole mix of instruments !
Note : I have purposely avoided discussing pitch ranges for instruments , since I want you to really focus on the sound here regardless of the sound source .
The only exception is with Octave 4 , for the reason mentioned above .
Octave 5 ( 320-640Hz )
We are in low midrange land here .
If Octave 4 is the common “ meeting ground ” for musical instruments ’ fundamental or dominant frequencies , then this midrange octave is where all of those voices fight for dominion .
The midrange octaves ( 5 and 6 ) are THE MOST IMPORTANT frequency range .
Read that sentence again .
This octave ( and octave 6 to be discussed in the next article ) is where you decide the dominant instrument or vocal that will project forth ahead of the others .
At the same time , more subtle fine - tuning , gives the rest of the instruments a loud and clear voice .
Consider this to be the “ projection ” octave(s ) .
Why ?
Simple answer :
This is the most sensitive range we can hear .
There is an old mastering adage :
Get the midrange right and everything else will fall into place .
Once you understand that almost all sounds we hear are prominent when featured in the midrange band , then the above statement makes sense .
It took me years to learn that !
Once again , the midrange can be misunderstood – and misused as well .
Too much , and you end up with “ boxiness ” .
Too little , and you ’re thinning out the herd again .
You end up with all bass , high mids and treble , but no real volume or authority .
Tread carefully here !
Homework
This will be a simple assignment .
We will use some of the same sounds we used before in order to maintain constant “ control ” subjects .
The familiar sounds we will use are :
Kick Drum
Snare Drum
Floor Tom
For EQ boosts I will use common starting points that most EQs feature :
31 Hz ….. for Octave 1
….. for Octave 1 62 Hz ….. for Octave 2
….. for Octave 2 125 Hz … for Octave 3
… for Octave 3 250 Hz … for Octave 4
… for Octave 4 500 Hz … for Octave 5
Tech note : I will use excessive boosting ( WAY more than “ proper ” EQing ) for the sole purpose of making those sonic characteristics stand out !
Practice Tracks
Remember :
You can save these to your computer or MP3 player to practice any time .
For the graphical player , press ‘ Download ’ while the clip ’s playing .
For the plain links , just right - click and “ Save As … ”
Steps for you
Listen to each sample “ flat ” – the original , un - EQed version .
This is to refresh and establish an anchor point .
( I trust you are starting to see the importance of reference or anchor points ! )
Now listen to each sample at each of the five octaves discussed .
There are 5 versions of each samples , each EQd specifically to highlight the characteristics of the 5 octaves discussed .
Characteristics and sound manipulations are literally endless ; but as usual , we build on the main ones …
Anchor points , Anchor points , Anchor points !
Listen , listen and listen again !
The lesson objective is to familiarize you with each characteristic discussed .
That ’s it !
Do n’t over think it .
Just listen and listen .
By repetition and rote you will start to become familiar with these sonic “ flavors ” .
That ’s it for now !
Simple homework right ?
Conceptually , and on the surface , yes !
But consider this :
How good a chef would one be if he / she did n’t know the taste of salt ; or sugar ; or cinnamon ; or , actually , any of the basic culinary ingredients ?
How well could that chef prepare even the simplest of dishes ?
See my point ?
In our next article we ’ll be looking at the top 5 octave bands in a similar way .
For now , focus on these low and midrange octaves !
Bonus Question
Here ’s a reminder of the mystery bonus question at the end of the last article :
Q : How do you go about finding which frequency to EQ , when trying to fix a problem ?
( It does n’t matter what the issue is ; boominess , shrill , thin , too boxy sounding , etc . )
Hint :
This method will also double up as a great way to locate a dominant frequency !
The answer is called “ frequency sweeping ” .
It involves the use of a parametric equalizer .
( If you do n’t know what a parametric equalizer is , there ’s a great introduction over at AudioTuts + )
Here are the steps :
Play the audio clip in question through EQ bypassed or set flat .
( Just to establish a baseline . )
Reduce the overall output of signal at the EQ output stage by about 1/3
( you ’ll see why in a second ! )
Now pick just one band of the EQ and turn the gain of that band ALL the way up .
( Naturally that will cause a huge volume boost …. hence the pre-emptive strike of step 2 ) Set the bandwidth control to the mid point .
Bandwidth determines how far of an influence the frequency and gain control have on the adjacent and tangential frequencies .
A wider bandwidth has more of an overarching influence , where as a really narrow bandwidth is razor sharp and focused only on the frequency selected .
Since we are on an exploratory mission , I say a good half way point is the right compromise .
Play the audio clip and slowly start to sweep through the whole frequency range , from 20 Hz all the way up to 20kHz .
As you slowly do this , eventually you will hit the frequency that resonates ( “ mirrors ” ) with the frequency you are having an issue with .
Once you get to that point , stop .
Check the frequency , and write it down .
Reset the EQ to flat , set the volume back up to normal .
Play the audio again , only this time , dial in the frequency you located in step 5 , and slowly reduce the gain of that frequency .
The amount of reduction necessary will vary , but you ’ll adjust accordingly until the problem spot is tamed down .
Notice , when you are performing step 5 , that the frequency that resonates with the “ problem ” frequency will usually increase in volume drastically .
Congratulations !
As a bonus point , you have just located a dominant frequency of your sound source .
Now , keep in mind it might not always be the main , or fundamental frequency , but it will still get you in the ball park .
Grant you , this is a cumbersome way to find a frequency , especially when there are easier ways to locate frequencies ( e.g. spectrum analyzers ) ; but if you are in a position where you do n’t have the luxury of analysis tools , believe me , this will save the day .
And you WILL find yourself in less than ideal situations in which you will have to perform a little creative engineering …
And now for this week ’s bonus mystery question :
What is special or unusual about the floor tom sound samples ?
I ’m purposely leaving this one broad and open ended !
Hint :
The answer has to do with “ resonance . ”
Answer next time !
Until then ….

The defendants said they had invited their financial adviser for a holiday Four German pensioners have been found guilty of kidnapping the financial adviser they blamed for US property investments that went awry .
The court found that the four , aged 61 to 80 , abducted James Amburn and tried to force him to refund 2.5 m euros ( £ 2.25 m ; $ 3.4 m ) in lost investments .
They took him from his home in western Germany and drove him 450 km ( 280 miles ) to southern Bavaria .
He was freed after hiding a message to call police in a fax to his Swiss bank .
The defendants had argued that they had invited Mr Amburn for a short holiday in upper Bavaria .
But the judge in Traunstein , Bavaria , ruled that it was a " spectacular case of self - justice " and that in Germany , people could not take the law into their own hands .
Lake Chiemsee is an island of peace and tranquillity .
This is a popular German holiday destination .
But it is also the scene of a bizarre crime

They were found guilty of offences ranging from kidnapping to grievous bodily harm .
The ringleader of the group , 74 - year - old retired architect Roland Kaspar , was sentenced to six years in prison .
His accomplice , a 61 - year - old businessman , was sentenced to four years .
Two women , one of them Kaspar 's 80 - year - old wife , received suspended sentences .
The trial of another suspect , aged 67 , has been postponed because he has health problems .
Coded fax
When the group 's attempts to recover their money in the courts failed , they kidnapped Mr Amburn from his home in Speyer , Rhineland - Palatinate , in western Germany last June .
They tied him up with tape and gagged him , put him in a box in the boot of a car and drove him to Bavaria .
Along the way , they beat him up , breaking two ribs when he tried to flee during a stop .
They finally locked him in a well - prepared basement of a house close to the Chiemsee lake in Bavaria .
He was then forced to sign papers promising to refund the money the pensioners had lost in the US property crash .
But Mr Amburn managed to insert a message to call police in a fax sent to his Swiss bank .
The bank then raised the alarm with German police , who stormed the lakeside house .

And on the other side , clinging to the fence like crumbling concrete moss , is the city of Nogales , Mexico .
You might think this was one city sliced down the middle , were it not for the fact that the Mexican side looks much poorer .
These are two very different worlds , and the fence is the main deterrent in these parts to illegal immigration .
' Hurting dignity '
In a state of some 6.5 m people , nearly 500,000 are here without permission .
This was one of the last places in America to be homesteaded .
There used to be Apaches .
It was the Wild West .
It 's getting like that again
Bill Mcdonald
Local resident Now , with the new anti-immigration law , Arizona has another way to implement its strategy : to make life so hard for illegal immigrants , that they either go home or do n't come in the first place .
Police will be required to stop anyone they " reasonably suspect " is here illegally .
If that person can't prove legal immigration status they could be arrested .
" It makes me sad , " said an older gentleman , a US citizen with Mexican roots , " it will hurt our dignity . "
" Search me because my skin is brown ? " a young man , also a US citizen , exclaimed .
" That 's bullshit ! "
Two young Mexican women who , like many , often cross the border for a day 's shopping , said they might not return to spend their money here in the future .
Several law enforcement officials complain the new measure will increase their workload .
Some doubt it will be enforced .
Original Wild West
All the same , most Arizonans support the new law .
And as you leave Nogales and head into the empty desert , opinions change as the landscape does .
Buildings and people give way to spiny cactus plants and desert birds along a quiet highway that winds through beautiful untamed hillsides .
They are unusually green this spring .
But soon they will be a parched furnace .
This is the original Wild West , dotted with old mining towns like Bisbee and Tombstone where the actual Gunfight at the OK Corral took place .
Now tourists watch daily re-enactments .
The border in this remote corner of Arizona is less heavily fortified than in the cities .
Despite the vigilance of the border patrol , it 's a busy smuggling route for people and drugs .
And in this dusty remote corner some 25 ranchers work a million acres .
They often find human debris on their vast lands , or encounter people trying to cross into America .
Most are tired , thirsty and looking for work , but not all .
" This was one of the last places in America to be homesteaded , " says Bill Mcdonald , whose family has been here for 100 years .
" There used to be Apaches .
It was the Wild West .
It 's getting like that again , " he says .
Taking no chances
Recently a rancher called Robert Krentz was shot dead on his property , along with his dog .
Police followed tracks to the border and suspect it was an illegal entrant who killed him .
Rancher Peggy Davis always carries a gun with her
One theory is that it may have been a revenge attack : shortly before , Mr Krentz 's brother discovered drugs hidden on their land and alerted police , who removed them .
Now some here take no chances .
On her family 's ranch , Peggy Davis plays with her four - year - old grandson Zane and his pet goat Gordy .
She tells me now when she goes out , she carries a gun .
Peggy supports the new law .
" We have been absolutely overrun , " she says , " and our government has not done what they need to to maintain safety I feel this is a national security issue . "
Arizona 's Governor Jan Brewer , who faces a tough re-election battle this year and who signed the anti-immigration bill live on TV , agrees .
So does President Barack Obama .
He said it was the federal government 's failure to act that had opened the door to irresponsible measures like the Arizona law .
He wants to reform immigration in the US , and people in border states want him to do it .
But they disagree on how .
Back in Nogales , I saw a woman with her four small children huddled by the metal fence .
A US border agent watched as a man's hand poked through the iron stakes and caressed the head of one of his daughters .
This was a family separated by the fence .
The woman said she was in the US legally , while her husband had failed once before to jump the fence .
Are you worried about the new law , I asked .
Will you try and come over again ?
" Yes , of course ! " he laughed .

The RSL says a decision to drop ' God Save the Queen ' from Melbourne 's Anzac Day dawn service was made after widespread consultation .
The decision has angered monarchist groups , who say it may offend veterans and their families .
David Flint from Australians for Constitutional Monarchy says the decision is disrespectful to Australia 's wartime past .
" They certainly have n't done the right thing , " he says .
" You do n't just trample all over your traditions .
You do n't say , well , that 's the past , and we 're going to get rid of that , otherwise you start doing other things as well , which take away the whole point . "
But the RSL's Victorian president , David McLachlan , says the decision was made based on feedback from veterans and young people alike .
He says after the dawn service every year , they ask a whole range of people what they think of the service .
" The question often comes up why do you have ' God Save the Queen ' ?
It 's not relevant and nobody knows it .
So we 've taken that into consideration . " he said .
He said the decision has the support of the Anzac Day commemoration council .

Teasers : Omniscience , SAT - solving
Using first - class continuations , it is possible to add a " non-deterministic ( or ambiguous ) choice " procedure to a language : amb .
The amb procedure takes a list of values , and chooses one of them .
The catch here is that amb must choose a value so that all assert statements encountered in the future of the computation are true .
For example , the following Scheme code :
( let ( ( a ( amb ( list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ) ) ) ( b ( amb ( list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ) ) ) ( c ( amb ( list 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ) ) ) ) ;
We 're looking for dimensions of a legal right ; triangle using the Pythagorean theorem : ( assert ( = (* c c ) (+ (* a a ) (* b b ) ) ) ) ;
And , we want the second side to be the shorter one : ( assert (< b a ) ) ;
Print out the answer : ( display ( list a b c ) ) ( newline ) )
prints out ( 4 3 5 ) .
The amb procedure chose these values so that when the assertions were encountered later on , they were true .
With amb available , it 's trivial to write a SAT - solving macro , so that :
( sat - solve ( and ( implies a ( not b ) ) ( not a ) c ) ( list a b c ) )
( #f #f # t )
( sat - solve formula body )
What are continuations ?
evaluates to .
That is , the macrobinds the free variables in the formula so that the formula evaluates to true , and then it evaluates the body expression in the context of these satisfying assigments .
Concretely , a continuation is a procedure that represents the remaining steps in a computation .
For the expression 3 * ( f ( ) + 8 ) , think about the remaining steps in the compuation after evaluating the expression f( ) .
For example , in C / Java , the procedure current_continuation is the continuation of the call to f( ) :
void current_continuation ( int result ) { result += 8 ; result *= 3 ; ( continuation of 3 * ( f ( ) + 8 ) ) ( result ) ; }
The value passed to the continuation is the return value of the call .
Some languages ( like Scheme and SML / NJ ) provide a way to capture the current continuation as a first - class value .
In Scheme , the procedure call - with - current - continuation ( often abbreviated call / cc ) takes a procedure , and passes it the current continuation of the computation .
The standard idiom for call / cc has an explicit lambda term as its argument :
( call / cc ( lambda ( current - continuation ) body ) )
During the execution of the expression body , the variable current - continuation is bound to the current continuation .
If invoked , current - continuation immediately returns from the call to call / cc , and call / cc returns whatever value was passed to current - continuation .
For example , the code :
( display ( call / cc ( lambda ( cc ) ( display " I got here .
" ) ( cc " This string was passed to the continuation .
" ) ( display " But not here .
" ) ) ) )
will display :
I got here .
This string was passed to the continuation .
What makes first - class continuations so powerful is that the continuation may still be called even after the call to call / cc is finished .
For example , the following causes an infinite loop that prints Going to invoke ( start ) forever :
( let ( ( start # f ) ) ( if ( not start ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( cc ) ( set! start cc ) ) ) ) ( display " Going to invoke ( start )
" ) ( start ) )
An idiom for continuation programming
By itself , call / cc can do anything you might need to do with continuations , but it is not the most convenient API .
When programming with continuations , I recommend using the a helper procedure , current - continuation :
( define ( current - continuation ) ( call / cc ( lambda ( cc ) ( cc c c ) ) ) )
The procedure current - continuation returns the continuation in which it was evaluated .
Then , you can use a conditional pattern to detect whether the continuation was just created , or the continuation has been invoked from some later point :
( let ( ( cc ( current - continuation ) ) ) ( cond ( ( procedure ? cc ) body ) ( ( future - value ? cc ) handling - body ) ( else ( error " Contract violation ! " ) ) ) )
The user - defined predicate future - value ?
should be able to identify the value passed to the continuation .
( Some Scheme implementations support continuation ? , which should be used instead of procedure ?
if it 's available . )
Implementing go - when and right - now
An alternative interface for interacting with continuations consists of two procedures : go - when and right - now :
( right - now ) returns the current moment in the computation ; and
returns the current moment in the computation ; and ( go - when moment ) returns the computation to a previously captured moment .
Some applications of continuation may be naturally expressed with just these two procedures .
Time - traveling search
Now we can expose how it was possible to write the teaser examples in the introduction .
Under the hood , the procedures amb and assert communicate with each other through a " fail stack . "
The top of the fail stack contains the next continuation to be invoked whenever an assertion fails .
When an assertion fails , it invokes the procedure fail , which pops the fail stack and invokes the result .
The amb procedure pushes a new continuation on top of the fail stack , selects the first value in the list , and then removes it .
If the list is empty , then the procedure amb invokes the procedure fail .
Exceptions
Exceptions are easily implemented with continations .
When an exception is thrown , control needs to return to the first enclosing try form .
To create this behavior with continuations , try forms capture the current continuation before evaluating their body .
In Scheme , an implementation of try will also use dynamic - wind to maintain a stack of exception handlers .
When evaluating ( dynamic - wind before - thunk do - thunk after - thunk ) , the run-time will ensure that before - thunk is called whenever execution enters the " dynamic extent " of the computation within do - thunk , and after - thunk is called whenever execution leaves the " dynamic extent " of the computation .
The try block can exploit this behavior by using the before - thunk to push the exception handler , and the after - thunk to pop the exception handler .
Generators
Generators are an elegant solution to the problem of iterating over complex data structures like trees and graphs .
Imagine you want to write a for loop like the following :
for ( node n in tree t ) { do something with n }
for ( Node n : t ) { do something with n }
t
Some languages ( like Java ) allow custom iterators , so you could write something like : But , how do you write the iterator ?
You could do a walk over the tree and turn it into an array or a list , but this is inefficient -- you allocate more than you need to , and you essentially end up iterating twice .
The efficient solution ( in a language like Java ) is to write an iterator that remembers where it is in the search of the tree .
This is difficult to get right , and it does n't feel natural .
( Try writing it ! )
A simple tree walk is easier to write .
If the language supports first - class continuations , then you can use the tree walk approach to iterate without the overhead of an intermediate data structure .
A generator is a procedure that accepts a yield procedure as an argument , with the expectation that it will iterate over some data structure and call yield on every element within the data structure .
With continuations , we can instrument a generator to make it suitable for overheadless for - style iteration .
The key idea is to toggle between two continuations -- one in the loop , and the other in the generator .
When the loop needs another value , it will switch to the continuation inside the generator ( passing it a continuation for the loop ) , and once the generator has a value , it will pass a value back ( plus a new continuation for the generator ) .
Cooperative threads ( coroutines )
Continuations make it straightforward to implement cooperative multi- threading ( and with macros , it is not difficult to simulate preemptive multithreading . )
In cooperative multithreading , a thread must yield control manually ; it will not be preemptively switched out .
The API for cooperative multithreading has five functions :
The Bluetooth SIG just gave its stamp of approval to the Samsung SGH - T959 , which by previous model numbers points to a handset that will see it ’s release on T - Mobile .
The T959 will reportedly feature Android , the TouchWiz 3.0 UI , Bluetooth 3.0 , and a 4 inch AMOLED touchscreen .
So what could this mysterious device be ?
One very real possibility is that T - Mobile will be getting their very own Samsung Galaxy S right along with AT&T .
Of course , a further look at the listing with the Bluetooth SIG does raise a few questions .
While the model number is listed as the SGH - T959 , further down in the design description the phone is referred to as the T939 , the model number of the already available Samsung Behold II .
A quick visit to the User Agent Profile for the T959 also lists an improper screen resolution .
These two minor discrepancies could be written off as typos , so take them as you will .
Will the Galaxy S be seeing the light of day on multiple carriers or is this just a bit of wishful extrapolation ?
If the specs listed for the T959 are to be believed , it is a very real possibility .
Now if we can just get this behemoth at a decent price point .

Super Bowl XX . 1986 .
Bears vs. Patriots .
New Orleans Superdome .
One of the great joys of growing up in Chicago was watching Walter Payton turn a corner on nasty winter day .
The Chicago Bears were a wondrous team in ' 85 / '86 : full of great personalities , before any originality in sports was reduced to the common rubble of brand , and a defensive line that rushed the quarterback like marauding beasts .
They were Mongols .
The Jumbotron was still relatively new technology at that time — at least it still felt new .
I remember the slack - jawed horror when Reagan 's mammoth speaking head filled the giant screen , draped in the pulsing stars and stripes .
We were celebrating the apex of liberty and the human spirit and lots of other shit , apparently .
His comforting tone was deep with menace .
I was with Tim Robbins and we got a bad case of The Fear , even though we had prepared for just this situation .
I remember witnessing the UP WITH PEOPLE halftime pageant terrified , with dilated pupils .
It was a time when kids were ordered or bullied into attending high school pep rallies — with all that hateful homecoming gibberish .
As you can see in this video now , watching the performance was like diving into an ocean of bad fashion and forced smiles .
Dr. Pepper dancing and Mom Jeans from shore to shore … pre-Prozac in motion …. military ballet …
Mandatory cheers and quasi- religious cult patriotics … the glory of the empire .
A choreographed tribute to the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King .
A celebration of diversity , unity , and fluorescent leggings .
Meanwhile , Reagan was dumping all the mentally ill and vets out on the streets to die , as a direct result of his policies .
Reagan was a bona fide motherfucker ( politically speaking ) who — among many other horrible things ( see Central America 's massacres and bloodbaths ) — launched the deregulation craze that began America 's descent .
But the triple - nuclear motherfuckers who shared his ideology and followed would make us nostalgic for his comparatively lesser evil .
The idea that America would one day feel homesick for the ' 80s was as alien to me then as that vast , choreographed grid of grinning dancers , goose - stepping to synthesizer blasts .
In the middle of the extravaganza , Dick Enberg 's syrupy and wholesome voice echoed through the Superdome :
The beat of the future is all around us !
It 's the players on the field
The kid in the stands ,
dreaming of being out there himself some day
It 's a feeling that 's hard to describe !
And when you can't say it with words ,
you can always say it with your feet .
" The beat of the future ! , " Up With People sang .
" The sound of tomorrow , ringing in my ears ! "
There was ringing in my ears , too .
We were seated on the 50 - yard line ten rows up .
The three grams of psilocybin I gobbled before the game was the only thing that kept me sane .
Later that night in New Orleans , I met a zombie , but I got away without being bitten .

President Barack Obama has just returned from his first trip as commander in chief to Afghanistan .
The U.S. - led invasion and occupation of that country are now in their ninth year , amid increasing comparisons to Vietnam .
Daniel Ellsberg , whom Henry Kissinger once called “ the most dangerous man in America , ” leaked the Pentagon Papers in 1971 .
Ellsberg , who was a top Pentagon analyst , photocopied this secret , 7,000 - page history of the U.S. role in Vietnam and released it to the press , helping to end the Vietnam War .
“ President Obama is taking every symbolic step he can to nominate this as Obama ’s war , ” Ellsberg told me recently .
He cites the “ Eikenberry memos , ” written by U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry , which were leaked , then printed last January by The New York Times .
Ellsberg said : “ Eikenberry ’s cables read like a summary of the Pentagon Papers of Afghanistan . …
Just change the place names from ‘ Saigon ’ to ‘ Kabul ’ … and they read almost exactly the same . ”
The Eikenberry memos recommend policies opposite those of Gens. David Petraeus and Stanley McChrystal , who advocated for the surge and a counterinsurgency campaign in Afghanistan .
Eikenberry wrote that President Hamid Karzai is “ not an adequate strategic partner , ” and that “ sending additional forces will delay the day when Afghans will take over , and make it difficult , if not impossible , to bring our people home on a reasonable timetable . ”
Petraeus and McChrystal prevailed .
The military will launch a major campaign in June in Afghanistan ’s second - largest city , Kandahar .
Meanwhile , with shocking candor , McChrystal said in a video conference this week , regarding the number of civilians killed by the U.S. military , “ We have shot an amazing number of people , but to my knowledge , none has ever proven to be a threat . ”
U.S. troop fatalities , meanwhile , are occurring now at twice the rate of one year ago .
Tavis Smiley has a PBS special this week on one of the most powerful , and overlooked , speeches given by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr .
The address was made on April 4 , 1967 , exactly one year to the day before King was assassinated .
The civil rights leader titled his speech “ Beyond Vietnam , ” and controversially called the U.S. government “ the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today . ”
The press vilified King .
Time magazine called the speech “ demagogic slander that sounded like a script for Radio Hanoi . ”
Smiley told me : “ Most Americans , I think , know the ‘ I Have a Dream ’ speech .
Some Americans know the ‘ Mountaintop ’ speech given the night before he was assassinated in Memphis .
But most Americans do not know this ‘ Beyond Vietnam ’ speech . ”
Smiley added , “ If you replace the words Iraq for Vietnam , Afghanistan for Vietnam , Pakistan for Vietnam , this speech is so relevant today . ”
Like King , Obama is a recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize .
In his acceptance speech , Obama mentioned King six times , yet defended his war in Afghanistan .
Princeton University professor Cornel West , interviewed by Smiley , said of Obama ’s Nobel speech , “ It upset me when I heard my dear brother Barack Obama criticize Martin on the global stage , saying that Martin Luther King Jr. ’s insights were not useful for a commander in chief , because evil exists , as if Martin Luther King Jr. did n’t know about evil . ”
In early March , Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio , offered a resolution to end the war in Afghanistan , saying : “ We now have about 1,000 U.S. troops who have perished in the conflict .
We have many innocent civilians who have lost their lives .
We have a corrupt central government in Afghanistan that is basically stealing U.S. tax dollars . ”
The resolution was defeated by a vote of 356- 65 .
A Washington Post poll of 1,000 people released this week found that President Obama enjoys a 53 percent approval rating on his handling of the war in Afghanistan .
The public is unlikely to oppose something that gets less and less coverage .
While the press is focused on the salacious details of Republican National Committee spending on lavish trips , especially one outing to a Los Angeles strip club , the cost to the U.S. taxpayer for the war in Afghanistan is estimated now to be more than $ 260 billion .
The cost in lives lost , in people maimed , is incalculable .
The real obscenity is war .
Ellsberg hopes that the Eikenberry memos will be just the first of many leaks , and that a new wave of Pentagon Papers will educate the public about the urgent need to end Obama ’s war .

Bonn , Germany – Lord Christopher Monckton , recently dubbed a “ famous contrarian ” in Esquire Magazine , said in Bonn today , “ The world ’s governing class has not understood what the world ’s working people have understood : that global warming caused by man is not happening and is not going to happen . ”
Lord Monckton said , “ The tactics of U.N. bureaucrats are dismally predictable .
They want to reach agreement here in Bonn that will lead to a binding climate treaty whose real purpose would be to stamp out freedom and destroy democracy throughout the world .
Nobody here in Bonn seriously imagines that this or any treaty brokered by a UN , which is still reeling from blows to its credibility from the Climategate scandal and revelations of errors in its reports , will ever make any difference to the climate that could be measured even by the most sensitive of instruments . ”
Lord Monckton said , “ The tactics of the global warming profiteers are clear .
They are desperate to cajole , bully or bribe the UN ’s member states into agreeing a treaty within weeks , because they know that the November midterm elections in the United States will return a Congress unfriendly to the notion that government of the people , by the people , and for the people should perish from the earth in the specious name of saving the planet from man-made effect on the climate that are negligible at worst . ”
Lord Monckton added that even if the warming effect of the carbon dioxide that our industries emit was as bad as the UN and its fellow travelers pretended to be , trying to control global temperature by international treaty would be as spectacularly futile as the failed attempt of King Canute to command the sea not to rise .
“ The United Nations ” , Lord Monckton said , “ is now in a panic born of desperation .
They are terrified , and rightly so , of the United States Constitution , which protects not only citizens of that great nation , but also the rest of the world from the plans of the global ruling class to bring liberty , democracy , and prosperity forever to an end . ”
The Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow , a UN accredited NGO whose delegation to the UN Conference in Bonn Lord Monckton is leading , has long campaigned for a more scientifically - based , reasoned understanding of environmental issues in today ’s public debate .
At the conference , it will be hosting a trailblazing seminar in the German Environment Ministry on the use of the internet to provide ordinary people with fact and opinions that have received scant attention by much of the mainstream media .
CFACT will sponsor a briefing and discussion with Lord Monckton , Prof. Luedecke and others at the Ministry of the Environment in Bonn at 19:45 in room Wind on Friday April 9 .
Press delegates and everyone accredited to attend the Bonn Climate talks are invited to participate .

Tom the Dancing Bug by Ruben Bolling Presents : News of the Times Computer Loses To Human Candy Land Champion Despite progress made in developing a computer program that can defeat a human CHESS champion , computer scientists confess that they have been able to launch a significant challenge to human supremacy in the game of CANDY LAND .
The latest model , CANDYTRON 5000 , faced last week against five - year - old Andrew Rifkin , the current Candy Land master .
CANDY LAND Challenge Andrew Rifkin vs. CANDYTRON
5000 Candytron 5000 started strong , taking the Rainbow Trail to the Lollipop Woods before Rifkin even got to the Gumdrop Mountains .
But as victory for the computer approached , Rifkin toppled the board and ran to his room crying .
Andrew : IT 'S NOT FAIR !
I WANNA WIN !
When decorum was restored and a new game started , Candytron 5000 apparently felt sorry for the tyke -- and even ignored its draw of a Snowflake card in order to allow Rifkin to overtake it and win .
Andrew : Yay !
I WIN !
Programmers are trying to close the " spoilsport gap " by installing on Candytron 6000 a lever capable of flipping the board when defeat is imminent .
But cognitive scientist Alvin Reeger is skeptical .
Alvin : Computers may surpass humans in intelligence and even creativity , but our unique ability to throw a good temper tantrum will forever ensure human Candy Land superiority .
BIRMINGHAM , Alabama ( Reuters ) - A tornado nearly a mile wide ripped through central Mississippi on Saturday , killing 10 people , including three children , and injuring dozens of others , state authorities said .
The tornado struck at least 13 counties , destroying scores of homes and trapping people inside , damaging businesses , blocking highways and knocking out power to thousands , said the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency .
Five people died in Choctaw County , four in Yazoo County and one in Holmes County , said Greg Flynn , spokesman at the agency .
Governor Haley Barbour declared a state of emergency after the first major U.S. tornado of the year .
“ It has done huge damage around Yazoo City , ” Barbour , who grew up in the city , told CBS television .
“ We have fatalities , a number of people that we ’re still trying to rescue who are trapped in buildings .
But it is a major , significant tornado ... and it did some huge damage and perhaps some fatalities north of here , ” Barbour said .
“ The Hinds County Sheriff ’s Department is sending two dozen deputies and 100 inmates to assist with the response in Yazoo County and clear debris , ” the emergency agency said .
The storm system has moved to Tennessee , Alabama and Kentucky , said Greg Carbin , spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .

Fifty percent of Jewish Israeli high - schoolers believe that Arab Israelis should not be granted the same rights as their Jewish counterparts , according to a new Ma’agar Mohot poll of 536 15 - to - 18 - year - olds .
Furthermore , Arabs should be prevented from running for Knesset , 56 percent of the Jewish children said .
Fifty percent of the Jewish youngsters who defined themselves as religious said the “ Death to Arabs ” slogan was legitimate .
Moreover , 70 % of Arab Israeli youngsters polled defined themselves as “ Palestinian patriots , ” and 20 % do n’t feel a part of the country .
Minister for Minorities Affairs Avishai Braverman ( Labor ) called the survey results “ very grave .
” “ I believe that it ’s the result of ignorance and a campaign of incitement that has been with us a long time , ” he said , calling for “ meaningful ” educational activities to allow the ethnic communities in Israel to better understand one another .

Cease and Desist letter from Amazon / dpreview
My recent post about the Canon EOS 7D caused a bit of controversy on the Internet and it is not surprising considering that in that post I ’m essentially showing that the EOS 7D , Canon ’s supposedly latest and greatest APS - C sensor camera body , is offering worse image quality compared to the two year older model , the EOS 40D .
This was my conclusion based on my discussion of dpreview ’s review of the EOS 7D and some of their test data .
After posting my article about the EOS 7D , I notified people of the post and one of those people was Philip Askey , the guy who started dpreview before Amazon bought them some time ago .
Shortly after sending my email to Askey , he replied demanding that I take down the sample images from dpreview which I included in my post about the 7D .
You can see the email conversation that followed below :

To : ‘ Philip Askey ’ Hi Philip , Thank you for reading .
I was hoping you guys would mention how the noise in 7D images was still worse compared to the 40D , like you did when you reviewed the 50D .
Also I use some of the crops to discuss the result of your published reviews and show how from your own reviews and samples , the 7D performs worse than the 40D , while also mentioning how you guys failed to mention in your own review that the 7D performs worse at low ISO compared to the D300s , as you can clearly see .
My use falls under fair use and that ’s why i did not ask permission .
But let me know if you think otherwise .

You clearly have an axe to grind against Canon and I ’m not hear to have a conversation , we would compare the 7D to the 40 D if it were the clear predecessor .
Your use of our numerous images does not fall under fair use .
Please remove all these images immediately .

To : ‘ Philip Askey ’ Philip ,
Can you explain to me why you think this is not fair use ?
Thanks ,
After my last email to Askey above , I did n’t hear from him again .
However , after this email exchange I started contacting a few people to ask them for their opinion about my use of the images in my post .
I was sure my use of the images fell under “ fair use ” but I still wanted to hear the opinion of others just to be absolutely certain that I was n’t infringing on dpreview ’s rights .
As a photographer myself , I too would love to be able to protect my work , so I take such matters very serious .
One of the people I contacted was Dan Heller , well known in the photography business community online , he has written about many similar topics in the past .
We started a very insightful email discussion on the subject , and Dan basically confirmed my “ fair use ” argument .
In case you ’re not familiar with “ fair use ” of content , the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) has the following to say about it :
The public ’s right to make fair use of copyrighted works is a long - established and integral part of US copyright law .
Courts have used fair use as the means of balancing the competing principles underlying copyright law since 1841 .
Fair use also reconciles a tension that would otherwise exist between copyright law and the First Amendment ’s guarantee of freedom of expression .
The Supreme Court has described fair use as “ the guarantee of breathing space for new expression within the confines of Copyright law ” .
3 . How Do You Know If It ’s Fair Use ?
There are no clear - cut rules for deciding what ’s fair use and there are no “ automatic ” classes of fair uses .
Fair use is decided by a judge , on a case by case basis , after balancing the four factors listed in section 107 of the Copyright statute .
The factors to be considered include : a .
The purpose and character of the use , including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes —
Courts are more likely to find fair use where the use is for noncommercial purposes .
b . The nature of the copyrighted work —
A particular use is more likely to be fair where the copied work is factual rather than creative .
c. The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole —
A court will balance this factor toward a finding of fair use where the amount taken is small or insignificant in proportion to the overall work .
d . The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work —
If the court finds the newly created work is not a substitute product for the copyrighted work , it will be more likely to weigh this factor in favor of fair use .
4 . What ’s been recognized as fair use ?
Courts have previously found that a use was fair where the use of the copyrighted work was socially beneficial .
In particular , U.S. courts have recognized the following fair uses : criticism , comment , news reporting , teaching , scholarship , research and parodies .
Based on the criteria in point 3 above , there ’s absolutely nothing wrong with my use of some of dpreview ’s images as I did in my post about the EOS 7D .
Especially considering the fact that I was mainly criticizing dpreview ’s review of the 7D ( they worded the review in such a way to make the 7D look positive at times ) and using their own data to show what I feel that they failed to mention about the 7D ( that it offers worse image quality compared to the Nikon D300s from ISO 100 – 1600 and worse compared to the EOS 40 D at all ISOs ) .
But the next day , after I sent my last reply to Askey , I get the following email from a lawyer at Amazon :

As you can see , they wanted me to assure “ that you are willing to immediately cease and desist from any and all use of dpreview .com ’s intellectual property , including any images and content from the dpreview.com web site . ”
This would mean that I could not even quote some of their review text so that I could comment on it or criticize it .
And of course this would severely limit me in exercising my right to free speech , so I could n’t possibly agree with this .
In addition , there was nothing wrong with my use of the dpreview images in the first place .
So I replied as follows :

Subject : RE : Cease & Desist Hi Kathryn ,
In my blog post , which you mention in your email , I am discussing , among other things , the review done by DPReview of the EOS 7D .
I quote part of their findings from the review , and offer my own comments and criticism on their review .
I have included browser screenshots of their review images ( not the original images ) from the review which were relevant to my comments , to support my comments and criticism to show that THEIR OWN images show things that I feel they failed to mention in their review .
I believe that this is “ fair use ” of the material .
I would not be able to discuss their review and make my points if I could not quote some of their text and show SCREENSHOTS of SOME of their images , and my comments and criticism would not be possible .
If you think this is not fair use , please let me know and also let me know why you think it is not , so I can consider taking the images down if I see that I am in fact infringing on dpreview .com ’s rights .
Regards ,
I have yet to receive a response from them on my last email above .
Dan Heller later told me that he thought I used way too many words in my reply , and that an email asking the following would have been enough :
Explain to me why you feel my use of the images does n’t meet the four criteria established by the courts in fair use assessments .
And I could n’t agree more .
Short , powerful and to the point .
I thought this information might be useful to many people out there , as the use of copyrighted images on blogs is an often discussed topic on the Internet , and I think it ’s going to be discussed a lot more often in the future as more people discover the Internet and start blogging .
Certain use of copyrighted images on your blog is certainly permitted as long as you keep the “ fair use ” guidelines in mind .
But I ’ll leave it to experts like Dan Heller to talk about this subject more in - dept .

Say goodbye to China 's " export economy " paradigm .
In a stunning development for trade hawks , and pretty much anyone who follows the biggest liquidity bubble in history , China Daily has announced China is about to announce a record trade deficit ( yes , not surplus , deficit ) for March .
This makes the whole CNY undervaluation debate pretty much moot , as even China now moves into the ranks of net importers .
From China 's official daily newspaper : " The country will probably see a " record trade deficit " in March thanks to surging imports " and " will " fight back " if Washington labels China a currency manipulator . "
Perhaps this finally explains where all the excess liquidity has gone : with China now not exporting to the US consumer , it has instead refocused on its own " middle " class .
This means that Chinese administrators are much more focused on maintaining a stable economy , and will be much more concerned about economic overheating , which goes in line with the recent indications of material liquidity tightening out of Beijing .
Market News reports that the actual deficit will come in at $ 8 billion for March , the first deficit since April 2004 , when the gap was $ 2.26 billion .
Maybe Albert Edwards will just have the last laugh with his iconoclastic prediction of a CNY devaluation .
More from the article :
After China 's exports rebounded in December , US legislators and economists have been demanding the Barack Obama administration label China a currency manipulator in a US Treasury report due out in mid-April , which will make it possible for Washington to slap duties on Chinese imports .
" China 's trade surplus with the US has been turned into a key excuse by American economists to pressurize the Chinese government to revalue the yuan , " but , ironically , the calls have been growing stronger even as the " surplus keeps falling " , Chen said .
The ministry also said on Friday that Washington 's method of evaluating trade figures magnifies the deficit with China .
In the three decades up to the 2008 global financial crisis , China 's exports registered annual growth of 20 percent but the surplus with the US contributed a big chunk to China 's total .
Last year , China had a surplus of $ 143.38 billion with the US , accounting for a hefty 73 percent of the total .
" The impact of currency revaluation on trade is limited , " said Chen .
From July 2005 to July 2008 , the yuan gained a cumulative 21 percent against the dollar , but China 's trade surplus with the US kept rising .
When the yuan was steady against the dollar from 2009 , the trade surplus dropped 34 percent .
" The deficit has been vastly overestimated based on American statistics , " and according to the latest report prepared by both sides , the US deficit for 2006 is " 26 percent higher than it should have been , " Chen said .
The scariest implication : China is quickly running out of dollars which it can then recycle into US Treasuries .
This is surely the biggest nightmare scenario for Tim Geithner .
While this explains the decline in indirect bidding , it also may go to refute the whole premise of China being behind the direct UK - based bidders is flawed .
And if so , is it merely just the Federal Reserve doing all the buying in a covert fashion ( via BlackRock or othewise ) as some of the more conspiratorially - minded market followers have speculated ?
Here is the most recent prophetic insight from Edwards , as of March 2 , pertaining to this critical shift :
Clearly to the extent that the rise in China ?'s official reserves depended on the size of its trade deficit , there will be reduced purchases of US Treasuries .
But China has , in part , merely been swapping official dollar purchases of US Treasuries with surging imports of dollar - denominated commodities on the trade account ( see chart below ) .
Accessory steering wheel and pedal setups can make driving games vastly more engaging and can often help improve your lap times .
Having said peripherals installed on a frame or cockpit with a low - slung racing seat only magnifies these effects .
But what if you want to go even further ?
Recently , the only way to really do that has been to invest in a big , super - expensive motion base that will tilt and buck you around in concert with the action on screen .
But what if there was another way to complete the experience ?
If the folks at Finland ’s Karjak CarLab are to be believed , it involves turning an actual working automobile into the controller .
For their project , they picked a 2009 Volkswagen Scirocco ( the nifty - looking , not - available - here one ) to serve as their controller / cockpit .
Why not something older , cheaper and simpler ?
It turns out having a late - model car made the setup process quite a bit easier than it would have been otherwise .
The car actually interfaces with the computer through its onboard diagnostics ( OBD II ) port .
It would appear that the boys at Karjak found a way to intercept the electrical signals derived from inputs to the steering wheel , pedals and shifter that would otherwise go to the onboard computer and accident data recorder and pump those signals to their PC to control a game ( in this case Bugbear ’s excellent Rally Trophy ) .
The VeeDub ’s nose appears to be resting on jackstands or some sort of pads to avoid putting strain on the steering system , and there is a projector on the roof to provide the visual stimulation and speakers for the aural stimulation .
Drawbacks ?
Well , there ’s no force - feedback , there still are n’t any hydraulic rams to create the sensation of lateral and longitudinal g- forces and , most importantly , it ’s kinda hard to get a real car into the average living room ( though not necessarily impossible ) .
But how can you not love the notion of getting your sisu on in your own car without risking putting so much as a scratch on it ?
And at the end of the day , this Scirocco can apparently be unplugged and driven around like a normal car .
So in addition to being one of the sickest gaming peripherals on earth , it ’s also one of the most practical .
Surely you can use that to sell your significant other on it …

An armband projects a user interface onto the skin , enabling users to control devices with a larger touchscreen than is offered by many mobile devices .
Credit : Harrison , et al .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
If you find yourself getting annoyed at the tiny touchscreens on today 's mobile devices , you might be interested in a " new " yet overlooked input surface : yourself .
A new skin - based interface called Skinput allows users to use their own hands and arms as touchscreens by detecting the various ultralow - frequency sounds produced when tapping different parts of the skin .
Skinput is a collaboration between Chris Harrison at Carnegie Mellon University and Dan Morris and Desney Tan at Microsoft 's research lab in Redmond , Washington .
The researchers have shown that Skinput can allow users to simply tap their skin in order to control audio devices , play games , make phone calls , and navigate hierarchical browsing systems .
In Skinput , a keyboard , menu , or other graphics are beamed onto a user 's palm and forearm from a pico projector embedded in an armband .
An acoustic detector in the armband then determines which part of the display is activated by the user 's touch .
As the researchers explain , variations in bone density , size , and mass , as well as filtering effects from soft tissues and joints , mean different skin locations are acoustically distinct .
Their software matches sound frequencies to specific skin locations , allowing the system to determine which “ skin button ” the user pressed .
Currently , the acoustic detector can detect five skin locations with an accuracy of 95.5 % , which corresponds to a sufficient versatility for many mobile applications .
The prototype system then uses wireless technology like Bluetooth to transmit the commands to the device being controlled , such as a phone , iPod , or computer .
Twenty volunteers who have tested the system have provided positive feedback on the ease of navigation .
The researchers say the system also works well when the user is walking or running .
As the researchers explain , the motivation for Skinput comes from the increasingly small interactive spaces on today 's pocket - sized mobile devices .
They note that the human body is an appealing input device “ not only because we have roughly two square meters of external surface area , but also because much of it is easily accessible by our hands ( e.g. , arms , upper legs , torso ) . ”
Playing Tetris .
“ Furthermore , proprioception - our sense of how our body is configured in three - dimensional space - allows us to accurately interact with our bodies in an eyes - free manner , ” the researchers write in a recent paper .
“ For example , we can readily flick each of our fingers , touch the tip of our nose , and clap our hands together without visual assistance .
Few external input devices can claim this accurate , eyes - free input characteristic and provide such a large interaction area . ”
In April , the researchers plan to present their work at the Computer - Human Interaction meeting in Atlanta , Georgia .

The FDIC has just announced that it has closed the sale of $ 1.8 billion of Notes backed by RMBS " from seven failed bank receiverships . "
The value of the actual aggregate balance : $ 3.6 billion .
And somehow banks still keep their RMBS books marked at par .
Furthermore , " the timely payment of principal and interest due on the notes are guaranteed by the FDIC , and that guaranty is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States .
Sure enough , smelling this insane deal , the vultures came out to snack on the taxpayer 's corpse : " The transaction was met with robust investor demand , with over 70 investors participating across fixed and floating rate series .
The investors included banks , investment funds , insurance funds and pension funds .
All investors were qualified institutional buyers . "
Just how many of these " banks , investment funds , insurance funds and pension funds " are viable to begin with , courtesy of the FDIC 's permission for every failed bank to continue existing is an amusing question , and Zero Hedge will attempt to get an itemized list of the participating buyers .
Some more details on the transaction :
The $ 1.81 billion of notes is backed by 103 non-agency residential mortgage - backed securities .
The aggregate unpaid balance of the 103 securities was approximately $ 3.6 billion at the time of the sale .
The FDIC retained an equity interest in each series .
The transaction features two series of senior notes , each backed by a separate pool of RMBS .
The larger series of approximately $ 1.3 billion , is based on option ARMS and has a floating rate tied to the one - month LIBOR .
The smaller series of $ 480 million is based mostly on fixed - rate RMBS and pays a fixed rate .
Both series priced at rates comparable to Ginnie Mae collateralized mortgage obligations .
And just in case you thought that the FDIC had finished funnelling taxpayer money from one failed bank to another soon to be failed bank , you are about to be disappointed .
FTMFW :
The timely payment of principal and interest due on the notes are guaranteed by the FDIC , and that guaranty is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States .
Hilarious , the use of proceeds will go to refilling a little of the at least technically insolvent Deposit Insurance Fund , which at last check was negative $ X billion ( we forget , but it was a big number ) , implyinh that the FDIC 's job as deposit guarantor is now moot , and all Sheila Bair 's organization does is to move money from taxpayers to banks .
Thank you Sheila .
As for the underwriter : it was Repo 105 counterparty extraordinaire , Barclays Capital , which served as " sole bookrunner , structuring agent and financial advisor . "
Makes one wonder whether the FDIC is using not Repo 105 but Repo 100,000,005 in its existing arrangements with banks .
Certainly , do n't hope to find before the US goes bankrupt .
And yes , this is a notable event in the FDIC 's history as the bankrupt organization slowly moves to irrelevancy .
This offering marks the first issuance of notes by the FDIC since the early 1990s and the first issuance by the FDIC of FDIC guaranteed debt backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. .
Here is a summary of the transaction , and below is a chart summarizing how taxpayers got raped once again .
Happy Meal toys and other promotions that come with high - calorie children ’s meals will soon be banned in parts of Santa Clara County unless the restaurants meet nutritional guidelines approved Tuesday by the county Board of Supervisors .
“ This ordinance prevents restaurants from preying on children ’s ’ love of toys ” to sell high - calorie , unhealthful food , said Supervisor Ken Yeager , who sponsored the measure .
“ This ordinance breaks the link between unhealthy food and prizes . ”
Voting against the measure was Supervisor Donald Gage , who said parents should be responsible for their children .
“ If you ca n’t control a 3 - year - old child for a toy , God save you when they get to be teenagers , ” he said .
Gage , who is overweight , said he was a living example of how obese children can become obese adults .

But he questioned the role of fast - food toys .
“ When I was growing up in Gilroy 65 years ago , there were no fast - food restaurants , ” Gage said .
The board , whose jurisdiction extends only to the unincorporated parts of the county , including much of Silicon Valley , voted 3 to 2 in favor of the ban after a contentious meeting that included more than an hour of testimony on both sides .
In favor of the item were public health administrators , parents and doctors ; opposed were fast - food franchisees , other parents , and fans of fast - food toys who said the promotions are often used to provide Christmas presents for poor children .
Dr. Dan Delgado , director of a county program that targets childhood obesity , said the toys are a powerful lure for children , encouraging them to eat unhealthy food , which then helps cause obesity .

Delgado told the supervisors that parents who come into his clinic say they often buy Happy Meals and other fast food for their children because of the toys that are included .
Delgado said that the obese children coming into his clinic include a 5 - year - old with Type - 2 diabetes .
But Steve Peat , who owns seven McDonald ’s franchises in Santa Clara and Santa Cruz counties , said he and his wife work hard to promote healthy lifestyles for children through their restaurants .
Peat said that they have donated funds for children ’s sports and other activities , and recently won an award for community service from the McDonald ’s Corp .
The toys wo n’t disappear right away .
As a compromise to win majority support , the five - member board agreed to put off implementing the measure for 90 days , to give the fast - food industry time to come up with a voluntary program for improving the nutritional value of children ’s meals .
Movable type : perhaps nowadays few will know the exact meaning of these two words , but until the middle of the twentieth century a letter was a small piece of lead , and to use it for printing you literally had to move it around , by hand .
In the 20th century big machines like the Monotype , equipped with keyboard , were used for typesetting ; but until 1900 all type was set by typesetters , by hand .
This simple object : a piece of lead with a letter on top , formed the central part of Gutenberg ’s invention , back in the middle of the 15th century .
To cast letters Gutenberg and all of the printers and type foundries that followed him used matrices .
To make matrices you first had to cut punches , and the punch was the instrument where art and business met .
The punches were made of steel — a little softer than today ’s steel — that was cut with a sharp steel knife or an engraving tool .
But still , to cut a letter on top of a very small piece of steel , and to do so with such precision and consistency required extraordinary skill .
Remember the magnifying glass had not yet been invented and even eye glasses were very rare .
To create the complete sets of more than a hundred different punches with letters , abbreviations , and other typographical signs that were all of the same size , all of the same design , and all equally pleasing to the eye when viewed en masse — it seems hardly conceivable that people were able to do just that .
But they did it , and with results that we use up to this very day .
The type designs we call roman are the grandchildren of one of the most beautiful romans ever created — a type created in about 1470 by the Frenchman Nicolaus Jenson , who was then working in Venice .
Roman , type 1 , used by Jenson in De Proprietate Sermonis .
Venice , 1476 .
In the 15th century each printer made ( or at least owned ) his own type designs .
At the end of the century specialist punchcutters started to trade in matrices and later also in type .
Type design soon became the job of specialists , and if you look at 15th and early 16th century type you can easily see its development from modest albeit interesting beginnings to it becoming a great art .
Many of the great type designs were created before 1550 .
These designs imitated the most elegant writing of their day , following the letters that were written by great humanists for kings .
Scholars like Poggio imitated Carolingian handwriting , mistakenly attributing these manuscripts to antiquity , when in fact they were products of the ninth century .
Carolingian minuscule , 9th century .
Initials and ornaments
Until the 18th century and for brief periods in the 19th and early 20th century , books were often decorated with initials and ornaments .
The earliest printed books were decorated by hand , like their written ancestors ; but soon printers began to use little woodcuts that could be used year after year in thousands of copies .
Initials by the famous 16th century French printer Estienne , and his two Basle colleagues Froben & Oporinus .
These initials form a neglected form of art — an undercurrent of popular culture that has been the subject of very little scholarly research , most of it by book historians , practically none by art historians .
The website we are creating is a first effort to change this .
Many of these initials and ornaments are abstract , but most are figurative : little pictures that furnish unexpected insights into the thinking of our ancestors .
They illustrate every human activity , and it is fun to trace the different pictorial traditions of countries and cities and all the changes they went through during those centuries .
You will find musical instruments , beautiful women , defecating little angels , knights , and monsters of every kind .
A town like Basel was especially rich in beautiful historiated initials — this was the influence of the famous German painter and engraver Hans Holbein ( 1497 –1543 ) who designed many of them .
Book historians often use these little pieces of wood to identify printers — some of the most famous and subversive books of all ages were printed without the name of the publisher , and the research of this kind of book is a quest without end .
But the sheer delight of looking at these beautiful little pieces of art is perhaps the most rewarding aspect .
Grand Gargantua
And so a grand project begins : with John ( the editor of this blog ) , we are building a website to bring these rare treasures to everyone .
Grand Gargantua — a history of typography will chart the course of typography from the incunabula .
For some time , I have been photographing ( in high resolution ) books of the Amsterdam Special Collections , and uploading them to Flickr .
Grand Gargantua will take this one step further , by organising and tagging these very high - resolution images , in addition to providing some commentary and historical perspective .
Our grand plan for Grand Gargantua is to gather some 50,000 samples in the next five or six years .
We hope that you will follow us in our adventures .
When we started out we had a small group of specialist book historians in mind as our audience , certainly not designers .
But we soon discovered that many designers were interested in our work .
For them we are creating an extra collection of examples of early book design .
Here we will display pictures of pages and books from the 15th - 19th century , sometimes accompanied by commentary .
We are touched by this interest in the historical roots of a tradition that today is as alive and vigorous as it was all those centuries ago .
This work is made possible by the Amsterdam Special Collections who generously permit access to the material , The A D & L foundation and the Huizinga Institute who generously supplied the camera , a Canon EOS 5D Mark II .
Paul Dijstelberge ( 1956 ) was a restaurant cook for 14 years and an expert bibliographer for 17 .
He completed his PhD on the use of initials and ornaments in the 17th century , and currently works as an Associate Professor to Professor Dr Lisa Kuitert ( History of the Book ) at the University of Amsterdam ; and as a curator at the Special Collections .
He publishes in the field of the history of the book and also writes short stories that have been published in several literary magazines .
He lives in Leiden with his wife and two daughters .

Just hours after HP teased us with another short video of its Slate tablet , Engadget revealed even more details about the upcoming device .
Those details are courtesy of an internal HP presentation , which shows the specs of the upcoming device , including both its advantages over the iPad and its weaknesses -- such as half of the battery life of Apple 's tablet .
The leaked HP Slate presentation , which looks genuine , elucidates many of the mysteries around the device , starting with the price : $ 549 for the 32GB model and $ 599 for the 64GB version .
In comparison , the introductory price of an iPad starts at $ 499 for a Wi -Fi-only 16 GB model .
The HP Slate will have a smaller , lower - resolution screen than the iPad , coming in at 8.9 - inch and 1024 by 600 pixels against iPad 's 9.7 - inch , 1024 by 768 display .
According to the leaked presentation , the HP Slate will also be able to run 1080 p HD videos , while the iPad can only run videos at 720p .
As previewed in the promotional video on Thursday , the leaked specs also show that the HP Slate will feature a SD card reader ( up to 128GB ) and a USB 2.0 port , together with a conventional SIM card tray ( the Wi-Fi+3G iPad comes with a new micro SIM card tray ) .
In addition , the HP Slate features a dock connector used for powering the device , audio , and HDMI out .
The iPad does not feature an SD card reader ( though there is an optional accessory available for $ 29 ) or a USB port .
An optional video - out adapter is also available for the iPad for $ 29 .
Size - wise , the HP Slate will be marginally lighter than the iPad , though slightly thicker ( Slate - 0.57 inches / iPad - 0.5 inches ) .
Due to the smaller screen size , the HP Slate is also slightly shorter and narrower than the iPad ( Slate - 9.21 by 5.70 inches / iPad - 9.56 inches by 7.47 inches ) .
The leaked specs also show the HP Slate will be powered by a 1.6 - GHz Intel Atom processor with 1GB of DDR2 RAM memory ( non-user upgradable ) .
The iPad runs on an Apple - customized 1 - GHz chip ( A4 ) , with an unspecified amount of RAM memory .
iPad tear - downs show that the Apple has 512MB of RAM installed , but apps can only access 256MB .
The HP Slate will run on a HP touch - optimized UI , based on Windows 7 Home Premium , though only real - life tests will show if the interface is as fluid as the promotional videos depict it .
Unlike the iPad , the HP Slate will feature two cameras : a VGA front camera for video calling and a 3MP camera on the back ( the iPad has none ) .
It 's unknown whether the HP Slate 's camera will have a flash or autofocus functions .
The beefed - up specs of the HP Slate will take a toll on the battery life though .
The HP presentation shows that the Slate will have only half of the advertised battery life of the iPad ( 5 hours on the Slate versus over 10 hours on the iPad ) .
The HP Slate 's battery is also non-user replaceable , as with the iPad .
What 's left of HP to reveal now is the launch date of the HP Slate , which is speculated to be around June or September .
The HP Slate looks like a worthy competitor to the iPad , though with the iPad selling over 300,000 units in its first day , HP better get its act together fast before it 's too late .
Brizamila is the company that distributes Capcom's DS games in the Netherlands , Belgium , and Luxembourg , or at least , they usually are .
They are passing on Ace Attorney Investigations : Miles Edgeworth , as they fear that R4 - enabled pirating of the game has already doomed it to commercial failure .
Bad news for the Netherlands , Belgium , Luxembourg , and even worse news for the people who spent months working to make Ace Attorney Investigations : Miles Edgeworth the great game that it is .
From what I 've gathered , pirating has caused many quality DS games to fail at retail .
Rumor has it that Retro Game Challenge had been downloaded over a million times .
If just a fraction of those downloads were sales , we 'd all probably be playing the sequel to the game right now .
Same goes for plenty of " hardcore " Wii games .
As of last December , House of the Dead : Overkill had been downloaded nearly a million times .
I 'm sure that the creators of the game are happy that people are playing their stuff , but not at the cost of their jobs , and more importantly to us , their ability to make more games .
So screw you Nintendo for making your consoles so easy to hack .
That may be OK for you , considering you make so many games that appeal to people who could n't hack their way out of a paper bag , but for third parties working to make core - friendly games , easily hacked consoles can be a death sentence .
And double - screw you to the people who pirate these games and never buy them .
You suck and I hate you .

It takes a village to pay for a slew of consultants .
Last Thursday , ABC News published a story titled “ SarahPAC Ensures That Sarah Palin Travels in Style ” .
A subheader added , “ When She Speaks for Fees , Her Hosts Pick Up Tab ; When Talking at Political Rallies , Donors Pay . ”
Matthew Mosk reported that “ Palin spent more than $ 400,000 from her political action committee during the first three months of 2010 , using the money donated by supporters to pay her team of advisers and cover the costs of stays in luxury hotels , flights , and even to de-ice a private jet that was shuttling her to a campaign rally . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The payments from her “ leadership ” PAC , called SarahPAC , are detailed in a newly released filing with the Federal Election Commission , and they lend additional insights into how the former GOP vice presidential nominee is paying for her whirl of post - governorship activities .
Much of the SarahPAC money contributed by her donors is being spent on legal and political advice .
She has several consultants who help with media inquiries , and pays a former foreign policy adviser to Sen .
John McCain to keep her fresh on global issues .
A good portion is also going to the high - end hotels and first class travel that has become a staple of her life in the months since she left office .
At Politics Daily , Sandra
Fish takes a closer look at the money that went entirely to consultants .
Sarah Palin put the bull ’s - eye on 20 U.S.
House races on her Facebook page last month , but did n’t donate to favored candidates in those districts during the first quarter of the year .
Although her SarahPAC took in $ 400,000 in the first quarter and had more than $ 900,000 in the bank , it gave only $ 7,500 to candidates between January and the end of March , plus an additional $ 2,000 to two other PACs .
None went to Republicans in the races she targeted .
However , since Palin did n’t target the races until March 23rd , those monies might not show up until the next SarahPAC filing .
But Fish ’s column notes , “ Almost $ 243,000 went to consultants , including almost $ 45,000 to PAC treasurer Timothy Crawford ( some of it for expenses ) , plus $ 21,500 for legal services .
NorthStar Strategies took in $ 50,000 , and Orion Strategies $ 30,000 .
Consulting services included media strategy , fundraising , candidate research and grassroots coalitions . ”

At the official site for Palin ’s political action committee , SarahPAC states that it ’s “ [ d ] edicated to building America ’s future , supporting fresh ideas and candidates who share our vision for reform and innovation , ” and the donation page asks supporters to “ [ p ] lease send what you can to SarahPAC today and help the campaigns of good , strong , commonsense Americans who will clean up the mess that Washington has created . ”
Conservatives upset about paying too much money in government taxes might not be pleased that over sixty percent of the total donations SarahPAC received during the first quarter of 2010 went to consultants instead of candidates or their campaigns .
ABC News reported last week , “ Tim Crawford , a spokesman for Sarah PAC , said he sees nothing out of the ordinary in the way Palin has made use of her account .
As for the $ 7,321 de-icing expense ?
Crawford said as Palin prepared to depart by private jet from Dulles Airport in Washington , ‘ there was thick stuff on the wings . ’
They thought it wise to have it removed . “
In the face of stiff resistance from Yahoo ! and a coalition of privacy groups , Internet companies and industry coalitions led by EFF , the U.S. government today backed down from its request that a federal magistrate judge in Denver compel Yahoo ! to turn over the contents of a Yahoo !
email user 's email account without the government first obtaining a search warrant based on probable cause .
The EFF - led coalition filed an amicus brief this Tuesday in support of Yahoo !'s opposition to the government 's motion , agreeing with Yahoo ! that the government 's warrantless seizure of an email account would violate both federal privacy law and the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution .
In response , the Government today filed a brief claiming that it no longer had an investigative need for the demanded emails and withdrawing the government 's motion .
While this is a great victory for that Yahoo !
subscriber , it 's disappointing to those of us who wanted a clear ruling on the legality and constitutionality of the government 's overreaching demand .
Such demands are apparently a routine law enforcement technique .
If the government withdraws its demand whenever an objection is raised by an email provider or a friend of the court like EFF , however , it robs the courts of the ability to issue opinions on whether the government 's warrantless email surveillance practices are legal .
This is not the first time the government has evaded court rulings in this area .
Most notably , although many federal magistrate judges and district courts have ruled that the government may not conduct real - time cellphone tracking without a warrant , the government has never appealed any of those decisions to a Circuit Court of Appeals , thereby preventing the appeals courts from ruling on the issue .
Similarly , a federal magistrate judge in New York , Magistrate Judge Michael H. Dolinger , has twice invited EFF to brief the court on applications by the government to obtain private electronic communications without a warrant , and in each case , the government withdrew its application rather than risk a ruling against it ( in one case the government went so far as to file a brief anticipating EFF 's opposition before finally dropping the case ) .
The government 's unwillingness to face off with EFF in these cases is certainly flattering , and it speaks volumes about their view of whether what they are doing is actually legal .
But the right answer here is to let the courts decide , not to have the government turn tail and run whenever someone seeks real judicial review of their positions .
So while it is a big victory for the Yahoo !
customer , today 's capitulation by the government is a profound disappointment to those of us seeking to clarify and strengthen the legal protections for your private data .
Court rulings are needed to keep the government within its legal bounds when it comes to warrantless communications and location surveillance .
Next time , the government should stay in the fight , because EFF is n't going to back down when it comes to protecting your privacy .
The first week of May 2009 was a rather good one for Barcelona fans and it seems like many of them celebrated in the time honoured fashion .
An historic 6 - 2 humiliation of arch rivals Real Madrid at their Bernabeu home on May 2 that effectively wrapped up the La Liga title was followed on May 6 by Andres Iniesta ’s brilliant , last - gasp goal at Stamford Bridge that took Pep Guardiola ’s side through to the Champions League final at the expense of Chelsea .
According to a survey of hospitals and clinics by a local radio station , the euphoria ( and other emotions ) generated among Barca fans by those two performances has had a rather unexpected result nine months on .
Maternity hospitals say they are struggling to cope with demand for beds and the survey , by COMRadio , of four hospitals and a clinic showed births this week and those expected next week are 45 percent higher than the average .
“ When we notice some sort of surge we look for the reason and it ’s evident that the cause of the increase this week is the euphoria of Barca fans thanks to the huge win ( against Real ) and Iniesta ’s goal , ” El Mundo newspaper quoted Mercedes Rodriguez of the city ’s Quiron Clinic as saying .
The babies were popularly known in Barcelona as “ the Iniesta generation ” , the paper added .
We did a story out of Berlin a couple of years ago that , disappointingly , showed expectations of a baby boom in Germany inspired by the 2006 World Cup proved to be little more than wishful thinking .
“ It ’s unrealistic to think that because there were more parties and people forgot their birth control it would make a statistical difference , ” Nicola Huelskamp , a consultant at the German Economic Institute in Cologne , told us .
It seems thrashing Real Madrid and getting through to the Champions League final are pretty special events for the Catalans .

The WORST Premier League signings of the season ?
With the Premier League season at an advanced stage , we are now at a point where we can sit back , and collectively have a good laugh at those signings which we feel did n’t quite work out as expected .
With this in mind , here are some of the worst Premier League signings this season
Michael Owen
Ok , he cost nothing .
Further , 9 goals in 11 starts in all competitions is n’t exactly a bad return .
However , Owen has spent most of the season out injured , and has hardly had any impact on the first team in crunch matches .
Further , if Ferguson thought Owen ’s signing would supplement the strike force of Berbatov and Rooney , he was wrong .
Rooney has carried Manchester United this season , and Owen was not the player to assist United in their quest for top honours .
A poor signing .
Alberto Aquilani
This is an obvious choice .
5 starts and 9 substitute appearances in the league , with one goal and one assist .
Oh and he cost £ 20 m .
Need I go on ?
I hope he proves the doubters wrong next season , but this year , he ’s been a flop .
Yury Zhirkov
Now then , now then .
Whilst I do not believe the Russian international left sided defender / midfielder to be a bad player , a little birdie tells me it cost Chelsea £ 18.6 m to prise him away from CSKA Moscow .
Come on .
£ 18.6 m ?
He ’s only blooming made two starts in the league !
That ’s £ 9.3 m per league start .
Further , even if it does turn out that Zhirkov is mustard , he ’ll never fit into the side anyway , because Ashley Cole is first choice at left back , and in midfield , Florent Malouda tends to play on the left of the diamond .
Ergo , the better of £ 20 m was wasted .
Why did n’t they bring in an out and out winger ?
Mido
He cost nothing , he earns less than a plumber a week ( those bloody tradesman , with their Ferrari ’s and cashmere sweaters tied neatly over their shoulders ) , and yet still he ’s getting booed by his own fans .
The Egyptian forward , who is on - loan from Middlesbrough , missed a penalty against Everton at the weekend , and had his own fans chanting ‘ off , off , off ’ and booing the referee after failing to send Mido off .
I believe the words ‘ fat ’ and ‘ useless ’ are being bandied about in East London fairly liberally these days .
Benedict McCarthy
The 32 year old South Africa striker cost £ 2.5 m , and is on a two year deal worth £ 38,000 - a- week .
So far , McCarthy has made two substitute appearances , and seems to be struggling to overcome the knee injury he sustained in his first match for West Ham against Burnley .
When McCarthy left Blackburn Rovers in January , Sam Allardyce suggested McCarthy ’s legs had gone , and it looks like Big Sam was right .
If McCarthy and Mido were signed collectively to score the goals to keep West Ham in the Premier League , the Hammers could be in a spot of bother …
Stewart Downing
Downing was a bad signing not because he is a particularly bad player , but more because the £ 12 m
Aston Villa paid Middlesbrough could have been better invested by Martin O’Neill .
Villa could have really done with signing a top quality centre forward , or even a centre midfielder .
Instead , they bought another winger .
Downing is an out and out left winger , yet Ashley Young is surely first choice for the position ?
The result is that either Young or Downing has to play out of position .
Not the greatest use of £ 12 m methinks .
Roque Santa - Cruz
£ 17 m sure does n’t buy you a lot these days .
In fact , if you ’re Manchester City , it buys you three league goals , one cup goal , and five Premier League starts .
So that ’s £ 4.25 m per goal then .
When you consider that Cristiano Ronaldo has so far scored 25 goals for Real Madrid , technically , at £ 3.2 m a goal , the £ 80 m fee Los Blancos paid actually looks like value for money .
What a bargain !
Santa - Cruz was injury prone at Blackburn Rovers in his second season , and has continued to enjoy further bad luck this term .
However , Manchester City knew of his problems before he signed , and so the £ 17 m they paid is one bad piece of business .
They should have bought Ronaldo …
Well , there you have it , some of the worse signings of the season .
Perhaps I ’ve been harsh , blinkered , or even ill - informed .
Well , that just means there ’s no excuse for you not to abuse me verbally in the comment box below …
Enjoy !

Members and supporters of Welfare Rights Committee stand in front of banner after April 15 " tax the rich " protest .
( Fight Back ! News / Kim DeFranco )
St. Paul , MN - Protesters assembled in the rotunda of the Minnesota state capitol here on April 15 for a rally to demand that the state government not “ balance the state budget on the backs of working and low - income people . ”
The rally called on politicians to instead , “ tax the rich . ”
“ In the midst of the greatest economic crisis in generations , the governor and legislature are preparing a budget that will put the worst effects of the economic crisis on the backs of low - income and working people .
Cuts are being proposed that will have a huge impact on working people and low - income families and individuals .
The rich created this economic crisis .
Let them pay for it ! ” said Deb Konechne , of the Welfare Rights Committee , a member group of the Minnesota Coalition for a People ’s Bailout , which organized the event .
The governor and state legislature are preparing a budget that will result in massive cuts to programs that provide needed services and jobs for many low income , disabled and working people across the state .
Jennie Eisert , a member of Minnesota Coalition for a People ’s Bailout , said , “ The wealthy have enjoyed years of state and federal tax breaks , which has led to an enormous concentration of wealth in this country .
But what have the wealthy done with this bonus ?
They ran the economy into the ground .
Now state and federal government are preparing huge budget cuts . ”
“ People are losing their jobs and homes .
It is time the rich make up the difference and pay higher taxes so low income and working people get a break , ” Eisert continued .
The MN Coalition for a People ’s Bailout has been working for state legislation that would provide some basic protections for working and low - income people during the current economic crisis .
Among the steps the coalition wants to see enacted are a moratorium on home foreclosures and evictions , an extension of the five - year limit for families receiving public assistance and an end to layoffs of public or University of Minnesota employees .

Senator Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) is a political product , bought and paid for by massive corporations that have grown far beyond understanding and control , in some measure as a result of everything DeMint believes in and works for in Washington .
The paucity of his Wikipedia biography is remarkable .
He was born , attended college , went to work for a public relations firm , moved into politics as a three - term Congressman and then won Fritz Hollings ' seat in the Senate .
That ’s almost all you learn of him there .
The one remotely interesting biographical fact is that he once played drums in a cover band called Salt and Pepper .
Even in this one slight glimpse of humanity , he is parroting other people ’s material as his own .
It 's not much of a story , because Jim DeMint is n't much of man .
He has not seen war , backpacked Europe , worked shoulder to shoulder with the poor or faced any transformative personal struggles that can produce greatness .
He has no Valley Forge , no charge up San Juan Hill , no Freedom Rides .
As much as he reveres Ronald Reagan , he does n’t even have made - up stories to tell .
The America of WalMart , strip malls and Fox News which produced Jim DeMint is a culture stripped of nearly everything that might relieve the empty pursuit of material possessions .
It is increasingly cheap , manipulative and disposable .
It is not the flawed decency of the small towns of the old South .
It is not American in the sense that it really means anything .
It is a shopping cart full of cheap Chinese goods purchased on credit , oblivious to the consequences : that our children will have less of everything that is of value unless we change .
As you read the endless stream of press releases that pour out of DeMint 's noise machine , the numbing repetition of manipulative words strung together is striking , because they once were words that really meant something .
Prayer , freedom , free enterprise and individualism are invoked paragraph after paragraph and day after day .
The message is simple and sadly seductive : " America is in trouble , and it's all the fault of the powerless , the poor and the people who are different .
If they could all be driven out of our society , the cheap gas and secure middle class life people remember would return for all of us ' real Americans . '" DeMint is against nearly everything .
Saying " no , No NO " to everything is easy , and can be -- in the short term -- very emotionally satisfying .
Just ask any two - year - old .
He opposes health care , public education , unemployment insurance , student loans , bicycle paths , public transit , high - speed rail and attempts to slow global warming .
If you sit on a bench in a public park , watching your children play on a tax - funded swing set , DeMint 's against the park , the bench and the swing set .
He 's against taxes for the sidewalk you walked there on .
What DeMint isis the relentless concentration of power and wealth in the huge corporations who fund his own campaigns and those of Marco Rubio , Pat Toomey and Chuck DeVore , whom he wants to join him as his brotherhood in the Senate .
He communicates the messages of his corporate funders , using the money they send him , over right - wing media outlets like Fox News , where he has become a favorite show pony since Obama became President .
He has gone all in with the Tea Party .
He famously said that healthcare reform would be Obama ’s “ Waterloo , ” and has strutted like a Napoleon ever since .
DeMint did not emerge as the leader of the far right in America because of any particular talent .
There are probably some conservatives with principled , thoughtful , if wrong , ideas about social policy and taxation .
But DeMint would not be one of them .
DeMint has risen because he is the emptiest of men .
He is needy enough and empty enough to become whatever is needed .
He was willing to serve as the author of a book other people had written .
He will demagogue any issue for profit .
He has been willing to frighten elderly people into believing they would be better off if their social security was gambled in the stock market , and eager to convince his constituents that they would be better off if " government kept their hands off Medicare " and left decisions of life and death to the market .
Eighteen months ago , a new President promised hope and change .
It is an open question and fair argument whether he can , or has the will , to deliver it , one that will continue here and elsewhere .
But when you consider Jim DeMint and all he stands for , and all he wishes and intends for this country , that is n’t what ’s on the table .
For DeMint and his corporate masters , the real money , the big take at the end of the game , comes by delaying the moment that problems can get solved to a point past solution .
There is a huge corporate killing to be made when people will surrender everything they have just to survive .
Then those who already have so much will be able to take all the chips off the table .
DeMint is their man .
He wants South Carolina to be the low - budget test bed for the future he wants for all of America : emaciated government , privatized everything , overtaxed charity , a degraded environment , no unions and low pay .
DeMint is working now to bring that time on , if he can .
He will try to take over the Republican Party in the US Senate .
He will fill it with his friends using corporate - funded campaigns driven by fear , if he can .
And make no mistake , if he wins re-election this year , Jim DeMint ’s next play is a Presidential run in 2012 against his personal demon , Barack Obama .
DeMint and his friends have no massive , secret agenda .
They do n't want to turn our children into robot lizards or implant chips in our brains .
Their agenda is massive and : they want to own it all and keep it all .
They already own Jim DeMint .
They want to own some more senators , and they ’re spending mad money to do that .
They want to own our government .
They would like to own our future .
All they need is our frightened consent and they 'll quietly arrange the rest , assisted by an empty man willing to do whatever they ask : Jim DeMint .
There is a red pill to DeMint ’s blue pill .
A man named Vic Rawl has very recently entered the South Carolina Senate race against DeMint , following the abrupt withdrawal of DSCC favorite Chad McGowan .
Rawl is an actual progressive Democrat , and not just by the low bar set for such in South Carolina .
And even as a genuine progressive , he has a pedigree that might actually beat DeMint .
Rawl is a former statewide judge , four - term State House member and National Guard colonel in a state that reveres the military .
He is principled , pragmatic and , yes , progressive .
While he faces nominal opposition in the June 8 primary , he will be our candidate in November against DeMint .

Senate Democrats have been unable to find a GOP co-sponsor of highly anticipated campaign finance reform legislation , delaying the rollout of a measure aimed at counteracting a landmark Supreme Court ruling .
Rep. Chris Van Hollen ( D - Md. ) and Sen. Charles Schumer Chuck SchumerFirst woman sentenced for her role in Nxivm sex cult Ocasio - Cortez calls Trump a ' white supremacist ' after debate Democrats rip Trump for not condemning white supremacists , Proud Boys at debate MORE ( D - N.Y. ) had expected to unveil their legislation with bipartisan support by the end of last week , with a goal of delivering a bill to President Barack Obama Barack Hussein ObamaUnseemly brawl unlikely to change a thing

That timeframe is in doubt , and the lack of GOP support could prevent passage of legislation through either chamber by Memorial Day .
Democrats now hope to unveil legislation this week , and the party is in an internal debate over whether to move forward without a Republican co-sponsor .
The difficulty Democrats have found in winning GOP support for campaign finance reform , an issue that has attracted Republicans in the past , reflects the highly partisan atmosphere in Congress , which has only intensified since the healthcare debate .
Republicans supportive of the Citizens United decision , which would allow unlimited corporate and union spending on individual campaigns , have attacked the Democratic effort as politically motivated , noting that the chief sponsors are Van Hollen , the current chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , and Schumer , the former head of the Democratic Senate campaign arm .
With Sen. John McCain John Sidney McCainBudowsky : Senate 's Trump Republicans on trial , in trouble America 's presence in Cam Ranh Bay should be more than occasional Meghan McCain , husband welcome first baby girl , Liberty Sage McCain Domenech MORE ( R - Ariz . ) , a longtime champion of greater restrictions on campaign finance , sidelined in a tough reelection primary fight , Democrats had set their sights on the newest GOP celebrity with centrist appeal , Sen. Scott Brown ( Mass . ) , the freshman Republican who won the seat held by the legendary Sen.
Edward Kennedy ( D ) for decades .
After weeks of courting , however , Brown turned down the Democrats late last week , according to spokeswoman Gail Gitcho and several sources close to the negotiations .
Brown delivered the news to Schumer on the Senate floor Thursday .
“ Sen .
Brown ’s priorities continued to be jobs , the economy and national security , ” Gitcho explained when asked why he declined to co-sponsor .
Shortly after Brown delivered the bad news , Schumer would not acknowledge the failure to win Brown over .
When asked how important Brown ’s support was for the bill ’s passage , Schumer said only : “ We welcome everyone ’s support . ”
In a statement e-mailed from his spokesman , Schumer on Monday told The Hill : “ We are reaching out to a number of Republicans , but we will move forward with a bill whether we get a Republican co-sponsor or not . ”
As of late Monday , Senate Democrats still lacked a Republican willing to sign up for the difficult task .
According to sources close to the negotiations , Schumer was focusing his efforts on convincing Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) but had yet to successfully secure an agreement .
After the high court ’s decision in Citizen United , Snowe seemed to come out swinging , saying it would undercut reforms that she and others had fought to secure and amounted to a “ serious disservice to our country . ”
Snowe ’s office did not respond to calls for comment for this story .
Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins Susan Margaret CollinsGOP senators pan debate : ' S --- show , ' ' awful , ' ' embarrassment ' Budowsky : Senate 's Trump Republicans on trial , in trouble Senate Democrats want to avoid Kavanaugh 2.0 MORE , her fellow Republican from Maine , co-sponsored the historic Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act of 2002 , along with McCain and a handful of other Republicans .
But Collins ’s spokesman Kevin Kelley said this year that Collins would not jump onboard .
He did not indicate the reason behind the decision .
“ As a co-sponsor of the 2002 campaign reform law , Sen .
Collins was disappointed that the Supreme Court struck down so many key provisions of this bipartisan legislation , ” Kelley said .
“ She believes that it is important that any future campaign finance laws include strong transparency provisions so the American public knows who is contributing to a candidate ’s campaign , as well as who is funding communications in support of or in opposition to a political candidate or issue . ”
Van Hollen ’s efforts in the House are bearing more fruit .
A spokeswoman for Rep. Mike Castle ( R - Del. ) confirmed that her boss was planning to sign on to the House bill as a co-sponsor .
Other House Republicans , such as Reps. Walter Jones ( N.C. ) and Todd Platts ( Pa. ) , are also possible co-sponsors .

Still , the Senate problems are having an impact on the timing of the House bill , since Van Hollen and Schumer had wanted to work in tandem .
“ Van Hollen has been working tirelessly to get this bill done and we are confident we are near the finish line , ” said his spokesman , Doug Thornell .
Advocates of tougher campaign finance law say the bill closely resembles the framework Van Hollen and Schumer laid out two months ago .
Major provisions include strict new disclosure requirements for corporate - funded campaign ads , including a mandate that CEOs and top donors appear on camera to “ approve ” messages .
It would also explicitly ban contributions from companies with a 20 percent or greater foreign ownership stake , as well as from government contractors or firms that have received and not repaid Trouble Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) funds .
Some congressional watchdog groups also would like to add a provision that would require corporations to hold a shareholder vote for significant political expenditures .
Despite GOP reluctance to publicly support the measure , the bill ’s backers contend it will be difficult for Republicans to argue against it , especially because for years they have argued vigorously in favor of more disclosure .
“ We expect this to be an intense battle , as all campaign finance reform issues are in Congress , ” said Democracy 21 ’s Fred Wertheimer .
“ But we also expect to win this battle because opponents really do not have any credible case to make against the legislation , particularly in light of the Supreme Court ’s upholding the constitutionality of disclosure in Citizens United . ”

Western Mining Companies and Slave Labor in Eritrea
( The Case of Nevsun Resources Ltd. and Others )
Yosief Ghebrehiwet
The gold rush in Eritrea has attracted many Western companies , among them Canada ’s Nevsun Resources Ltd. and Sunridge Gold ; Britain ’s Andiamo Exploration and London Africa ; and Australia ’s South Boulder , Sub Sahara Resources , Chalice Gold Mines Ltd. and Gippsland Ltd .
And this does n’t tell all that there is to the involvement of Western companies , for there are many subcontracted companies rushing to get in too , such as AMEC of Canada doing engineering study and Capital Drilling and Geo Drilling of Australia and Boart Longey of Canada doing drilling .
But among the stories of the mining boom in Eritrea and the mining companies ’ stocks going up and down , the dirtiest secret that has remained untold is the extensive use of slave labor in these mining projects .
As in all kinds of gold rush , the Eritrean one is attracting all kinds of desperados .
There are two aspects to this desperate endeavor .
First , a totalitarian regime totally strapped of hard currency is giving away all the gold found in its domain in the lowest bid imaginable .
While neighboring nations such as Sudan and Egypt demand 50 % and 60 % of ownership respectively , the desperate Eritrean regime is asking as low as 10 % to attract companies that would n’t have come under normal conditions .
This being an extremely risky area where war with Ethiopia and violence from within ( given the numerous armed groups active in the country ) could easily erupt at any moment , the regime has felt that it has to sweeten its package to attract Western companies .
One of these risks has , in fact , recently materialized when none other than the UN imposed sanctions on this young nation for sponsoring terrorism in Somalia and throughout the region .
On the other side of this desperate endeavor are the mining companies that are more than willing to return the favor .
Given the huge profit and high risk involved in this gamble , it is no wonder that from the very beginning these companies are turning out to be accomplices of the regime in violating the human rights of the already terrorized Eritrean masses , in general , and the workers employed in their projects , in particular .
For all they want is get their gold out and run .
And if that requires accommodating the brutal regime in Asmara in any they can while they are there , so be it .
This accommodation gets even worse with some desperado companies , far from the mainstream brand - name ones , rushing to capitalize on this offer of a lifetime .
A case in point is Nevsun Resources Ltd whose entire portfolio is made up of one single project in Eritrea – the Bisha project .
For this company it is a matter of life and death , a situation that renders it susceptible to all kinds of manipulations by the regime .
Among the many negative roles that these Western mining companies are already playing are the following three :
Slave labor :
The totalitarian regime is known for using extensive slave labor in its “ development projects ” under that misleading policy of “ self - reliance ” that every totalitarian system invokes to control the economy and its people .
And now , given that almost all of the local companies subcontracted to do various jobs in the mining projects are government owned , slave labor has become a pervasive problem in these areas .
Forced displacement :
The forced displacement of indigenous populations from the mining areas and their surroundings has become an ongoing phenomenon , something that will even get worse if any armed sabotage is conducted in any one of these areas .
The scorched earth approach that the regime has been using in the Kunama area is a case in point , where a whole ethnic group has been being targeted to pacify a corridor that it is considered too close to the Bisha mining project to be left “ unmonitored ” .
A lifeline to the regime : With monetary aid from outside and revenues from Diaspora Eritreans dwindling , the regime ’s hard currency reserve has been totally depleted .
If so , with the revenues from the mining projects starting to flow into the PFDJ coffers at a time when the regime is economically challenged , theirs will be the only lifeline that will keep this totalitarian regime afloat , thereby extending the misery of the Eritrean masses unnecessarily for years to come .
The latter has been addressed in my article , [ Eritrea Sanctions Watch ] Western Mining Companies : Throwing a Lifeline to a Brutal Regime in Eritrea ; in this article , it is only the first one that will be addressed .
The second one will be addressed in another article .
There are three things that we need to know regarding the slave labor in Eritrea and its emerging intimate link with the mining companies : ( a ) its nature – how did it come about and what does it look like ; ( b ) its scope – how many people it involves , and for how long it lasts for each laborer ; and ( c ) its ties with government - owned companies and , by extension , with the Western mining companies .
Much of the work being done in the mining projects is , and will be , subcontracted to local companies – construction , food products , transportation , banking , even some drilling , etc – and since the government has already bankrupted all private companies and forced them out of the market , there is no option for the mining companies but to give all the work that there is to these government - owned companies .
Since the overwhelming majority of those “ employed ” by government companies are the youngsters from the army and national service – a pool of about 300,000 at any given moment – forced to work at a salary of 500 Nakfa ( $ 12 ) per month , the link to slave labor can not be more direct than this .
The mercantile nature of the PFDJ ( the ruling party ) has no boundary ; all it cares is how to maximize its profit , irrespective of consequences .
In its former dealings with foreign entities – NGOs , the donor community , foreign companies , etc – there are three schemes that the government used to exploit their local employees .
First , it sets the salaries of workers directly employed by the companies at a low level and pockets the difference .
Second , it gets a lump sum of money from the work its companies are subcontracted to do and gives only a tiny fraction of that money to its slave laborers .
And third , all the salaries have to be paid in local currency after an extortion of more than 60 % in a currency exchange rate system in government - owned banks .
We will see how these schemes of blatant exploitation work in regard to the mining companies below .
Before we look at how the mining companies are letting most of the work in their mining projects be done through slave labor provided by the government and allowing the government to get away with its various exploitation schemes , it is important to know the nature and extent of the pervasive slave system that the regime has fostered , perfected and installed throughout the nation to remain economically and politically viable , long before the mining companies have showed up in Eritrea .
Slave labor at national service
It has been about 15 years in Eritrea since an experimentation of Khmer Rouge like proportion has been undergoing under the misleading name of “ national service ” .
It is to be remembered that the first thing the Khmer Rouge did when they “ liberated ” Cambodia was to empty its towns and cities of its inhabitants and drive them to the jungle to make better Khmer out of them – one that ended in a tragedy of epic proportion .
In Eritrea , in a similar experimentation , villages , towns and cities have been emptied of their adult and most productive population and cordoned off in the wilderness in their hundreds of thousands .
As in the case of Khmer Rouge , this experimentation is meant to create “ better Eritreans ” in the image of the guerrilla fighters that “ liberated ” the nation .
The only reason why this experiment has not ended in Khmer Rouge like tragedy of genocide is that Eritrea has very porous borders and these modern - day slaves have been successfully escaping to neighboring countries in their hundreds of thousands .
This totalitarian experimentation is designed to achieve three things : to create a formidable war machine to counter Ethiopia ’s hegemony in the region , quixotic as it may seem ; to provide endless source of free labor for governmental projects ; and to control a population group deemed to be dangerous to the survival of the regime .
Emboldened by this foolish experiment , a war that was instigated by the leader of the nation has already resulted in tens of thousands dead and tens of thousands maimed .
Ever since then , the whole nation has been at war footing for more than a decade .
While keeping them cordoned off in the wilderness under the pretext of “ national security ” , this bottomless pool of workforce has been the main source for the Sisyphean projects that the regime has been undertaking .
Given the indefinite nature of the national service , this has directly translated into endless form of slavery .
It is important for outsiders to know the extent ( the number of slave laborers ) and the years involved in this totalitarian experimentation of epic proportion .
Right now , there are about 300 , 000 slave laborers in active “ military service ” , with hundreds of thousands more in reserve .
All of those in reserve have already gone through the grueling years of service and are frequently called back to fill in gaps left by ever - deserting recruits .
If we take only those in active service , all of which have been slave laborers for all the years they have been serving in the military , they would make up about 6 % of the entire 5 million population .
Think now of the US having 6 % of its population in active military service doubling as slave laborers : about 18 million of them !
And this does n’t tell the whole story , for every adult person has to pass through that grueling experimentation before he or she is sent back to civilian life or escapes to one of the neighboring nations .
This has been going on for about 15 years straight .
There are tens of thousands that have wasted their entire adult lives on these slave camps hauling stones , and still remain trapped there .
No wonder that Eritrea , despite its small population , has been identified as a nation that has generated the highest number of refugees seeking asylum in the world last year .
Exiles in their own land
The main purpose for quarantining hundreds of thousands of adults ( mostly young men and women ) in the wilderness for more than a decade has been that of totalitarian control .
Once identified as the number one internal enemy of “ Eritrea ” , this young population group has to be contained by whatever means necessary .
As a result , those in national service have acquired all the characteristics of the classical exile .
That is to say , “ national service ” is just an Orwellian name given to “ internal exile ” .
Some of these exile characteristics are [ for a more extensive look at the nature of the national service , please read my Sealing off Eritrea : Domestic Terrorism ] :
Isolation / minimum contact :
As dangerous exiles , with poisonous ideas to spread , the Warsai ( an Orwellian name – “ inheritors ” – given to the young generation in the national service ) population group has to be kept away from urban population centers where it could potentially create a lot of mischief to the totalitarian regime .
So the first step is to isolate them and put them in a safe laboratory setting rendered controllable .
Cordoning off hundreds of thousands of them in the wilderness is meant to achieve just that .
In the image of “ liberators ” :
Once they have been isolated in an ideal laboratory setting of the regime ’s liking , the mission of this experimentation is to mold the Eritrean youth – the guinea pigs of this experimentation – in the image of teghadalay ( the guerrilla fighters that liberated the nation ) , with the purpose of making robotic , atomic units out of them that would easily be made to fit into the totalitarian machine .
Hard labor :
As in the case of Siberian exiles , they have been wasting their productive years in modern - day slavery , hauling stones in futile Sisyphean tasks , with the main purpose of keeping the young generation preoccupied , at minimum , and of breaking their spirit , at maximum – both , of course , for control purposes .
Vigilantly watched over as enemies :
In their place of exile , they have been put under constant watch by none other than the former guerrillas ( the Yikealo : the Big Brothers ) ; every movement they make is assessed purely for its potential danger to the regime .
Any sign of independence in thinking or action is severely punished .
Indoctrination :
As in all kinds of political exiles , the indoctrination of the Warsai generation is essential to PFDJ ’s survival , the idea being to create compliant subjects willing to execute the orders of the regime without questioning .
Physical and mental punishment :
Other forms of cruel punishment are also essential to break down this restive generation ; those considered non-complaint are subjected to cruel forms of medieval - like torture infamously known as “ helicopter ” , “ otto ” , “ Jesus Christ ” and “ almaz ” – all innovative ways of tying up the victim to inflict maximum pain .
Humiliation ( ex : shaving a female Warsai ’s hair for “ noncompliant ” behavior ) and isolation are also used .
As a result , mental traumas have become normal phenomena .
Victims of the elements :
As in the case of many exiles in many totalitarian systems ( the Khmer Rouge come easy to mind ) , this huge mass of humanity lives in the open under arduous regimental conditions , hard labor , meager food supply and little medical attention , resulting in hunger and malnutrition and various diseases .
Many of them are stationed in one of the hottest area in the world .
Sexual abuse of women :
The sexual coercion and rape by military authorities that the female Warsai have been subjected to have resulted in illegitimate pregnancies , illegitimate abortion , illegitimate children , HIV infection , mental traumas and life - long stigmas .
Sexual slavery has become a fixture in every military camp , where beautiful women are selected to “ serve ” the officers , colonels and generals .
Wasted lives : National service has interrupted the normal life of Warsai – no education , no normal jobs , no raising families , etc – for years on end .
There are those who have spent their entire productive life in the national service ; 10 to 15 years of life under slavery has now become normal .
Spiritually deprived :
Any inclination in spirituality is severely dealt with ; reading the bible is a no - no .
The regime has no tolerance to anyone among the Warsai who shows loyalty to others than itself – be it of earthly types ( ex : the family ) or of heavenly types .
Thousands of Evangelical Christians , most of whom are from the Warsai generation , are languishing in prisons simply because of their belief .
Mass exodus :
As every exile would undoubtedly do under similar circumstances , the Warsai are escaping in droves at every opportunity , only to be met with further hardships both inside and outside Eritrea .
Tens of thousands are stranded in refugee camps in Ethiopia and Sudan and tens of thousands more have ventured further [ in Israel alone , there are more than 8,000 ] .
Fugitives in their land :
Those who have escaped from the totalitarian regime ’s laboratory setting but remain hidden within the land lead a fugitive ’s life .
Most of them wo n’t venture outside a compound or house for years .
The countless informers everywhere and the frequent unannounced round ups ( giffa ) are meant to apprehend deserters and dodgers before they make it to neighboring countries .
Shoot - at - sight policy :
To stop slave escapees from making it across the border to Sudan or Ethiopia , the cruelest policy the regime has come up with is the shoot - at - sight policy at border crossings .
The case of the 12 Mai-Temenai kids ( a neighborhood in Asmara ) shot at the border recently is a case in point .
Prisons within a prison :
Even though the whole national service is a huge prison , those who are considered not malleable enough to fit into the experimentation are sent to walled prisons .
To date , there are tens of thousands of prisoners languishing in hundreds of prisons and concentration camps scattered all over Eritrea , the overwhelming majority of which come from the slave laborers population group .
Executions and massacres :
These too are not uncommon .
The massacres at Adi-Abeyto , where more than 50 rounded - up young men were killed , and at Wi’a , where more than 160 young men lost their lives in similar fashion , are two cases in point .
Many die in prisons as a result of torture , malnutrition and diseases .
Many others are also executed and buried in unmarked graves under the cover of darkness .
Parental penalization :
Even the parents are not spared .
The parents of army deserters and conscription evaders are asked to pay a hefty price ( 50,000 Nakfa ) or to go to prison .
This is done more with the goal of making a lesson out of them to the rest of the population than bringing back the escapees , most of whom have already made it all the way to safe destinations .
Given the synoptic view of the type of modern - day slavery in Eritrea depicted above , the question that has to be answered now is :
Where do all the hundreds of thousands slave laborers work ?
And where in this picture of total deprivation and exploitation do the Western mining companies come in ?
Where do the slave laborers work ?
The slave laborers are all made to work in government projects .
Two types need to be mentioned here : agricultural and construction projects .
The first one is motivated by two needs : to feed a huge army and to grow cash crops for hard currency .
In its effort to feed a huge mass of ever - moving humanity , the government has been expropriating fertile farmlands from pastoralists and peasants at an alarming rate .
But what is more is that it is using the very manpower needed in the villages to tend their land as slave labor in its own farms .
No wonder the villages , strapped both of manpower and land , have been facing one famine after another .
The other consequence of the regime ’s farming policy is that , given its use of free slave labor in its farms , almost all private commercial farming has been bankrupted .
The result is total government monopoly .
Now all the big farms are owned by the PFDJ ( the ruling party ) , the army or directly by the government itself [ do n’t get fooled , they all amount to the same thing ] .
Government - owned companies running these farms include : Afhimbol Agricultural Project , Alebu Dairy Farm , Gash - Setit Agricultural Project , Homib Agricultural Establishment , Sawa Agricultural Industry , etc .
The other part that “ employs ” a huge number of slave laborers is construction : of roads , bridges , micro-dams , housing , etc .
Many of these projects are either meant to occupy the hands of Warsai or to generate hard currency for the regime .
The government has , step by step , systematically killed all private - owned construction companies .
Now , all the construction companies working in the nation are owned by the government .
Again , one of the effective ways it did to kill private companies was by availing itself of free labor from the huge pool of slave laborers in the national service .
Remember that it pays a worker a measly 500 Nakfa ( $ 12 ) .
No company would be able to compete with that .
To mention some of the government owned construction companies : giant national ones like Asbeco , Bidho , Ghedem , Rodaab and Segen and smaller ones such as Badme , Haben , Mereb , Musa Ali and Sawa .
Now add all the banks ( National Bank of Eritrea , Commercial Bank of Eritrea , Housing and Commerce Bank of Eritrea , etc. ) , the only insurance company ( National Insurance Company of Eritrea ) , most of transportation companies and whatever is left of that most foolish of all its endeavors – Eritrean Airlines – to the government ’s ownership list to see how thorough and pervasive this monopolization has become .
You could also easily see that whatever is deemed to be a good source of hard currency for the money strapped regime is given priority .
Export - oriented agricultural projects and housing projects entirely oriented to the Diaspora community are two such examples .
But now the mining projects have come to overshadow these other projects in terms of importance to the survival of this brutal regime and , understandably , slave labor has come to occupy central role in them .
Mining companies and slave labor
Where do the mining companies come into this web of conspiracy against the Eritrean people ?
The “ slavery ” link could throw light on the nature of their involvement .
Since Nevsun is the first mining company to go fully operational , one need only examine its project at Bisha to see the extent of slave labor used there – a trend that every other mining company will have to follow .
We need to look both at those directly hired by Nevsun and those indirectly hired by the subcontracted local companies to get the full picture .
A look at the history of PFDJ ’s dealings with local and foreign companies will be essential in figuring out what is going on in Nevsun ’s mining project .
National service to the PFDJ ’s rescue
As the government keeps expanding national service to include every adult in the country and for as many years as possible , many companies have been facing dire shortages of workers .
If a company ( or any other workplace ) wants to keep a worker considered too indispensable , the government relents under one condition : that the worker does his national service while working in the company .
All that this says is that worker will get only 500 Nakfa ( $ 12 ) to the duration of his / her service , which goes indefinitely for years , while the company pays the rest of the money to the government .
At its most bizarre , the government used to do that to its own employees in various ministries .
First , it would declare some workers to be too valuable in their workplace to do national service in the army , and then it cuts off their salaries for years , pretending that they were in extended national service .
The case of teachers is a notable one .
Considered to be indispensable in their task as educators , many were pauperized by the meager salary they were getting for the duration of their service .
Knowing this lucrative business of selling slaves , the government used to target organizations with big monies in the pipeline like the UN , UNMEE , NGOs and foreign companies .
The case of HALO Trust comes easy to mind .
The aftermath of the war left Eritrea with a huge part of its land planted with tens of thousands of landmines .
One of the companies employed to do the clearing of landmines by the UN was HALO Trust , the largest NGO of its kind in the world .
Locals were trained to do the actual demining process , mostly from the national service .
Given that they were involved in a very high risk job , they were initially paid relatively high wages .
As usual , the government protested , and allowed them to be paid meager salary and wanted to pocket the difference .
This maltreatment of employees by the government was one of the main contentions between the regime and the company .
In the end , the regime , typical of its handling NGOs and other foreign entities that did n’t go along with its various schemes to rob its own subjects , expelled the company from Eritrea .
The regime abhors any substantial amount of money without passing through its hands .
The main reason why the regime did n’t want the NGOs in the land was because it felt they were blocking the money from the donor community from reaching its hands .
That is why , after expelling them , it championed cash - for - work policy only – a scheme that the EU easily fell into .
Given that most of the work was done by slave laborers , most of that cash donated by the donor community went directly to the regime ’s coffers .
What we need to know now is whether the mining companies are entering the kind of deals mentioned above with the regime where they allow the government to exploit the laborers working for them and pocket a disproportionate amount of their salaries .
What we know now is that when Nevsun Resources Ltd. began directly hiring locals , the median salary was about $ 300 a month , undoubtedly considered to be better - off salary when compared with the national one for similar jobs .
Not surprisingly , the government strongly protested ; it wanted the wages to be drastically cut to resemble the local ones .
The company reluctantly cut it into half .
No one knows for sure if the government is pocketing the difference .
Given the track record of the regime in similar dealings , as pointed above , the latter possibility is not pure speculation .
But even if this is going on , it would still remain a small part of the story , for the majority of the employees are not directly employed by the companies .
Subcontracted PFDJ companies
When it comes to the question of which local companies to subcontract , for the mining companies it is not even an option .
As pointed above , since the PFDJ - owned companies have already bankrupted and forced almost every private company in its field out of the market and in the process monopolized the whole economy , the mining companies will have no other alternative than to hire these government - owned companies ; and that is exactly what they are doing .
Much of the work that does n’t require very specialized tasks like transportation , construction , providing food for the local workers and any other menial jobs will be done by local companies .
Still , that does n’t mean all the government - owned companies are involved in non-specialized tasks only ; a case in point is Eri-Drilling , owned by Eritrea and South Africa , subcontracted to do drilling .
There is no doubt then that the overwhelming majority of the workers in the mining projects are those “ hired ” by the subcontracted government - owned companies .
And that is where the link to slave labor exists at its strongest .
We all know that the much - vaunted “ developmental projects ” like roads , bridges and micro-dams are entirely built using the slave labor of national service ; a free source of labor that the government - owned companies used to kill every conceivable private competition .
These PFDJ - owned companies that are now hired by the Western mining companies are availing themselves from the same source of free labor to do their assigned tasks in the mining projects , and the mining companies are looking the other way .
In the case of Nevsun Resources Ltd. , the government - owned Segen Construction Co. has ended up with the lion ’s share .
Senet is a South African company that is given the role of General Contractor , and is subcontracting its work to local and foreign companies .
The biggest of the local companies subcontracted by Senet is Segen Construction Co .
The company is involved in construction of roads , micro-dams , housing complex and building materials .
And typical of all government - owned construction companies , the overwhelming majority of its employees and labor force come from the slave labor pool of youngsters brought from the national service and army .
This also holds true for almost every other subcontracted local company .
One need to carefully look at the level of exploitation involved in these schemes .
What the slave laborers get on salary is what is given to them as the others in the national service – a meager $ 12.00 a month .
Since the subcontracted companies get their money lump sum , the level of robbery involved in this scheme is astounding .
Let ’s say that , under normal circumstances , the average salary would be $ 300 .
Now , the government would pocket a difference of $ 288 from each employee – a whopping 96 % of what they were supposed to earn .
I mentioned above many government - owned companies involved in various sorts of construction .
These will be the companies with the largest number of employees in all the mining projects .
Roads that lead to these mining areas , many of which were inaccessible before , are being built by these companies .
All the employees working in these areas have to be housed in the vicinity ; all the housing projects are done by these companies .
Various other projects that require construction are also being undertaken in the mining process itself , and the bulk of that will be done by these companies .
One that needs particular attention is the nature of mining involved in all the mining projects in Eritrea : open - pit mining [ the environmental degradation that takes places as a result of open - pit mining is huge , but that is a subject matter for another time ] .
As the companies sift through one layer of earth after the other to extract first gold , then silver , then copper and last zinc , their open - pit mining will eventually look stadium - size gigantic holes with terraces leading from the ground level all the way to the bottom .
For example , in Nevsun ’s case , it is projected the first couple of years or so will be used to get the gold and silver out ; then would follow the extraction of copper and zinc for the rest of the ten - year lifetime projected for the whole Bisha mining project .
The open - pit mining involves a lot of soil moving , terracing and walling ; all of which will be done by PFDJ - owned construction companies .
The same holds true with other PFDJ - owned companies , albeit in a smaller scale .
Someone has to feed the local employees , and the agricultural companies are the only ones well positioned to provide that service .
So is it with other companies : transportation , insurance , banking , etc .
Let me say a few words about the latter to highlight the extent of robbery used in the destitution of the workers .
Daylight robbery at the Bank of Eritrea
One of the most effective ways that the regime does to rob money out of its people is the hard currency exchange rate system it uses .
So far , the main engine of the nation ’s economy has been the large Diaspora community .
A great part of the huge remittance sent by the Diaspora community to their families passes through PFDJ hands where an extortion exchange rate system is used to milk the poor recipients of more than 60 % of what they are supposed to get .
You see , the black market exchange rate system is about 45 Nakfa for one dollar , and it is that exchange rate that really reflects the value of the local currency , the Nakfa ..
But the official rate system that the banks use is 15 Nakfa for one dollar ; only a third of the dollar ’s real worth .
Of course , most of the Diaspora community uses the black market , but it is fraught with danger .
Besides , since many of the Diaspora community – in tens of thousands – visit their country every year , they are asked to register the amount of hard currency they bring with them at the airport .
All that money has to be exchanged using the official exchange rate .
The regime used the same extortion system with foreign entities whenever it could get away with it .
Its insistence that an NGO has to put 2 million dollars in an Eritrean bank for it to remain operational in the country was done with that extortion in mind .
Now , let ’s return to the mining companies .
Take , for instance , the case of those that are directly hired by the mining companies and were meant to be paid , say , roughly $ 300 a month .
First , the government protests and cuts their salaries in half , immaterial of whether it pockets the difference or not .
Second , since these companies are not allowed to pay the employees in hard currency , they will have to exchange it first in the government - owned banks [ there are no other banks ] before they pay their local employees .
For the companies , there is no loss ; it will always be the same amount of hard currency that they will issue .
The loss will be the employees ’ ; it is they who will have to be paid with the extortion exchange system .
That is , two thirds of their salary would be lost in the exchange system itself alone .
So if we add this to the first robbery mentioned above , we can see that even those directly employed – let alone the slave laborers that work in the subcontracted government - owned companies – would be left with a pittance in their hands in the end .
Now you can easily see what I meant at the beginning when I said that it is not only that the government that is sweetening their packages to attract the Western companies in an otherwise inhospitable area , but it is also the mining companies that are accommodating the regime in every way they can , the most horrible of which is in the role they are playing to keep the culture of slave labor deeply entrenched in Eritrea well and alive .
Conclusion
The goal of this article is not only to inform Eritreans of what is going on in their country in the name of a “ mining boom ” , but also to inform the rest of the world .
First , the democratic nations – mainly Canada , Australia , Britain and South Africa – from which these mining companies hail have to live up to their own expectations .
It seems to me to be hypocritical for these governments to approve sanctioning Eritrea , on the one hand , while they keep a blind eye to the unholy alliance struck between their companies and the very regime they want to proscribe , on the other hand .
This hypocrisy starts with the US .
Even though the German bank that was meant to finance Nevsun Resources Ltd. finally withdrew from the deal for lack of governmental support that had to insure it if it were to go ahead with the venture , in the end it was a US company that rescued Nevsun .
This US company must have been given a green light by administration officials , something to the effect that it is OK to invest in Eritrea despite the sanctioning , to be so bold as to buy 75 % shares of Nevsun .
This is an American gold fund whose name Nevsun company has yet to make public .
All this is ironic in light of the fact that it the US that has been the most vocal in sanctioning Eritrea .
Second , this article is also written with investors in mind .
The investors should know that their money is being used to perpetuate misery in the land in two ways .
Not only is it motivating the totalitarian regime to use all the slave labor it can in the mining companies to maximize its profit to unimaginable level , it will also be using all the revenues it gets from these mining projects to terrorize its own people and the region – the way it has been doing so for the last 15 years , .
And third , it is written with the aim of informing humanitarian and international labor union groups that are at the forefront in the fight against slave labor the nature and extent of slave labor in Eritrea , in general , and the extensive slave labor used in the Western mining companies ’ projects that are sprouting all over Eritrea , in particular .

Communications Minister Stephen Conroy has said he plans to introduce legislation by the end of next week that would require ISPs to block a blacklist of " refused classification " websites for all Australians .
It is not clear if the government will meet this deadline ; a spokeswoman for Conroy said the legislation would be introduced " after it has been considered by caucus and cabinet " .
Today ’s inclusion on " Internet Enemies " follows the naming of Conroy as the " internet villain of the year " last July at the Internet Service Providers ’ Association annual awards in London .
The latest report was seized on by Peter Coroneos , the managing director of the Internet Industry Association , who said it showed the international reception to the proposed internet filter .
" This regrettably puts Australia on notice that , despite the Rudd government ’s best intentions , any mandatory filtering policy is likely to be perceived internationally in ways that will not benefit our reputation as a free and open society , " he said .
" It will likely be used by less open societies as a vindication of their internet censorship regimes , despite any domestic attempts to draw distinctions .
Mandatory filtering is mandatory filtering by whatever colour it is painted . "
Conroy 's spokeswoman defended the internet filtering policy , saying RC content is already prohibited in physical media distributed offline .
" Under Australia ’s existing Classification regulations this material is not available in newsagencies , it is not on library shelves , you cannot watch it on a DVD or at the cinema and it is not shown on television , " she said .
Whether the internet filtering scheme gets up will most likely depend on the position of the Liberal Party , as the Greens have already pledged to oppose the legislation .
The opposition has yet to come to a final position on the matter but in a speech to the Grattan Institute last night shadow treasurer Joe Hockey said the policy was " likely to be unworkable in practice " .
He expressed concerns that the scope of blocked sites could expand in future and said it was up to parents , not governments , to regulate their children 's internet use .
A spokeswoman for Hockey said today that the shadow treasurer 's comments should not be interpreted as confirmation that the opposition would oppose the filtering legislation , as a decision had not yet been made .
In South Korea , the RSF report added , " draconian laws are creating too many specific restrictions on web users by challenging their anonymity and promoting self - censorship " .
" These countries are worrying us because they have measures that could have repercussions for freedom of expression on the internet , " RSF secretary general Jean - Francois Julliard said at an internet rights award ceremony on Thursday .
Russia and Turkey were also added to the watchlist , which is a category below RSF 's top " Enemies of the internet " , the countries it considers the 12 worst web freedom violators .
These include Saudi Arabia , Burma , China , North Korea , Iran and Vietnam .
" The world 's largest netizen prison is in China , which is far ahead of other countries with 72 detainees , followed by Vietnam and then by Iran , which have all launched waves of brutal attacks on websites in recent months , " RSF 's report said .
A senior manager of US internet giant Google , David Drummond , said there was an " alarming trend " of government interference in online freedom , not only in countries that are judged to have poor human rights records .
He cited Australia 's plans as an example , saying that there " the wide scope of content prohibited could include socially and politically controversial material " .
The Australian case " is an example of where these benign intentions can result in the spectre of true censorship " , he added , speaking at Thursday 's ceremony .
" Here in Europe , even in France , at this very moment , some are tempted by this slippery path of network filtering . "
Loading Last month , after Conroy called on YouTube to censor videos in accordance with his filtering scheme , the search giant 's head of policy in Australia , Iarla Flynn , said : " The scope of RC is simply too broad and can raise genuine questions about restrictions on access to information .
RC includes the grey realms of material instructing in any crime from [ painting ] graffiti to politically controversial crimes such as euthanasia , and exposing these topics to public debate is vital for democracy . "

Last week , I was trying to find out how to get my photo ’s metadata .
I had noticed that Windows could display the camera model , creation date and lots of other data on my photos , but I could n’t remember what that data was called .
I finally found what I was looking for .
The term is EXIF ( Exchangeable Image File Format ) .
For this post , we ’ll take a look at the various 3rd party packages that give you access to this information .
My first thought was that the Python Imaging Library would have this functionality , but I had n’t found the EXIF term yet and could n’t find that info in PIL ’s handbook without it .
Fortunately , I did eventually find a way to use PIL via a stackoverflow thread .
Here ’s the method that it showed :
from PIL import Image from PIL .
ExifTags import TAGS def get_exif ( fn ) : ret = {} i = Image.open ( fn ) info = i._getexif ( ) for tag , value in info.items ( ) : decoded = TAGS.get ( tag , tag ) ret [ decoded ] = value return ret
This works quite well and returns a nice dictionary object .
There are several fields that I found useless , such as the “ MakerNote ” field which looked like a lot of hexadecimal values , so you ’ll probably only want to use certain pieces of data .
Here ’s a sample of some of the info I got back :
{'YResolution ' : ( 180 , 1 ) , ' ResolutionUnit ' : 2 , ' Make ' : ' Canon ' , ' Flash ' : 16 , ' DateTime ' : ' 2009:09:11 11:29:10 ' , ' MeteringMode ' : 5 , ' XResolution ' : ( 180 , 1 ) , ' ColorSpace ' : 1 , ' ExifImageWidth ' : 3264 , ' DateTimeDigitized ' : ' 2009:09:11 11:29:10 ' , ' ApertureValue ' : ( 116 , 32 ) , ' FocalPlaneYResolution ' : ( 2448000 , 169 ) , ' CompressedBitsPerPixel ' : ( 3 , 1 ) , ' SensingMethod ' : 2 , ' FNumber ' : ( 35 , 10 ) , ' DateTimeOriginal ' : ' 2009:09:11 11:29:10 ' , ' FocalLength ' : ( 26000 , 1000 ) , ' FocalPlaneXResolution ' : ( 3264000 , 225 ) , ' ExifOffset ' : 196 , ' ExifImageHeight ' : 2448 , ' ISOSpeedRatings ' : 100 , ' Model ' : ' Canon PowerShot S5 IS ' , ' Orientation ' : 1 , ' ExposureTime ' : ( 1 , 200 ) , ' FileSource ' : ' \x03 ' , ' MaxApertureValue ' : ( 116 , 32 ) , ' ExifInteroperabilityOffset ' : 3346 , ' FlashPixVersion ' : ' 0100 ' , ' FocalPlaneResolutionUnit ' : 2 , ' YCbCrPositioning ' : 1 , ' ExifVersion ' : ' 0220'}
I do n’t really know what all of those values mean , but I know I can use some of them .
My purpose for wanting the data is to expand my simple Image Viewer such that it can display more info to the user about their photo .
Here are a few other libraries I found that can supposedly give access to the EXIF data :
I tried the Python Exif Parser and it worked quite well .
When I tried to install pyexiv2 on my Python 2.5 box at work , I got an error message about Python 2.6 not being found and then the installer quit .
There is no mention on the pyexiv2 website that it requires a certain version of Python to work , so that was a little frustrating .
Most of these modules have little or no documentation , which was also pretty frustrating .
From what I can tell , EXIF .py is supposed to be used via the command line rather than as an importable module .
Anyway , back to the Python Exif Parser .
It ’s actually simpler to use than PIL is .
Here ’s all you need to do after copying the exif.py file into your Python path :
import exif photo_path = " somePath\to\a\photo.jpg " data = exif.parse ( photo_path )
The code above returns mostly the same information that the PIL snippet does , although it uses integers instead of hex for the “ MakersNote ” and it has several “ Tag0xa406 ′ ” fields whereas the PIL data had some numerical fields ( which I excluded above ) .
I assume they reference the same information in different ways though .
Anyway , should you find yourself wandering the web when trying to discover this information , hopefully you will stumble upon this post and it will point you in the right direction .

Being the verbose kind , I guess I will put in a summary at the top leaving the original post below for everyone to read all the little details .
Essentially the summary is that I ( and many other core developers ) agree that HEAD / trunk in its current form was stalling future development on PHP .
Jani indirectly jump started the discussion of moving this stumbling block out of the way by essentially doing two commits that violate the most fundamental rules of PHP development ( and common sense courtesy ) we have .
I am worried that this will lead to confusion in the user base and other seem to think that the " ends justify the means " .
I also think that we need clearer processes to make it easier for new developers to have a clear path to follow in order to get things done in PHP .
Full story :
So this all requires a bit of background .
I still remember my first contact with a PHP core developer .
I do not quite remember the year , but it was quite some time ago .
Anyway Jani was great , we filed a bug report on the imap extension .
He fixed the bug in no time .
IIRC we also ended up sharing a room at the second IPC in Frankfurt I attended .
I think only a few years later I realized that Jani is the same guy a lot of people were complaining as being rude .
But I guess few of these people realize how much time Jani has spend on verifying bug reports and what a tedious job this is , especially since most bug reports are quite low on the actual relevant details and come with a " fix my code for me , now ! " attitude .
In other words , I get along fine with Jani and I have great respect for his contributions to PHP .
Next piece of background .
I am also one in the long list of people that has made a fool of himself by predicting a release of PHP6 in about 18 to 24 months ( quite a few people have given this prediction over the past 3 - 4 years I guess ) .
I have also been one of the people that has tried to motivated people at various times to finish those last 2 % that seem to be missing to complete PHP6 in terms of functionality .
As such I have opposed a PHP 5.4 because I felt its time to focus on finish up PHP 6 which we have promised people for so long .
After releasing 5.3.0 I was hoping things would happen .
But last weekend I came to the realization that we have waited long enough .
That even if PHP 6 would be unicode bliss ( at least in terms of features , probably not in terms of performance ) , the fact of the matter is that in all of the many years nobody put in the time to finish it .
This imho is an indirect proof that the approach taken apparently does not hold enough merit to the world in general .
Furthermore looking at internals since last summer it has been more dead than ever : PHP 6 aka HEAD aka trunk had become such a motivation killer that nothing was happening .
At the same time I knew that suggesting to move trunk to a branch and copying 5_3 to trunk would cause a lot of confusion .
Not only among those reading internals , but also that this would quickly make it to the news sites of the world .
Call it politics , marketing or just an unwillingness to cause thousands ( millions ? ) of PHP developers distress and uncertainty , but I figured it would be better to propose this with a semi solid plan and giving a number of PHP core developers the heads up that I will bring this to the list , so that they also could prepare themselves .
So I started talking to people offlist , either in person , via phone , via IRC / skype or via email with the full intention of going to the list no later than the end of this month , ideally sooner rather than later .
I should also note , I do not code C , I also do not consider myself a unicode expert .
So if I wanted to present a plan , I obviously needed to talk to people to get my facts straight .
Anyways , this week Jani decided to commit a patch .
I guess I did n't mention one more piece of background .
Jani had asked to get this patch into PHP 5.3 during the pre alpha stage , but at the time Johannes and I ( I was co - RM back then ) felt that the patch had n't been tested enough in HEAD and that while we knew the patch fixes several bugs , we felt the risk of introducing new bugs was too high , especially since Michael who wrote the original patch for HEAD was not always around to fix things .
Johannes had tried to get the patch into 5.3 six months earlier , but at the time nobody had time to do the work .
So we decided to stick with the known bugs , instead of fixing them and risking new bugs in a very core component of PHP close to going alpha .
So basically Jani committed a huge patch into a stable branch , without talking to anyone about this , despite knewing full well that the RM had specifically vetoed this patch in principle .
Furthermore the patch from my understanding even breaks the ABI which makes the patch even more a no go .
Now I was quite surprised when I saw this patch and I at first got confused why Johannes would allow this patch in now only to find out that he did n't .
Like several others I told Jani that he needs to revert this patch , but I then did the fatal mistake of expressing sympathy for Jani by saying that he probably was acting out because of frustration over PHP 6 been stalled as the patch in question was already applied there .
Now instead of reverting the patch Jani decided to take things a step further now and simply created a PHP 5_4 branch , despite the fact that during the last discussion over the creation of 5_4 the consensus was to instead focus on PHP 6 .
Of course there was little focus on PHP 6 , which is why I ( and many others ) also wanted to drop the current approach .
If the next version should be 5.4 or 6.0 is of course not a trivial decision to make .
For one we had already decided on a lengthy list of [ stuff we wanted to remove from PHP for PHP 6 , and even if we were to drop unicode from PHP 6 , chances were we would stick to the original plan for all other things .
Obviously we can however not start stripping these features in a 5.4 .
Anyway , the good news in all of this was that people were starting to get excited about the future of PHP again .
But what irritated me was that apparently a fan club for Jani 's actions was forming .
It seemed that people were saying he was providing a " shock to the system " that revived core .
I do not have reason to believe that it would have been less successful to revive internals without basically pissing all over an RM decision and then following this up by pissing over all sorts of unwritten rules that it's not a lone wolf call to create a branch with the name of a possible future PHP version .
Worse yet , if this even gets you a fan club , it means that the already insanely maddening work of an RM just got that much harder .
Furthermore Jani was happily committing away into the 5_4 branch , while others were still working on 5_3 .
Why should they suddenly be obligated to merge stuff into 5 _4 because of Jani 's shooting from the hip decision ?
Should n't the point in time for such a branch be a bit more consciously decided ?
Calls to get the branch removed were answered that its all good and sooner or later the 5_4 branch will be renamed into trunk anyway , even though there was still no clear decision .
I am sorry , I might be a rule loving German but WTF ?!?!?!?!
At this point I cannot even try to put into words the level of disappointment .
Of course most of us do the bulk of the work on PHP in our spare time , but we do have to have a sense of responsibility to the world out there , with many people depending their professional life 's on PHP , something I assume we welcome , and we are toying with the image of PHP here .
We are also toying with the position of the RM here , one of the few roles we have in PHP , which is critical to getting at least a tiny bit of structure into the development process .
PHP is simply too big to go without any structure at all .
So to me the only thing to do at this point was to slam a bit on the breaks .
For one I asked that Jani 's commit karma be revoked until we sort out the situation .
This would have given us the opportunity to communicate to the world at large : " Sorry , someone jumped the gun , do expect some real news to be communicated soon . "
Instead we have news ( heise is probably the most important german speaking tech site ) sites and the twitter - verse announcing the creation of 5_4 and the death of native unicode inside the engine .
But the cheerleading went on and any criticism of Jani was deemed " bashing " .
Again WTF ?!?!?!
I should note one more thing .
A lot of people got pissed off by the fact that I decided to first talk to people offlist .
This includes many people who I have not yet contacted and a few I did contact .
I realize that it 's not ideal to do so .
I hope nobody is implying I might be complaining about Jani because I was hoping for a moment of fame singlehandedly reviving PHP development .
I also realize that going to the list directly could not have been worse than what Jani has created now .
I also realize that with all the unwritten rules and power structures in PHP its hard for new guys to get the things happening they want ( the fact that traits is still not committed to trunk is a prime example of this very problematic situation ) .
In that light to many Jani 's stepping over all rules and processes might seem empowering to the people that are not part of the " inner circle " of core PHP developers .
I think thats very short sighted .
Again I am German , so I have a tendency to trust rules a lot , but I feel the more rules and processes the actually write down and follow , the more of a chance new people will have in getting " shit done " without turning the project 's principles to " shit " like what Jani did with his commits the past two days .
So instead of cheering on Jani to continue pissing all over the very few rules we do have , I feel people should more work towards identifying some more rules we can agree on that will ensure that new guys have a clearer processes to getting things into core .
I hope that with this blog post I have clarified my position a bit more and I hope that I have convinced some of you that thinking first rather than just shooting from the hip is the better approach when it comes to dealing with such large sweeping decisions like reconsidering the branch into which so much work was pored into and on which so many promises for the future of PHP were based .
After taking a bit of time to playing some " laser frisbee " and listening to soothing music I am now again a bit hopeful that we can bring some dearly needed structure into the process to determining a realistic plan for the future of PHP that best serves our large user base .
$ ( '# mytable tr:not ( # '+$ ( tr ) . attr ( 'id ' ) + ' ~tr ) ' ) .size ( ) -
1
Clearly just saying tr.rowIndex is no good .
It 's too fast , or too readable , or something .
( Actually the real reason it's a no - go because it's part of the standard DOM , which everyone knows is “ full of [ unspecified ] browser bugs ” which using jQuery magically manages to fix , except when it does n't . )
The Lure Of Strings is here once more .
j Query users want to work with strings , not DOM objects .
Strings are easy !
You can make a selector string $ ( ' # '+id ) so much more easily than having to type out boring document.getElementById( id ) , and it 'll only be a bit slower , and it 'll only fall over when there 's a dot or colon in the ID , and that probably wo n't happen , unless maybe it does , so that 's OK .
Plus , you can make a div by saying $ ( ' < div > ' + message + '</div >') instead of having to muck around with document.createElement ( ' div ' ) and text nodes .
Hooray !
Only ... hang on .
You 've not escaped that HTML , and have probably just created a cross - site - scripting security hole , only on the client side this time .
And after you 'd spent so long cleaning up your PHP to use htmlspecialchars on the server - side , too .
What a shame .
Ah well , no - one really cares about correctness or security , do they ?
j Query 's not wholly to blame for this .
After all , the innerHTML property has been about for years , and already proved more popular than DOM .
But the library certainly does encourage that style of coding .
I do have some serious reservations about a lot of the stuff jQuery does , but that 's a long , complicated and boring tirade for another time .
Preferably a time when I 've got some actually - useful JavaScript library stuff on my software page instead of the manky 8 - year - old scripts aimed at IE5 and Netscape bleedin ' 4 which live there at the moment ... but that would involve updating this site .
Which it turns out I 'm really not very good at .
Tsk , eh ?
PS .
I do n't much like Prototype , either .

Spyware : end of an era
That 's it ; “ spyware ” is done .
Zango ( né 180 solutions ) , the last of the major spyware vendors , is no more .
It is unclear at this point what parts of Zango live on after being purchased by blinkx .
I suppose it 's possible that it's a case of moving the system to new operators whilst shrugging off some of the old debts .
But whether blinkx have the means and intent to keep the adware network up and running or not , it 's the last nail in the coffin for the concept of adware .
If 180 , having swallowed up its other extant competitors ( Hotbar and CDT ) can't make it work , the adware model is doomed .
And predictably so .
It has always been blatantly obvious that adware does not offer an acceptable value proposition for any rational customer : years of irritating ads and loss of control over your computer and privacy , in exchange for some crappy smilies or video you can almost certainly get elsewhere for free ?
Not a goer .
Even if you could be persuaded to install it , the obvious course of action is to remove the adware again immediately afterwards .
So adware can not be viable on legitimate terms .
The only way to make it pay is to cheat : to hack ‘ consent ’ by hiding your agreement where no - one will see it ; to target inexperienced or non-rational customers who wo n't understand the agreement ( in particular children ) ; and to install without any consent at all , through silent bundling or in the worst cases install by exploit .
180 and the rest of the industry did all of these ; when finally threatened into curbing the worst of this behaviour by legal threats and the FTC , they were no longer capable of keeping the model afloat .
Ken Smith , previously CTO , offers a mixture of apologia and self - justification in a post - mortem at his blog .
It 's interesting to see how he views 180 's actions , but some of the comments seem a little disingenuous to me .
We partnered with some people that we should never have partnered with .
During that time period , my best estimate is that something like 4 % of our installs during that time period were completely silent , i.e. , were the result of affiliates using browser security holes
I think this is a massive under-estimate .
Perhaps only 4 % of affiliates were directly using browser security hole exploits themselves , but there were also many intermediary affiliates that installed 180 software without any notice or consent , having themselves previously been installed silently .
For example , a 180 variant was installed by NeoToolbar , which was itself installed by CoolWebSearch variants , which were installed by exploits .
Another was installed by MediaMotor ( later shut down by the FTC ) , which was installed by SmartBot exploits .
And so on .
Plus there were many installs that were simple bundles rather than exploits , just with no notification or consent that 180 software would be installed .
I 'd say this also counts as silent ; the figure must be much higher than 4 % even ignoring the issue of whether a few paragraphs of legalese in an enormous EULA squashed into a tiny scrollbox counts as meaningful consent .
Empirically , I used to see 180 software all over the computers I was looking after , with the owners unaware of what they had done ( if anything ) to receive it .
But more recently * , I 've not come across a single one .
Whilst some of that will have come from greater customer awareness of the dangers of installing software with bundles attached , the majority has to be up to the move away from silent installs .
(* : I 'd say “ since 180 cleaned up their act ” but that would imply their modern practices were completely clean .
I do n't necessarily consider that the case .
Some promotional materials are still misleading and / or seemingly aimed at children , and much of the content used as bait by affiliates is worthless at best — and at worst , as in the case of the fake torrents , illegal .
But it is undeniable that 180's behaviour has been much better than in their heyday . )
Back in 2003 , spyware meant " a program that your wife puts on your computer to track what you 're doing . "
By 2005 , it was synonymous with " adware " , which was an awkward if reasonable description of Zango 's business model .
How did this happen ?
Oh , that 's an easy one .
You get called spyware because your software spies .
180 software included long - term clickstream tracking functionality ( which though not immediately personally - identifiable can easily become so through leakage of information in URLs ) , and , much worse , deliberate sniffing of e-mail addresses and personal registration details from multiple third - party programs ( eg. Outlook Express ) .
You may take offence because the primary purpose of the software is not spying , and demand to be called adware instead as ads are the main thing the software is designed for .
But your software leaks information ; security researchers have no way to verify what happens to that information after it leaves the computer .
If you do n't want to be considered spyware , do n't spy .
Do n't do something incredibly suspicious like sniffing out the user 's name , e-mail address and ZIP code if you do n't intend to use it .
( It 's amusing how , over the years , “ no spyware ! ” has become a phrase only ever used by spyware .
Like farts , where He Who Denied It Supplied It , “ we 're not spyware ! ” is an immediately obvious red flag that something quite smelly is present . )
And very few of those programs had any sort of notice , QA , or presence in Add / Remove Programs : in contrast , Zango had all of those things .
Only in the latter days .
Earlier versions of Zango ( originally ‘ n Case ’ ) were installed with no notice , served unlabelled ads , occasionally crashed , and had no Add / Remove function ; indeed , some resisted being manually uninstalled .
You had executables with completely random names , dropped into different folders to be difficult to find .
And when removed , many versions left an ActiveX installer in - place , allowing nCase to be re-installed without any notice by any web site .
Malice or simple incompetence , there 's no excuse for this stuff .
You 're crying because your reputation was terrible in the later years of Zango despite having improved things since the early days .
But there should never have been any later years , because the actions of the early days were simply unlawful .
180 solutions 's software did untold damage to machines it had no authorisation to access ; if the FTC or other authorities had been more on the ball in 2002 - 2004 you would have been shut down already .
I 'm working on another startup
I wish you luck — if it 's a theology startup .
If it 's adware again , not so much .
After all , they [ the anti-spyware vendors ] were in it to make a buck as well
No , not originally .
The first wave of anti-spyware tools — OptOut , Ad - Aware and Spybot Search and Destroy — were completely free .
They were originally written by amateurs to satisfy the malware removal needs that were not being met by traditional anti-virus vendors ( who ignored the problem for years , perhaps afraid of litigious adware companies like your own ) .
Anti-spyware in decline
Things are a bit different now of course .
As described in an earlier post , the category of adware barely exists any more .
Instead we have the annoying but relatively harmless bundled toolbars from Google , MS , Yahoo and Ask on one side , with the trojans , botnets and fake anti-spyware apps installed by PPI fraud and Russian exploits on the other , not even attempting to look legit .
I guess if you 're going to do exploits , the proper trojans pay better than adware .
There 's very little in between ( you still see the Mirar toolbar installed by the trojans occasionally , but that 's about it ) , so there 's little left that the anti-virus people are n't already targeting .
Generally unsuccessfully targeting , but that 's another story .
Some anti-spyware apps have themselves drifted out to target this more obvious malware , with the result that there 's little difference between them and the traditional anti-virus stack .
There is no longer really any place for dedicated anti-spyware .
But the anti-spyware companies now really are out to make a buck , and it's hard to take a broken business model that 's still making you money and just decide to pack it all in .
This is leading to some strange bedfellows .
AVG and SpySweeper have been bundling variants of the Ask toolbar ( previously considered spyware ) , and now both Ad - Aware and SpywareBlaster are pushing users towards TrialPay , one of those nasty schemes where you have to sign up for dodgy offers you do n't want , then cancel them and hope you do n't have to spend the next twelve months on a helpline trying to stop your credit card being billed .
Which may not be spyware , but it 's certainly exactly the same kind of marketing unpleasantness that the adware companies loved to push .
It 's a bit sad to see previously impeccable software teams go this way .
To be honest I do n't even know why SpywareBlaster still exists ; its ActiveX CLSID - based blocking was relevant to the unsolicited commercial software threats of yesterday , but does absolutely nothing against the exploits , trojans and rogue anti-spyware that dominate today .
The parasite - detector script on this site worked in a similar way , but has since been withdrawn as it's of almost no practical use any more .
( I 'll probably remove the ‘ parasite ’ section itself completely soon .
Certainly the advice about anti-spyware software there is woefully out of date .
Perhaps I 'll replace it with an archive of the old , much - plagiarised parasite list for historical interest . )
Plug out
Another point release of Firefox was released today , fixing more security holes .
IE was a week ago with the usual monthly round - up .
It seems we 've completely given up on the idea of having a secure browser , and are happy to let it update once a month instead .
It 's a bit sad , but that 's the price of having such a complex and expanding feature set , I suppose .
But still , the majority of successful exploits recently are n't even targeting the browser , but plug-ins .
Quicktime , Real , Windows Media and especially Java have been targeted by the Russian malware gangs in the past , but the current favourite by a mile is the Adobe Reader PDF plug -in .
Perhaps the reason these attacks are so successful is that while browsers are understood to be net - facing software it is important to keep updated , users do n't really understand what they have with plug-ins .
And why should they ?
If you install Adobe Reader , it says nothing about installing a PDF plugin .
You would n't naturally expect it to , because let 's face it , no - one wants to read PDFs squished up in a little embedded box in a web browser .
It 's an unpleasant experience even when it works , and it adds a whole load more attack surface to the web browser .
Plus it occasionally crashes .
Previously , to be attacked , you 'd have to explicitly download and double - click on a PDF you wanted to read .
Now , you 're at risk just by going to a web page .
And not just known ‘ dodgy ’ web pages like porn and warez ; any number of high - profile sites have been hacked , or included adverts from networks that are hacked .
For example for the last week , foxnews.com has been happily sending its readers to PDF exploits .
( Yeah , I know , Fox News is way dodgier than porn or warez ect ect jolly laughs and so on . )
When you install Microsoft Office , do you really want to be able to view Excel spreadsheets in your web browser ?
That 's what the installer quietly does for you .
You 'll probably never actually need that feature , but it does still make you vulnerable to various Office Web Components exploits that have come out over the years .
Now you have to worry about keeping Office up - to - date .
When you install iTunes , do you expect arbitrary web pages to be able to fire up the iTunes application ?
They can now , so if there are security holes in it you 're at risk .
You have to keep it updated ... that and the Quicktime plug - in it will also install behind your back .
You can use the Apple Software Updater to do it , but how can you trust that when it has been known to also bundle further unrequested applications like Apple 's Safari browser ?
Is the Apple logo on your MacBook not brash enough for everyone in the coffee shop to see ?
Is that streamlined aluminum appearance too Pro for you ?
Time to enter the newly opened KARVT online store , where unabashed Apple fans can finally add the sophistication of " 100 % real authentic wood " to their beloved machines .
Most popular tastes can be accommodated , with different shades of cherry , bamboo , pine , and walnut on offer , and there 's even an artists ' section where some design flair is added to your timberrific purchase .
The skins will fit on any recent Apple laptops , and prices are $ 35 for the wood grain or $ 50 for the artsy ones , with deliveries starting on May 1 .
Bargain or what ?
ROME — A senior Vatican priest , speaking before Pope Benedict XVI at a Good Friday service , compared the world ’s outrage at sexual abuse scandals in the Catholic Church to the persecution of the Jews , prompting angry responses from victims ’ advocates and consternation from Jewish groups .
The Vatican spokesman quickly distanced the Vatican from the remarks , which came on the day Christians mark the Crucifixion .
They underscored how much the Catholic Church has felt under attack from recent news reports and from criticism over how it has handled charges of child molesting against priests in the past .
The pope and his bishops have denounced abuses in the church , but many prelates and Vatican officials have lashed back at news reports that Benedict failed to act strongly enough against pedophile priests , once as archbishop of Munich and Freising in 1980 and once as a leader of the Vatican ’s powerful Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith .
The Vatican has denied that he was at fault , and Vatican officials have variously described the reports as “ deceitful , ” an effort to undermine the church and a “ defamatory campaign . ”
As dean of the Graduate School of Education at Hunter College , he sought to elevate the practical aspects of teaching : when to make eye contact , when to call on a student by name , when to wait for a fuller answer .
He now urges the use of video , a tool he pioneered at Hunter , to help student teachers see what works and what does n’t in the classroom ( “ Like taking apart a serve in tennis , ” he says ) .
In New York , teachers can begin working without a master ’s degree as long as they have had some education courses as undergraduates , but they must earn a professional certification within five years by receiving a master ’s degree from a teaching school .
New York is one of a dozen states that requires teachers to get a master ’s degree .
Alternative certification programs like Teach for America offer a quicker path for graduates who did not study education in college , allowing them to begin teaching from the outset while pursuing a master ’s degree after hours .
Under the Regents ’ proposal , which the board is expected to approve on Tuesday and does not need the approval of the State Legislature , Teach for America and similar groups could create their own master ’s programs , and the Regents would award the master ’s degree , two powers that are now the sole domain of academia .
The Regents are looking for academic programs that would be grounded in practical teaching skills and would require teachers to commit to working in a high - needs school for four years .

“ Ten years ago , this would have been an incredibly tough sell , ” Dr. Steiner said .
Education school deans say they are grateful that groups like Teach for America , which recruits heavily among recent college graduates , and N.Y.C. Teaching Fellows , which attracts young professionals seeking to change careers , have managed to rebrand teaching as both sexy and noble .
Some in New York have formed partnerships with these programs .
But the deans also say that the charge that they are mired in theory is outdated .
Geoffrey L. Brackett , provost of Pace University in Manhattan , pointed to Pace High School in Chinatown , which the university created in 2003 and functions as something of a laboratory for the university ’s education school .
“ You have our students at the graduate level being placed in that high school , but you also have current teachers working with our faculty on best practices and innovation , ” he said .
The agency once viewed as a major stumbling block to the bill 's passage is now seen as an inevitability by Republicans and key industry lobbyists alike .
Banks will accept consumer agency
Republican Sen. Richard Shelby recently made Democratic Sen. Chris
Dodd a tantalizing offer :
He 'd drop his opposition to an independent consumer financial protection agency as part of a renewed round of negotiations over sweeping financial reform .
It 's not clear what the top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee asked his Democratic counterpart for in return for the offer , which Shelby made almost immediately after a regulatory reform bill cleared the committee last month .
But Shelby ’s willingness to negotiate signals that an agency that would regulate mortgages , credit cards and most loans to consumers — once viewed as a major stumbling block to the bill 's final passage — is now viewed as an inevitability by Republicans and key industry lobbyists alike .

Big banks that have been vocal opponents of the agency have decided they have the legal resources to deal with a consumer agency , whether it 's independent the way it was originally proposed by President Barack Obama , or as a part of the Federal Reserve , as envisioned in Dodd 's bill .
Whatever its ultimate form , they expect they will still be able to influence the critical details of how it 's set up .
And smaller banks are expected to be exempt from many of the new agency 's regulations , according to insiders .
An even larger factor is that big financial institutions now have more important concerns as they scramble to fend off tighter restrictions on lucrative derivatives trades and other provisions of financial regulatory reform legislation that threaten the industry 's bottom lines .
Obama on Friday threatened to veto any bill that fails to place tight controls on derivatives , the complex financial instruments that played a key role in the 2008 global meltdown .
" While media reports and attention has been focused on the consumer protection piece , most industry believes there is a greater threat in other areas of the bill , " a Democratic industry lobbyist said .
Indeed , mammoth financial institutions like Citigroup , JPMorgan Chase , Goldman Sachs , Bank of America and Morgan Stanley are worried about one provision that would force more open dealings in the $ 450 - trillion over - the - counter derivatives market , an unregulated playground largely dominated by the quintet .
Another provision , the so - called Volcker Rule preventing federally insured banks from trading on their assets , essentially threatens to break up financial titans like JPMorgan .
And megabanks are worried about new rules governing how companies once deemed too big to fail would close down under the new system should they implode again .
Those five banks spent more than $ 21 million lobbying Congress last year , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
And they have employed plenty of Washington 's brand name lobbyists to work their influence , including : former House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt ; Steve Elmendorf , a former top Gephardt staffer ; Chuck Brain , former President Bill Clinton 's top lobbyist ; Ken Duberstein , a chief of staff in the Reagan White House ; and Tony Podesta , a prodigious fundraiser close to the Obama administration and much of the Senate Democratic caucus .
Not every lobbyist is willing to accept the inevitability of a consumer protection agency .
Scott Talbott , the chief lobbyist for the Financial Services Roundtable , said his group of top financial services firms is not backing off its opposition to it even as other issues take center stage .
" We 're not dividing our time , we 're multiplying it , " he said .
" We 're not dividing our priorities , we 're multiplying them . "
And the U.S. Chamber of Commercer is plowing ahead in its opposition to large swaths of the bill .
Its $ 3 million lobbying , grassroots and advertising campaign has prominently featured the argument that an independent consumer protection agency 's new regulations will hurt small business .
It 's a message that was chosen , in part , because it resonates with the public , said the Chamber 's Tom Quaadman .
" Why should Main Street be regulated because of the financial crises ? " Quaadman asked .
An example , he said , is that under the plan a local orthodontist who extends credit to help parents pay for their kids braces would fall under the new regulatory regime , he said .
Robert Weissman , president of the consumer group Public Citizen , said it was " preposterous " to suggest that the bill could regulate mom-and - pop orthodontists .
While Weissman does not buy the idea that banks are backing off the consumer protection issue he thinks an independent consumer agency is more likely because banks do n't want to be out front opposing an issue that the public understands .
Instead banks are choosing to " live reluctantly with the regulation , " hoping to " chip away at it legislatively over time . "
" The big banks know it 's politically counterproductive for them to say they 're opposed to consumer protection so they 're relying on others to publicly carry the fight for them , " Weissman said .
" On issues that can be presented as more complicated and technical , but have enormous import for their bottom lines , they 're fighting as hard against the public interest as they ever have . "
Industry fought the idea of an independent consumer protection agency , first proposed by Harvard Law professor Elizabeth Warren , from the beginning .
At one point , the proposal included a mandate that banks offer traditional alternatives to their more exotic products - a 30 - year mortgage as well as adjustable rate mortgages , for instance .
That provision was scuttled and the agency was made part of the Fed .
The ideological split between big - government - hating Republicans who opposed the agency and activist - government - loving Democrats who supported it , combined with the fight between industry and consumer groups gave the unwieldy and complex bill an understandable , media - friendly storyline .
But that was before Shelby offered to strengthen Dodd 's bill by endorsing an independent consumer protection watchdog , and the agency has since become less of an issue .
Once a prime target of industry , the proposed agency has become " small potatoes , " according to one Democratic industry lobbyist .
That 's not to say the banking industry does not have concerns about the agency .
It 's still pushing , for example , to ensure that states could never pass consumer protections tougher than the federal requirements .
Insiders frequently compare the battle over the consumer protection agency to the health care debate 's fight over the public option - both were lightening rod provisions that garnered months of debate and obscured other critical components of their respective bills .
The difference is that in this case , some version of the provision most popular with the Democratic base is likely to prevail .
" All of the groups on the far left and far right have seized on it as sort of the end - all - be - all and it really does n't go to the heart of reforming the system , " said a Democratic lobbyist , who represents commercial and investment banks .
" It 's the one thing that everybody can understand so it 's all that anybody talks about . "
Another Democratic financial services lobbyist with similar clients put it more bluntly : " Big players do n't give a [ expletive ] " about a new consumer protection agency .
Also driving the calculus is the issue 's changing politics .
Led by Shelby , Republicans universally opposed Dodd 's financial reform bill in committee .
In particular , Shelby called an independent consumer agency a dangerous folly .
But now , as Democrats prepare to bring the bill to the floor , Shelby is again trying to negotiate a deal with Dodd .
And Shelby 's offer to support an independent consumer advocate gives Republicans cover from Democratic charges that the GOP is in bed with bankers .
For their part , Democrats feel they are negotiating from a position of strength .
With voters angry at Wall Street , Republicans that vote against reform hand Democrats a good issue to run against them in November .
And Democrats only need to pick off one Republican to pass the bill .
Still , some insiders worry that Democrats could overplay their hand and push a bill with restrictions too onerous to win any Republican support .
And despite the scenario's political upside , the Obama administration has signaled it wants a legislative victory more than a political issue .
Some industry insiders chock up the Chamber and Roundtable efforts to the need for trade organizations to stick to the script on an issue where dues - paying members expect representation .
Privately , lobbyists say , most big companies are likely to accept an independent consumer protection board .
" Most banks , " said a Republican industry lobbyist , " can live with a reasonable new regulator . "
A Queensland parliamentary committee looking into alcohol - related violence has recommended weekday trading hours be wound back to no later than 2 am in entertainment precincts and 1 am elsewhere .
In its report tabled this morning , the bipartisan committee recommends 4 am trading on the weekend in the entertainment precincts , and 3 am elsewhere , with all premises subject to a 2 am lock - out .
It has also called for precincts to be declared as such and to have a management plan .
The committee has also recommended mandatory use of tempered glass or polycarbonate after midnight in all venues , other than those deemed to be low risk .
It says free water should be made available to patrons .
Closing hours for detached bottleshops are recommended to be wound back from 10 pm to 9 pm .
The committee says it supports increased penalties for violent offenders , and for more resources for police and liquor licensing authorities .
It has also recommended police and the courts have the power to ban offenders from the designated entertainment precincts .
The inquiry heard submissions from across Queensland on ways to curb alcohol - related attacks .
The committee held three public hearings and received more than 130 public submissions .
Other issues under consideration included the culture of drinking and the role parents can play in educating children .
The impact of alcohol - related violence on emergency service and health workers was also been considered .
Inquiry chairwoman , Labor MP Barbara Stone , says earlier closing will not hurt pubs and clubs around the state .
" We had a look at what people in the community ... expect and we had a look at traders when they spoke to us [ and ] were telling us that their peak times are that Friday , Saturday night , " she said .
" So we do n't believe we have impacted too much on their best trading times . "
Queensland Police Union ( QPU ) president Ian Leavers said yesterday the State Government should adopt the 2 am curfew for pubs and clubs , as applies in the city of Newcastle .
" They 've seen a 20 to 30 per cent reduction in general crime [ and ] a 30 per cent reduction in serious violent assaults and as well as sexual assaults , " he said .
Police Minister Neil Roberts said yesterday he personally agrees with the QPU view .
" The industry I 'm sure will be able to survive whatever the final hours are , " he said .
" I have a personal view that we do n't need to go through until 5 am but ultimately we need to take into account all views and obviously this report will be a significant milestone in terms of dealing with alcohol - fuelled issues in community . "
Queensland Nurses Union ( QNU ) assistant secretary Beth Mohle also said yesterday there should be stricter penalties for drunken attacks on hospital staff .
" We really do want to see that those sort of like avenues pursued in circumstances where there is violence towards nurses and other health workers , " she said .
Identification scanners
Pubs and clubs will also be encouraged to install identification scanners under recommendations being put to Queensland Parliament .
As part of the proposal , venues using the technology could be given a reduction in license fees .
Law , Justice and Safety committee member Dean Wells has expressed concerns that the measure could create identity and privacy issues .
Committee chairwoman Barbara Stone says ID scanners can help to reduce violence .
" Knowing that there 's going to be a picture of them , their driver 's licence , their details if anything happens - that 's there , that 's there for police , that 's there for the club to say you 're not coming back , " she said .
" Now I do n't know about you but I 'd be pretty upset if I was n't allowed to go to back to a club with my friends and enjoy my Friday night . "

( PhysOrg.com ) --
A team of MIT researchers has found a novel way to mimic the process by which plants use the power of sunlight to split water and make chemical fuel to power their growth .
In this case , the team used a modified virus as a kind of biological scaffold that can assemble the nanoscale components needed to split a water molecule into hydrogen and oxygen atoms .
Splitting water is one way to solve the basic problem of solar energy :
It 's only available when the sun shines .
By using sunlight to make hydrogen from water , the hydrogen can then be stored and used at any time to generate electricity using a fuel cell , or to make liquid fuels ( or be used directly ) for cars and trucks .
Other researchers have made systems that use electricity , which can be provided by solar panels , to split water molecules , but the new biologically based system skips the intermediate steps and uses sunlight to power the reaction directly .
The advance is described in a paper published on April 11 in Nature Nanotechnology .
The team , led by Angela Belcher , the Germeshausen Professor of Materials Science and Engineering and Biological Engineering , engineered a common , harmless bacterial virus called M13 so that it would attract and bind with molecules of a catalyst ( the team used iridium oxide ) and a biological pigment ( zinc porphyrins ) .
The viruses became wire - like devices that could very efficiently split the oxygen from water molecules .
Over time , however , the virus - wires would clump together and lose their effectiveness , so the researchers added an extra step : encapsulating them in a microgel matrix , so they maintained their uniform arrangement and kept their stability and efficiency .
While hydrogen obtained from water is the gas that would be used as a fuel , the splitting of oxygen from water is the more technically challenging " half - reaction " in the process , Belcher explains , so her team focused on this part .
Plants and cyanobacteria ( also called blue - green algae ) , she says , " have evolved highly organized photosynthetic systems for the efficient oxidation of water . "
Other researchers have tried to use the photosynthetic parts of plants directly for harnessing sunlight , but these materials can have structural stability issues .
Belcher decided that instead of borrowing plants ' components , she would borrow their methods .
In plant cells , natural pigments are used to absorb sunlight , while catalysts then promote the water - splitting reaction .
That 's the process Belcher and her team , including doctoral student Yoon Sung Nam , the lead author of the new paper , decided to imitate .
In the team 's system , the viruses simply act as a kind of scaffolding , causing the pigments and catalysts to line up with the right kind of spacing to trigger the water - splitting reaction .
The role of the pigments is " to act as an antenna to capture the light , " Belcher explains , " and then transfer the energy down the length of the virus , like a wire .
The virus is a very efficient harvester of light , with these porphyrins attached .
" We use components people have used before , " she adds , " but we use biology to organize them for us , so you get better efficiency . "
Using the virus to make the system assemble itself improves the efficiency of the oxygen production fourfold , Nam says .
The researchers hope to find a similar biologically based system to perform the other half of the process , the production of hydrogen .
Currently , the hydrogen atoms from the water get split into their component protons and electrons ; a second part of the system , now being developed , would combine these back into hydrogen atoms and molecules .
The team is also working to find a more commonplace , less - expensive material for the catalyst , to replace the relatively rare and costly iridium used in this proof - of - concept study .
Thomas Mallouk , the DuPont Professor of Materials Chemistry and Physics at Pennsylvania State University , who was not involved in this work , says , " This is an extremely clever piece of work that addresses one of the most difficult problems in artificial photosynthesis , namely , the nanoscale organization of the components in order to control electron transfer rates . "
He adds : " There is a daunting combination of problems to be solved before this or any other artificial photosynthetic system could actually be useful for energy conversion . "
To be cost - competitive with other approaches to solar power , he says , the system would need to be at least 10 times more efficient than natural photosynthesis , be able to repeat the reaction a billion times , and use less expensive materials .
" This is unlikely to happen in the near future , " he says .
" Nevertheless , the design idea illustrated in this paper could ultimately help with an important piece of the puzzle . "
Belcher will not even speculate about how long it might take to develop this into a commercial product , but she says that within two years she expects to have a prototype device that can carry out the whole process of splitting water into oxygen and hydrogen , using a self - sustaining and durable system .

Nature Nanotechnology , April 11 , 2010
Regular readers of this blog will know that we ’re been trying to develop the idea that a great deal of politics exists prior to the science in the argument for a political response to climate change .
This was the basis of our criticism of studies such as the GHF ’s and WHO ’s reports of ( respectively ) 300,000 and 150,000 deaths a year attributed to climate change – all of them in the world ’s poorer regions .
You can only make this kind of statement , we argue , if you take for granted that poverty is a ‘ natural ’ effect .
Otherwise , logically , the cause of so many deaths is in fact poverty , not climate change .
And on the other hand , we try to point out to sceptics that , as much fun as debunking hockey sticks and exposing Climategate emails is , the political debate does not rest on science .
Looking for the ‘ smoking gun ’ to ‘ debunk ’ global warming fears merely reproduces the mistake that alarmists make – it expects science to answer the political debate .
When we make this argument elsewhere , it seems to appear to our counterparts as though we are saying that somehow politics is prior even to material reality , which would seem to deny material or formal reality by making it somehow dependent on social reality in some kind of postmodern sleight of hand .
This is n’t what we ’re arguing .
What we are suggesting is that the politics is prior to formal reality in the argument , but not in formal reality .
It is a conceit of the warmists that they imagine their own argument to be perfect models of the world , such that to take issue with it them is to deny the causal universe itself .
In the real world , it is possible to presuppose certain things , and to model and project scenarios from these social , or political presuppositions .
There is nothing wrong , or unscientific about this .
But the assumed premises are easily forgotten , and from these projections , it seems , comes an argument for the politics that the projection presupposed .
This in turn is passed off as ‘ science ’ , ‘ speaking ’ .
The GHF and WHO ’s projections , for instance , have to presuppose that poverty is an immutable fact in order to make the claim that 150,000 / 300,000 deaths a year are caused by climate change ( rather than by poverty ) .
This in turn becomes an argument for policies which aim to mitigate climate change for the putative benefit of ‘ the poor ’ , but in reality miss entirely the factor which makes people vulnerable to climate – poverty , and lack of wealth more generally .
Our citing the cases of the GHF and WHO is not intended to make the argument that ‘ therefore all climate politics is wrong ’ , of course .
However , this kind of thinking is evident in virtually every argument that we have seen which posits the human consequences of climate change as a basis for political action .
It is a mistake that the GHF and WHO make .
It is a mistake that was made when it was assumed that the lives of millions of people would be at risk from the exaggerated Himalayan glacial recession .
And it seems that it is a mistake that is almost built into the operations of the IPCC .
The next move in any discussion is the trump card … the end - of - the world story that does not depend on modelling projections from presupposed scenarios .
There remains a risk that greenhouse gases will cause runaway climate change .
There remains the possibility that sea level rise will be so rapid and so high that it really does inundate society ’s adaptive capacity .
A small rise in temperature might unleash vast clouds of methane from under frozen land .
Just a few degrees of warming may cause a mass extinction event , destroying the world ’s biodiversity and capacity to support life .
And so on .
Only scientists can really understand these risks .
It ’s a curious thing to happen .
Anyone can construct a superficially plausible disaster story and then demand that only the scientist with the exact pertinent qualifications can stand in the way of its moral authority .
It is the straightforward application of the precautionary principle .
Such arguments are scientific only in the sense that they are expressed in technical terms , or require some technical knowledge to unpack them .
They are not claims of the same order that are made more often in the debate that attempt to match theory with empirical evidence .
It makes no difference what that actual numerical values of such risk calculations are .
That the scenario they depict is remotely plausible makes ignoring them – rhetorically speaking – as good as inviting them .
The mere possibility that your existence is threatened is held over the debate in much the same way as a gun to the head .
Not simply the worst - case scenario , but the worst - possibly - imaginable scenario carries more weight in debate than anything rational .
And it is passed off as “ science ” .
To challenge it is to “ deny ” science .
This is not a phenomenon that it is unique to climate politics .
If people want to take issue with our contention that climate politics are prior to climate science , they are most welcome .
They could , for example , argue that we are overstating the degree to which the politics is prior .
We are unaware of any extant sociological accounts of science that deny any confounding effect of politics in the scientific endeavour .
A good argument might be made , for instance , that science ’s quality control measures of peer review , replication and the like are more effective than we credit when it comes to squeezing out messy humanity from the process , or that political and scientific institutions are better than we believe at appraising their own biases , fears and desires when commissioning , conducting and interpreting policy - relevant scientific research .
But , as a general rule , that is not what happens .
Rather , we are accused of denying material reality , of attacking or disprepecting science … of postmodernism gone mad .
Which is as funny as it is infuriating .
Because to deny that climate politics is – to a greater or lesser degree – prior to climate science is as at odds with reality ( and even the academic consensus ) as the notion that the causal universe is merely a product of our collective imaginations .
If we are wrong , it is only by degree .
It ’s an argument we would enjoy having .
But it ’s not going to happen when just to broach the subject is seen as a sign that we are anti-science .
It is those writing us off as such who are wrong in absolute terms .
Sometimes you need to access private fields and call private methods on an object – for testing , experimentation , or to work around issues in third - party libraries .
. NET has long provided a solution to this problem : reflection .
Reflection allows you to call private methods and read or write private fields from outside of the class , but is verbose and messy to write .
In C# 4 , this problem can be solved in a neat way using dynamic typing .
As a simple example , I ’ll show you how to access internals of the List < T > class from the BCL standard library .
Let ’s create an instance of the List < int > type :
List < int > realList = new List < int >( ) ;
To access the internals of List < int > , we ’ll wrap it with ExposedObject – a type I ’ll show you how to implement :
dynamic exposedList = ExposedObject . From( realList ) ;
And now , via the exposedList object , we can access the private fields and methods of the List <> class :
// Read a private field - prints 0 Console . WriteLine(exposedList._size ) ; // Modify a private field exposedList._items = new int [ ] { 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 } ; // Modify another private field exposedList._size = 5 ; // Call a private method exposedList. EnsureCapacity ( 20 ) ;
Of course , _size , _items and EnsureCapacity ( ) are all private members of the List < T > class !
In addition to the private members , you can still access the public members of the exposed list :
// Add a value to the list exposedList .
Add(0 ) ; // Enumerate the list .
Prints " 5 4 3 2 1 0 " foreach ( var x in exposedList ) Console . WriteLine(x ) ;
Pretty cool , is n’t it ?
How does ExposedObject work ?
The example I showed uses ExposedObject to access private fields and methods of the List < T > class .
ExposedObject is a type I implemented using the dynamic typing feature in C# 4 .
To create a dynamically - typed object in C# , you need to implement a class derived from DynamicObject .
The derived class will implement a couple of methods whose role is to decide what to do whenever a method gets called or a property gets accessed on your dynamic object .
Here is a dynamic type that will print the name of any method you call on it :
class PrintingObject : DynamicObject { public override bool TryInvokeMember ( InvokeMemberBinder binder , object [ ] args , out object result ) { Console . WriteLine ( binder . Name ) ; //
Print the name of the called method result = null ; return true ; } }
Let ’s test it out .
This program prints “ HelloWorld ” to the console :
class Program { static void Main ( string [ ] args ) { dynamic printing = new PrintingObject ( ) ; printing .
HelloWorld ( ) ; return ; } }
There is only a small step from PrintingObject to ExposedObject – instead of printing the name of the method , ExposedObject will find the appropriate method and invoke it via reflection .
A simple version of the code looks like this :
class ExposedObjectSimple : DynamicObject { private object m_object ; public ExposedObjectSimple ( object obj ) { m_object = obj ; } public override bool TryInvokeMember ( InvokeMemberBinder binder , object [ ] args , out object result ) { //
Find the called method using reflection var methodInfo = m_object .
GetType ( ) .
GetMethod ( binder .
Name , BindingFlags .
NonPublic | BindingFlags .
Public | BindingFlags .
Instance ) ; // Call the method result = methodInfo .
Invoke ( m_object , args ) ; return true ; } }
This is all you need in order to implement a simple version of ExposedObject .
What else can you do with ExposedObject ?
The ExposedObjectSimple implementation above illustrates the concept , but it is a bit naive – it does not handle field accesses , multiple methods with the same name but different argument lists , generic methods , static methods , and so on .
I implemented a more complete version of the idea and published it as a CodePlex project : http://exposedobject.codeplex.com/
You can call static methods by creating an ExposedClass over the class .
For example , let ’s call the private File.
InternalExists ( ) static method :
dynamic fileType = ExposedClass . From ( typeof ( System . IO. File ) ) ; bool exists = fileType.InternalExists ( " somefile.txt " ) ;
You can call generic methods ( static or non-static ) too :
dynamic enumerableType = ExposedClass . From ( typeof ( System .
Linq . Enumerable ) ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( enumerableType.Max < int >( new [ ] { 1 , 3 , 5 , 3 , 1 } ) ) ;
Type inference for generics works too .
You do n’t have to specify the int generic argument in the Max method call :
dynamic enumerableType = ExposedClass . From ( typeof ( System .
Linq . Enumerable ) ) ; Console .
WriteLine ( enumerableType.Max ( new [ ] { 1 , 3 , 5 , 3 , 1 } ) ) ;
And to clarify , all of these different cases have to be explicitly handled .
Deciding which method should be called is normally done by the compiler .
The logic on overload resolution is hidden away in the compiler , and so unavailable at runtime .
To duplicate the method binding rules , we have to duplicate the logic of the compiler .
You can also cast a dynamic object either to its own type , or to a base class :
List < int > realList = new List < int >( ) ; dynamic exposedList = ExposedObject . From( realList ) ; List < int > realList2 = exposedList ; Console . WriteLine( realList == realList2 ) ; // Prints " true "
So , after casting the exposed object ( or assigning it into an appropriately typed variable ) , you can get back the original object !
Updates
Based on some of the responses the article is getting , I should clarify : I am definitely not suggesting that you use ExposedObject regularly in your production code !
That would be a terrible idea .
As I said in the article , ExposedObject can be useful for testing , experimentation , and rare hacks .
Also , it is an interesting example of how dynamic typing works in C# .
Also , apparently Mauricio Scheffer came up with the same idea almost a year before me .
The recent war between Apple and Adobe and the justifications made in Apple ’s defense ( ignore the predatory behavior in the tech space because it is too big a market to ignore ) bring to mind the attitude that most large American corporations have regarding China ( ignore the civil rights abuses because it is too big a market to ignore ) .
The closed environment
For years now , I have worried about Apple ’s tendency to prefer closed environments to open ones when it came first to its iPod line of products , then its iPhone line , and now it ’s iPad one .
Each of the product are terrific consumption tools but that ’s where they stop and my worry stems from the trend they create , one where Apple is creating an increasingly closed environment , more in line with the type of thinking that permeates the consumer electronics , movie , and telephone industry than the one that exists in the computer world .
It seems that whenever Apple enters a new industry , it may have a small impact on that industry but the industry itself has a big impact on Apple .
Of course , one could see this as a natural evolution as the counter - culture 1970s Steve Jobs was booted out of Apple and , after a long exile , came back as Steve Jobs , founder of Pixar and eventually morphed into Steve Jobs , largest Disney shareholder .
The net result is that the Apple leader has now learned to turn his company into the new Disney , bringing safe products to the masses in a highly sterilized environment that may not appeal to all .
And a Disneyworld version of computing is OK for most people .
Most people love the magic kingdom but , for a portion of the population , Disneyworld is a place you visit , not one you live in .
And that ’s where conflict arises .
For people who have lived in the mostly free - for - all environment of the computing industry ( and its cousin , the anything - goes world of the Internet ) , the idea of a Disneyified world is as close as you will get to their concept of hell .
And those people tend to be the ones that develop applications .
Two Impulses
So developers now find themselves conflicted between two impulses :
On one hand , Apple is created this Disney - like environment that increases the level of control Apple asserts in many spaces including the music , video , and mobile space .
On the other hand , this type of environment attracts large crowds who really enjoy the safer experience .
As an added bonus , the space actually looks very clean and the interface components are very slick .
The market size issue is one that larger technology companies are starting to grapple with in another arena : China .
For example , Google has been trying to figure out the right balance between insisting that China stop censoring internet content and protecting its chances at getting into that market .
Many of Google ’s competitors , in the meantime , stood on the sideline , arguing that China is too large a market to ignore and that corporations should not get involved into politics , a position that is often at odds with their own actions in the US .
But back to Apple .
Apple vs. Adobe
For those who have not been following what ’s happening between Apple and Adobe , here ’s what ’s happening .
Adobe owns
Flash , a product that allows for video or more interactive type of content on the web .
Thanks to the Flash technology , distributing video on the internet became a reality because the Flash player ran on most browsers and , thanks to strong marketing by Macromedia ( the company that was managing Flash at the time and was acquired by Adobe ) , the Flash player became ubiquitous on computers .
When Apple first released the iPhone , it presented it as a different type of phone because it offered a browser that gave its users access to “ the full Internet , ” a statement that highlighted how poorly other mobile phones rendered web pages .
This was a major advance but there were a couple of things that were not included : in order to ensure that the browser ran quickly and reliably on the lower - CPU phones , Apple made a technical decision to remove Java and plugin support from its browser .
For the most part , that was OK but many people started complaining that Flash was not included because a large amount of internet video was delivered using the flash player .
Apple said , at the time , that its partnership with YouTube should offer with enough video content and that the other groups were pretty much fringe .
Over the years , the discussion continued in tech circles and Adobe , now owners of Flash , decided to reposition it as a tool that would allow for creating interactive content that could run on any platform .
It was widely known in development circles that Adobe was working on a version of Flash that would help developers create iPhone applications with the Flash development tools .
So Apple upped the stakes by banning its development community from leveraging such tools .
Because of the tight control Apple has over what gets on the iPhone and iPad , it essentially killed any chances of using Flash to create programs for those platforms .
As one would expect , Adobe was very unhappy .
They had made the ability to create iPhone applications with Flash a key feature of their new offering .
So they huffed and puffed enough to get the tech community fired up .
The controversy has now gotten so strong that it got a response from Steve Jobs himself , which resulted in Adobe abandoning their strategy of distribution on Apple devices .
Apple : Standard bearer for openness ?
Jobs ’ note is interesting in many aspects .
On the one hand , he does seem to address many of the issues that have been raised and explain why Apple ’s position is the friendly one .
On the other , people with enough knowledge of the underlying technologies can see some cracks in the arguments made :
First , there ’s “ Open ”
That Apple would lead with the concept of openness is ironic at its best and deceiving at its worst .
While it ’s true that Adobe Flash is not open , Apple ’s selective list of standards it is supporting reveals some of the politics surrounding web standards .
Yes , HTML5 is completely open but the issue of video in HTML5 is a small developer skirmish in which Apple is backing a horse that is not necessarily the most open one .
H.264
It ’s interesting that , in the paragraph about openness , Steve Jobs mentions HTML5 , CSS , and JavaScript but leaves the issue of video codec for later in his note .
That comes in the discussion of “ the full web ” where he mentions support for H.264 .
That name represents a standard that is not an open one .
In fact , it ’s one that needs to be licensed in order to be used and , while many people use it ( as Apple ’s note demonstrate ) , it ’s one that could generate royalties for many companies when the agreement to make this standard royalties - free for internet video ends in 2015 .
And one of the companies that would get some of those royalties is ….
( if you have n’t guessed , you must have skimmed throught the rest of the article )
surprise , it ’s Apple Inc. , a company that happens to own some proprietary intellectual property that is included in this standard .
And , surprisingly , the best tool for authoring content for the H.264 standard is Quicktime , a piece of software that is distributed by …
Apple .
I ’m not going to deny that the rest of the arguments ( around security , performance , and battery life ) may hold value .
I ’m also not going to claim that Jobs is wrong in saying that the “ Touch ” experience is not fundamentally different from the experience that Flash was initially created for .
But I am going to go out on a limb and say that this whole fight between Apple and Adobe comes down to a single thread :
Who will control video on the web .
Jobs is probably not thrilled that Flash has usurped Quicktime as the main contender on the web and is working on changing that .
Reasserting closed systems
While the war between Adobe and Apple is an amusing soap opera , the last reason Jobs gives for not supporting Flash ought to be the most chilling to the development community .
I could paraphrase but I would n’t do it justice so here ’s what he said ( emphasis is mine ) :
We know from painful experience that letting a third party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in sub-standard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform .
If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools , they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features .
We can not be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers . …
Our motivation is simple – we want to provide the most advanced and innovative platform to our developers , and we want them to stand directly on the shoulders of this platform and create the best apps the world has ever seen .
We want to continually enhance the platform so developers can create even more amazing , powerful , fun and useful applications .
At first read , an innocuous set of statements but one that has potential implications for the future of computing .
If the thinking in Cupertino is that third party development tools are bad , then what about the Mac and non-Apple development tools on OSX ?
Where would those stand .
And , while the introduction of new features are great , what happens if Apple decides to remove old ones ?
That is question left unanswered by this note and one that may leave the door open for more concerns .

( Health.com ) --
There 's a species of smoker among us that is common , yet poorly understood .
Their habitat consists of parties , barbecues , and the sidewalks outside bars and restaurants .
They prefer to scrounge for their cigarettes , and if they do buy a pack , they 're apt to nurse it for a week or more .
You may hear them say , " I 'm not a smoker , " or " only on weekends . "
These are " social smokers " -- and there are more of them than you might think .
Smoking is often characterized as an all - or - nothing activity -- on doctor 's office questionnaires it 's usually a yes - or - no question , for instance -- but by some estimates , anywhere from one - fifth to one - third of adults who smoke do n't light up every day .
While some of these so - called nondaily smokers smoke regularly but sparingly , up to 30 percent likely fall into the social - smoker category .
CDC urges 50 - state anti-smoking push
Hard numbers are difficult to come by , in part because the definition of a social smoker is so vague .
A 2007 study of social smoking among college students -- one of very few that have been published on the subject -- found the term was used " loosely and inconsistently , " even among researchers .
But most people know a social smoker when they see one .
They smoke occasionally , almost always in groups , and more often than not while drinking alcohol .
By definition , they do not consider themselves addicted to nicotine .
Many started smoking casually in high school or college but never graduated to a daily habit .
" If I 'm out drinking , or hanging out with people who are smoking , then I usually get the urge to smoke , " says Vickie , 45 , from New York .
" But I might smoke Friday , Saturday , Sunday , and then not smoke for a week . "
Vickie 's friend Katherine , 46 , has smoked intermittently since her college days , but she limits it to specific times and places .
" I do n't think I 've ever had a cigarette before 7 p.m. , " she says .
" I have smoked alone , but very , very rarely , and I do n't think I 've bought a pack in 20 years .
I know that I could put it down at any time . "
Nicotine vaccine shows promise in early tests
Though she sometimes goes for months without smoking , she may smoke a whole pack in a weekend if some old friends are in town or if she 's on vacation .
" Smoking is a small indulgence that I sometimes do , " says Katherine , " sort of like eating too much ice cream . "
Social smoking is often compared with social drinking -- that is , the social smoker is to the " real " smoker what the casual weekend drinker is to the alcoholic .
Even if social smokers ( or drinkers ) go a little overboard sometimes , their behavior is still fundamentally different .
Social drinking is an " important analogy , " says Saul Shiffman , PhD , a professor of psychology at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in studying occasional smokers .
One of the " hallmarks " of social drinkers ( the vast majority of those who drink alcohol ) , says Shiffman , is that they drink in specific settings .
" They 'll drink at dinner with friends , they 'll drink in the evenings on weekends -- but they do n't drink in the car , or first thing in the morning , " he explains .
" It 's the confinement of use to particular situations that marks someone who uses a drug but not in an addictive way . "
Social smoking is a trend
While the overall number of smokers in the United States is dropping , the proportion of occasional smokers appears to be on the rise .
Government surveys show that the number of nondaily smokers rose 40 percent between 1998 and 2001 , according to Shiffman .
News reports and studies have also provided anecdotal evidence that social smoking is increasing , especially among young people .
Health.com : Social , sneaky or skinny ?
The 7 types of smokers
The reasons for this apparent trend have n't been fully explained .
Some suggest that the growing awareness of health risks , the stigma surrounding smoking ( which may explain why the smokers interviewed for this article did n't want their full names used ) , and smoking bans in public places are causing heavy smokers to cut back .
Vickie , for instance , would n't be caught dead smoking around her two young children , and the restrictions against smoking at work or inside bars and restaurants are often enough to extinguish her urges , she says -- especially in the wintertime .
Another popular theory is that social smokers , unlike social drinkers , do n't really exist .
Social smokers , the thinking goes , are low - level addicts either in denial or on the brink of addiction .
It 's a bit like the old saying about there being two types of motorcyclists : those who have had accidents and those who are going to .
And research indicates that there may be something to this :
In the recent study of college students , 60 percent of the students surveyed who denied that they were smokers did identify themselves as social smokers ; roughly 10 percent of these alleged nonsmokers in fact smoked at least every other day .
The denial theory may be a bit simplistic , however .
We 're accustomed to thinking of everyone who smokes as an addict -- nicotine is known to be one of the most addictive drugs , after all -- but according to the most recent National Survey on Drug Use and Health , of the 40.9 million adults over the age of 18 who had smoked a cigarette in the previous month , only about 60 percent could be considered dependent on nicotine .
Health.com : Crazy ways smokers finally kicked the habit
The remaining 40 percent includes social smokers , as well as a group known as " chippers , " a term originally used to describe intermittent , nonaddicted users of heroin .
These smokers , who remain something of a medical mystery , have smoked up to a pack a week for years , or even decades , without becoming dependent on nicotine .
When they stop smoking for a day or two , they suffer none of the cravings , irritability , and other withdrawal symptoms that torment addicted smokers .
It 's unclear why this is ; it may be that the way their brains are hardwired leaves them less susceptible to addiction .
Not all social smokers are chippers , but there is certainly some overlap between the groups .
Katherine has noticed that she has always had a different relationship with cigarettes than some of her friends who smoke more heavily .
" Even when I 've had 10 cigarettes in a night , I do n't think I 've ever thought , ' I better not do this because I 'll get addicted , ' which drives real smokers crazy , " she says .
" Even when I first tried cigarettes , in high school , I could see that for my best friend smoking was a different thing than it was for me .
Her smoking kept increasing , and I just was never like that . "
Addicted to smoking , not nicotine ?
Social smokers may not be addicted to nicotine , but that does n't necessarily mean that they 're not hooked on smoking -- whether it 's the ritual itself , the sensation of the smoke , or the nicotine high it provides .
" These folks take nicotine for its psychoactive effects , not to stave off withdrawal , " says Shiffman .
" But that 's not to say that they do n't come to need it in some other way . "
Lacey , 23 , a recent college grad in Athens , Georgia , was a " real " smoker for four years ; she traded daily smoking for social smoking when she was 20 .
She did n't have any trouble scaling back -- she smoked more out of boredom and habit than nicotine addiction , she says -- but she has found her social smoking at bars surprisingly hard to kick .
" It 's been difficult , " she says .
" It 's a really big habit , but I do think the nicotine has something to do with it .
When you 're drinking , smoking a cigarette is one of the best feelings in the world . "

Even after all that has been said and written , people are still searching for a narrative to explain how a relatively small number of homebuyers failing to make mortgage payments led to such a deep recession .
The 22 - page Securities and Exchange Commission complaint against Goldman Sachs & Co. provides an outline of such a narrative .

Many readers of my blogs and the gotovertime website know that a major tool that employees have in getting employers to comply with the law is that the employee can frequently recover attorneys fees if they prevail .
Frequently , defense attorneys discount this by stating that judges " never " award attorneys fees in excess of the amounts that are recovered .
However , a recent case illustrates that this is simply not the case .
In Harman v. City and County of San Francisco , 158 Cal. App. 4th 407 , the Plaintiff was awarded $ 30,300 in damages for racial discrimination .
The appellate court then upheld an award of $ 1,113,905 in attorneys fees .
In particular the Court held that " [t ] he law does not mandate , however , that attorney fees bear a percentage relationship to the ultimate recovery of damages in a civil rights case . "
This is an extremely useful case because frequently , defendants can make mountains out of mole hills .
If plaintiffs were limited to recovering only a percentage of the amount recovered , it would eliminate effective representation for any claims less than a couple hundred thousand dollars .
Many employment cases simply will not amount to over $ 100,000 , so plaintiffs ' attorneys are reluctant to take them .
Hopefully , this case will set a good precedent that plainitffs are entitled to their full attorney fees , even if the actual value of the case is small .
I will point out that to many individual plaintiffs , such as many of the ones I represent , $ 30,000 is no small amount .
Without the proper award of attorneys fees , many of these people would not be able to receive adequate legal representation .
It is also interesting to note that the attorneys fees in the Harman case were paid largely to a conservative legal foundation , The Pacific Legal Foundation .
The Pacific Legal Foundation lists its goals as representing individuals who have " grown weary of overregulation by big government , overindulgence by the courts , and excessive interference in the American way of life . "
( See http://www.pacificlegal.org/?mvcTask=about).
Hopefully , they will put the $ 744,756.75 that they were awarded to use in insuring that the courts are open to all employees who rights have been violated .
( CNN ) --
The health care reform legislation that President Obama signed recently is n't only about insurance coverage -- there 's also a renewal of $ 50 million per year for five years for abstinence - focused education .
Programs that receive this funding must " teach that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out - of - wedlock pregnancy , sexually transmitted diseases , and other associated health problems , " according to the Department of Health and Human Services .
To qualify , they must also teach that sex before marriage is " likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects . "
These are part of the " A - H definition , " requirements for programs to receive abstinence funding under Title V of the Social Security Act .
" Title V is trying to make sure that kids are being given a message that saving sex and childbearing for marriage is the safest , healthiest , best choice , " said Scott Phelps , executive director of Abstinence & Marriage Education Partnership .
Public schools hire educators from this organization to teach abstinence , and may use Title V funding for it , he said .
In Phelps ' experience -- he started his abstinence education work in Chicago , Illinois , 10 years ago -- the abstinence message is embraced by kids , even some who have already become sexually active .
" They did n't realize they could stop , " he said .
Organizations promoting evidence - based sex education say it 's troubling that this $ 250 million will go to state programs that have not been shown to work .
" Just the fact that we continue to pour money into programs that have no evidence of effectiveness at all just does n't seem to us to be good evidence - based health policy , " said Heather Boonstra , senior public policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute , a nonprofit reproductive and sexual health research firm .
There have been numerous studies suggesting that it's not so easy for people to practice abstinence consistently .
A congressionally mandated study in 2007 found that none of four abstinence programs showed a significant positive effect on sexual behavior among youth .
A January 2009 study in Pediatrics found that religious teens who take virginity pledges are less likely to use condoms or birth control when they become sexually active , and just as likely to have sex before marriage as their peers who did n't take pledges .
Medical professional organizations also criticize abstinence education on ethical grounds , for leaving out potentially lifesaving information .
Abstinence - only programs " are inherently coercive by withholding information needed to make informed choices , " the American Public Health Association said in a statement .
Phelps ' program does n't teach that sex before marriage is wrong , but that waiting will enable teens to eliminate the risks of sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy .
Students are taught that contraception , a " limited part of our conversation , " reduces risk , but does not avoid it altogether , he said .
The law sets up a separate funding stream of $ 75 million for " personal responsibility education , " which includes teaching about both abstinence and contraception .
It sets aside an additional $ 25 million for untested but innovative programs .
Having separate funding for abstinence - focused and comprehensive programs " is a method that provides real choice for states and for communities , and we would like to see that model used across the board , " said Valerie Huber , executive director of the National Abstinence Education Association .
But Huber 's group is not happy that abstinence - focused programs get less funding per year than the other approaches .
" We would like to see equitable funding , " she said .
Abstinence programs have received federal funding through a program that grew out of welfare reform during the Clinton administration .
The $ 50 million per year began in 1998 and expired in 2009 , with restoration in the recent health care legislation from this year until 2014 .
States have the option of tapping into the $ 50 million or not , but those who want it have to contribute also , Boonstra noted .
For every $ 4 of federal money , states have to put up $ 3 of their own money , according to the Department of Health and Human Services .
As of June 2009 , 22 states , plus Washington D.C. , had declined to apply for funds under the program , according to the Guttmacher Institute .
A study published in February in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine found that an abstinence - based program was more effective than other initiatives at keeping sixth - and seventh - graders from having sex within a two - year period .
Rather than asking students to delay intercourse until marriage , however , the program told students to wait until they were ready .
It also did not portray sex in a negative light .
For these reasons , it is unclear whether that program would qualify for funding from the $ 50 million allocated in the health care bill , because it does not fit the A - H definition , said Bill Albert of the nonpartisan National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy .
Boonstra agreed that it would likely not fit this category , as it differs from the programs that have received funding in the past .
Huber said she thought it would qualify , although she has not seen the curriculum .
It 's better to invest taxpayer dollars into what works , Albert said .
Public opinion surveys reveal that Americans view abstinence and contraceptive education as complementary , not contradictory .
" There is great and very wide support among parents and among teens themselves that young people should be encouraged to delay sexual activity , " Albert said .
" But it is also clear that the American public wants young people to receive information about contraception . "
Social news website Digg is getting rid of the controversial DiggBar as soon as the upcoming version of Digg exits beta , acting CEO Kevin Rose announced in a blog post today .
All previously banned domains will also be unbanned when the new Digg launches , Rose said .
DiggBar is an iFrame toolbar that sits on top of a web page ( see below ) .
It allows users to digg and bury pages , view comments and page views , and discover other stories without having to return to Digg 's website .
Additionally , users can create shortened Digg URLs to share on other social sites by typing digg.com / before the URL of any given page .
Although it seems like a useful tool , DiggBar 's release was controversial , primarily because its URL shortener was accused of hurting website 's search rankings .
Many sites and users blocked the DiggBar as a consequence .
Digg defended the toolbar , assuring publishers and users that it did not negatively impact SEO .
Digg caved to some requests , however , removing the toolbar for users who are not logged into Digg and allowing logged in users to opt out of the feature .
Today , Rose acknowledged that the DiggBar is " bad for the Internet " and added that " it causes confusion when bookmarking , breaks w/ iFrame busters , and has no ability to communicate with the lower frame ( if you browse away from a story , the old digg count still persists ) .
It ’s an inconsistent / wonky user experience , and I ’m happy to say we are killing it when we launch the new Digg . "
It 's a major concession given Digg 's defense of the toolbar a year ago .
The decision follows yesterday 's surprise announcement that Jay Adelson is out as CEO at the social news site , which came as a surprise given that Digg has recently ramped up hiring and is about to release a complete overhaul of its site .
It 's uncertain how much of today 's promised changes have to do with Adelson 's departure .
What do you think of Digg 's decision to remove the DiggBar ?
Will you miss it ?

There was a sports agate page announcement back in February that somehow slipped by our Google alert on all things Margo McAuley .
You might remember Ms. McAuley as the Florida State soccer player who became an Internet sensation after we published sexy photos and named the Indiana nativeÂ “ Hottest College Student - Athlete ” a year ago this month .
Something seemed to go wrong at FSU and in February it was announced that Margo was taking her game to Indiana .
While that is great news to the men of Bloomington , even better news is that the junior defender is also still taking bikini photos to keep her fans happy .
Our tipster forgot to mention the IU news but did fill the BC inbox with these new shots that we assume were taken before heading north to the shitty Midwestern weather .
We pray that the change of locales does n’t mean the bikinis go into hibernation .
We also pray that the Indiana coaching staff does n’t kibosh her fun ways .
BC rarely comes across such a talent from the world of soccer .
And just think , two more years of eligibility for Ms. McAuley .
Know of a hot ( female ) collegiate soccer player that needs to be commended for her beauty ?

From a University of Arizona press release ,
Giant Sequoias Yield Longest Fire History from Tree Rings
California ’s western Sierra Nevada had more frequent fires between 800 and 1300 than at any time in the past 3,000 years , according to a new study led by Thomas W. Swetnam , director of UA ’s Laboratory of Tree - Ring Research .
By Mari N. Jensen , UA College of Science March 17 , 2010
A 3,000 - year record from 52 of the world ’s oldest trees shows that California ’s western Sierra Nevada was droughty and often fiery from 800 to 1300 , according to a new study led by University of Arizona researchers .
Scientists reconstructed the 3,000 - year history of fire by dating fire scars on ancient giant sequoia trees , Sequoiadendron giganteum , in the Giant Forest of Sequoia National Park .
Individual giant sequoias can live more than 3,000 years .
“ It ’s the longest tree - ring fire history in the world , and it ’s from this amazing place with these amazing trees . ” said lead author Thomas W. Swetnam of the UA .
“ This is an epic collection of tree rings . ”
The new research extends Swetnam ’s previous tree - ring fire history for giant sequoias another 1,000 years into the past .
In addition , he and his colleagues used tree - ring records from other species of trees to reconstruct the region ’s past climate .
The scientists found the years from 800 to 1300 , known as the Medieval Warm Period , had the most frequent fires in the 3,000 years studied .
Other research has found that the period from 800 to 1300 was warm and dry .
“ What ’s not so well known about the Medieval Warm Period is how warm it was in the western U.S. , ” Swetnam said .
“ This is one line of evidence that it was very fiery on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada – and there ’s a very strong relationship between drought and fire . ”
Droughts are typically both warm and dry , he added .
Knowing how giant sequoia trees responded to a 500 - year warm spell in the past is important because scientists predict that climate change will probably subject the trees to such a warm , dry environment again , said Swetnam , a UA professor of dendrochronology and director of UA ’s Laboratory of Tree - Ring Research .
During the Medieval Warm Period extensive fires burned through parts of the Giant Forest at intervals of about 3 to 10 years , he said .
Any individual tree was probably in a fire about every 10 to 15 years .
The team also compared charcoal deposits in boggy meadows within the groves to the tree -ring fire history .
The chronology of charcoal deposits closely matches the tree -ring chronology of fire scars .
The health of the giant sequoia forests seems to require those frequent , low - intensity fires , Swetnam said .
He added that as the climate warms , carefully reintroducing low - intensity fires at frequencies similar to those of the Medieval Warm Period may be crucial for the survival of those magnificent forests , such as those in Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks .
Since 1860 , human activity has greatly reduced the extent of fires .
He and his colleagues commend the National Park Service for its recent work reintroducing fire into the giant sequoia groves .
The team ’s report , “ Multi-Millennial Fire History of the Giant Forest , Sequoia National Park , California , USA , ” was published in the electronic journal Fire Ecology in February .
A complete list of authors and funding sources is at the bottom of this story .
To study tree rings , researchers generally take a pencil - sized core from a tree .
The oldest rings are those closest to the center of the tree .
However , ancient giant sequoias can have trunks that are 30 feet in diameter – far too big to be sampled using even the longest coring tools , which are only three feet long .
To gather samples from the Giant Forest trees , the researchers were allowed to collect cross-sections of downed logs and standing dead trees , he said .
It turned out to be a gargantuan undertaking that required many people and many field seasons .
“ We were sampling with the largest chain saws we could find – a chain - saw bar of seven feet , ” he said .
“ We were hauling these slabs of wood two meters on a side as far as two kilometers to the road .
We were using wheeled litters – the emergency rescue equipment for people – and put a couple hundred pounds on them . ”
To develop a separate chronology for past fires , co-authors R. Scott Anderson and Douglas J. Hallett looked for charcoal in sediment cores taken from meadows within the sequoia groves .
“ We can compare the charcoal and tree - ring fire records .
It confirms that the charcoal is a good indicator of past fires , ” Swetnam said .
Such charcoal - based fire histories can extend much further into the past than most tree - ring - based fire histories , he said .
The charcoal history of fire in the giant sequoia groves extends back more than 8,000 years .
Increasingly , researchers all over the world are using charcoal to reconstruct fire histories , Swetnam said .
Many scientists are analyzing the global record of charcoal to study relationships between climate , fire and the resulting addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere .
Swetnam ’s co-authors are Christopher H. Baisan and Ramzi Touchan of the University of Arizona ; Anthony C. Caprio of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks in Three Rivers , Calif . ; Peter M. Brown of the Rocky Mountain Tree - Ring Research and Colorado State University in Fort Collins ; R. Scott Anderson of Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff ; and Douglas J. Hallett of the University of Calgary in Alberta , Canada .
The National Park Service , the U.S. Geological Survey , Mountain Home Demonstration State Forest and Calaveras Big Trees State Park provided funding .

Editor 's note : Professional photographer and naturalist James Balog is director of the Extreme Ice Survey and the first recipient of the International League of Conservation Photographers Award .
He is the author of " Extreme Ice Now : Vanishing Glaciers and Changing Climate : A Progress Report , " some of which is excerpted for this commentary .
( CNN ) --
In graduate school and as a mountaineer and nature photographer , I 've visited many of the world 's great mountain ranges and seen hundreds of glaciers .
In spite of this , I did n't understand how fast truly enormous quantities of ice could disappear until 2005 when I went to Iceland and shot a story for The New Yorker magazine .
This led to a 2006 National Geographic magazine assignment to document changing glaciers in various parts of the Northern Hemisphere and South America .
By the time this cover story was done , the Extreme Ice Survey was born .
EIS merges art and science to give visual voice to the planet 's changing ecosystems .
Through time - lapse imagery and other innovative methods , EIS documents and communicates environmental impacts from global warming and other human - made causes while inspiring action among citizens and policymakers .
Time - lapse photography captures the speed at which glaciers are retreating in places such as Greenland , Iceland , Alaska , the Alps and the Rocky Mountains .
Watch video and see EIS project here .
EIS is a collaboration between image - makers and leading environmental scientists , all of us devoted to documenting the changes transforming Arctic and alpine landscapes today .
We do this because shrinking glaciers are the canary in the global coal mine , the most visible , tangible manifestations of climate change on the planet .
The survey is extreme in every way -- distances , costs , logistics , field conditions .
Truth be told , there are times when I wonder why I 'm putting myself through this ordeal .
But other voices , asking different questions , ultimately provide the answers .
I picture myself 30 years from now .
I hear my daughters Simone and Emily saying with a certain amount of anger and exasperation : " Dad , with what everyone knew back in 2009 , how could people not have realized the climate was changing ? "
And then they ask the personal zinger : " What were you doing about it ? "
Hindsight can be merciless .
People of any given era often look back in time and wonder how their predecessors could have been so dimwitted .
How could the British navy have taken hundreds of years to make limes and other antiscorbutics a standard part of sailors ' diets ?
The cure for scurvy was known to European navigators as early as the 1500s .
During three epic voyages of the 1770s , Capt .
James
Cook forced his crews to eat sauerkraut , which was later shown to be rich in vitamin C .
He lost not a single man to the disease .
Yet the British admiralty waited until 1867 before mandating that its sailors eat limes to stay healthy .
When the future looks back at the late 20th and early 21st centuries , people will be as astounded at our mule - headedness about dealing with climate change , as we now are at the foibles of earlier societies .
Unfortunately , the astonishing pace of climatic events , as witnessed in the ice , does n't give us the luxury of time to be slow learners .
We cannot afford to be hamstrung by ponderous social institutions or deluded by false information .
We must make a major effort to stop climate change right now , and not think we can absolve ourselves of responsibility by educating our children to do things differently .
A generation from now will be too late .
The voices of the future -- our grown - up children -- will damn us if we are passive and indifferent .
As I head to Copenhagen , Denmark , for the United Nations Climate Change Conference , I hope to bring the extraordinary evidence of melting glaciers that my colleagues and I at the Extreme Ice Survey have worked so hard to collect to both the climate - change believers and the skeptics .
I hope to attract even more widespread attention to this critical issue , because if we rise to the occasion demanded by a changing climate , we will be heroes .
Descend into collective complacency and dysfunctional denial , and we will someday be judged to have been fools .
Sir Edmund Hillary once said about great deeds , " People do not decide to become extraordinary .
They do extraordinary things . "
The quality of our society and our lives will be judged by the deeds we do or do n't do .
Once upon a time , I was a climate - change skeptic .
I 'm not one anymore .
The evidence is in the ice .

Tools for foiling malicious links and files : Rex Swain 's HTTP Viewer reveals browser activity .
A special " thank you " from Yves Latour , co-founder of the search engine for brochures & catalogs :
Who-sells -it.com
10 - Jul - 2008
Who - sells - it.com is a search engine for brochures and catalogs .
Everyone owning some sort of product catalog using the popular PDF format can have it added for free .
There are no catchy terms attached , but the catalog file should be online already and allow an easy spidering and fetching .
The robots . txt file is supported .
Sometimes our catalog spider cannot fetch a catalog as supposed or we have a problem with one of our own web documents .
Usually , the first move is getting over to Rex Swain 's HTTP Viewer , slapping the URL into the input box to check the document header .
In most cases this gives us the information we need to know to be able to understand the problem .
We appreciate the existence of such free tools .
Thank you , Rex , for saving us time !
From Fred Langa 's " LangaList " Newsletter 17 - Feb -2000 LangaList reader Rex Swain is a consultant and needed a way to see easily what was going on behind the scenes of various web sites when he clicked in .
So , he wrote an " HTTP Viewer " that anyone can use ( for free ! ) .
It intercepts and displays * everything * that transpires between a browser and any given web page , showing you stuff your browser normally hides .
For example , when you connect to Amazon .
Com , you 'll normally see your browser churn for a few seconds ( showing a blank page ) and then the Amazon home page comes up .
But Rex 's tool lets you see that you 're actually viewing three pages in rapid succession :
An initial page quickly redirects you to a second page that sets a cookie ; and then that page dumps you to a third page where another cookie is set .
Your browser only shows you the third page , but Rex 's spy tool lets you see everything -- and I mean everything -- that 's going on , including the cookie contents and the URLs of the hidden pages .
