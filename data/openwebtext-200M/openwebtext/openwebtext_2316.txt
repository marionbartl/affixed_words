Fingerprint tests show that human remains found in a gravel pit east of Fairbanks on Wednesday are those of Joe Vogler , the founder of the Alaskan Independence Party , who vanished in May 1993 , Alaska state troopers said today .
The discovery of the remains , following an anonymous tip to the authorities , apparently resolves a year - and - a - half - old mystery concerning Mr. Vogler , a folk hero throughout the state who was 80 when he disappeared from his home here .
The blue tarp and duct tape in which the remains were wrapped , officials said , matched a description given by a convicted thief , Manfred West , who confessed last summer that he had killed Mr. Vogler in a plastic - explosives sale gone bad and had then buried him .
Batman is not charming .
He is n’t popular , partly because he ’s a zealot and partly because he does n’t bother to explain himself to the press .
He is independently wealthy , having spent years as the head of an industrial company .
His methods are disturbing , his operations bathed in darkness .
He is misunderstood , mistrusted , endlessly pursued by the attack dogs of the night .
He is not a hero .
And he lives in an undisclosed location .
Is n’t it obvious ?
Batman is Dick Cheney with hair .
“ The Dark Knight ” and “ Batman Begins ” do n’t ignore the dilemmas of realpolitik but plunge you into them .
Unlike the “ Spider - Man ” or “ Superman ” movies or the Keaton / Kilmer / Clooney series of increasingly fey Batman extravaganzas , the two superb Christopher Nolan films stand up as drama for adults , not fantasy for middle schoolers .
The real - world parallels are everywhere .
Start with the Joker , a man who is not interested in amassing a fortune or any other goal .
The Joker takes hostages , blows up a hospital and scares civilians to turn them against Batman .
He sends regular dispatches on his activities to TV news , which immensely aids his cause even as it criticizes Batman .
“ Look what I did to this city with a few drums of gas and a couple of bullets , ” the Joker says , bragging about the relative ease of being a terrorist in an open society in which anyone can walk into a hospital or drive a truck through a tunnel .
The Joker shares al Qaeda ’s taste in weaponry , activating an IED with a cell phone to blow up a police station and favoring blades over firearms .
“ Do you wanna know why I use a knife ? ” he says .
“ Guns are too quick .
You ca n’t savor all the little emotions . ”
The calm , technocratic Lucius Fox ( Morgan Freeman ) is to Batman what Colin Powell was to Dick Cheney – old colleagues with the same goals but major points of disagreement .
Fox is cautious , unexcitable , reluctant to break any rules .
“ This is wrong , ” he tells Batman .
“ Spying on 30 million people is n’t part of my job description . ”
At issue is Batman ’s plan to track criminals by monitoring the signals from everyone ’s cell phone , without their knowledge or permission from any authority .
But the city is about to explode , and Batman has no time for red tape .
So Fox , denouncing the surveillance as “ unethical ” and “ dangerous , ” threatens to resign .
Alfred ( Michael Caine ) is a bit like Batman ’s Rumsfeld .
Like Alfred , Rumsfeld showed the younger man the ropes ( Cheney ’s first big job was as assistant to Rumsfeld in the Nixon administration ) then became his fiercely loyal employee ( or yes man , depending on your point of view ) .
Alfred tells a story about how he once hunted a bandit in the wilds of Burma .
To catch him , Alfred says , “ We burned the forest down . ”
Alfred ’s role is to punch through his boss ’s reluctance and encourage him to be extreme , even as citizens at a press conference wail , “ Things are worse than ever . ”
They are singing from the Joker ’s hymn to chaos .
“ They ’ll cast you out like a leper , ” he warns Batman .
Batman , the public thinks , should turn himself in .
A harsh stance toward terrorists merely antagonizes them , enhances their recruiting and brings us down to their moral level , does n’t it ?
When Batman doubts himself , Alfred encourages him : “ Endure , Master , endure .
Take it .
They ’ll hate you for it but that ’s the point of Batman .
He can make the choice that no one else can make – the right choice . ”
As if shrugging off this year ’s public - mood polls , Alfred says , “ Things are always going to get worse before they get better . ”
There ’s a weariness , a sense of a long war , that is central to “ The Dark Knight . ”
Cops get mowed down in the movie , just as US soldiers get killed overseas , and Gotham begins to grasp at any option that seems like an alternative to endless conflict .
Taking the fight to the enemy comes to seem hopelessly rigid .
But Batman is insistent : “ The Joker can not win , ” he declares .
Several times , the movie makes the case that only those who die young can truly be heroes .
By hanging around ( Cheney has worked in four different administrations ) you automatically become a villain in the public eye .
But the ability to take abuse without complaining defines Batman .
He is content to lurk in the shadows getting blamed for everything while his boss , Commissioner Gordon , tries to manage all of the personalities in his department and provide a public face for Gotham crime - fighting .
Smiling for the cameras does n’t interest Batman .
If people hate him , he ’s okay with that .
“ He ’s not being a hero , ” Alfred says .
“ He ’s being something more . ” Someday President Obama is going to be standing on the White House roof projecting the Halliburton logo into the sky .

Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin leaves a hotel in New York on Wednesday after meeting with the Ukrainian and Georgian presidents .
In a first , Palin takes press questions
NEW YORK — Sarah Palin fielded four questions from a small group of reporters Thursday after touring several Sept. 11 - related sites , articulating a forceful approach to the war on terror but offering mostly evasive answers to specific questions .
She also would n’t say whether she supports the reelection bids of embattled Alaska Republicans Sen .
Ted Stevens and Rep. Don Young .

“ Ted Stevens ' trial started a couple days ago .
We ’ll see where that goes , ” she told reporters in what amounted to her first press conference since accepting the Republican vice presidential nomination .
She ignored a follow - up question on whether she would vote for Stevens and Young and would n’t say whether she would have done anything differently than the Bush administration in its war on terror .
“ I agree with the Bush administration that we take the fight to them , ” she said .
“ We never again let them come onto our soil and try to destroy not only our democracy but communities like the community of New York .
Never again .
So , yes , I do agree with taking the fight to the terrorists and stopping them over there . ”
She deflected a follow - up question about whether she felt the continued U.S. military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan has inflamed Islamic extremists .
“ I think our presence in Iraq and Afghanistan will lead to further security of our nation , again , because the mission is to take the fight over there .
Do not let them come over here and attempt again what they accomplished here , and that was some destruction , terrible destruction on that day .
But since Sept. 11 , Americans are uniting and rebuilding and committing to never letting that happen again .
In response to a question about the bailout package before Congress , she said , “ I do n't support that until the provisions that Sen.
McCain has offered are implemented in [ Treasury Secretary Henry ] Paulson 's proposals . ”
Palin broke her campaign trail media silence after touring several Sept. 11 - related sites and delivering a brief statement on the lessons of Sept. 11 in front of a firehouse that lost many of its firefighters in the World Trade Center disaster .
“ Every American student needs to come through this area so that , especially this younger generation of Americans , to be in a position of never forgetting what happened here and never repeating , never allowing a repeat of what happened here .
I wish every American would come through here .
I wish every world leader would come through here and understand what it is that took place here and , more importantly , how America came together and united to commit to never allowing this to happen again .
And just to hear from and see these good New Yorkers who are rebuilding not just this but are helping to rebuild America has been very , very inspiring and encouraging .
These are the good Americans who are committed to peace and security , and it 's been an absolute honor getting to meet these folks today . ”
Before that , Palin took a 20 - minute tour of the Tribute WTC 9/11 museum , took in a firefighters memorial , spent 25 minutes in a center for families of victims of the terrorist attacks , then met with New York City firefighters .
Palin was ushered into the museum by Lee Ielpi , president of the board of directors of the September 11th Families Association , which maintains the private museum .
Ielpi ’s son , a firefighter , died on Sept. 11 , and Jennifer Adams , CEO of the tribute museum , said Palin was moved when Ielpi showed her his son ’s picture as well as his bunker jacket .
Palin told her guides that her parents came to New York after the attacks and worked in the Staten Island landfill .
After the tour , Palin observed a memorial wall with John Morabito , a firefighter with Ladder Company 10 .
“ She was actually a little emotional because of the firefighters memorial wall , ” Morabito said .
“ I think she was sincere with it .
She was friendly .
I think she actually is a decent person . ”
“ She seems to be up to date [ with ] current events and everything that happened on 9/11 .
She ’s been given enough information .
I ’m sure she knows as much as the common American . ”
I 've finally found a title for the blog , Page F30 .
This comes from an article in the Washington Post a few weeks back ( April 13th to be precise ) about the future , where you find the following paragraph :
The most important things happening in the world today wo n't make tomorrow 's front page .
They wo n't get mentioned by presidential candidates or Chris Matthews or Bill O'Reilly or any of the other folks yammering and snorting on cable television .
They 'll be happening in laboratories -- out of sight , inscrutable and unhyped until the very moment when they change life as we know it .
Science and technology form a two - headed , unstoppable change agent .
Problem is , most of us are mystified and intimidated by such things as biotechnology , or nanotechnology , or the various other - ologies that seem to be threatening to merge into a single unspeakable and incomprehensible thing called biotechnonanogenomicology .
We vaguely understand that this stuff is changing our lives , but we feel as though it 's all out of our control .
We 're just hanging on tight , like Kirk and Spock when the Enterprise starts vibrating at Warp 8 .
What 's unnerving is the velocity at which the future sometimes arrives .
Consider the Internet .
This powerful but highly disruptive technology crept out of the lab ( a Pentagon think tank , actually ) and all but devoured modern civilization -- with almost no advance warning .
The first use of the word " internet " to refer to a computer network seems to have appeared in this newspaper on Sept. 26 , 1988 , in the Financial section , on page F30 -- about as deep into the paper as you can go without hitting the bedrock of the classified ads .
McLean won a $ 1,005,048 contract from the Air Force to supply a defense data network internet protocol router . "
Perhaps the unmellifluous compound noun " data network internet protocol router " is one reason more of us did n't pay attention .
A couple of months later , " Internet " -- still lacking the " the " before its name -- finally elbowed its way to the front page when a virus shut down thousands of computers .
The story referred to " a research network called Internet , " which " links as many as 50,000 computers , allowing users to send a variety of information to each other . "
The scientists knew that computer networks could be powerful .
But how many knew that this Internet thing would change the way we communicate , publish , sell , shop , conduct research , find old friends , do homework , plan trips and on and on ?
Joe Lykken , a theoretical physicist at the Fermilab research center in Illinois , tells a story about something that happened in 1990 .
A Fermilab visitor , an English fellow by the name of Tim Berners - Lee , had a new trick he wanted to demonstrate to the physicists .
He typed some code into a little blank box on the computer screen .
Up popped a page of data .
Lykken 's reaction : Eh .
He could already see someone else 's data on a computer .
He could have the colleague e-mail it to him and open it as a document .
Why view it on a separate page on some computer network ?
But of course , this unimpressive piece of software was the precursor to what is known today as the World Wide Web .
" We had no idea that we were seeing not only a revolution , but a trillion - dollar idea , " Lykken says .
So there it is , the purpose of this blog summed up a nice succinct title : Page F30 .
I spend most of my time here just writing whatever comes to mind and it comes across as a bit of a jumble of languages , space , geopolitics and whatnot , but there is one unifying theme behind it : to try to uncover and show what is hidden and / or unknown , to be the Page F30 article that reveals something that will turn out to be that much more important later on .
Of course , places like Page F30 are not just reserved for first mentions of new technology , but also things like IALs like Ido ( and others of course ) , another creation that does n't get the attention it deserves .
Or to state the blog 's goal in another way , it is to contribute to human development as a whole .
We as a whole are very good at progressing when we 're given the tools to do so , and you can see this in sites like Wikipedia .
Before it was created searching for information online was a process of scouring newspapers , sites , blogs , and so on .
Once people were given the tools to create a whole encyclopedia by themselves , off they went , and now we have Wikipedia .
The same situation occurs between countries as well .
When two countries that used to conflict with each other finally come to terms , trade and interaction between the two is astounding .
Remember when France and England used to be at war ?
I doubt that 'll ever happen again .
As a result of the peace between the two people are free to interact with each other , trade with each other , and do pretty much anything they want .
In that same way I suspect that if other hotspots in the world are done away with ( Azerbaijan - Armenia , Cyprus , Georgia 's breakaway republics , etc. ) we 'll be able to see a lot of progress in those regions that we 've never seen before .
A universal language is another area in which the whole of humanity will be able to interact with each other , and that should have the same effect .
Space travel as well : once we 've found a second Earth in another solar system we 'll never look at space the same way again .
In this way , once we 've overcome a certain obstacle or have stumbled upon something completely new , we almost never go back to the way we used to be .
So it 's generally this ultimate goal that I have in mind whenever I write something here .
Finally , I might later on decide to register a domain name like pagef30.com , but do n't bother registering it yourself in the hopes that I 'll be interested because then I 'll just change it to pagef29 , or pageg30 , or pagee35 , or .org instead of .com , or I 'll change page to pagino ( Ido for page ) , or any other combination .
Any combination that evokes the back of the newspaper will suit me fine .
By taking a couple of courses in economic theory , we could immunize ourselves from nonsense spouted by politicians and pundits , but in the meantime check out Professor John R. Lott 's " Freedomnomics : Why the Free Market Works . "
His first chapter is " Are You Being Ripped Off ? "
It addresses myths about predation where it 's sometimes alleged that corporations will charge below - cost prices to bankrupt their rivals and then charge unconscionable prices .
There 's little or no evidence that corporations would choose predation as strategy ; there are too many pitfalls .
A major one is that in order to recoup losses from charging low prices to bankrupt rivals , the predator would later have to charge higher - than - normal prices .
That would attract new rivals who might have purchased the bankrupt assets of the predator 's prey and be able to undercut the predator 's prices .
A far more successful means to monopoly wealth is for businesses to enlist the aid of congressmen to form a collusion .
Classic examples are the dairy industry , which uses the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's Federal Milk Marketing Orders to set statutory minimum prices , or the Gasoline Retailers Association using state law to do the same or the sugar industry using Congress to establish quotas on foreign sugar imports .
Professor Lott 's chapter " Government as Nirvana " highlights examples of government predation .
When the U.S. Postal Service raised the price of first - class mail in 1999 , it reduced its price for domestic overnight express mail from $ 15 to $ 13.70 , even though it was losing money at $ 15 .
The Postal Service was facing stiff competition from FedEx and UPS overnight services and wanted to keep its market share .
During the 1980s , private meteorology firms saw a chance to make money by selling television stations specialized forecasts that were n't provided by the National Weather Service .
The National Weather Service started providing television stations the same services for free , thus driving private forecasting companies out of business .
Predation is observed in higher education .
UCLA is both Lott 's and my alma mater .
It spends $ 40,000 per student but charges $ 6,522 tuition for in - state students .
Such below - cost pricing gives public universities a significant competitive advantage over private universities .
State universities have acquired many formerly private universities after driving , or threatening to drive , them out of business .
Lott gives examples of George Mason University School of Law , University of Buffalo , University of Houston and University of Pittsburgh .
In the case of University of Buffalo , the State University of New York reportedly threatened to open a public university across the street unless the University of Buffalo joined the state system .
The U.S. Department of Justice would go after a private business using similar predatory practices of intimidating its rivals and selling goods and services below cost .
The U.S. Department of Commerce sanctions foreign companies accused of selling goods in the U.S. below cost with anti-dumping duties .
If selling goods below cost is seen as unfair in the international arena , why is it not when it 's done by government entities ?
Lott 's " Crime and Punishment " chapter has a lot of interesting tidbits .
It starts off stating a fundamental principle of economics : the higher the cost of something , the less people will do of it .
To demonstrate the generality of this principle , Lott says that when the number of referees were increased from two to three in the Atlantic Coast Basketball Conference , fouls fell by 34 percent ; fouling became more costly .
The American League has more hit batsmen than the National League , but the difference only appeared after 1973 when the American League removed its pitchers from the batting lineup in favor of designated hitters .
Not being afraid of being hit themselves , American League pitchers threw more bean balls ; bean balls became cheaper .
The same principle applies to the U.S. crime rate that fell after the death penalty was reinstated , more prisons were built and concealed - weapon carry laws were enacted .
The higher the cost of a crime , the less people will do of it .
PRAIRIE VIEW , Tex .  “ Vote or Die , ” exhorts the faded slogan on a roadway at Prairie View A&M University , where black students once marched for the right to vote here in the town where they attend school , on a former cotton plantation about 50 miles northwest of Houston .
The students won that battle in 2004 , long after the United States Supreme Court supposedly decided the issue in 1979 .
But disputes over minority voting rights  along with accusations of election fraud  continue to rouse Prairie View , home to one of the nation ’s leading historically black colleges , and other Texas locales .
“ The cold war ’s not over  they just moved the fence from Berlin to the Texas border , ” said DeWayne Charleston , Waller County justice of the peace , who maintains that local officials failed to record hundreds of students whom he registered to vote in 2006 .
The federal Department of Justice and the Texas attorney general ’s office say investigations are under way here , but will not give details .
Meanwhile , the attorney general , Greg Abbott , is a defendant in a separate voting rights case that goes to federal trial on Wednesday in the East Texas city of Marshall , in the wake of the Supreme Court ’s decision last month upholding Indiana ’s tough voter identification law .
Scientists at the University of California in Berkeley have engineered a material that can bend visible light around objects .
This development could soon result in technology that can render tanks , ships and troops invisible to the eye .
Results of the US military - funded research are expected to appear in the scientific journals Science and Nature this week .
According to a report in the Sunday Times , this breakthrough follows earlier work undertaken at the Imperial College in London that achieved similar results with microwaves .
Like light , these are a form of electromagnetic radiation , but their longer wave - length makes them far easier to manipulate .
Achieving the same effect with visible light is a big advance .
Journalist 's impression of troops equipped with the new cloaking technology on exercise
The head of research , Professor Xiang Zhang , said in the case of invisibility cloaks or shields , the material would need to curve light waves completely around the object like a river flowing around a rock .
In essence , an observer looking at the cloaked object would then see light from behind it , making it seem to disappear .
Substances capable of achieving such feats are known as metamaterials , which get their electromagnetic properties from their structural mix , rather than directly inheriting those of the substances composing them .
They have the power to grab electromagnetic radiation and deflect it smoothly .
No such material occurs naturally and it's only very recently that molecular engineering has advanced sufficiently to give scientists the opportunity to create them .
Not since Project Rainbow , when in October 1943 the US Navy rendered the destroyer escort USS Eldridge invisible to human observers for a brief period , has such a breakthrough in light - refraction stealth technology been made .
Of course , that last bit 's complete nonsense . ®
Shai Agassi — on a mission to end oil . *
Photo : Joe Pugliese * Shai Agassi looks up and down the massive rectangular table in the Ritz - Carlton ballroom and begins to worry .
He knows he 's out of his league here .
For the last day and a half , he 's been listening to an elite corps of Israeli and US politicians , businesspeople , and intellectuals debate the state of the world .
Agassi is just one of 60 sequestered in a Washington , DC , hotel for a conference run by the Saban Center for Middle East Policy .
Among the participants : Bill Clinton , former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres , Supreme Court justice Stephen Breyer , and two past directors of the CIA .
It 's December 2006 .
Scheduled to speak in a few minutes , Agassi gets nudged by the Israeli minister of education : " Be optimistic , " she tells him .
" We 've got to close with an upbeat tone . "
Agassi thanks her .
Optimism wo n't be a problem .
At 38 , Agassi is the youngest invitee .
Just after the dotcom boom , SAP , the world 's largest maker of enterprise software , paid $ 400 million for a small - business software company he started with his father ; now he 's SAP 's head of products and widely presumed to be the next CEO .
But he 's not here this morning to talk about business software .
Instead , his topic will be the world 's addiction to fossil fuels .
It 's a recent passion and the organizers invited him to counterbalance the man speaking now , Daniel Yergin , the famed energy consultant and oil industry analyst .
Yergin gives them his latest thinking : Energy independence is unattainable .
Oil consumption will continue to rise .
Iran will get richer .
It 's not exactly what this audience wants to hear .
Now it 's Agassi 's turn .
He starts off uncharacteristically nervous , stammering a bit .
He 's got something different , he says .
A new approach .
He believes it just might be possible to get the entire world off oil .
For good .
Point by point , gaining speed as he goes , he shares for the first time in public the ideas that will change his future — and possibly the world's .
Agassi has dark hair , light brown eyes , and a square jaw .
He 's a careful speaker , holding back until the right moment before delivering his thoughts .
He 's partial to dramatic pauses , especially if he 's about to explain how the future is going to look — something he does all the time .
People often think he 's kidding , partly because he always has a slight , wry smile .
But when the pause ends , what follows — no matter how far - fetched — is never a joke .
At his first executive board meeting at SAP , a company that had grown dominant by moving slowly and conservatively , Agassi suggested nearly a dozen heretical ideas .
He said SAP should give away its hardware and software for free — just charge for IT support .
He said SAP should make its database business open source to undermine Oracle .
The other board members laughed :
The new kid was a cutup !
But they stopped when SAP cofounder Hasso Plattner looked around the table and said , " He 's the only guy making sense here . "
Agassi's interest in energy is new .
In 2005 , he joined Young Global Leaders , an invitation - only group for politicians and businesspeople under 40 .
The four - day induction seminar was held at the Swiss ski resort of Zermatt .
Between lectures , YGLs like Skype cofounder Niklas Zennström and NBA star Dikembe Mutombo pledged to find ways to " make the world a better place " by 2020 .
Agassi's assignment was the environment , and he quickly focused in on climate change .
Most left the event and just poked around in their own industries , looking for small tweaks and improvements .
But Agassi wanted something bigger .
Back home in Silicon Valley , his day job involved coaxing SAP into the Web 2.0 era .
But after Zermatt , his nights were devoted to dinners with energy experts , books on energy policy , and sessions on Wikipedia , learning everything he could about the carbon economy .
Getting off oil was the key , he decided .
But how ?
He started by looking at cutting energy usage in the home , then moved to a more tempting target : transportation .
Was hydrogen the answer ?
What about embedding power in the street — like slot cars ?
Could more be done with biofuels ?
Agassi kept a running file on his home PC and began working on a series of white papers .
Agassi will sell his battery - powered cars cheap and make money off drivers ' electricity purchases .

The problem , he decided , was oil - consuming , CO 2 - spewing cars .
The solution was to get rid of them .
Not just some , and not just by substituting hybrids or flex fuels .
No half measures .
The internal combustion engine had to be retired .
The future was in electric cars .
This was hardly an original insight ; electric cars had been the future for over 100 years .
In the late 1800s and early 1900s , the Electric Vehicle Company was the largest automaker in the US , with dealers from Paris to Mexico City .
But oil , in the end , supplanted volts on American highways because of one perennial problem : batteries .
Car batteries , then and now , are heavy and expensive , do n't last long , and take forever to recharge .
In five minutes you can fill a car with enough gas to go 300 miles , but five minutes of charging at home gets you only about 8 miles in an electric car .
Clever tricks , like adding " range extenders " — gas engines that kick in when a battery dies — end up making the cars too expensive .
Q&A With Israel 's Shimon Peres
In early June , Wired 's Daniel Roth talked with Israeli president Shimon Peres about Better Place , the greening of Israel , his obsession with Israel 's burgeoning solar industry , and the problems that come with turning a vision into a reality .
An edited excerpt :
Wired :
Was the message of getting off oil something you were concerned about before ?
Peres : I thought that the greatest problem of our time was oil .
Oil on one hand is polluting the land , and on the other hand it 's financing terror .
They say jokingly that the Middle East is divided into these kind of countries : the oily countries and the holy countries .
We are obviously a holy country .
We do n't have oil .
We do n't have water .
Wired : You brought Better Place and Renault together .
Did you expect them to form this partnership ?
Peres : I never worried about it .
My great advantage is that I 'm ignorant .
My own mentor was David Ben-Gurion .
He used to say all experts are experts for things that did happen .
There are no experts for things that may happen .
Wired : Before Israel publicly announced its Better Place rollout , I was told that you and Prime Minister Ehud Olmert were going to announce that Israel was going to declare complete energy independence .
But the announcement was much more modest .
What happened ?
Peres :
It 's not the end of the story .
I am now pushing solar energy and introducing the new environmental approach to life .
It 's foolish :
Why should we hang on oil when we can hang on the sun ?
The sun is much more permanent , more democratic , and there 's plenty of it .
I 'm feeling that our technology will miniaturize the equipment of the solar energy and reduce the cost .
So I 'm very glad that we started .
Israel is going to be a green country .
That 's our ambition .
And our ambition is to do it as soon as possible .
Wired :
So can Israel become a clean tech global power ?
Peres : Israel , you know , is too small of a country to become a world market and too small a country to become a great world producer , but we have enough scientists per square kilometer to become a world laboratory .
And smallness has its own advantages ; when you are small you can be really daring , you can be a pilot plant .
You cannot , for example , try a car like Shai Agassi's in Texas .
It is too large and would be too costly and complicated .
Here we can do it on a human scale and eventually extend it and expand it .
Wired :
Do you see any " peace dividends " coming out of the clean tech push ?
Peres :
Oh yes .
Ecology forces us to cooperate .
Water is not disciplined , the air does n't ask for visas to fly from one place to another place , and if seas are beginning to die , all partners have to save them .
So today the economy is very much a matter of environment , and environment is an independent force that is not committed to borders or rules or conventions .
And nature is impatient .
You cannot say : I 'm going to negotiate pollution for 10 or 20 years .
Pollution wo n't wait for you .
Pollution is not a political force ; it 's a force of nature .
Agassi dealt with the battery issue by simply swatting it away .
Previous approaches relied on a traditional manufacturing formula :
We make the cars , you buy them .
Agassi reimagined the entire automotive ecosystem by proposing a new concept he called the Electric Recharge Grid Operator .
It was an unorthodox mashup of the automotive and mobile phone industries .
Instead of gas stations on every corner , the ERGO would blanket a country with a network of " smart " charge spots .
Drivers could plug in anywhere , anytime , and would subscribe to a specific plan — unlimited miles , a maximum number of miles each month , or pay as you go — all for less than the equivalent cost for gas .
They 'd buy their car from the operator , who would offer steep discounts , perhaps even give the cars away .
The profit would come from selling electricity — the minutes .
There would be plugs in homes , offices , shopping malls .
And when customers could n't wait to " fill up , " they 'd go to battery exchange stations where they would pull into car - wash - like sheds , and in a few minutes , a hydraulic lift would swap the depleted battery with a fresh one .
Drivers would n't pay a penny extra :
The ERGO would own the battery .
Agassi unveiled the outline of his vision for the crowd at the Saban event : a new kind of infrastructure , with ubiquitous charge stations , that was not only simple and logical but potentially profitable , too .
As he talked , he read the body language of the audience — they were leaning forward , they were nodding — and he fed off it , layering on details .
A country like Israel , he told them , could get off oil by simply adopting his new business model .
No technological breakthroughs were necessary .
No new inventions .
It was as if he 'd discovered a trapdoor beneath both the gasoline industry and the auto industry , a combined $ 3 trillion market .
It sounded easy and unavoidable .
Even Daniel Yergin was amazed .
Shai Agassi had stolen the show .
A week later , Agassi was in bed when his phone rang .
He was asked to hold for Shimon Peres .
At first he thought it was a joke .
" Now what ? " said the familiar rumbling voice on the other end of the line .
Peres said he had been thinking about Agassi 's speech since returning to Israel .
He wanted to know what Agassi was going to do about it .
" What do you mean ? " Agassi asked .
" You spoke so beautifully , you have to make this a reality .
Otherwise , it will remain a speech . "
After that conversation , Agassi could n't get Peres ' voice out of his head .
A few months later , when his boss broke the news that he would n't be getting the top job at SAP anytime soon , Agassi shocked just about everyone in the tech world by quitting .
And not long after that , in May 2007 , he launched Project Better Place , the world 's first global electric - car grid operator ( he later dropped " Project " ) .
He had no cars , no test site , and no electrical engineering or auto experience .
It was n't even clear that consumers wanted change .
They were paying $ 3 a gallon , painful but bearable .
### Electric Avenues
AutoOS , the Better Place operating system , would transform the transportation grid .
Here 's how .

2 The driver unplugs and heads out .
The software analyzes the first few minutes of driving and guesses the destination based on past history : " Work ? " it asks .
The driver speaks a response and the system determines how much energy is needed for the day .
3 During the commute , the location - aware system finds and displays three open parking spaces near the office that are equipped with Better Place charging spots .
4 An automatic arm extends to plug into the car .
The spot then communicates with the control center , which anticipates the driver 's energy needs so as to allocate power economically .
It might , say , limit consumption during expensive peak hours .
The driver gets a text : " 80 percent charged . "
5 An unexpected meeting comes up .
The driver enters a new route , and AutOS determines there is insufficient charge to get there .
The driver orders a battery swap .
6 AutOS finds the most convenient battery - exchange location and books a bay .
The old battery gets lowered onto a hydraulic plate , and the car moves forward on a car - wash - style track .
In five minutes , a fully charged battery is in place .
Nevertheless , many of Agassi 's colleagues from SAP joined him .
They realized that what Shai was building was still essentially a software company .
He needed a network that allowed cars to tell the grid how much charge they were carrying and how much more they required .
The system had to know where the car was so it could tell the driver where to go to " fill up . "
And it had to electronically negotiate with the local energy utility over when it could and could n't take power and how much to pay .
Few of his colleagues asked to read the business plan before signing on .
They were joining the cause , not just the company .
" Once you have a mission , " Agassi told me over dinner one night last winter , " you ca n't go back to having a job . "
By early summer 2008 , Agassi had two countries ready to roll out the plan , a major automaker producing the cars , and $ 200 million in committed capital .
He had launched the fifth - largest startup of all time in less than a year .
After a career spent thinking exclusively about business software , Agassi now thrills to the idea that he 's changing the world .
" I get to shift multiple markets , " he says .
" I get to shift economies .
It 's extremely liberating .
I breathe differently . "
Israelis like to call Peres , now their president , a visionary , and they mean it as both a compliment and a dig .
He sees where things can go but not necessarily how to get there .
When I spoke with him , he recognized that Agassi has to deal with the same challenge : " When you translate a dream into reality , " he said , " it 's never a full implementation .
It is easier to dream than to do . "
It is mid-May , and Agassi is sitting at the head of a conference table in the Kiryat Atidim high tech office park in northern Tel Aviv .
Two dozen Better Place engineers and executives are grabbing platefuls of fresh watermelon and finding seats .
About a third have flown in from the company 's Palo Alto headquarters ; the rest are based here .
Agassi knows the Israeli tech community intimately .
He was born here to immigrant parents — his dad 's family fled from Iraq , his mom's from Morocco — and at 15 he was accepted into the Technion , Israel 's MIT .
After graduating , he and his father , also a Technion alum , started a series of software companies .
They had their pick of talent :
The country 's density of scientists and engineers is among the highest in the world .
This is the first time that most of these Better Placers have been together in one room .
Agassi slumps low in his chair , staring at this morning 's first speaker , his little brother , Tal. Better Place is a family affair .
Agassi's younger sister , Dafna Barazovsky , also works there , and their father , Reuven , frequently sits in on meetings .

Tal wears a tight - fitting button - down , and as usual his hair is heavily gelled in spikes .
At 33 , he is Better Place 's head of network deployment , overseeing every aspect of the all - important electric grid .
Behind him are three gray - and - blue mock - ups of the charging stations .
These will be much more than dumb sockets ; they have to carry the charge , sure , but they also must withstand being dinged by cars , vandalized by thieves , and subjected to the heat and cold .
And they have to communicate with Better Place headquarters to verify that , yes , this is a subscriber and here 's how to bill them .
The first order of business is to choose a design .
" Put them on the table , " Agassi tells his brother , who gently positions the foam models so everyone can vote .
The first looks like a giant Pez dispenser , with a skinny trunk leading up to a cantilevered box that houses the charging equipment .
The second has a fat base and a skinny body that zigs in the middle , like a svelte E.T .
The last one is waist - high , smaller than the others , and resembles a stunted drive - through squawk box .
It 's the most practical :
It can be freestanding or mounted , and it would be the least objectionable to retail centers .
It wins unanimous approval .
Then , from all around the table , come the real questions .
How does the box signal that it 's out of service ?
Where will the 32 - amp charging cable go — in the charging spot or in the vehicle ?
" In America and Australia , it has to be outside the car , " declares Ziva Patir , a former vice president of the International Organization for Standardization .
Agassi hired her in April , because he not only wants Better Place to adhere to every country 's existing regulations , he wants to define the new standards for the coming global electric recharge grid .
So the power cords will have to be coiled inside the device and pulled out like a garden hose .
But how many hoses ?
Enough for two cars ?
Four cars ?
And if four , wo n't the box be too small to hold them all ?
Plus , what if the power outlet on the car is in the back and the driver pulls in facing forward ?
Agassi has been listening , saying nothing .
But now he reacts .
" Our customer goes to park her car , " he says .
" She pulls in , then she 's squeezing between two cars to drag out this big cable and walk it back to her car .
She 'll be wearing her nice work clothes and getting them dirty . "
His eyes are closed , his hands resting on his head .
" Guys , " he says , using a term that always signals his disappointment with the group , " we 've just lost half the market .
You need to make life simple for people . "
Tal stands in the front of the room , slightly stunned .
A small - scale Agassi family feud breaks out .
Dafna , 37 , head of marketing for Better Place 's Israel operations , says it 's not asking a lot for people to pull into a parking spot a certain way .
Their father is sitting up front , but he remains quiet .
Tal finally comes up with a response : " We can have a hydraulic arm holding the cable , " he says .
That enrages the rest of the room .
An arm !
The cost of adding an arm to the hundreds of thousands of charge spots they envision will crater the business model , argues someone from the Israeli office .
Forget money , someone else says : Redesigning these things will push us way behind on our deadlines .
Agassi dismisses the whole idea of an arm .
" It 'll break in three months , " he mutters to himself .
He tries to move the meeting along , but the cable and the connector keep coming up .
Each proposed solution creates a new set of problems .
( " It 's like a fractal , " Agassi tells me later of the process , with a hint of pleasure .
" But at the end , what you want is a snowflake . " )
He asks occasional questions , but usually just about how the speaker came to a certain conclusion — it 's the thought process more than the answer that seems to intrigue him .
Finally , as Hebrew and English blur into a confusing Esperanto roar , Agassi raises both arms over his head : " One conversation ! " he shouts .
And then , the pause .
He suddenly sees how it 's going to work .
Maybe the arm is n't so wrong .
" This is ' think different , ' " he says , invoking Apple , a company that features prominently in the detailed business metaphors he always seems to have at hand .
" What do we need to make this happen ?
Two servos , two degrees of movement for the arm . "
Pause .
" This is the driver experience :
He goes into a spot and the spot connects itself .
In 2008 , we put the cable in the unit , in 2010 we use an arm , in 2012 , there 's a smart arm that connects automatically .
For the home unit , the users get a pull cable for free , or they pay $ 500 and they get autoconnect .
It 'll cost $ 250 to build , and we 'll sell it for $ 500 . "
Agassi has not only come around on the arm , he now thinks it is essential .
End of discussion .
He even names a company that can build the arm and suggests how to structure the deal .
The choice : to recharge batteries at plug - in spots , or swap them out at special stations .
Photo : Joe Pugliese " Shai 's got two big traits , " says Aliza Peleg , Better Place 's VP of operations .
" By the time he 's thought of something , to him it 's been completed , it 's been achieved , " she says .
" The other trait is that by the time you 've understood what he 's thinking , he 's already somewhere else .
You 're in catch - up mode 24/7 . "
For months ,
Tal and his team have been working with vendors to design and price the charging spots .
Now he has to go back and tell them that they need to add arms — and eventually smart arms — and that the redesign has to be ready by their next all - company meeting , in 90 days .
Crazy .
That 's what people say when they first realize the scope of Agassi 's project .
He 's tilting at electric windmills , fighting a fight that has undone countless well - funded , well - intentioned entrepreneurs before him .
In a time when Silicon Valley is all about small — scalable startups like Flickr , Tumblr , and hundreds of other vowel - deprived minicompanies — Agassi is thinking big .
Google , Ford , and Exxon Mobil big .
His brother tells me that Better Place is going to become one of the biggest companies in the world .
When I ask Shai if he 's worried about a competitor stealing his idea , he stares at me like I 'm an idiot .
" The mission is to end oil , " he says , " not create a company . "
Most startups try out their product on beta testers .
Agassi wanted a beta country .
A cooperative national government would be willing to modify the tax code or offer other incentives — essential to getting consumers on board quickly .
He was n't selling cars , but really building a network ; the bigger the initial base , the stronger the network effect .
A small island nation would be ideal , since the range of his car is limited by the range of his charging grid .
Fortunately , he already had deep family and business ties to a virtual island — Israel is surrounded by water on one side and by enemies on all others .
The farthest a driver can safely go in a straight shot is about 250 miles .
Plus , Israel is increasingly queasy about its role as an oil importer .
Anything that threatens the livelihoods of hostile Arab oil sheikhs and Iranian mullahs has a special appeal in Agassi 's native land .
Agassi got to work convincing the Israeli government in 2007 .
First he , Peres , and Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert pressed legislators to change the tax code to make electric vehicles more attractive to consumers .
Under the proposed tax scheme , Israel 's 78 percent tax on cars would be replaced by a 10 percent tax on zero-emission vehicles and a 72 percent tax on traditional gas - guzzlers .
( After four years , the sales tax on electric vehicles will rise sharply . )
Agassi argued that the revenue losses — calculated at $ 700 million over five years — would be insignificant compared to what foreign oil costs the economy .
At a Jerusalem press conference in late January , Olmert beamed down at Agassi , who was sitting in the front row : " In order to bring about this dramatic change , sometimes we need a boy like in the fairy tales to say , ' Look , the emperor has no clothes . '
We can all see that for ourselves , so how come we have n't said so ?
And this boy comes along and puts things in motion to bring about change .
And the boy in this story — and he really is a boy , practically , but he has achieved more than many adults have — is , of course , Shai Agassi . "
He had a country , but he also needed someone to build the cars .
At the 2007 World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland , when Agassi was still representing SAP , he met Carlos Ghosn , CEO of both Nissan and Renault — related companies that together form the fourth - largest automaker in the world .
The two talked in Peres ' hotel room .
Agassi 's timing could n't have been better .
Ghosn was looking for a way to leapfrog his competitors in the clean - vehicle arena .
GM was chasing the hydrogen fuel cell , Ford liked biofuels , Toyota had the Prius .
Ghosn was especially dismissive of the hybrid approach : " They 're like mermaids , " he told the Israelis .
" When you want a fish you get a woman , and when you want a woman you get a fish . "
Ghosn 's companies did n't have much except a tiny electric Nissan car and plans for a high - powered lithium - ion battery to be developed by Nissan and NEC .
At best , he figured , he might be able to sell the vehicles to post offices or other companies that would buy a few dozen and never drive them more than 60 miles .
Agassi's plan could open much bigger doors .
Still , who was this guy ?
Ghosn was interested , but it was too early to make any commitment .
Two months later , Agassi quit his job at SAP .
Soon he was looking for money and , in early June , he found himself sitting in an office in Tel Aviv 's gleaming Millennium Tower , pitching to one of Israel 's richest men , Idan Ofer .
Ofer is short and powerfully built ; he carries himself like a wrestler ready for his next takedown .
Ofer and his family have investments around the world , and much of their money is tied up in shipping .
But he 'd recently bought the largest oil refinery in Israel and was finalizing a joint venture with Chery Automobile , the massive Chinese auto company .
Ofer liked what Better Place could do for Israel , and he thought it could work around the world .
Plus , he really liked how it might make his China investment more valuable .
Chery could build cars to work on the Better Place infrastructure .
China itself could be a market .
( Agassi has no deal yet with Chery , but one is being discussed . )
Most Israeli entrepreneurs who tried to get into Ofer 's wallet were interested only in becoming big in Israel , then selling out .
Ofer was impressed that Agassi 's global ambitions surpassed even his own .
" He had the self - image of being an equal to Steve Jobs or Michael Dell or Bill Gates , " Ofer says .
" Even if this ends up destroying — for lack of a better word — my refinery business , that will be small money compared to what this will be .
When you play chess , you give up something to get something else . "
After the meeting , Ofer joined Agassi in the elevator .
By the time they got to the street , he had committed $ 100 million .
The total would eventually grow to $ 130 million .
Agassi raised another $ 70 million more from Morgan Stanley and two venture firms , VantagePoint Venture Partners and Maniv Energy Capital .
Once Agassi had $ 200 million to fund the grid and a government serious about tax breaks , Renault began developing an electric car that would be ready for the market by 2011 .
Agassi promises that 50 Renault prototypes will be on Israeli roads this winter — and 1,000 stations will be there to recharge them .
He 's not talking about some three - wheeled , pimped - out golf carts , either , but blend - in - at - the - school - parking - lot cars and SUVs .
The sedan will be mid-size , similar to Renault 's popular Laguna and Mégane models and able to go from 0 to 60 in a respectable 7.5 seconds .
Better Place expects to have close to 100,000 vehicles by the end of 2011 .
And while these might show up in Israel first , Renault plans for them eventually to be on roads worldwide .
" We would n't have invested if we thought this was a onetime , one - place story , " says Patrick Pélata , Renault 's product manager and Ghosn 's number two .
4x4 Projects in Kfar Saba , a suburb of Tel Aviv , is the auto equivalent of an Olympic training center .
The building , however , does n't look like much , just a mustard - yellow warehouse on a cluttered industrial side street .
And inside , it 's just a warren of cars , trucks , and auto parts .
But on a lift sits a white Jeep Wrangler that 's been outfitted with supersize off - road wheels , like a monster dune buggy .
A green Hummer is parked in back , its diesel engine replaced with a high - powered Chevy small - block .
And a silver BMW 318i has a shiny new Corvette V - 8 ; touch the gas and the tail whips out , perfect for drifting .
The only vehicle that does n't really fit in is a completely ordinary family sedan , a silver 2005 Renault Mégane — Better Place 's first prototype .
Agassi needed some way to test Better Place 's all - important software , called AutOS ( pronounced " autos " ) .
The system serves as energy monitor , GPS unit , help center , and personal assistant , packed into an onboard PC that will also hold cellular and Wi-Fi chips .
As part of the debugging process , Agassi bought the used Mégane and sent it to 4x4 with his car guy , Quin Garcia .
The assignment was to convert it into an electric car .
Garcia was just finishing his master 's in automotive engineering at Stanford University last year when he heard Agassi give a speech on campus .
A few months later , he had a job at Better Place .
Garcia 's manner is laid - back Northern California until anything related to cars comes up , at which point he turns as intense as everyone else at Better Place .
Garcia reaches into the Mè9gane and pushes a button .
Nothing happens .
" It needs to be rebooted , " he shouts to the owner of the shop .
Garcia opens a silver box under the hood and fiddles with some buttons .
" Control - Alt - Delete , " jokes Better Place executive Barak Hershkovitz .
Hershkovitz oversees AutOS .
He is the hard - nosed realist to Agassi 's dreamer , the Scotty to his Kirk .
That means Hershkovitz , even when he 's joking , comes off hangdog — he knows that deadlines are looming .
Hershkovitz was about to start a residency in ophthalmology when he teamed up with Agassi in 1998 .
He was a brilliant , self - taught programmer , and what started as a bit of moonlighting quickly turned into a full - time job , first at one of the Agassi family companies , then at SAP .
He quit soon after Agassi left , and now , with a staff of six , he 's building AutOS .
The system reboots , and Garcia taps a blank spot on the dashboard to show where the car 's AutOS - powered LCD will go .
The garage 's owner gets behind the wheel .
I take the passenger seat , Garcia and Hershkovitz climb in back , and we head toward the highway .
As we accelerate , I 'm pinned uncomfortably to my seat .
Unlike a traditional engine , an electric motor produces all of its power right away .
( Recently , Ofer , whose $ 130 million investment made him chair of the board , took the prototype for a spin .
Garcia and others watched in horror as Ofer 's sharp steering , combined with the instant torque , caused an axle to snap . )
I keep waiting for the shift to another gear — the jerk that signals it 's time to breathe again .
" A normal gas engine spins at 6,000 rpm , " Garcia says , noticing my surprise .
" This motor can spin up to 12,000 rpm , " which means there 's no need to change gears .
" You do n't have the normal car problem where you need first gear to get off the line .
We just took the original transmission and stuck it permanently in second . "
As we approach a stop sign , the car feels like it 's being held back by a rubber band .
The tug , Hershkovitz explains , comes from what 's called regeneration .
" When you take your foot off the pedal , the car has kinetic energy , " he says .
" The motor starts charging the battery , turning the kinetic energy back to electric energy . "
He starts running through possible ways to turn the physics into a game :
He wants Better Place users to be able to go to a Web site and see which drivers have racked up the most " regen . "
Maybe they 'll win prizes .
Garcia decides to argue the point .
" If you 're regening , it means you used too much energy in the first place ! "
Meaning drivers should just take their foot off the accelerator sooner .
" Ah , you are not a computer .
It 's not like you can calculate how much energy you need to get to that red light , " Hershkovitz says .
" Every time you do regen , there 's a loss — it 's not like you get it all back , " protests Garcia .
" The perfect driver would cruise around without ever using regen or the brakes .
When they came to their destination , they would coast to a stop . "
Hershkovitz ignores him .
" Come on , let 's go , " he says as we pull back into the 4x4 shop .
He has an appointment with a Japanese team from NEC to talk batteries .
I follow him into his rented Mazda5 and find my body relaxing to the familiar shifts and jerks of the internal combustion engine .
The initial deal with Israel was , thanks to Agassi 's connections , practically foreordained .
The real test would be signing up a second country — a " validator , " to use Agassi 's term .
In March , he got one .
Denmark is everything Israel is not : a cold climate ( which is hard on batteries ) , a net exporter of oil , a nation friendly with its neighbors .
Agassi had no ties to the government .
But he had a business model that proved irresistible to a Danish company called DONG Energy .
For DONG , Denmark 's largest utility , Better Place offers an opportunity to solve one of its biggest problems : the economies of wind power .
DONG makes a higher portion of energy from wind — 18 percent — than any other power company in the world .
Danish politicians want to see that figure doubled , which is good and green but completely impractical :
Some days the wind blows , and some days it does n't .
Banking wind energy is expensive and inefficient — DONG would have to buy fields of batteries .
Rather than lose it , the company ends up giving away excess power to Germany and Sweden .
So when DONG CEO Anders Eldrup met with Agassi , he immediately saw that Better Place would not only appeal to his countrymen 's environmental leanings , but the cars would also be a cheap , distributed way to store excess wind power .
After the partnership was announced , Eldrup went for a haircut and found himself bombarded with questions about Better Place .
His longtime barber had never once asked about Eldrup 's business .
Before the Better Place announcement , the man explained , he 'd never really cared .
Better Place did seem to sell itself .
That 's what Agassi was discovering .
The day of the Denmark announcement , he received a text message from an executive at a carmaker outside of the US .
( He declines to name the company . )
" What 's going on in Denmark ? " it read .
Agassi , a bit confused , wrote back that he had just announced country two .
" What 's the announcement ? "
Agassi typed : " Zero percent tax on our cars , DONG as a partner . "
The next day he got another text message : " But there was already 0 percent tax on alternative energy cars in Denmark . "
Agassi sent back a long missive explaining that because of Better Place , Denmark was talking about expanding its tax break beyond the current 2012 cutoff date ; that DONG was promising that it could supply 100 percent clean energy for all Better Place cars ; that he 's raising an additional * $ * 160 million for Denmark alone ; and that Renault intended to supply all the cars Denmark could buy .
He finished the message with some barbed advice : " I 'll be offering $ 20,000 cars in a market where you 're selling $ 60,000 cars .
How many have you planned to sell in 2011 in Denmark ?
Because I recommend you take them off your plan . "
The next day , Agassi was invited to a meeting with the automaker 's CEO .
" I have a strong feeling this is where the industry is going to go , " says Rod Lache , an auto analyst at Deutsche Bank .
In March , Lache crunched the numbers for his clients on what Better Place might do to their portfolio of auto holdings .
He figured a typical driver in the US gets 20 mpg .
With gas at $ 4 per gallon , a driver who clocked 15,000 miles per year would have an annual gas bill of $ 3,000 .
The equivalent cost of electricity and battery depreciation — Better Place 's cost to fill up its customers ' cars , in other words — would be about $ 1,050 .
If Agassi had cheaper cars ( thanks to tax breaks or incentives ) and offered monthly plans that were lower than or equal to what consumers were paying at the pump , this would be phenomenally attractive .
" Frankly , " Lache wrote , " we are not aware of any reason why [ automakers ] would not sign up for this . "
Early this summer , Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche told a German newspaper that his company would have an electric Mercedes and an electric Smart car on the market by 2010 .
When asked about the cost , he said it really depended on whether the batteries came with the car or were leased .
No one had thought about separating the battery from the car before Agassi ; now CEOs like Zetsche were treating it as standard electric - car business practice .
And yes , Zetche confirmed , Daimler is talking to Better Place .
It 's a warm mid-March morning in Washington , DC .
Agassi has just flown in from San Francisco on the red-eye .
He was booked in business class but ended up in coach , sleeping across three seats .
His ever - present uniform — dark suit , white shirt — looks slightly rumpled .
For years , Agassi has traveled almost constantly , and the irony of fighting planetary destruction while clocking countless hours of carbon - spewing jet travel is n't lost on him .
" I have so many sins to pay on my climate bill right now that we hope this works really fast , " he says .
If Better Place is to live up to Agassi 's revolutionary goal , it will eventually have to win over Americans , the world 's largest per-capita polluters .
But that wo n't be easy .
He starts the day off with a speech at a conference organized by a left - leaning think tank .
Speaking without notes , Agassi roams the stage , preaching the inevitability of his plan .
He has a way of describing things that is never zero - sum ; everybody wins in his version of the future , even when he 's selling massive disruption .
" For the car companies , we made it simple , " he says .
" We separated the ownership of the car and the ownership of the battery .
See , car companies do n't know how to assess the life of the battery .
So they go through these complicated programs of testing them for a long period of time .
And we told the car company , you know what ?
Just like you do n't sell a car with a card that says ' Here is oil for the life of the car , ' you do n't sell cars with the batteries for the life of the car , because the battery is crude oil . "
He explains that his plan alone , once scaled up , could produce a 20 percent drop in the world 's CO 2 emissions .
And he was n't stopping there .
" If we also buy clean generation , we reduce the price of clean electrons so that at the end of 10 years , clean electrons are cheaper than coal - based electrons , and nobody builds another coal plant at that point .
That 's another 40 percent of CO 2 emissions ; that 's the treaty Tony Blair is now working to get for the world by 2050 .
I 'm telling you , we can get there a decade after we finish the car side .
We can get there in 2030 — 60 percent reduction in our CO 2 emissions . "
After every speech — or just in the course of everyday business — one or two people ask Agassi for jobs .
Michael Granoff , the venture capitalist who was Better Place 's earliest investor , now works for Agassi as head of oil independence policies .
( " I joke that 29 days a month Shai 's my boss , and one day a month " — when Agassi briefs investors — " I'm his , " Granoff says . )
Today in DC , a young man from the Boston Consulting Group corners Agassi on his way out of the Hilton conference room and hands over his résumé .
Granoff , who has organized Agassi's day , waits until the man is out of earshot and reminds Agassi that the same guy made the same request after a speech in Boston .
Agassi has a groupie .
Outside the hotel , Granoff and Agassi jump into a hybrid Lexus SUV and head to Capitol Hill for a series of meetings .
In the office of a New York House Democrat named Steve Israel , Agassi settles into a leather couch and makes a direct pitch .
" Whoever is number 44 , " meaning the next president , " will transfer $ 2 trillion to $ 3 trillion out of the economy " — the amount America will spend on foreign oil in his first term .
This is a line Agassi has been testing lately , and Israel seems to bite .
" So what do we do ? " asks the legislator .
Agassi lays it out :
He wants tax hikes on gas - powered cars .
Israel tells him that will never fly .
As Agassi discusses other possible incentives , Israel interrupts him : " We do n't make batteries , so are n't we going to swap out foreign - oil dependence for foreign - battery reliance ? "
It 's a strange theory , but Agassi does n't blink .
The conversation suddenly shifts to the best way to set up a battery - manufacturing center in the congressman 's Long Island district .
Israel is late for a vote , so everyone hustles off toward the Capitol .
As Israel veers away toward the House floor , Agassi enters an elevator followed by Kansas senator Sam Brownback .
Granoff , who seems to know everyone in DC , introduces the two and quickly explains Better Place .
Brownback asks if he can buy one of Agassi 's cars .
" One problem :
We need the infrastructure first , " Agassi says .
" That 's what we 're building . "
" All you need is a plug , right ?
Why would you need an infrastructure ? " asks Brownback , who towers over Agassi .
Agassi pulls out his BlackBerry : " We 're like AT&T , not Nokia , " he says .
But the cell phone analogy does n't click here .
" So you 're like a long extension cord ? " asks Brownback , and everyone laughs politely .
Agassi starts to explain , but the senator steps out .
Granoff promises that he 'll bring the two men together soon for a more substantial discussion .
The rest of the day proves equally unsatisfying .
One senator cancels at the last minute ; another offers little but good wishes .
In nearly every meeting , insiders ruefully give the same advice .
Getting anything like the deal he has in Israel is going to be impossible .
Washington was a bust , but there are other ways to conquer America .
Agassi has already been contacted by the mayor of Los Angeles and politicians in Michigan and New York City .
San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom was in Agassi's Young Global Leaders class .
" My proposal was about health care or something in San Francisco , " Newsom says sheepishly .
He traveled to Israel to meet with Better Place in May .
But Agassi is wary .
For one thing , San Francisco is hardly an island , and as leader of a municipality , Newsom has few tax levers he can pull to make the electric car affordable .
That has n't kept the mayor from combing through statutes for fees the city might lift .
" This is the irony :
The city is working harder to get their business than the business itself .
Should n't he be sucking up to San Francisco ? "
Newsom asks , only half joking .
But there is a natural place to start in the US .
The island state , Hawaii , depends on shipped - in oil ; a full 14 percent of the state 's annual $ 62 billion gross domestic product goes to oil producers , more than any state in the nation .
After Israel announced its Better Place plans in January , Hawaii governor Linda Lingle asked for a meeting .
This spring , Agassi went to Honolulu .
The governor ushered him into her grand koa - wood - paneled conference room .
She sat at the head of the table , flanked by cabinet members .
Agassi showed them how the model worked , how it would roll out , how unstoppable it would be .
The governor 's people wanted to know why this was n't just shifting the environmental burden to the electric utility .
Agassi said he'd pay a premium to buy energy made only from renewable sources , making it cost - effective for the utility to put in wind farms or solar - powered plants — something Lingle has been pushing for .
The tourism and economic development director was impressed , but one thing bothered him : Consumers want choices .
" This is Hawaii , " he said .
" Where are the convertibles ? "
At a larger meeting a few weeks later , one of Agassi 's lieutenants made the case to dozens of Hawaii 's business and political leaders .
Like others , Dave Rolf was intrigued .
He represents the state 's auto dealers , a powerful lobby in the state capitol that 's against anything that cuts into car dealer profits .
The meeting lasted eight hours , and Rolf left stunned .
Not only was this going to happen , he decided , it needed to happen , and Hawaii was the perfect place .
He fired off a letter to GM 's regional head in California urging the carmaker to pay attention .
The auto industry needed to be part of this from the get - go .
They needed to be making electric cars .
" This is kind of a world - changer , " Rolf says .
A few months ago , I stopped by Agassi's Palo Alto headquarters to sit in on a three - day strategy meeting .
The company has just moved in , and the walls are still decorated with motivational posters put up by the previous tenant .
Empty cubicles are waiting to be filled .
The entire staff is trying to write a mission statement with help from a moderator .
He flips through slides on a screen : " Our mission is to transform personal mobility . "
" Our mission is to break the world 's oil addiction ( before it breaks us ) . "
Agassi , in a black leather jacket , a stiff blue - and - white button - down , and faded jeans , stops the moderator .
" We still think we 're selling to them , " he says , after one of his long , drawn - out pauses .
" We 're not .
It 's not us to them .
It 's them to us .
You see , people want this to happen ; we just happen to be in the way of their getting what they want .
We can't give them the car fast enough .
That 's something we need to capture : ' We 're here to serve you , ' not ' We 're here to sell to you . '
We 're a facilitator , not the creator .
This is going to be a community .
We just need to get out of their way .
They 're going to push for policy , they 're going to sell the cars , they 're going to be zealots . "
I start thinking about the people he has already hooked : mayors , CEOs , investors , statesmen , even car dealers .
At one point , Tal had marveled to me about Shai 's ability to convince you that the answers to the most challenging problems are easy and obvious .
" He tells you the story , and it sounds so simple .
Why do n't we have it today ?
Why is n't it here already ? "
It 's true .
Shai Agassi has only one car , no charging stations , and not a single customer — yet everyone who meets him already believes he can see the future .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The House on Wednesday voted 272- 152 to pass sweeping legislation that will offer up to $ 300 billion in assistance to troubled homeowners and throw government support behind mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The nearly 700 - page measure will now go back to the Senate , where final passage is expected .
It 's not clear when the vote will occur because of a Republican filibuster threat .
The legislation has won the support from key senators in both parties , and on President Bush withdrew his long - standing veto threat on Wednesday .
" The positive aspects of the bill are needed now to increase confidence and stability in the housing and financial markets , " White House spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
The legislation is the centerpiece of Washington 's efforts to address the nation 's housing meltdown .
" This is the most important piece of housing legislation in a generation , " said Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd , D - Conn. , who led the Senate 's efforts on the bill .
Critics find much to dislike about the multi-pronged plan .
They argue , for example , that the bill gives " a blank check " to the Treasury to spend on helping Fannie and Freddie , despite assurances from Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Democratic leaders that the authority granted Treasury by the bill is unlikely to be used .
Supporters note that while no one likes every provision in the bill , the housing crisis and market instability demand action .
" This is n't a perfect solution by any means , " said Rep. Barney Frank , D - Mass . , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
But , he added , it enjoys support from a broad and unlikely coalition , including bankers , housing advocates and governors and mayors struggling with the foreclosure crisis .
Over the past year , housing prices have fallen more than 15 % nationwide , according to the S&P / Case - Shiller Home Price Index .
More than 340,000 have had their homes repossessed by banks during the first six months of the year , up 136 % from the same period in 2007 .
The number of delinquent mortgage holders during the same period has risen to 1.4 million , up 56 % from a year earlier .
" Enactment of the bill is too politically important to both parties for either side to let the legislation die , " said Jaret Seiberg , a financial services analyst for the Stanford Group , a Washington policy research firm .
Boosting Fannie and Freddie
To help stabilize markets , which were shaken in the past few weeks by steep declines in the stock prices of Fannie Mae ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) , Treasury Secretary Paulson asked Congress on July 13 to give the Treasury power to provide a liquidity and capital " backstop " for the two companies .
Fannie and Freddie guarantee the purchase and trade of mortgages and own or back $ 5.2 trillion in mortgages .
The bill allows Treasury over the next 18 months to offer Fannie and Freddie an unlimited line of credit and the authority to buy stock in the companies if necessary .
Shares of Fannie closed 12 % higher and those of Freddie 9 % on Wednesday .
Fannie 's stock is down 79 % and Freddie 's 84 % over the past year .
" This [ backstop ] sends a signal ... to help calm the market , that we 'll not walk away , " said Sen .
Richard Shelby , R - Ala. , the lead Republican on the Senate Banking Committee .
Shelby , saying the country is " in a real crisis , " has long advocated for stricter oversight of Fannie and Freddie .
" I believe if we 'd pushed the GSE legislation four or five years ago , we would n't be here today , " he said .
Both critics and supporters of the Paulson plan have expressed concern that loaning or investing money in the companies could leave taxpayers with a fat bill to pay .
In a speech in New York on Tuesday , Paulson characterized the proposal as a way to support Fannie and Freddie and bolster the capital markets and economy .
" The best way to protect the taxpayer is to have very flexible powers which are temporary , " Paulson said .
While the bill sets parameters on the Treasury 's authority , it does n't necessarily force its hand , Seiberg said .
For instance , the measure requires the Treasury to take into consideration the need that it should be given priority over other GSE investors when it comes to being paid back .
But " consideration " means " the Treasury has discretion in what it can seek .
It does n't have to ensure it gets paid back first , " Seiberg said .
The Congressional Budget Office on Tuesday estimated the potential cost of a rescue could be $ 25 billion .
CBO said there is probably a better than 50 % chance that Treasury would not need to step in .
It also said there is a 5 % chance that Freddie and Fannie 's losses would cost the government $ 100 billion .
Helping at - risk borrowers
The bill also aims to help homeowners at risk of foreclosure and to bolster regulation of Fannie and Freddie .
Among other things , it would :
Increase the Federal Housing Administration 's role .
The FHA could insure up to $ 300 billion in new 30 - year fixed rate mortgages for at - risk borrowers in owner - occupied homes if lenders agree to write down loan balances to 90 % of the homes ' current appraised value .
Lenders would also agree to pay upfront fees to the FHA equal to 3 % of a home 's appraised value .
Borrowers must agree to pay an annual premium to the FHA equal to 1.5 % of their new loan balance .
They must also agree to share with the government any profit they realize from selling or refinancing .
The cost of the new FHA program - which would begin on Oct. 1 and be in place for just a few years - would be funded by fees from Fannie and Freddie .
While the bill authorizes the FHA to insure up to $ 300 billion in loans , the CBO estimates that the agency is only likely to insure up to $ 68 billion and help keep roughly 325,000 people in their homes .
Those estimates were based on the CBO 's assessment of who is likely to qualify under the program and who is likely to default and lose their home anyway despite being in the program .
Steve Preston , secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development , which oversees FHA , called the bill " a mixed bag . "
He said in a statement that the measure " ties our hands " by making it impossible for FHA to charge higher rates to riskier borrowers .
The bill calls for a 12 - month moratorium on so - called risk - based pricing for FHA loans .
" Now , FHA will be required to increase prices on all customers or eliminate its refinancing program for subprime borrowers at a time when they need it the most , " Preston said .
Establish a stronger regulator for the GSEs .
The new regulator will have a greater say over how well funded the agencies are - a major concern in the markets that has sent stocks in both companies plunging .
Permanently increase " conforming loan " limits .
The bill would permanently increase the cap on the size of mortgages guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie to a maximum of $ 625,000 from $ 417,000 .
The FHA maximum loan limits for high - cost areas would also increase to $ 625,000 .
Higher loan limits will make it easier for borrowers to get mortgages , because they 're more likely to be traded if they are considered conforming .
Create home - buyer credit .
The bill includes a tax refund for first - time home buyers worth up to 10 % of a home 's purchase price but no more than $ 7,500 .
The refund , however , serves more as an interest - free loan , since it would have to be paid back over 15 years in equal installments .
It would be reduced gradually for single filers with adjusted gross incomes above $ 75,000 and for joint filers with AGIs over $ 150,000 .
Bar down - payment assistance for FHA loans .
The bill eliminates a program that has allowed sellers to provide down payment assistance .
The seller - funded program is largely the reason why the agency 's reserve has fallen by $ 4.6 billion , according to FHA Commissioner Brian Montgomery .
Currently , that reserve is roughly $ 16.4 billion .
The bill would also increase to 3.5 % from 3 % the down payment requirement for borrowers getting FHA loans .
Create an affordable housing trust fund .
In the first three years of the FHA refinancing program , fees paid by Fannie and Freddie - based on a percentage of their new mortgage activity - would help defray potential government losses from loans that end in default .
The fees would later pay for a permanent fund to promote affordable housing .
Critics question , among other things , how Fannie and Freddie will be able to pay the fees if they are as undercapitalized as many say .
" It 's not only bad policy , it 's irresponsible , " said House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Spencer Bachus , R - Ala . , during the House floor debate Wednesday .
He noted that a year ago the GSEs had $ 106 billion in market capitalization and today they have roughly $ 20 billion .
Give grants to states to buy foreclosed properties .
The bill would grant $ 4 billion to states to buy up and rehabilitate foreclosed properties .
The funding had been opposed by the White House , which said it would benefit lenders and not homeowners .
But given the administration 's push to get a Fannie and Freddie rescue proposal in place quickly , Democratic leaders decided to keep the provision in the bill , sensing the president would n't kill the bill over it given its other priorities .

Code is a predator and I 'm its prey .
By Michel Arseneault
Dolbeau - Mistassini , Quebec
It is already 4 am , a little late for breakfast .
African immigrants make up the bulk of the region 's forestry workers
In a fiercely - lit canteen , dozens of forestry workers in oilskin jackets are swallowing eggs and ham .
It is a typical work - camp meal in northern Canada .
Yet these workers are not typical - most hail from Africa .
The loggers are employed by a forestry management company , Amenagement Myr , which is based in a town called Dolbeau - Mistassini , 300 km ( 186 miles ) north - west of Quebec City .
The company has hired some locals , but none are around .
They have all left the camp to spend a long weekend with their families in nearby towns and villages .
The Africans who work here do not take weekends off .
Montreal , where they have left wives and children behind , is not a weekend destination .
Driving there takes almost seven hours .
Raymond Bertrand Neabo , 28 , worked for a French bank in Yaounde , the capital of Cameroon , after graduating from university there .
After moving to Canada in 2006 , he found that prospective employers deemed his business administration degree useless .
So he started a second degree from scratch .
For him , logging is a well - paying summer job that has , however , forced him to leave his pregnant wife behind in Montreal .
" It 's very hard work , " he said in French .
" You can not get used to it .
It 's like winter . "
' Pay to learn '
Workers use brush cutters and power saws that look like oversized weed - whackers but roar like motorcycles , to " thin " the forest .
This means removing small deciduous trees , usually birch , to allow commercially valuable spruce and fir trees to thrive .
Life is tough away from home , and some get homesick
It is physically demanding work that many of the workers would never have done back home .
Many speak a polished French that conveys their urban , middle - class backgrounds .
Amenagement Myr initially hired a man from Ivory Coast in the late 1990s .
The word quickly spread in the African community that there was money to be made in the bush .
Now , the majority of the camp 's 90 employees are African - born .
Another local forest management company , Foresterie DLM , also primarily employs African immigrants .
After moving to Montreal , Thomas Shase , a 25 - year - old Nigerian , first started working in telemarketing , phoning resentful people who sometimes told him to " go back to Africa " .
He then heard about the forestry job .
" It 's hard , my brother , but it 's better than Montreal , " he said .
" The forest is peaceful .
You get to think .
But the best part is the money . "
At least these mosquitoes do n't give you malaria
Leonard Haninahazwa
From Burundi Amenagement Myr , who works under contract for AbitibiBowater Inc , one of the largest pulp and paper companies in the world , pays them $ 500 ( US $ 472 , £ 266 ) per hectare " thinned " .
This means that experienced brush cutters earn good money if they clear three or four hectares a week .
Beginners , however , do not earn good money .
" You pay to learn , " admits Mario Richard , who owns and runs Amenagement Myr .
Some locals have accused him of luring Africans to work as cheap labour .
" I pay everyone the same , " he says .
" Whether you 're black or white , green or yellow makes no difference to me as long as you can do the job . "
Mr Richard believes that his African employees have more stamina , noting that the overwhelming majority tough it out until the end of the season .
Homesick
By 5 am , the workers pile into a school bus that bumps along pot -holed forest roads and log bridges .
They have packed sandwiches , fresh fruit and pre-packaged desserts .
But there is a cap on everything .
The company says it is essential that no uneaten food be thrown out for fear of attracting black bears .
The work is physically demanding
What loggers most fear are snakes .
The land is covered in " slash " , the unwanted branches , tops and stumps that were removed during clear - cut logging operations more than a decade ago .
The garter snakes that live there are harmless , but workers remain watchful .
Mosquitoes are the real issue .
The loggers douse themselves with a powerful insect repellent supposed to protect them for six hours , but they sweat it off in an hour .
Burundian Leonard Haninahazwa tries to see the bright side .
" At least , " he remarks , " these mosquitoes do n't give you malaria . "
The bus drops the loggers off .
Within minutes , the brush cutters are whizzing and whirring .
These workers are in effect selecting the spruce trees that will be felled in 30 to 40 years .
If the brush wood is not cleared , it will take these trees twice as long to mature .
The school bus is back at the camp by 6.30 pm .
Visibly exhausted loggers fan out to their trailers .
After a quick shower they return to the canteen for an all - you - can - eat supper .
By 9 pm , those who are still awake are firing off e-mail messages on the one computer they can use .
Some workers look a little downcast .
One African , who declined to give his name , said he was homesick .
" In Montreal , my wife massages me every morning , " he said .
" Here , I only get massaged by the mosquitoes . "

What are these ?
Charlie Parker I : " Hot House "
By : Bernard Chazelle
America has produced many geniuses , none greater than Charlie ( Bird ) Parker .
Nobody plays bebop today , just as no one speaks Latin , but Bird and his associates wrote the grammar of modern jazz .
What you hear today in any jazz club is what bebop begat , its progeny .
Downbeat Magazine , a prominent jazz publication with a long , storied , racist tradition , awarded Bird and Dizzy Gillespie their annual trophies for 1951 .
" You boys got anything more to say ? "
Funny the " boys " have yet to utter a single word when they are asked if they have more to say .
Ain't too sure how people talked in the 50s but I bet Isaac Stern was never addressed as " You boy " by a conductor at Carnegie Hall .
This relentless lack of respect literally killed Charlie Parker , who shared with the likes of Mozart and Proust the inner certainty that he was a genius , yet one never satisfied with his work .
Like Mozart , he was blessed with a phenomenal musical memory .
He would read a long , complex score only once and memorize every chord change .
The only musician on earth Charlie Parker could not outplay was his idol and mentor , Art Tatum .
" Hot House " is based on a Cole Porter chord progression .
( Many bebop tunes were inspired by Broadway musicals . )
It adheres to the classical format of the genre .
First , you 've got the unison head ( 0:50 - 1:28 ) : a signature bebop device that ( IMHO ) must have been invented to dull your mind before the amazing solo hits you on the head !
( Mozart himself was no stranger to these borderline - manipulative games of contrast . )
Note how the pianist , Dick Hyman , completes Diz 's unresolved ending at 2:50 .
That 's a beautiful jazz tradition that you rarely ( never ? ) see in classical music .
Beginning at 3:30 , the drummer and the horns " trade fours " ( ie , they all take turns playing 4 bars ) .
Jazz was always terribly competitive .
Ruthlessly so .
Bird , no precocious prodigy , paid his dues the hard way .
Basie 's drummer , Jo Jones , nearly decapitated him after he'd screwed up a double - timing transition .
" I 'll be back , " muttered Bird to himself , " I 'll teach these cats . "
He did .
As they say in the Midwest , if you can make it in Kansas City , you can make it anywhere .
Behind the magic chemistry between Bird and Diz lay an intense rivalry .
Next to the self - indulgent , irresponsible genius that was Bird , Dizzy Gillespie was the calm , mature leader ( as well as a nonpareil virtuoso ) .
Trading fours in bebop was always understood as a dialogue ... or a wrestling match .
Pay attention closely and you 'll see how each musician responds to the previous one , or even to the one before that .
There is a hot unmoderated debate going on , of the kind you wo n't see in this election season .
The drummer , Charlie Smith , borrows techniques pioneered by Kenny Clarke and Max Roach .
He uses the ride and hi-hat ( the cymbaly thingies ) to mark the tempo while the bass drum is used for accents ( eg , dropping " bombs " ) and his snare ( the little table in front of him ) " chatters " along .
Bebop 's use of chord substitutions was a radical departure from the swing era , but never forget that the true revolution in bebop was rhythmic , not harmonic .
Around the time this video was recorded , Bird 's daughter , Pree , was born .
Two years later , she was dead of pneumonia .
Her death sent him into a tailspin from which he never recovered .
One botched suicide attempt and many shots of Scotch and heroin later , Charlie Parker died at the New York home of Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter ( an amazing woman I hope to blog about some day ) .
He was 34 .

In Part 2 , I will show you how to slice the design we did in part 1 .
After that , I will show you the important notes when we are coding a css / xhtml layout which compatible with wordpress structure .
Let ’s start .
Slicing ( Updated 7 Sept 08 )
Before we slice , we need to make sure what components we can replace them with css and which parts we need to slice out .
Also , consider the background images which we can only use a 1px width image and set it to repeat in background .
This will save more bandwidth and capacity while also increase the loading time .
Go to View > snap .
We need to make sure the slicer can auto snap to the edge of the object we need .
To select a slice tool , simply press on ‘ k ’ from the keyboard .
Video
Since the slicing steps are n’t clear , so I create this video for you .
I hope this short video can explain better .
Below are some shorcut keys if you are using PC :
K » Slice Tool
» Slice Tool Space Bar +
Mouse Drag »
Move the screen
» Move the screen CTRL + ALT + SHIFT + S » Save for web
When you are going to select the slices to save for web .
Space Bar +
Mouse Drag »
Move the screen
» Move the screen SHIFT + Left Click » Select multiple slices
Here , you may notice that I am going to save the layout images into PNG - 24 which is clearer but with a little increase of file size .
Repeated image
We use the header background as a repeated image .
In this case , we need to be very careful to slice out the border of two different colors .
Refer to the screen shot below .
Image Slices
For cutting a full image , we need to zoom in always .
Sometimes we need to zoom to maximum ( 1600 ) to get the best result .
For example :
CSS / HTML Coding
We need to figure out the main sections for the layout before we start .
Parts to be considered are :
Wrapper ( to hold the entire layout except footer ) Header ( for the header part including the page navigation ) Content ( to hold the posting area and also the sidebar ) Left - col ( for the posting area , comment section and respond section ) Right - col ( sidebar , RSS , about me and search field ) Footer ( footer )
Preparation
I am using DreamWeaver as the editor .
Before we start .
Create a stlye.css file and a index.html .
Place the code below before the title in the index.html .
< link rel=" stylesheet " href= " style.css " type =" text / css " media= " screen " />
Step 1 – Setting Up the Main structure
Below are the main containers for the layout .
I put the footer out of the wrapper for the full width for different resolution .
<!--wrapper--> < div id =" wrapper " >
<!-- content--> < div id =" content " >
<!-- left-col -->< div id =" left- col " ></div><!--left-col-end--> <!--right-col--><div id =" right- col " ></div><!--right-col-end--> </div><!--content-end-->
</div><!--wrapper-end-->
<!-- footer -->< div id =" footer " ></div><!--footer-end-->
Step 2 – Add In More Details Into Certain Section
Below are the main containers for the layout .
I put the footer out of the wrapper for the full width for different resolution .
<!--wrapper--> < div id =" wrapper " >
<!-- header --> < div id =" header " >
<!-- logo--> < div id =" logo " ><h1 ><!-- Logo link --></h1></div>
<!--logo-end--> <!--page-navigation--> < div id =" menu " > < ul > < li class= " page_item " >< a href= " # " >
Gallery </a></li> < li class= " page_item " >< a href= " # " >
Contact</a></li> < li class= " page_item " >< a href= " # " >
About </a></li><!-- we need to float this to the right , so , we need to make it in reverse way --> </ul > </div><!--page-navigation-->
</div><!--header-end--> <!--content--> < div id =" content " >
<!--left-col --> < div id =" left- col " >
<!-- featured - post-->< div id =" featured - post " ><!-- featured post will goes here --></div><!--featured-post-end-->

</div><!--sidebar-end-->
</div><!--right-col-end-->
</div><!--content-end-->
</div><!--wrapper-end-->
<!-- footer -->< div id =" footer " ></div ><!-- footer-end-->
Step 3 – CSS For The Main Containers
Below are the main containers for the layout .
I put the footer out of the wrapper for the full width for different resolution .
# wrapper { width : 960 px ; margin : 0 auto ; } #header { width : 960 px ; height : 100 px ; float : left ; } #content { width : 960 px ; float : left ; } #content # left - col { width : 600 px ; float : left ; position : relative ; padding - right : 30 px ; } #content # right - col { width : 330 px ; margin - top : 20 px ; float : left ; position : relative ; } #content # right - col # sidebar { width : 330 px ; float : left ; position : relative ; } # footer { width : 100 % ; float : left ; background : url( images / footer - bg.png ) repeat-x top left ; height : 23 px ; padding - top : 40 px ; color : # fff ; }
Step 4 – CSS For Page List
We know that the menu will stick to the right hand side .
In this case , the menu will be in descending order .
So , we need to float it right .
#header # menu { float : left ; width : 500 px ; margin - top : 38 px ; } #header # menu ul { width : 500 px ; list - style : none ; float : right ; text - align : right ; } #header #menu ul li.page_item { /* page_item is wordpress default class for page list */ float : right ; } #header # menu ul li.page_item a { padding : 4px 8 px ; display : block ; margin : 0 7px 0 0 ; float : left ; text - decoration : none ; font : 900 14px Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif ; color : # a9bf78 ; - moz - border - radius - topleft : 2 px ; - moz - border - radius - topright : 2 px ; } #header # menu ul li.page_item a :hover { color : # fff ; } #header #menu ul li.current_page_item a { /* current_page_item is wordpress default class for active page list */ color : # fff ; background - color : # 2c4106 ; }
Step 5 – Sidebar Structure
WordPress have a default sidebar structure .
It is design to fit all the widget you are going to use in the future .
The widget you apply will start in the second level of the list .
<!--sidebar--> < div id =" sidebar " >< h3 > Sidebar </h3 > <!--sidebar1--> < div id =" sidebar1 " > < ul > < li ><h2 > Category </ h2 > < ul ><!-- the widget will start at the second level of the list --> < li></li> </ul > </li > < li ><h2 > Links </h2 > < ul > < li></li> </ul > </li > </ul > </div><!--sidebar1-end-->
</div><!--sidebar-end-->
Step 6 – CSS For Sidebar Structure
WordPress have a default sidebar structure .
It is design to fit all the widget you are going to use in the future .
The widget you apply will start in the second level of the list .
# sidebar ul { list - style : none ; } # sidebar1 { float : left ; width : 160 px ; padding - right : 10 px ; } # sidebar2 { float : left ; width : 160 px ; } #sidebar ul { } # sidebar ul li { float : left ; width : 158 px ; background - color : # d7d39a ; border : 1 px solid # bbb875 ; margin - bottom : 10 px ; } # sidebar ul li h2 { /* this is the widget title */ padding : 3 px 4px 6 px ; font : 400 18px Arial , Helvetica , sans - serif ; color : # 4c6b0d ; } #sidebar ul li ul { } # sidebar ul li ul li { /* begin for the widget list */ float : left ; width : 158 px ; border : 0 ; margin - bottom : 0 ; } #sidebar ul li ul li a { border - top : 1 px solid # bbb875 ; float : left ; width : 150 px ; text - decoration : none ; color : # 5d5b35 ; padding : 2px 4 px ; } # sidebar ul li ul li a : hover { color : # fff ; background - color : # bbb875 ; }
Step 7 – Comment Section For the Single Page
Below is the comment section .
<!--comments--> < div id =" comments " > < h3 id =" comment - title " > Comments </h3 > < ol > < li > < div class= " comment - data " ><!-- the left comment box for the content --> < p><!-- comment goes here --></p> </div > < div class= " comment - info " ><!-- the right hand side for the commentor gravatar and info --> <!-- author avatar --> < br />< strong >< a href= " # " ><!-- author name --></a></strong><br
/><!--date--> </div> </li > < li class = " alt " ><!-- the alternative style for the comment box --> < div class= " comment - data " >

/><!--date--> </div> </li > </ ol > </div><!--comments-end-->
Step 8 – CSS For Comment Section
I am not going to show the single page structure here because it is actually similar to the index page .
but I do showing you the comment section .
#comments { margin - top : 15 px ; float : left ; width : 600 px ; } h3 # comment - title { background : url( images/comments.png ) no -repeat top left ; width : 600 px ; float : left ; text - indent : - 9999em ; padding - top : 5 px ; } #comments ol , #comments ol li { float : left ; width : 600 px ; list - style : none ; padding : 0 ; } #comments ol li .comment - data { float : left ; width : 478 px ; margin - right : 10 px ; background - color : # d7d39a ; padding : 5 px 10 px ; min-height : 120 px ; _height : 120 px ; /* an IE6 hack */ overflow : auto ; border : 1 px solid # c1bd85 ; } #comments ol li.alt . comment - data { float : left ; width : 478 px ; margin - right : 10 px ; background - color : # eae8c6 ; padding : 5 px 10 px ; min-height : 120 px ; border : 1 px solid # c1bd85 ; _height : 120 px ; /* an IE6 hack */ overflow : visible ; margin - top : - 1 px ; margin - bottom : - 2 px ; } #comments ol li . comment - info { width : 90 px ; float : left ; text - align : right ; font - size : 10 px ; line - height : 12 px ; } #comments ol li .comment - info a img { border : 0 ; margin - bottom : 5 px ; } #comments ol li .comment - info a { text - decoration : none ; }

Multiple US officials : Sorority obsession seen in anthrax case Associated Press
Published : Monday August 4 , 2008
Print This Email This
One of the biggest mysteries surrounding the anthrax scare of 2001 - why the anthrax - laced letters were dropped off at a mailbox in New Jersey - may be connected to a sorority chapter at Princeton University .
Bruce Ivins ' decades - long obsession with the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority could link the former Army biowarfare scientist to the four anthrax - laced letters , authorities said Monday .
Still , authorities acknowledge they cannot place Ivins in Princeton the day the anthrax was mailed .
And the curious explanation connecting the scientist and a sorority is unlikely to satisfy his friends and former co-workers who question what motive the married father of two might have had for unleashing the attack .
Ivins , 62 , killed himself last week as the Justice Department prepared to indict him on capital murder charges for the deaths of five people who were poisoned by the anthrax in the weeks following 9/11 .
His attorney maintains he would have been proven innocent were he still alive .
Leroy Richmond , a former postal worker in Washington who was stricken with anthrax , said Tuesday that he has been invited to attend an FBI briefing that it is scheduled for Thursday .
The mailbox just off the campus of Princeton University where the letters were mailed sits about 100 yards away from where the college 's Kappa Kappa Gamma chapter stores its rush materials , initiation robes and other property .
Sorority members do not live there , and the Kappa chapter at Princeton does not provide a house for the women .
Multiple U.S. officials told The Associated Press that Ivins was obsessed with Kappa Kappa Gamma , going back as far as his own college days at the University of Cincinnati when he apparently was rebuffed by a woman in the sorority .
The officials all spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the case publicly .
There is nothing to indicate Ivins was focused on any one sorority member or other Princeton student , the officials said .
Instead , officials said , Ivins ' e-mails and other documents detail his long - standing fixation on the organization .
An adviser to the Kappa Kappa Gamma chapter at Princeton , Katherine Breckinridge Graham , said Monday she was interviewed by FBI agents " over the last couple of years " about the case .
She said she could not provide any details about the interview because she signed an FBI nondisclosure form .
However , Graham said there was nothing to indicate that any of the sorority members had anything to do with Ivins .
" Nothing odd went on , " said Graham , an attorney and Kappa alumna .
Kappa Kappa Gamma executive director Lauren Paitson , reached at the sorority 's headquarters in Columbus , Ohio , initially told an AP reporter Monday afternoon she would provide a comment shortly .
She did not answer subsequent phone messages or e-mails seeking that response .
Had he lived , authorities had planned to argue that Ivins could have made the seven - hour round trip to Princeton from the Fort Detrick lab in Frederick , Md. , after work .
One official said investigators were working off the theory that Ivins chose to mail the letters from outside the sorority 's Princeton chapter to confuse the government if he ever were to emerge as a suspect in the case .
Kappa Kappa Gamma also has chapters at colleges in Maryland , Pennsylvania and Washington .
Princeton University referred questions about Ivins to the FBI .
The university does not formally recognize sororities and fraternities , but chapters operate off campus .
Local police in both Princeton Borough and Princeton Township said Ivins ' name did not turn up on any incident reports or restraining orders .
Details about Ivins ' alleged obsession with the sorority will be spelled out in court documents that could be made public as early as Tuesday .
The Justice Department is expected to decide soon whether to end the " Amerithrax " investigation by concluding Ivins acted alone in carrying out the attacks that killed five and sickened 17 .
Even the government officials acknowledged the sorority connection is a strange one , and it's not likely to ease concerns by Ivins ' friends and former co-workers who are skeptical about the case against him .
Ivins ' attorney , Paul F. Kemp , did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment Monday but has asserted his client 's innocence and said he would have been vindicated in court .
At least some of Ivins ' former colleagues , as well as others who want to see the FBI 's still - secret evidence , question whether he could have created the powder form of the deadly toxin without co-workers noticing .
Law enforcement officials familiar with the case said Ivins borrowed freeze - drying equipment from a bioweapons lab in 2001 that was used by scientists to convert wet anthrax spores into a powder similar to that sent to journalists and lawmakers in the weeks after the September 2001 terror attacks .
Not commonly used by researchers at the Fort Detrick , Md. , lab where Ivins worked , the drying unit - known as a lyopholizer - was lent to Ivins ' unit after he went through a formal process to check it out .
While in his possession , Ivins apparently tackled a project for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency .
Law enforcement officials , who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the inquiry , said the documents Ivins created during the check out process and in his experiments are being mined for proof that he might have used it to powderize anthrax spores .
In August 2002 , investigators announced they 'd found anthrax spores inside the mailbox on Nassau Street , Princeton 's main thoroughfare .
FBI agents immediately began canvassing the town , showing residents a photograph of Army scientist Steven J. Hatfill , who at the time was a key " person of interest " in the case .
That theory fell flat and this June , the Justice Department exonerated Hatfill and agreed to a $ 5.8 million settlement with him .
In the past year , the FBI has turned its attention to Ivins , whom a therapist said had a history of homicidal and sociopathic thoughts .
Social worker Jean C. Duley won a protective order against Ivins on July 24 after telling a judge the scientist was a homicidal sociopath .
Duley , 45 , also has a minor criminal record , according to court records .
She pleaded guilty in April to driving under the influence and was fined $ 500 and placed on probation for nearly a year .
In October 2006 , she pleaded guilty to reckless driving and was fined $ 580 .
A 1992 charge of possessing drug paraphernalia was dismissed .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Oil rose more than $ 4 a barrel on Wednesday after U.S. government data showed an unexpected drop in gasoline stocks as suppliers facing weak consumer demand cut production and imports .
U.S. crude settled up $ 4.58 at $ 126.77 a barrel after falling to $ 120.42 on Tuesday , the lowest level since May 6 .
London Brent crude rose $ 4.39 to settle at $ 127.10 a barrel .
U.S. gasoline stocks fell by 3.5 million barrels last week , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration , countering analyst calls for a 200,000 - barrel build .
“ The gasoline data showed a stronger demand than expected and support at $ 120 held , causing crude futures to rally , ” said Phil Flynn , analyst at Alaron Trading .
The EIA report also showed U.S. crude oil stocks dropped by 100,000 barrels , lower than analysts forecasts , while distillate stocks rose 2.4 million barrels , more than expected .
Additional support came from U.S. refinery problems , with BP cutting rates at its Texas City , Texas , plant due to mechanical problems .
Top U.S. refiner Valero plans to cut gasoline production by an average of 330,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) in the third quarter at its 16 plants .
“ The combination of several refinery issues is supporting gasoline , along with bullish gasoline inventory data , ” said Tom Bentz , analyst at BNP Paribas Commodity Futures Inc , adding short covering was also fueling the gains .
Oil has plunged from a record $ 147.27 hit on July 11 in the steepest drop from a high since early 2007 , pressured by signs that costly fuel and wider economic problems are curbing demand , especially in the United States
Strong growth from emerging economies like China has stretched poor supply growth over the past six years , launching a rally that sent crude up sevenfold at its peak .
Further strength has come from investors buying commodities as a hedge against inflation and the weak dollar , tensions between Iran and the West , and supply disruptions .
Iran ’s supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , said on Wednesday Tehran would pursue its nuclear path despite a deadline set by world powers in the dispute over Tehran ’s nuclear program .
Western powers gave Iran two weeks from July 19 to respond to their offer to hold off on imposing more U.N. sanctions on Iran if the OPEC member would freeze any expansion of its nuclear work .
In Nigeria , Africa ’s top oil producer , Royal Dutch Shell , declared force majeure on Bonny Light exports after militants blew up parts of a key pipeline earlier this week .
Militant attacks have disrupted supplies from the OPEC nation this year , pushing up oil prices .
This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
I ’m a multifarious geek .
I read a lot , I ’m addicted to learning , I write extensively ( even professionally ) , I run an open source operating system on my laptop , I program , I theorize about ethics , I play RPGs , I play at an electric bass , and I make occasional attempts to change the world with logic and reason , one mind at a time — among other geeky pursuits .
A common thread through all these things is the hacker ‘s impulse .
I like to examine , tinker with , and understand stuff .
I like to change stuff to suit my preferences and beliefs , to learn , and just for the sheer joy of it .
I seek to innovate and improve in pretty much all things , including the state of my own mind .
This has a pretty significant impact on the way I think about roleplaying games .
Some people use such games mainly as a way to escape the concerns of mundane , everyday life for a few hours now and then ; some as a response to a creative drive akin to that of a compulsory sketcher ; some as a way to act out fantasies ; and some for other reasons as well .
I ’m sure I subscribe to most , if not all , such common motivations — but I am also motivated by my urge to hack , to fiddle , to experiment , learn , and improve , and even to write RPG related software .
As a result , it does n’t take me long once I ’ve started playing a game to start thinking about how I can change , add , or subtract rules to improve on what I see as flaws in the game mechanics .
My recent SOB entry on Special Item Advancement — a means of dealing with magic items such that they advance with the character in a fairly believable ( in terms of in - game justification ) and well balanced fashion — should be a pretty good indicator of that .
Of course , the irony of this is that , generally speaking , the way one introduces house rules to an RPG is by running the game as its GM .
Meanwhile , the changes I make are changes that suit what I would like to be a part of the game if I were playing it .
Other GMs tend to be a little more reticent to incorporate such changes , sometimes because their vision of the game is different , other times because they do n’t want to have to deal with incorporating variant rules and are happy enough with flaws in the rules they may never have even noticed before , and still other times because they might actually believe that the only way to play the game is strictly according to canon , as presented in the books , with no exceptions .
Regardless of the reasons , the end result is that — as much as I ’d love to be able to play character concepts that are inspired or enabled , or perhaps just subtly enhanced in their depth and playability , by my own variant rules — I often have to settle for experiencing these enhancements from a player ’s perspective only vicariously , through the people who play the games I run .
It is the core irony of the hacker GM , I suppose .
Some variant rules , of course , significantly alter the flavor and game play experience .
Such variants may be wholly inappropriate for some games , and I do n’t begrudge that .
For instance , it looks like my SigO will start running a Pathfinder RPG campaign from one of Paizo ’s Adventure Paths within the next few weeks — and while I ’d dearly love to play a particular character concept ( his name is Baran Cole ) with the rules I cooked up for special item advancement , that set of rules is probably wholly inappropriate for that adventure path .
On the other hand , some critical hit rules I cooked up should be able to fit in quite well , if the GM ’s amenable to it .
I spec out new rules systems for fun — and , ironically , I do n’t usually get to experience them as a player .
I guess it ’s funny how things work out .
His name is Chen Jun .
He ’s 18 - years - old .
And he was captured this morning in rural Anhui province , hundreds of kilometers from Shanghai .
Some , actually most , facts are vague :
In addition to cash and a laptop computer police say belonged to the victim Diana O’Brien , Chen was allegedly carrying “ a weapon . ”
We ’re also somewhat puzzled by this sentence : “ The statement said police narrowed down suspects to Chen after they received reports that a medium - sized man was spotted riding a bicycle near the victim ’s residence . ”
Police tracked this medium - sized Chinese man with a bicycle from Shanghai to Zhejiang to Anhui .
The Shanghai Daily story says
Chen confessed to the murder and claimed it was a robbery gone bad , which basically falls right in line with how police framed the incident from the first time they spoke on the matter .
The story also says Chen could have at one time worked at a restaurant near O’Brien ’s apartment complex , reported to be Jinseng Plaza , 490 Zhaohua Road ( which seems to be in Xuhui District , not Changning District , or Chongming Island , as was previously reported ) .
We also learn that O’Brien “ was found stabbed to death in her apartment building ’s stairwell ” early Monday morning .
We hope more pieces of the investigation puzzle will arrive soon .
Foreign media all seem to have the same vague details so far .
You can find two Chinese TV reports here and here .

" Squid Suckers : The Little Monster That Feed the Beast , " by Jessica D. Schiffman and Caroline L. Schauer / Drexel University / Science , Honorable Mention
Every year the National Science Foundation and the journal Science pick the best images taken with advanced technology ( like electron microscopes ) to convey images to scientific concepts .
These photos are always stunning , and this year 's photos are no different .
This one above is a close up of squid suckers :
Little Shop of Horrors fans may see a resemblance to the bloodthirsty plant from the 1986 movie in the above electron micrograph image .
Drexel University doctoral student Jessica Schiffman won an honorable mention in photography in the 2008 International Science and Engineering Visualization Challenge for capturing what 's actually an array of suckers found on the tentacles of a long - finned squid .
Each sucker -- about 400 micrometers wide , or a little smaller than the width of a human hair -- is surrounded with " fangs " of chitin , a hard organic material .
Squid use their powerful suckers to secure unwitting prey and feed their robust appetites -- much like the horror - movie plant that inspired the image 's color scheme .
Here are the winners of the Best Science images of 2008 at National Geographic : Link - Thanks Marilyn Terrell !

Liar Nation : Finally Reaping What We Have Sown ( September 16 , 2008 )
The operant phase of this nation in this decade : " Take the ' con , ' Captain ! "
It 's all too easy to be distracted and confused by the complexity of the financial unraveling which now transfixes our craven media and politicos , but the underlying cause is really very simple : we have become a nation of liars , and no one cares .
We have candidates for the highest office of the land pronouncing their deep religious faith , yet not one candidate has expressed any outrage at the ubiquity , the pervasiveness , the crassness of the nation 's reliance on lies or the incalculable harm perpetrated by the lies which have formed the very bedrock of the debt / credit bubble which is now , at long last , finally imploding .
Lying is now accepted as the norm and elicits bored yawns .
Hillary ducking machine gun fire as she deplaned - - a lie , but oh well , she " misspoke . "
Now we have Palin and McCain claiming Governor Palin eschewed Federal " earmarked " pork spending , only to read that the Wall Street Journal checked the record and found , ahem , the two candidates " misspoke , " i.e. lied .
Palin's Project List Totals $ 453 Million Last week , Republican presidential candidate Sen. John McCain said his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , had n't sought earmarks or special - interest spending from Congress , presenting her as a fiscal conservative .
But state records show Gov. Palin has asked U.S. taxpayers to fund $ 453 million in specific Alaska projects over the past two years .
Here is a brief rundown of the financial implosion sweeping the nation : 1 . Appraisers routinely overstated the value of real estate : they lied .
2 . Realtors sold properties they knew were overvalued and / or risky to buyers they knew were not qualified : they lied .
3 . Mortgage brokers withheld negative information from buyers ' mortgage applications to guarantee loan approval : they lied .
4 . Applicants exaggerated their income and understated their liabilities on their mortgage applications : they lied .
5 . Investment banks gamed the risk assessment guidlines to package risky mortgages as " safe " mortgage - backed securities and derivatives : they lied .
6 . In order to earn huge fees , the ratings agencies accepted these fraudulently packaged and represented securities as " safe , low risk " AAA - rated investments : they lied .
7 . The investment banks then sold the securities to investors worldwide as " safe " investments : they lied .
8 . Banks and other financial institutions " misrepresented " the true risks of their holdings by secreting " level 3 " assets and derivatives off their balance sheets or hiding them in footnotes : they lied .
9 . Federal regulators claimed their oversight and enforcement was rigorous : they lied .
10 .
Congresspeople who accepted millions in campaign contributions from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stated that their goverance of those two entities was unaffected by these vast pools of lobbying funds : they lied .
11 . Former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan stated repeatedly that the system was robust and safe , even suggesting homeowners choose adjustable - rate mortgages over 30 - year fixed - rate mortgages : he lied .
12 . CEO after CEO has stated most emphatically that the financial institution which he / she led was financially sound and adequately capitalized : they lied .
13 . Investment bankers game the U.S. tax code to save their non-U.S. clientele from the terrible indignity of paying U.S. taxes , and then they claim their scams are " legal " : they lied .
I could go on , but you get the point : the entire financial edifice of the U.S. is built on lies , and requires lies at every point and every level to continue generating outsized profits for the real estate , lending and investment banking " industries . "
It 's all based on lies .
All of it .
This " prosperity " could not have existed without lies by every player on every level and the " turning a blind eye " to the fraud and lies by our leadership , elected , " spiritual " and financial .
Our mainstream media and political establishment have become expert in the art of cloaking lies with innocent - sounding synonyms and phrases : misspoke , mis-stated , cannot recall , was tired , etc .
This mockery of the truth can be traced back to Watergate and the Reagan administration , which learned the lesson of Watergate all too well : prevaricate , fabricate , claim forgetfulness , mince words , and basically do whatever is necessary to skirt the truth and protect your position : lie , in other words , without appearing too blatantly to be lying .
Even Ronnie claiming that his uniformly dark hair was undyed at 80 years of age was a blatant lie , and though it might be claimed it was merely a lie of vanity , the erosion of the truth starts precisely in the so - called " innocent " or " white " lie .
Note to a supposedly " religious " nation : there are no " innocent " lies .
If someone is dying of a dread disease , their family may choose to lie about their approaching fate , but even this well - intentioned lie is not innocent .
I was raised in what now seems a very simplistic religious belief : that a lie was wrong , regardless of the definition of " is . "
What causes people who claim to be infused with deep religious beliefs to lie , not just once but habitually , as a matter of course , even founding their immensely profitable business on the constant shading , cloaking and manipulation of the truth , without any qualms ?
We are constantly brow - beaten by a zealously political " evangelical " movement which bases its authority on its religious beliefs , yet this purportedly " religious " movement has stood by silently as blatant fraud and lies have corroded the nation 's character and economy .
Many of the most self - congratulatory mega-churches in this nation have effectively cast wealth acquisition into a characteristic more desirable than simple personal integrity .
Did the entire edifice of lies metasticize only in godless , heathen liberal havens like San Francisco ?
No , it blossomed and grew in " conservative " states like Florida , Arizona and Utah , and " conservative " counties in California ( Orange County , for instance ) .
Yet what political or religious leader has chosen to recognize this deep moral rot at the very center of the nation 's finances , and speak not just to the lies , fraud and moral bankruptcy of Congress and the banking industry , but of the lies , fraud and moral bankruptcy practiced by many in their own congregations ?
The Empire of Fraudulent Debt that is finally unraveling was built not just on the lies of ratings agencies , accountants , tax attorneys and investment bankers , but on the lies of countless home buyers , realtors , appraisers and mortgage brokers - - " regular " Americans who consciously threw away any pretence of following the 10 Commandments and sacrificed any pretense of personal honor and intregity by lying , choosing to mask the lies behind the polite screens of " it 's only a little lie , " " everybody 's doing it , " " it 's just business , " etc .
Note to a supposedly religious nation : you cannot parse lies into " acceptable because it 's just business " and unacceptable lies ( adultery , stealing from the church donations , etc . )
A lie is a lie .
My family was and is deeply religious ; my father 's uncle was a missionary in Africa , where he gave his life to that cause , and my father 's siblings were all born in Central America , where his parents served as lay ministers for many years .
The truly religious person is humble about their faith and about their superiority , for they are keenly aware of their faults and sins and do not attempt to mask or hide their failings behind fine - sounding words .
How low we have sunk as nation , not just of Christians , but Jews , Muslims , Hindus , Buddhists and other faiths that so few community , political and financial leaders of any faith have spoken directly and openly to the moral rot at the very center of the American financial system .
Even if a person has no religious faith , there are deep moral , philosophic and even practical reasons to value personal integrity and the trust which is built on the truth and only the truth , unmediated by lies , prevarications , footnotes , excuses , half - truths , exaggerations , faulty memory , and convoluted legalistic definitions of simple moral concepts like telling the truth or lying .
Note to a supposedly religious nation : if you 're really pious and religious , keep the pronouncements to yourself and act out your faith by telling the truth in all things and in all times and places .
Live your faith by denouncing lies wherever you find them in public life , even if the liar claims to share your beliefs , and even if you stand to benefit financially from the lies being foisted off as " the truth , sort of . "
In a simple phrase : shut up about how moral you are and stop lying : on your taxes , and on everything else , too .
Do n't just accept , but celebrate the collapse of a national financial system based solely and precariously on systemic lies and cloaking of the truth .
Then tell us how religious you are .
As the rotten , morally corrupt financial edifice that is the U.S. financial system collapses under the groaning weight of our collective lies and our silence in the face of those lies , it is a good time to ponder Lincoln 's Second Inaugural speech .
Though he spoke of the great sin of slavery , his words could just as well describe the coming cost of our financial perfidy :
Yet , if God wills that it continue , until all the wealth piled by the bond - man 's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk , and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash , shall be paid by another drawn with the sword , as was said three thousand years ago , so still it must be said " the judgments of the Lord , are true and righteous altogether " .
It is unpopular to " call out " financial lies because we have all benefitted , if not directly then tangentally , from the House of Lies being " sold " as trustworthy ; our own properties have risen ( until recently ) greatly in nominal value , our 401K and public pension funds have grown , our bond funds have swollen as Bill Gross begged and pleaded for a public bailout of his private capital , our mortgage rate dropped , and so on , ad nauseum .
There will be a cost to perpetrating a national House of Lies and bailing it out with taxpayer 's money : the default of the U.S. government .
It can't happen , you say ?
The gummit has to send me my Social Security checks , pay my Medicare bills and send me the interest on my T - Bills .
No , it does n't .
Check in again in October 2012 and let 's see how the Empire of Lies and Debt is doing .
Remember , there are myriad ways to default .
One way is to magically reconstitute a " new dollar " which is worth 5 % of its previous value .
On Friday , your $ 20 is worth whatever $ 20 will buy ; on Monday , it will buy 95 % less .
But there was no default .
That 's how the Empire of Lies and Debt " works . "
Rest assured , we shall reap what we have sown .
New essay on leadership by Chris Sullins : First , Do No Harm
Reader Comments Harun I . I found this quote from one of your readers interesting :  Palin is attractive because she comes across as honest and principled . 
This is vaporous soliloquy .
This is tantamount to saying she seems like a nice person .
Every despotic dictator who has dragged the world down through the muck and mire of war truly believed themselves to honest and principled .
Memories are short .
Bush Jr. too seemed honest and principled but his extreme ideological views have not yielded anything remotely conservative or republican .
His honest and principled ideologically driven persona has yielded the worst consequence of character in a person wielding great power in a very complex and fluid environment : inflexibility .
If voters truly wanted real change in terms of small government and fiscal responsibility and a regard for Constitutional law then Ron Paul would be on the Republican ticket .
Choosing the aptly assessed Palin / McCain ticket is a vote for the same or worse .
It is absolutely sickening and pathetic that McCain will for the most part make no appearances on without her .
Obama is truly running against Palin !
We have had over 19 months to gain some perspective about Obamas quality of character and his ideas on important issues but there was one telling moment :
Beside the fact that he thought the better of the Iraq war , his response to the Georgia / Russian conflict was thoughtful and measured .
In contrast McCain who has been around for 25 years responded with threats .
Palins response merely parrots the party line .
Most Americans were not served well by the media during this brief conflict because they thought they knew that Russia drew first blood , this is not true .
But I digress ; in contrast to Obama what is known and what will be known about Palin will have to be assessed in a few short weeks .
I really do not care much about experience .
One never knows how he or his teammates will perform in combat .
I do care about her responses to questions on important issues and so far those answers are unacceptable to truly discerning people .
In this complex world economics and foreign policy need to be a Presidents strong points .
Diplomacy is prime ; war is the last resort .
Emotion and rhetoric are not primitive limbic responses , they are tools used carefully to bring about a desired affect .
Having an ideology that sees things as black and white , good and evil is counterproductive and potentially dangerous as we have found out with the sitting President .
Neither ticket has the answers so the question becomes who would you rather see take the fall ?
John S. I also agree with you that unless the American public in general feels the pain in their daily lives , there will not be much of an action to speak of .
Although I am afraid that it will be too late by then ....
I like your advise of taking care of our financial situation to prepare our self of the pending economic crisis .
I think you are giving Palin too much credit and too little credit to John McCain .
I truly believe he is a Maverick and is going along with the show to get into the white house .
Once there , I think he will pursue what is right in his mind not the party 's .
If he can endure 5 years of POW imprisonment , he can pretty much endure anything ...
Also as an afterthought , how knowledgeable are you of the Soviet Union 's downfall ?
Here is a prime example I wonder if any lessons can be learned from the Soviet 's in the last decade ....
Just a thought .
Good points , Harun and John , thank you .
There is an interesting book on the parallels , real and imagined , between the USSR and the US : Reinventing Collapse : The Soviet Example and American Prospects by Dmitri Orlov I also recommend two excellent descritions of the culture of fraud and lying in our financial system : Greed , Fraud & Ignorance : A Subprime Insider 's Look at the Mortgage Collapse

New Book Notes :
My new " little book of big ideas , " Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis is now available on amazon.com for $ 10.99 .
" Charles Hugh Smith 's Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis is one of the most important business analyses I have ever read .
It is the first to squarely face converging global crises from a business perspective : peak oil , climate change , resource depletion , and the junction of key social cycles will radically alter the business landscape in coming decades .... "
An excerpt from Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis : 3 . The Kondratieff Cycle suggests that the global asset bubbles which are just starting to deflate have a long way to go before the next cycle of financially healthy / stable growth can begin .
( Those who seek evidence of a global explosion of debt which marks the Kondratieff Cycle 's peak , please examine the charts to the right . )
The Kondratieff Cycle captures the cyclical nature of debt accumulation through excessive borrowing , and the inevitability of debt repudiation as the end - state of that extreme leverage / euphoria , which is then renounced in a lengthy crash / depression that lays the foundation for a new cycle of productive growth .
What is truly unprecedented is that this low point ( which typically corresponds to global depression ) coincides with a global crisis in energy supply and a demographic time - bomb in which the retired / elderly are so numerous that there will soon be only two or three workers for every retiree in an era of double - digit growth in healthcare costs .
No asset class which has experienced a bubble - - real estate , stocks , non-energy commodities and even bonds -- will be spared from severe depreciation as assets are sold to fund retirements and as the global " glut of savings " / low - cost lending of surplus dollars dries up in a global consumer recession / depression .
Pensions both public and private which were once considered well - funded will be revealed as woefully underfunded and unable to pay out the benefits and pensions which were expected .
As capital pools and consumer spending both contract , government 's ability to borrow or raise ever - larger sums from taxation will decline even as demands for promised entitlements increases sharply in both developed and developing nations .
" This guy is THE leading visionary on reality .
He routinely discusses things which no one else has talked about , yet , turn out to be quite relevant months later . "

AirJelly houses two lithium - ion polymer accumulator batteries rated at 8 V and 400 mA , which can be completely charged in half an hour and are AirJelly 's sole source of power .
A connected central electric drive unit transmits the force to a bevel gear wheel and then to eight spur gears in sequence .
These gears power eight shafts , each of which activates a crank ; these in turn move the jellyfish 's eight tentacles .
Each tentacle is designed as a structure with Fin Ray Effect®- a construction derived from the functional anatomy of a fish 's fin .
The actual structure consists of two alternating tension and pressure flanks movably connected by ribs .
If a flank is subjected to pressure , the geometrical structure automatically bendsin the direction of the applied force .
Together , the tentacles produce a peristaltic forward motion similar to that of their biological model .
Yes , you just saw FOX News ’ Megyn Kelly standing up to McCain surrogate and chronic idiot Tucker Bounds on his inability to stay on subject , and his useless attacks on Obama .
I never thought I ’d see the day when a FOX News reporter stood against McCain attacking Obama ( O’ Reilly ’s half - assed remarks of a week ago fell on deaf ears [ literally , considering his audience ] ) , but it seems that even America ’s least fair - and - balanced news network has decided that McCain is a terrible candidate .
It had been reported that Rupert Murdoch , owner of News Corp which presides over FOX News , recently took a liking to Barack Obama .
However , his comments were outweighed by the director of FOX News programming , conservative Roger Ailes , who said FOX News would not be “ in the tank for [ Obama ] like CNN and MSNBC . ”
Roger Ailes , if you had n’t guessed from that quote , is not a very smart man , especially since he made that comment to Obama ’s face .
But apparently FOX News , or at least Megyn Kelly , is trying to turn over a new leaf by actually challenging both sides for once .
We ’ll see how long that lasts , but in the meantime , I ’m enjoying it .
Cynic Finishes Mixing New Album
Band Photo : Cynic ( ?)
CYNIC drummer Sean Reinert has issued the following update :
“ We are currently finishing up mixing the last two songs for the new CYNIC album with Warren Riker and could not be happier .
It is really sounding amazing .
I ’m loving my drum sound !
Paul ’s [ Masvidal , guitar / vocals ] guitar tones are really killer .
[ Sean ] Malone [ bass ] came down from Missouri for four days and tracked some great bass and stick lines .
Tymon [ Kruidenier , guitar / vocals ] arrived [ from Holland ] last weekend and is now part of the fold .
His growls and guitars are sounding sick !!
We ’ve been in a Glendale studio for almost 4 1 / 2 weeks now and yet I feel like we ’ve been here a year !
After we finish tomorrow night we will sit and live with the songs for a week before proceeding on to mastering .
Right after that we start our rehearsals for the summer European mini - tour so keep a lookout for dates . ”
Observations from NASA ’s Cassini spacecraft have been used to build , for the first time , a 3 - D picture of the sources of intense radio emissions in Saturn ’s magnetic field , known as the Saturn Kilometric Radiation ( SKR ) .
Saturn Kilometric Radiation is the most intense component of radio emissions from Saturn .
It was discovered by NASA ’s Voyager spacecraft in 1980 .
The radio emissions have frequencies between about 10 kilohertz and 1.2 megahertz .
This corresponds to the Long Wave and Medium Wave broadcasting bands .
The results were presented by Dr Baptist Cecconi , of LESIA , Observatoire de Paris , at the European Planetary Science Congress on Tuesday 23rd September .
The SKR radio emissions are generated by high - energy electrons spiralling around magnetic field lines threaded through Saturn ’s auroras .
Previous Cassini observations have shown that the SKR is closely correlated with the intensity of Saturn ’s UV aurora and the pressure of the solar wind .
Projection of radio sources onto plane perpendicular to line between Cassini and the centre of Saturn .
The measurements were made using Cassini ’s Radio and Plasma Wave Science ( RPWS ) experiment .
“ The animation shows radio sources clustered around curving magnetic field lines .
Because the radio signals are beamed out from the source in a cone - shape , we can only detect the sources as Cassini flies through the cone .
When Cassini flies at high altitudes over the ring planes , we see the sources clearly clustered around one or two field lines .
However , at low latitudes we get more refraction and so the sources appear to be scattered , ” said Dr Cecconi .
The model found that the active magnetic field lines could be traced back to near - polar latitudes degrees in both the northern and southern hemisphere .
This matches well with the location of Saturn ’s UV aurora .
“ For the purposes of the model , we ’ve imagined a screen that cuts through the middle of Saturn , set up at right - angles to the line between Cassini and the centre of the planet .
We ’ve mapped the footprints of the radio sources projected onto the screen , which tilts as Cassini moves along its orbital path and its orientation with respect to Saturn changes .
We ’ve also traced the footprints of the magnetic field lines back to the cloud tops of Saturn , ” said Dr Cecconi .
Although there were some minor differences between emissions in the northern and southern hemispheres , the emissions were strongest in the western part of Saturn ’s sunlit hemisphere .
This area corresponds to a region of Saturn ’s magnetopause where electrons are thought to be accelerated by the interaction of the solar wind and Saturn ’s magnetic field .
Still from the animation .
The left - hand panel shows the radio sources clustered along a magnetic field line in the southern hemisphere of Saturn .
The right hand panel shows the footprint of the magnetic field line projected onto the surface of Saturn .
Lighter colours indicate higher frequencies .
Credit : Cecconi
The observations were made over a 24 - hour period during Cassini ’s flyby of Saturn on 25 - 26th September 2006 .
This flyby was chosen because Cassini would approach from the southern hemisphere and swoop out from the northern hemisphere , allowing the instruments to take measurements from about 30 degrees below to about 30 degrees above the equatorial plane .
Last week , McCain could n’t remember how many homes he owns .
Now , Think Progress points to a 2007 interview when he not only did n’t know how many homes he owns ( in the interview , he was only willing to admit to two homes , when the real answer is at least seven ) , but amazingly he did n’t know what kind of car he drives .
Instead , he had to ask a nearby aide , who replied “ A Cadillac CTS ” .
Who does n’t know what kind of car he drives ?
Does he even drive anymore ?
How old do you have to be before they take away your license ?
And what kind of person drives a Cadillac CTS , anyway ?
Earlier this year , I married my British fiancee and switched my visa status from " Highly Skilled Migrant " to " Spouse . "
This was n't optional : Jacqui Smith , the British Home Secretary , had unilaterally ( and on 24 hours ' notice ) changed the rules for Highly Skilled Migrants to require a university degree , sending hundreds of long - term , productive residents of the UK away ( my immigration lawyers had a client who employed over 100 Britons , had fathered two British children , and was nonetheless forced to leave the country , leaving the 100 jobless ) .
Smith took this decision over howls of protests from the House of Lords and Parliament , who repeatedly sued her to change the rule back , winning victory after victory , but Smith kept on appealing ( at tax - payer expense ) until the High Court finally ordered her to relent ( too late for me , alas ) .
Now , it seems , I will become one of the first people in Britain to be forced to carry a mandatory biometric RFID card in a pilot programme being deployed first to foreign students and we spousal visa holders ( government is looking to curtail spousal visas altogether , capping all visas at 20,000 per year , including spousal visas , denying Britons the right to bring their spouses into the country once the quota has been filled ) .
The card will be eventually linked to all of the national databases — credit , health , driving , spending .
These are the same databases that the government has been repeatedly losing and haemmorhaging by the tens of million ( literally ) .
My family fled the Soviet Union after the war .
They were displaced people ( my father was born in a refugee camp in Azerbaijan ) who destroyed their papers to protect themselves from the draconian authorities who sought to limit their travel and migration .
I used to think it was ironic that my family had gone from Europe to Canada and back to Europe again in a generation , but now I do n't know how long the Doctorows will be staying in Europe — or at least in the UK .
The green and pleasant land has suspended habeas corpus , instituted street searches without particularlized suspicion , encourages its citizens to spy and snitch on each other , and now has issued mandatory universal papers that will track we dirty immigrants as we move around our adopted " home , " as part of a xenophobic campaign to arouse fear and resentment against migrants .
Many of my British friends act as if I 'm crazy when I say that we must defeat Labour in the next election .
We 're all good lefties , and a vote for the LibDems is considered tantamount to handing the country over to the Tories .
But what could the Tories do that would trump what Labour has made of the country ?
The Labour Party has made a police state with a melting economy , a place where rampant xenophobia makes foreigners less and less welcome — where we are made to hand over our biometrics and carry papers as we conduct our lawful business .
The only mainstream party to speak out against this measure is the LibDems , and they will have my vote .
To my friends , I say this : your Labour Party has taken my biometrics and will force me to carry the papers my grandparents destroyed when they fled the Soviet Union .
In living memory , my family has been chased from its home by governments whose policies and justification the Labour Party has aped .
Your Labour Party has made me afraid in Britain , and has made me seriously reconsider my settlement here .
I am the father of a British citizen and the husband of a British citizen .
I pay my tax .
I am a natural - born citizen of the Commonwealth .
The Labour Party ought not to treat me — nor any other migrant — in a way that violates our fundamental liberties .
The Labour Party is unmaking Britain , turning it into the surveillance society that Britain 's foremost prophet of doom , George Orwell , warned against .
Labour admits that we migrants are only the first step , and that every indignity that they visit upon us will be visited upon you , too .
If you want to live and thrive in a free country , you must defend us too : we must all hang together , or we will surely hang separately .
" We all want to see our borders more secure , and human trafficking , organised immigration crime , illegal working and benefit fraud tackled .
ID cards for foreign nationals , in locking people to one identity , will deliver in all these areas , " she added .
The UK Border Agency will begin issuing the biometric cards to the two categories of foreign nationals who officials say are most at risk of abusing immigration rules – students and those on a marriage or civil partnership visa .
Foreign national ID card unveiled , Support NO2ID and oppose the surveillance state
Local Television News Station Reports Orthorexia Is On The Rise

Do you suffer from Orthorexia ?
Do n’t know what Orthorexia is ?
THAT’S BECAUSE IT’S NOT REAL !!!
The folks over at KNBC , however , might disagree .
This crack squad of A+ reporters used their box of scare tactics to warn you about Orthorexia — meaning one who is obsessed with eating healthy food .
Do you avoid hormone - laden chow , Big Macs and soda ?
Well , I hate to say it , but you probably have Orthorexia .
THIS is the exact reason why I do n’t watch television .
Now if you ’ll excuse me I have some greens and tofu waiting for me .

Why Do Lies Prevail ?
John McCain was not offended when Barack Obama described McCain ’s policy agenda as putting “ lipstick on a pig . ”
I ca n’t prove that , but it seems so obvious to me that it ’s more like a fact than an opinion .
Nor could McCain possibly have thought that Obama was calling McCain ’s running mate , Sarah Palin , a pig , since Obama did n’t even mention Palin .
If Obama had even thought that his words would be misinterpreted as calling Palin a pig , he would n’t have said them .
That also seems obvious .
The whole controversy is ginned up , a fraud , a lie .
All obvious .
I know that by even bringing this up , I am falling into the trap that McCain ’s people have set and perpetuating this ridiculous controversy .
But the routine acceptance of obvious lies now corrodes our politics as much as the money that was the subject of McCain ’s famous act of Republican apostasy : McCain - Feingold campaign finance reform .
McCain has described his motive for McCain - Feingold as a giant mea culpa for his involvement in the Keating Five scandal .
Maybe when this is over , one way or another , McCain will swear off corrupt lying the way he has sworn off corrupt money .
But it should n’t be necessary to wait for one of McCain ’s conveniently delayed conversions to righteousness .
In a democracy , obvious lies and obvious liars should be self - defeating .
Why are n’t they ?
One reason is that the media have trouble calling a lie a lie , or asserting that one side is lying more than the other -- even when that is objectively the case .
They lean over backwards to give liars the benefit of the doubt , even when there is no doubt .
Objectivity can’t be objectively measured .
What can be is balance .
So if the sins of both campaigns are reported as roughly equal , the media feel they are doing their job -- even if this is objectively untrue .
But the bigger reason is that no one -- not the media , not the campaign professionals , not the voters -- cares enough about lying .
To some extent , they even respect a well - told lie as evidence of professionalism .
If a candidate complains too much about an opponent ’s lies , he or she starts being regarded as a bad sport , a whiner .
Stoic silence does n’t work either .
People start asking why you do n’t “ fight back . ”
Pretty soon , the victim of the lies starts getting blamed .
C’mon : this is n’t paddycakes ; politics ai n’t beanball ; and so on .
This happened to Al Gore in 2000 and to John Kerry in 2004 .
And it ’s already starting to happen to Barack Obama this year .
Sure , if he loses , it will be his fault .
Sure , he and everybody ought to know that the Republicans play this game for keeps .
But that should n’t let John McCain off the hook .
He says he ’d rather lose the election than lose the war .
But it seems he ’d rather lose that honor he ’s always going on about than lose the election .
There were so many better moves it could have made .
After Bear Stearns fell , it could have sent SWAT teams into all the other financial firms to assess their mortgage - backed paper .
It could have then announced to the world the health of each firm , which would have helped the market regain some confidence .
It could have forced firms to disclose their mortgage - backed holdings so that counterparties could evaluate them .
It did none of these things .
Then again , maybe the S.E.C. is trying to cover up its own culpability in this crisis .
Four years ago , the agency pushed through a rule that allowed the big investment banks to take on a great deal more debt .
As a result , debt ratios rose from about 12 to 1 to more like 30 to 1 .
Guess what Lehman ’s debt ratio was when it went bust ?
Yep : 30 to 1 .
SAVE THE MONEY MARKET FUNDS
The precipitating event here was the news that the Reserve Fund , a money market fund that caters to institutions , had “ broken the buck ” and was paying investors 97 cents on the dollar .
That is only the second time that ’s ever happened , and it had to scare investors , because most of us have come to think of money market funds as being the equivalent of bank savings account  perfectly safe .
In the aftermath , investors in the various Reserve money market funds pulled $ 58 billion out in the space of a week , leaving the firm with only $ 7.1 billion .
If that same fear had spread across other money funds , it could well have led the funds to stop accepting short - term commercial paper .
That would have been a disaster , because big companies rely on the commercial paper market to finance their day - to - day needs .
Under the circumstances , insuring the money market funds probably makes sense .
It will calm investors and keep the commercial paper market functioning .
But think about the moral hazard !
It bails out poorly managed money funds  the ones most likely to break the buck  at the expense of funds that have n’t taken the extra risk that causes a sudden drop in value .
And then there ’s this :
If you have your money in a bank account , only $ 100,000 is insured .
But if you have it in a money market fund  which usually has a slightly higher yield precisely because it has a small element of risk  you now have unlimited insurance .
It ’s the world turned upside down .
THE BIG MEGILLAH
For the last few weeks , a growing chorus of voices has called for the establishment of a new Resolution Trust Corporation , the entity the government devised in the wake of the savings and loan crisis to take over , and eventually sell off , the assets of failed S.& L.’s .
On Wednesday , that chorus got its most powerful voice , when Paul Volcker , a former Federal Reserve chairman , co-authored an op - ed article in The Wall Street Journal .

A Prime Case of Chaos
" A Prime Case of Chaos " is an article from Volume 4 of What 's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences by Barry Cipra , published by the AMS .
This article describes conjectural links between the Riemann zeta function , which is intimately related with prime numbers , and chaotic quantum - mechanical systems .
Mathematicians have been studying the zeta function since the time of Riemann , in the 19th century , while quantum mechanics is a development of 20th century physics .
Both of these areas , independently , as well as the hypothesized connection between the two , are topics of intense current research .

Why wo n't the FTC question the fraud of Big Pharma ?
Why the FTC is a threat to America
Operation False Information
Is there such a thing as false advertising of natural cures ?
The People 's Protection Agency
It 's time to end government - sponsored medical tyranny
( Natural News ) The Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) today launched " Operation False Cures , " a coordinated scheme to censor natural cancer remedies and financially destroy companies offering them for sale .
In doing so , the FTC joins the criminals at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) who currently operate an extortion racket that works by threatening health supplement companies with legal action unless they settle with the FDA by paying them million of dollars .
Both the FTC and FDA work to protect the interests of the pharmaceutical companies by discrediting or outlawing competing natural cures that work better , more safely and more affordably than FDA - approved pharmaceuticals .
In order to understand what 's really going on with the FTC , the key question to ask yourself is simply this :
Are there such things as anti-cancer nutrients ?
In other words , do anti-cancer nutrients actually exist in the real world ?
Of course they do .
Broccoli is loaded with them .
So is green tea .
Zinc is anti-cancer , selenium is anti-cancer , and rainforest herbs are absolutely loaded with anti-cancer nutrients .
Vitamin D is such a strong anti-cancer nutrient that , all by itself , it prevents an astonishing 77 % of all cancer , and this is all published in peer - reviewed science journals .
Turmeric is anti-cancer , especially when combined with black pepper .
So is resveratrol , seaweed , spirulina , chlorella , brown seaweed extract , raw foods , sprouted foods , cabbage , onions , garlic and a thousand other foods .
Now get this :
That 's where this whole story enters bizarro land .
The FTC , you see , does n't believe anybody should be able to state on any website that there is such a thing as an anti-cancer nutrient .
Period !
According to the FTC , anyone even mentioning a " cure for cancer " is automatically a quack , regardless of the science backing their position .
That 's because the real intent of the FTC is , of course , to , thereby protecting its corporate buddies in Big Pharma .
Notice how the FTCgoes after the fraudulent advertising and outrageously false health claims of drug companies ?
I mean , if you 're going to protect consumers from dangerous substances being sold , then there 's no better place to start than with Big Pharma .
Its drugs .
What does the FTC have to say about that ?
Nothing .
How about the fraudulent science , the censored negative studies , the criminal price fixing practices and the monopoly racket run by Big Pharma and the FDA ... does the FTC spend any effort looking into that ?
Of course not .
What about the fact that FDA and Big Pharma are running a monopolistic price fixing scheme that allows some drugs to be sold at more than 500,000 % markups over their manufacturing prices ?
Americans pay the highest prices in the world -- by far -- for their prescription drugs , and the drug control authorities trap Americans into monopoly pricing by banning imports from Canada and other countries .
It 's blatant monopolistic pricing , and if it were happening to T - shirts , cars or software , the FTC would leap right in and start suing the companies involved .
But when it concerns pharmaceuticals , the FTC remains silent , covering its eyes to the interstate commerce crimes being committed right now by the pharmaceutical industry .
The FTC is n't looking out for you folks , it 's just part of the criminal gang that 's taking away your Free Speech , suppressing your access to truthful information about natural cancer cures , and harming tens of millions of Americans in the process .
It 's just another corrupt , government - run group of con artists who delude themselves into thinking they 're protecting people by suppressing information about cancer cures .
You see , the official position of the U.S. government , the drug industry and the entire medical system is that That 's astonishing , given that I 've personally spoken to hundreds ( maybe thousands ) of people who CURED cancer using raw foods , nutritional supplements , anti-cancer herbs and alternative therapies .
I 've personally spoken with people who have cured pancreatic cancer , liver cancer , breast cancer , prostate cancer , colon cancer , skin cancer , bone cancer , throat cancer , thyroid cancer and all sorts of other cancers .
I suppose , according to the FTC , I must have beenall these conversations .
Maybe I 'm hallucinating from eating too much vitamin C , and now I 'm dreaming up imaginary conversations with people who claim to have cured cancer .
That 's apparently what the FTC believes .
You see , the FTC has fallen in line with all the other health system criminals operating in the United States today by declaring there is no cure for cancer .
It 's like claiming " The Earth is flat ! "
It 's such outmoded , ignorant thinking that I can only laugh in total disgust at the so - called " intelligent " people making that argument .
Of course , it's in the interests of the cancer industry to keep everybody completely misinformed about cancer cures ..
Cancer cures are so commonplace now that you'd have to actually make a conscious effort not to see them .
You can cure cancer with infrared sauna therapies ( detox through sweat ) combined with the Max Gerson diet ( www.Gerson.org ) , a raw foods diet , superfood supplements , and even things like insulin potentiation therapy , ultraviolet irradiation of your blood , oxygen therapy , Chinese medicine herbs and a whole host of other natural therapies that really work .
You can't find most of these therapies offered in the United States becausedue to the outright oppression of any medical technology outside the toxic chemotherapy and radiation protocols .
Curing cancer , as one Chinese medicine doctor once told me , is easier than curing the common cold .
But you 'll probably have to leave the USA to actually participate in a cure , since curing or treating the cause of cancer ( or just about any disease ) has been outlawed in the U.S.
Eliminating cancer tumors and boosting natural immune function is so incredibly easy that it takes the cancer industry billions of dollars a year in propaganda just to try to hide the truth from people .
The FTC and FDA , for their part , use taxpayer money to continue the charade , so they essentially have unlimited funds to pursue their cancer propaganda and disinformation campaigns .
Only the internet allows people to learn the truth about cancer , and of course they 're trying to shut that down , too .
Only a few organizations like NaturalNews -- which sells no supplements whatsoever -- remains insulated from the orchestrated attacks on free speech now being waged by the FTC and FDA .
Together , these two government monstrosities have become a force of death and destruction , laying waste to the health education of the American People , enforcing ignorance and health illiteracy that keeps the People enslaved in a fraudulent cancer racket offering nothing but bankruptcy and death .
If anything , the FTC 's announcement today should be called , because that 's what it 's all about :
Spreading lies and disinformation about cancer cures , hoping to dissuade people from learning the truth about the very real cancer cures that exist right now .
In taking this position , the FTC has joined the ranks of the criminally - operated FDA , EPA , DEA and USDA , all of which now operate as taxpayer - funded branches of Big Pharma that seek to destroy anything that competes with drug profits and the " culture of death " permeating American society .
From a Biblical perspective , these organizations would be considered satanic , as if they were possessed by the devil himself .
If this were Lord of the Rings , they would be like the Dark Lord Sauron , raising armies of orcs to spread darkness and death across the land in the quest for power and control .
Make no mistake :
The FTC is waging war against the People , much like the FDA , and it will stop at nothing to discredit , destroy and bankrupt the natural products industry in its desperate , evil - minded efforts to enslave Americans in the Big Pharma system of medical control .
Because , let 's face it :
Any organization that claims there is no cure for cancer is delusional .
They also claim there 's no cure for diabetes , or heart disease , or osteoporosis .
In fact , these delusional government people believe there is no cure for ANY disease !
That 's right :
They do n't believe there is any such thing as a cure for anything .
That 's a serious sign of complete detachment from reality .
These people are more delusional than a bunch of DEA agents smoking up the crack they confiscated from the local crack house .
They are high on their power and steeped in ignorance .
They know nothing of the real world and operate from a fictional set of delusions they 're now trying to imprint upon the American people .
To say there 's no such thing as a natural cure for cancer is to instantly label yourself a moron .
There are hundreds of natural cures for cancer , and people are curing themselves every day , using no pharmaceuticals , no chemotherapy , no irradiation and no doctors .
And it's that reality that scares the bejeezus out of the cancer industry .
No doctors ?
Well how on earth are they supposed to make their money if people can cure cancer themselves ?
That 's the whole point , actually :
While I want to set you free with the knowledge and power to heal yourself ( and I have nothing to gain from you curing cancer , by the way ) , the cancer industry hasif you are empowered with knowledge and informed about natural cancer cures that really work .
If you 're cancer free , they 'll lose your business , and the cancer industry is far more concerned about its own revenues than your health , believe me .
Of course there is .
Not all cancer cures on the internet are honest .
But the FTC does n't limit its targeted to just false promises .
The FTC , by its own admission , believes that ANY mention of a cancer " cure " is , by itself , fraudulent .
Thus , it throws the baby out with the bathwater by targeting all products that claim to cure cancer .
Now , if you want to talk about false cures , let 's talk about the chemotherapy industry , and the mammography industry , and the whole fraudulent system of oncology .
A rigorous review of the scientific literature on chemotherapy reveals thaton 98 % of people .
It 's a fraud all by itself .
And even when it " works " to shrink tumors , it does n't give people quality of life or restored health .
It does n't cure cancer , in other words .
It merely poisons the patient .
Mammography is also a fraud .
Rigorous scientific studies reveal that .
The devices actuallycancer by irradiating the breasts !
( See https://www.naturalnews.com/020829.html
Modern oncology is a fraud .
It 's marketed through a system of controlled , fabricated fear .
An oncologist makes a false diagnosis , then scares the patient into agreeing to high - profit treatments by telling them , " You only have six months to live . "
This is not merely unethical , it 's athat 's used every day in America to sign up consumers for conventional cancer treatments that will only harm them .
So where is the FTC on investigating the chemotherapy fraud ?
The mammography fraud ?
The fear marketing tactics of modern oncology ?
The FTC , as you well know , is a no - show on these issues .
Apparently , poisons that kill people , and procedures that maim women are perfectly fine with the FTC , even when they are promoted using deceptive marketing tactics !
The FTC , you see , thinks nothing of women being disfigured and having their breasts sliced off by cancer surgeons , even when they do n't yet have breast cancer !
That 's perfectly fine with the FTC .
But if you approach that same woman and offer to sell her some broccoli sprouts that can help reverse breast cancer , then suddenlythe criminal !
So the insane doctors wielding scalpels , poisons and lies are fully protected by the FTC , while the naturopaths selling healing nutrients and safe , effective cancer therapies are considered criminals .
Welcome to the USA , friends ... the land of medical insanity and government - enforced oppression of natural cures .
I think we need a new agency called the People 's Protection Agency ( PPA ) .
The PPA is tasked with making arrests of the top criminals at the FTC , FDA , DEA , USDA and other government racket groups that threaten the health and safety of the American People .
The PPA would have a list of certain people to arrest and prosecute for their crimes against humanity .
It should be a completely non-violent organization , of course , but it should bring these unindicted criminals to justice and let all the evidence come out in a public forum where the truth is a matter of public record .
This list should include the top criminals at the FTC and FDA who are orchestrating these campaigns of health destruction and enforced ignorance against the American people .
I would hope that these criminals be brought to justice through proper arrest and prosecution , and I might even recommend that we grant them immunity in exchange for their full accounts of what happened ( like many Nazi war criminals , or even the Apartheid criminals in South Africa ) so that future generations can learn from the mistakes of our own .
We are past the time of tolerating the ongoing medical abuse of our families and our children .
It is time for the American People to stand up against tyranny , ignorance and oppression .
It 's time to take back our rights to openly and honestly describe the anti-cancer properties of plants , nutrients and therapies .
And it 's time that we recognized any person , institution or government that interferes with those God - given rights is itself an enemy of the People , and a disservice to all of humanity .
Stay subscribed to NaturalNews to join the ( peaceful ) revolution that 's coming .
Together , we can help transform this world from a place of death , destruction and ignorance to one of life , abundance and free knowledge .
There are institutions that wish to prevent us from setting our fellow human beings free , but those institutions are already beginning to crumble , and soon , the opportunity will be right to step forward and be part of the creation of The Next Society , where knowledge reigns over ignorance , peace triumphs over war , and the People are set free from the mental prisons in which they 've been trapped for generations .
Today 's actions by the FTC are the last , desperate attempts to hold together the fragile bars of those prisons and prevent the human race from being set free by the truth about healing cancer .
We can live in a world without cancer .
The technology exists right now .
It 's probably growing in your back yard .
And yet the cancer industry is doing everything in its power to isolate people from the truth and prevent cancer cures from becoming so widely known that the entire cancer industry implodes like Bear Stearns Co. Be part of the revolution .
Forward this article to everyone you know .
Post it everywhere .
Spread the truth , free the People , and stand up against the ignorance , tyranny and oppression of the cancer industry and its police state enforcers :
The FTC and FDA .

It also occurs to me that in a way McCain and Rove have actually simply taken over the liberal blogosphere in some way .
They are being played .
I just wanted to say thank you so much for being the only blogger ( aside from Al Giordano ) who gets it .
While the rest of the blogosphere ( especially the liberal bloggers ) lose their heads you are an island of common sense .
Patience and Steel .
Yes , yes .
yes .
The liberal bloggers have become McCain central .
They make people click on his ads , make the world spin around him instead of focusing on our candidate and what he is trying to do .
There is ZERO coverage of what Obama is actually doing every day talking tough on the issues .
There is ZERO coverage of Biden ( who is on the trail but the blogs do n't seem to care or cover him unless he is doing what they think he should be doing .
Sadly AFP did cover him this week and people seemed to be too busy saying he was not doing anything to include the link with his forceful comments against McCain .
The one time the blogs linked to Biden --- when the MSM tried to make a big deal out his answer to a question that made Hillary look bad and he defended her .
That was it ) .
McCain and crew realized early this cycle that they did not have a visible internet presence .
So what did they do ?
They took over the liberal presence , they are manipulating the leading liberal blogs , just as they manipulate the MSM .
All to their own advantage .
And the blogs have all fallen for this hook , line and sinker .
Does no one realize this ?
They are all being played .
And Obama , god bless him , he gets it .
As does his team .
while everyone whines he keeps at it every day with much much class and like a laser focused on the issues .
The problem is not Obama , is that no one wants to follow his lead .
Instead they are following McCain - Rove and they do n't even know it .

This year marks the 60th anniversary of John Kenneth Galbraith ’s celebrated book , The Affluent Society , which sparked much public discussion at the time of its publication about disparities between ever - increasing private wealth and what Galbraith claimed was an impoverished public sector lacking in social and physical infrastructure .
Murray Rothbard critiques Galbraith ’s claims in the following article , which is excerpted from his monumental treatise , Man , Economy , & State .
In the early part of the 20th century , the main indictment of the capitalist system by its intellectual critics was the alleged pervasiveness of “ monopoly . ”
In the 1930s , mass unemployment and poverty ( “ one third of a nation ” ) came to the fore .
At the present time [ 1962 ] , growing abundance and prosperity have greatly dimmed the poverty and unemployment theme , and the only serious “ monopoly ” seems to be that of labor unionism .
Let it not be thought , however , that criticism of capitalism has died .
Two seemingly contradictory charges are now rife : ( a ) that capitalism is not “ growing ” fast enough , and ( b ) that the trouble with capitalism is that it makes us too “ affluent . ”
Excess wealth has suddenly replaced poverty as the tragic flaw of capitalism . [ 1 ]
At first sight , these latter charges appear contradictory , for capitalism is at one and the same time accused of producing too many goods , and yet of not increasing its production of goods fast enough .
The contradiction seems especially glaring when the same critic presses both lines of attack , as is true of the leading critic of the sin of affluence , Professor Galbraith . [ 2 ]
But , as the Wall Street Journal has aptly pointed out , this is not really a contradiction at all ; for the excessive affluence is all in the “ private sector , ” the goods enjoyed by the consumers ; the deficiency , or “ starvation , ” is in the “ public sector , ” which needs further growth . [ 3 ]
Although The Affluent Society is replete with fallacies , backed by dogmatic assertions and time - honored rhetorical devices in place of reasoned argument , [ 4 ] the book warrants some consideration here in view of its enormous popularity .
As in the case of most “ economists ” who attack economic science , Professor Galbraith is a historicist , who believes that economic theory , instead of being grounded on the eternal facts of human nature , is somehow relative to different historical epochs .
“ Conventional ” economic theory , he asserts , was true for the eras before the present , which were times of “ poverty ” ; now , however , we have vaulted from a centuries - long state of poverty into an age of “ affluence , ” and for such an age , a completely new economic theory is needed .
Galbraith also makes the philosophical error of believing that ideas are essentially “ refuted by events ” ; on the contrary , in human action , as contrasted with the natural sciences , ideas can be refuted only by other ideas ; events themselves are complex resultants which need to be interpreted by correct ideas .
One of Galbraith ’s gravest flaws is the arbitrariness of the categories , which pervade his work , of “ poverty ” and “ affluence . ”
Nowhere does he define what he means by these terms , and therefore nowhere does he lay down standards by which we can know , even in theory , when we have passed the magic borderland between “ poverty ” and “ affluence ” that requires an entirely new economic theory to come into being .
The present book and most other economic works make it evident that economic science is not dependent on some arbitrary level of wealth ; the basic praxeological laws are true of all men at all times , and the catallactic laws of the exchange economy are true whenever and wherever exchanges are made .
Galbraith makes much of his supposed discovery , suppressed by other economists , that the marginal utility of goods declines as one ’s income increases and that therefore a man ’s final $ 1,000 is not worth nearly as much to him as his first  the margin of subsistence .
But this knowledge is familiar to most economists , and this book , for example , has included it .
The marginal utility of goods certainly declines as our income rises ; but the very fact that people continue to work for the final $ 1,000 and work for more money when the opportunity is available , demonstrates conclusively that the marginal utility of goods is still greater than the marginal disutility of leisure forgone .
Galbraith ’s hidden fallacy is a quantitative assumption : from the mere fact that the marginal utility of goods falls as one ’s income and wealth rise , Galbraith has somehow concluded that it has already fallen to virtually , or really , zero .
The fact of decline , however , tells us nothing whatever about the degree of this decline , which Galbraith arbitrarily assumes has been almost total .
All economists , even the most “ conventional , ” know that as incomes have risen in the modern world , workers have chosen to take more and more of that income in the form of leisure .
And this should be proof enough that economists have long been familiar with the supposedly suppressed truth that the marginal utility of goods in general tends to decline as their supply increases .
But , Galbraith retorts , economists admit that leisure is a consumers ’ good , but not that other goods decline in value as their supply increases .
Yet this is surely an erroneous contention ; what economists know is that , as civilization expands the supply of goods , the marginal utility of goods declines and the marginal utility of leisure forgone ( the opportunity cost of labor ) increases , so that more and more real income will be “ taken ” in the form of leisure .
There is nothing at all startling , subversive , or revolutionary about this familiar fact .
According to Galbraith , economists willfully ignore the specter of the satiation of wants .
Yet they do so quite properly , because when wants  or rather , wants for exchangeable goods  are truly satiated , we shall all know it soon enough ; for , at that point , everyone will cease working , will cease trying to transform land resources into final consumers ’ goods .
There will be no need to continue producing , because all needs for consumers ’ goods will have been supplied  or at least all those which can be produced and exchanged .
At this point , everyone will stop work , the market economy  indeed , all economy  will come to an end , means will no longer be scarce in relation to ends , and everyone will bask in paradise .
I think it self - evident that this time has not yet arrived and shows no signs of arriving ; if it some day should arrive , it will be greeted by economists , as by most other people , not with curses , but with rejoicing .
Despite their venerable reputation as practitioners of a “ dismal science , ” economists have no vested interests , psychological or otherwise , in scarcity .
But , in the meanwhile , this is still a world of scarcity ; scarce means have to be applied to alternate ends ; labor is still necessary .
People still work for their final $ 1,000 of income and would be happy to accept another $ 1,000 should it be offered .
We would venture another prediction :
An informal poll taken among the people , asking whether they would accept , or know what to do with , an extra few thousand dollars of annual ( real ) income , would find almost no one who would refuse the offer because of excessive affluence or satiety  or for any other reason .
Few would be at a loss about what to do with their increased wealth .
Professor Galbraith , of course , has an answer to all this .
These wants , he says , are not real or genuine ones ; they have been “ created ” in the populace by advertisers , and their wicked clients , the producing businessmen .
The very fact of production , through such advertising , “ creates ” the supposed wants that it supplies .
Galbraith ’s entire theory of excess affluence rests on this flimsy assertion that consumer wants are artificially created by business itself .
It is an allegation backed only by repetitious assertion and by no evidence whatever  except perhaps for Galbraith ’s obvious personal dislike for detergents and tailfins .
What is more , the attack on wicked advertising as creating wants and degrading the consumer is surely the most conventional of the conventional wisdom in the anticapitalist ’s arsenal . [ 5 ]
There are many fallacies in Galbraith ’s conventional attack on advertising .
In the first place , it is not true that advertising “ creates ” wants or demands on the part of the consumers .
It certainly tries to persuade consumers to buy the product ; but it cannot create wants or demands , because each person must himself adopt the ideas and values on which he acts  whether these ideas or values are sound or unsound .
Galbraith here assumes a nave form of determinism  of advertising upon the consumers , and , like all determinists , he leaves an implicit escape clause from the determination for people like himself , who are , unaccountably , not determined by advertising .
If there is determinism by advertising , how can some people be determined to rush out and buy the product , while Professor Galbraith is free to resist the advertisements with indignation and to write a book denouncing the advertising ? [ 6 ]
Secondly , Galbraith gives us no standard to decide which wants are so “ created ” and which are legitimate .
By his stress on poverty , one might think that all wants above the subsistence level are false wants created by advertising .
Of course , he supplies no evidence for this view .
But , as we shall see further below , this is hardly consistent with his views on public - or governmentally induced wants .
Thirdly , Galbraith fails to distinguish between fulfilling a given want in a better way and inducing new wants .
Unless we are to take the extreme and unsupported view that all wants above the subsistence line are “ created , ” we must note the rather odd behavior attributed to businessmen by Galbraith ’s assumptions .
Why should businessmen go to the expense , bother , and uncertainty of trying to create new wants , when they could far more easily look for better or cheaper ways of fulfilling wants that consumers already have ?
If consumers , for example , already have a discernible and discoverable want for a “ no - rub cleanser , ” it is surely easier and less costly to produce and then advertise a no-rub cleanser than it would be to create some completely new want  say for blue cleansers in particular  and then work very hard and spend a great deal of money on advertising campaigns to try to convince people that they need blue cleansers because blue “ is the color of the sky ” or for some other artificial reason . [ 7 ]
In short , the Galbraithian view of the business and marketing system makes little or no sense .
Rather than go to the expensive , uncertain , and , at bottom , needless , task of trying to find a new want for consumers , business will tend to satisfy those wants that consumers already have , or that they are pretty sure consumers would have if the product were available .
Advertising is then used as a means of ( a ) conveying information to the consumers that the product is now available and telling them what the product will do ; and ( b ) specifically , trying to convince the consumers that this product will satisfy their given want  e.g. , will be a no-rub cleanser .
Indeed , our view is the only one that makes sense of the increasingly large quantities of money spent by business on marketing research .
Why bother investigating in detail what consumers really want , if all one need do is to create the wants for them by advertising ?
If , in fact , production really created its own demand through advertising , as Galbraith maintains , business would never again have to worry about losses or bankruptcy or a failure to sell automatically any good that it may arbitrarily choose to produce .
Certainly there would be no need for marketing research or for any wondering about what consumers will buy .
This image of the world is precisely the reverse of what is occurring .
Indeed , precisely because people ’s standards of living are moving ever further past the subsistence line , businessmen are worrying ever more intensely about what consumers want and what they will buy .
It is because the range of goods available to the consumers is expanding so much beyond simple staples needed for subsistence  in quantity , quality , and breadth of product substitutes  that businessmen must compete as never before in paying court to the consumer , in trying to obtain his attention : in short , in advertising .
Increasing advertising is a function of the increasingly effective range of competition for the consumer ’s favor . [ 8 ]
Not only will businessmen tend to produce for and satisfy what they believe are the given wants of consumers , but the consumers , in contrast to voters , have a direct market test for every piece of advertising that they confront .
If they buy the cleanser and find that much rubbing is still required , the product will soon fade into oblivion .
Thus , any advertising claims for market products can be and are quickly and readily tested by the consumers .
Confronted with these facts , Galbraith could only maintain that the aversion against rubbing was itself generated , in some mysterious and sinister fashion , by business advertising . [ 9 ]
Advertising is one of the areas in which Galbraith , curiously and in glaring self - contradiction , treats private business differently from governmental activities .
Thus , while business is supposed to be “ creating ” consumer wants through advertising , thereby generating an artificial affluence , at the same time the neglected “ public sector ” is increasingly starved and poverty stricken .
Apparently , Galbraith has never heard of , or refuses to acknowledge the existence of , governmental propaganda .
He makes no mention whatever of the hordes of press agents , publicists , and propagandists working for government agencies , bombarding the taxpayers with propaganda which the latter have been forced to support .
Since a considerable part of the propaganda is for ever - greater increases in the particular government bureau ’s activities , this means that G , the government officials , expropriate T , the bulk of the taxpayers , in order to hire more propagandists for G , to persuade the taxpayers to permit still more funds to be taken from them .
And so forth .
It is strange that , while waxing indignant over detergent and automobile commercials over television , Professor Galbraith has never had to endure the tedium of “ public service commercials ” beamed at him from the government .
We may pass over the Washington conferences for influential private organizations that serve as “ transmission belts ” for government propaganda to the grassroots , the “ inside briefings ” that perform the same function , the vast quantities of printed matter subsidized by the taxpayer and issued by the government , etc .
Indeed , not only does Galbraith not consider government propaganda as artificially want - creating ( and this is a realm , let us remember , where consumers have no market test of the product ) , but one of his major proposals is for a vast program of what he calls “ investment in men , ” which turns out to be large - scale governmental “ education ” to uplift the wants and tastes of the citizenry .
In short , Galbraith wants society ’s objective to be the deliberate expansion of the “ New Class ” ( roughly , intellectuals , who are blithely assumed to be the only ones who really enjoy their work ) , “ with its emphasis on education and its ultimate effect on intellectual , literary , cultural and artistic demands … . ” [ 10 ]
It seems evident that , while the free market and business are accused of artificially creating consumer wants , the shoe is precisely on Galbraith ’s own foot .
It is Galbraith who is eager to curtail and suppress the consumers ’ freely chosen wants , and who is advocating a massive and coercive attempt by the government to create artificial wants , to “ invest in men ” by “ educating ” them to redirect their wants into those refined and artistic channels of which Professor Galbraith is so fond .
Everyone will have to give up his tailfins so that all may be compelled to … read books ( like The Affluent Society , for example ? ) .
There are other grave and fundamental fallacies in Galbraith ’s approach to government .
In particular , after making much ado over the fact that , with poverty conquered , the marginal utility of further goods is lower , he finds that everything somehow works in reverse for “ governmental needs . ”
Governmental needs , in some mystical way , are exempt from this law of diminishing marginal wants ; instead , mirabile dictu , governmental needs increase in urgency as society becomes more affluent .
From this flagrant and unresolved contradiction , Galbraith leaps to the conclusion that government must compel the massive shifting of resources from superfluous private , to starved public , needs .
But on the basis of diminishing marginal utility alone , there is no case for such a shift , since all wants at a higher real income are of lower utility than the wants of the poverty stricken .
And when we realize that if we talk about “ created ” wants at all , governmental propaganda is vastly more likely to “ create ” wants than is business , a case , even in Galbraith ’s own terms , can be made for just the reverse : for a shift from the governmental to the private sector .
And , finally , Galbraith , in his lament for the starved and underprivileged public sector , somehow neglects to inform his readers that , whatever statistics are used , it is clear that , in the past half - century , government activity has increased far more than private .
Government is absorbing and confiscating a far greater share of the national product than in earlier days .
How much lower its “ utility , ” and how much greater the case , in Galbraith ’s terms , for a shift from government to private activity !
Galbraith also airily assumes , in common with many other writers , that many governmental services are “ collective goods ” and therefore simply cannot be supplied by private enterprise .
Without going further into the question of the desirability of private enterprise in these fields , one must note that Galbraith is quite wrong .
Not only is his thesis simply a bald assertion , unsupported by facts , but , on the contrary , every single service generally assumed to be suppliable by government alone has been historically supplied by private enterprise .
This includes such services as education , road building and maintenance , coinage , postal delivery , fire protection , police protection , judicial decisions , and military defense  all of which are often held to be self - evidently and necessarily within the exclusive province of government . [ 11 ]
There are many other important fallacies in Galbraith ’s book , but the central thesis of The Affluent Society has now been discussed .
Thus , one of the reasons why Galbraith sees great danger in the present high consumption is that much is financed by consumer credit , which Galbraith considers , in the conventional manner , to be “ inflationary ” and to lead to instability and depression .
Yet consumer credit that does not add to the money supply is not inflationary ; it simply permits consumers to redirect the pattern of their spending so as to buy more of what they want and ascend higher in their value scales .
In short , they may redirect spending from nondurable to durable goods .
This is a transfer of spending power , not an inflationary rise .
The device of consumer credit was a highly productive invention .
Predictably , Galbraith pours much of his scorn on the supply - and - demand explanation of inflation , and especially on the proper monetary explanation , which he terms “ mystical . ”
His view of depression is purely Keynesian and assumes that a depression is caused by a deficiency of aggregate demand .
“ Inflation ” is an increase in prices , which he would combat either by reducing aggregate demand through high taxes or by selective price controls and the fixing , by compulsory arbitration , of important wages and prices .
If the former route is chosen , Galbraith , as a Keynesian , believes that unemployment would ensue .
But Galbraith is not really worried , for he would take the revolutionary step of separating income from production ; production , it seems , is important only because it provides income .
He proposes a sliding scale of unemployment insurance provided by the government , to be greater in depression than in boom , the payment in depression rising almost to the general prevailing wage ( for some reason , Galbraith would not go precisely as high , because of a lingering fear of some disincentive effect on the unemployeds ’ finding jobs ) .
He does not seem to realize that this is merely a way of aggravating and prolonging unemployment during a depression and indirectly subsidizing union wage scales above the market .
There is no need to stress the author ’s other vagaries , such as his adoption of the conventional conservationist concern about using up precious resources  a position , of course , consistent with Galbraith ’s general attack on the private consumer . [ 12 ]
There is a problem of the “ public sector ” : scarcities and conflicts keep appearing in government services , and in these fields alone , e.g. , juvenile delinquency , traffic jams , overcrowded schools , lack of parking space , etc .
The single remedy that proponents of government activity can offer is for more funds to be channeled from private to public activity . [ 13 ]
However , such scarcity and inefficiency are inherent in government operation of any activity .
Instead of taking warning from the inefficiencies of government output , writers like Galbraith turn the blame from government onto the taxpayers and consumers , just as government water officials characteristically blame the consumers for water shortages .
At no time does Galbraith so much as consider the possibility of mending an ailing public sector by making that sector private .
How would Galbraith know when his desired “ social balance ” was achieved ?
What criteria has he set to guide us in knowing how much shift there should be from private to public activity ?
The answer is , none ; Galbraith cheerfully concedes that there is no way of finding the point of optimum balance : “ No test can be applied , for none exists . ”
But , after all , precise definitions , “ precise equilibrium , ” are not important ; for to Galbraith it is crystal “ clear ” that we must move now from private to public activity , and to a “ considerable ” extent .
We shall know when we arrive , for the public sector will then bask in opulence .
And to think that Galbraith accuses the perfectly sound and logical monetary theory of inflation of being “ mystical ” and “ unrevealed magic ” ! [ 14 ]
Before leaving the question of affluence and the recent attack on consumption  the very goal of the entire economic system , let us note two stimulating contributions in recent years on hidden but important functions of luxury consumption , particularly by the “ rich . ”
F.A . Hayek has pointed out the important function of the luxury consumption of the rich , at any given time , in pioneering new ways of consumption , and thereby paving the way for later diffusion of such “ consumption innovations ” to the mass of the consumers . [ 15 ]
And Bertrand de Jouvenel , stressing the fact that refined esthetic and cultural tastes are concentrated precisely in the more affluent members of society , also points out that these citizens are the ones who could freely and voluntarily give many gratuitous services to others , services which , because they are free , are not counted in the national income statistics .

Notes
[ 1 ]
This performance leads one to believe that Schumpeter was right when he declared :
… capitalism stands its trial before judges who have the sentence of death in their pockets .
They are going to pass it , whatever the defense they may hear ; the only success victorious defense may produce is a change in the indictment .
( Schumpeter , Capitalism , Socialism and Democracy , p. 144 )

[ 3 ] “ Fable for Our Times , ” Wall Street Journal , April 21 , 1960 , p. 12 .
Thus Galbraith , ibid. , deplores the government ’s failure to “ invest more ” in scientists and scientific research to promote our growth , while also attacking American affluence .
It turns out , however , that Galbraith wants more of precisely that kind of research which can have no possible commercial application .
[ 4 ]
Galbraith ’s major rhetorical device may be called “ the sustained sneer , ” which includes ( a ) presenting an opposing argument so sardonically as to make it seem patently absurd , with no need for reasoned refutation ; ( b ) coining and reiterating Veblenesque names of disparagement , e.g. , “ the conventional wisdom ” ; and ( c ) ridiculing the opposition further by psychological ad hominem attacks , i.e. , accusing opponents of having a psychological vested interest in their absurd doctrines  this mode of attack being now more fashionable than older accusations of economic venality .
The “ conventional wisdom ” encompasses just about everything with which Galbraith disagrees .
[ 5 ]
In addition to wicked advertising , wants are also artificially created , according to Galbraith , by emulation of one ’s neighbor : “ Keeping up with the Joneses . ”
But , in the first place , what is wrong with such emulation , except an unsupported ethical judgment of Galbraith’s ?
Galbraith pretends to ground his theory , not on his private ethical judgment , but on the alleged creation of wants by production itself .
Yet simple emulation would not be a function of producers , but of consumers themselves  unless emulation , too , were inspired by advertising .
But this reduces to the criticism of advertising discussed in the text .
And secondly , where did the original Jones obtain his wants ?
Regardless of how many people have wants purely in emulation of others , some person or persons must have originally had these wants as genuine needs of their very own .
Otherwise the argument is hopelessly circular .
Once this is conceded , it is impossible for economics to decide to what extent each want is pervaded by emulation .

[ 7 ]
Professor Abbott , in his important book on competition , quality of products , and the business system , put it this way :
The producers will generally find it easier and less costly to gain sales by adapting the product as closely as possible to existing tastes and by directing advertising to those whose wants it is already well equipped to satisfy than by attempting to alter human beings to fit the product .
( Abbott , Quality and Competition , p. 74 )
[ 8 ]
Recent writings by marketing experts on “ the marketing revolution ” now under way stress precisely this increasing competition for , and courting of , the favor and custom of the consumer .
Thus , see Robert J. Keith , “ The Marketing Revolution , ” Journal of Marketing , January , 1960 , pp. 35 –38 ; Goldman , “ Product Differentiation and Advertising : Some Lessons From Soviet Experience , ” and Goldman , “ Marketing  a Lesson for Marx , ” Harvard Business Review , January  February , 1960 , pp. 79 –86 .
[ 9 ]
On the alleged powers of business advertising , it is well to note these pungent comments of Ludwig von Mises :
It is a widespread fallacy that skillful advertising can talk the consumers into buying everything that the advertiser wants them to buy … .
However , nobody believes that any kind of advertising would have succeeded in making the candlemakers hold the field against the electric bulb , the horse - drivers against the motorcars , the goose quill against the steel pen and later against the fountain pen .
( Mises , Human Action , p. 317 )

[ 10 ] Galbraith , Affluent Society , p. 345 .
In proposing this large - scale creation of an intellectual class , Galbraith virtually ignores the artificiality of educating people beyond their interests , capacities , or job opportunities available .
[ 11 ]
Since this would take us far afield indeed , we can mention here only one reference : to the successful development of the road and canal networks of 18th - century England by private road , canal , and navigation improvement companies .
See T.S. Ashton , An Economic History of England : The 18th Century ( New York : Barnes and Noble , n.d. ) , pp. 72 –81 .
On the fallacy of “ collective goods , ” only suppliable by the government , see Appendix B below .
[ 12 ]
Amidst the tangle of Galbraith ’s remaining fallacies and errors , we might mention one : his curious implication that Professor von Mises is a businessman .
For first Galbraith talks of the age - old hostility between businessmen and intellectuals , backs this statement by quoting Mises as critical of many intellectuals , and then concedes that “ most businessmen ” would regard Mises as “ rather extreme . ”
But since Mises is certainly not a businessman , it is odd to see his statements used as evidence for businessman - intellectual enmity .
Galbraith , Affluent Society , pp. 184–85 .
This peculiar error is shared by Galbraith ’s Harvard colleagues , whose work he cites favorably , and who persist in quoting such nonbusinessmen as Henry Hazlitt and Dr. F.A. Harper as spokesmen for the “ classical business creed . ”
See Francis X. Sutton , Seymour E. Harris , Carl Kaysen , and James Tobin , The American Business Creed ( Cambridge : Harvard University Press , 1956 ) .
The Affluent Society is a work that particularly lends itself to satire , and this has been cleverly supplied in “ The Sumptuary Manifesto , ” The Journal of Law and Economics , October , 1959 , pp. 120–23 .
[ 13 ] See pp. 944ff. , of this chapter .
[ 14 ]
A brief , and therefore bald , version of Galbraith ’s thesis may be found in John Kenneth Galbraith , “ Use of Income That Economic Growth Makes Possible … ” in Problems of United States Economic Development ( New York : Committee for Economic Development , January , 1958 ) , pp. 201–06 .
In the same collection of essays there is in some ways a more extreme statement of the same position by Professor Moses Abramovitz , who presses even further to denounce leisure as threatening to deprive us of that “ modicum of purposive , disciplined activity which … gives savor to our lives . ”
Moses Abramovitz , “ Economic Goals and Social Welfare in the Next Generation , ” ibid. , p. 195 .
It is perhaps apropos to note a strong resemblance between coerced deprivation of leisure and slavery , as well as to remark that the only society that can genuinely “ invest in men ” is a society where slavery abounds .
In fact , Galbraith writes almost wistfully of a slave system for this reason .
Affluent Society , pp. 274–75 .
In addition to Galbraith and Abramovitz , other “ Galbraithian ” papers in the CED Symposium are those of Professor David Riesman and especially Sir Roy Harrod , who is angry at “ touts , ” the British brand of advertiser .
Like Galbraith , Harrod would also launch a massive government education program to “ teach ” people how to use their leisure in the properly refined and esthetic manner .
This contrasts to Abramovitz , who would substitute a bracing discipline of work for expanding leisure .
But then again , one suspects that the bulk of the people would find a coerced Harrodian esthetic just as disciplinary .

Hayek , Constitution of Liberty , pp. 42 ff .
As Hayek puts it :
A large part of the expenditure of the rich , though not intended for that end , thus serves to defray the cost of the experimentation with the new things that , as a result , can later be made available to the poor .
The important point is not merely that we gradually learn to make cheaply on a large scale what we already know how to make expensively in small quantities but that only from an advanced position does the next range of desires and possibilities become visible , so that the selection of new goals and the effort toward their achievement will begin long before the majority can strive for them .
( Ibid. , pp. 43 –44 )
Also see the similar point made by Mises 30 years before .

The Best of Murray N. Rothbard
The game of chess has been around in its current form for hundreds of years .
It takes a minute to learn and a lifetime to master , but it 's not much of a spectator sport .
Still , chess is so fascinating that considerable imagination has gone into making it more accessible and exciting for players , students , and spectators .
Wu Chess is a social networking site that marries hip - hop culture with chess .
Founded by Chesspark and RZA from the Wu - Tang Clan , members can learn from masters , play each other online , form chess clans , and discuss common interests .
Chess Boxing combines the cerebral with the physical .
Participants play 4 minute rounds of chess alternating with 3 minute rounds of boxing .
It shows that boxers can be smart and chess players are n't weinies .
Roller Coaster
Chess is n't about winning the game ; it 's about managing to play at all ( and get the photograph ) on a roller coaster !
To make playing the game more challenging without involving bodily risk , try 3 - way Chess .
You 'll need three people to play , and there are places on the board that give you a choice of moves , but the rules are basically the same as regular chess .
Other chess variants include 3d chess ( which honestly has no limit ) and Moebius chess ( see a picture here ) .
Or you can speed things up by playing blitz chess in a hurry .
The easiest way to make chess more interesting is to get a different chess set to play normal chess with .

Light can make a chess set beautiful .
Illuminated Onyx chess tables are table tops made from translucent stone .
They appear as a regular table when unlit .
The chessboard square only appear when the light is on !
Available in several shades of natural translucent onyx .
Daan Van
Tulder designed this lighted chess set made of PMMA acrylic glass .
LEDS in the board provide light , and the pieces are distinguished by transparent vs. frosted .
The Alice Chess Set by Yasmin Sethi was inspired by the story of Alice Through the Looking Glass .
The pieces all have the same mirror finish , but when they touch the chess board , the cover becomes transparent and the type of piece can be seen .
The Chessboard is made out of LightPoints a material manufactured by Schott , which is glass that has LED 's embedded in it ; the pieces are coated with Mirona , a Material that turns transparent when light shines through it .
When the piece is placed on the board it completes the circuit and lights up the LED under it turning it transparent , like magic .
MegaChess has traditional chess sets in a variety of materials and sizes ( all large ) .
The pieces range from 11 inches up to 12 foot inflatables .
They also offer topiary frames so you can grow your potted shrubs into chess pieces !
Here 's a chess set that looks good enough to eat - and you can !
Designer Biggles made cookie cutters in the shapes of various chess pieces .
When you take your opponent 's pieces , they could be gone forever .
Drinking chess works along the same lines .
Combining chess and a drinking game , you could either take a drink for a successful capture , or force your opponent to take a drink when losing a man .
Which method you use would depend on whether you are wagering money on the outcome .
You see these for sale all over near Christmas .
Alternately designed chess pieces range from the whimsical to the truly tasteless .
A subclass of chess sets are designed to resemble real people .
Civil War sets often feature Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis as kings , with famous generals in other roles and foot soldiers in blue and gray as pawns .
As another example of chess pieces designed to resemble real people , this set was created by Norma Jean Almodovar to illustrate the strategy in the OJ Simpson trial .
Even the pawns are each modeled after a real participant !
The trouble in playing with such a set is that you 'd have to know who each piece represents and whether they were on the prosecution or the defense team .
The Iraqi Quagmire chess set is another modeled after real people , although not a playable set due to the shape of the board .
Hermann MejÃ­a designed it for Mad Magazine .
You can make a chess set out of just about anything , as long as you can identify the role of the pieces .

What can you do with a PhD in UFOs ?
Martin Plowman is about to find out .
This Saturday , the University of Melbourne will award Plowman Australia 's first - ever graduate degree in ufology .
Do you wish you could write your thesis on flying saucers ?
Click through to see just what such a course of study entails .
Plowman , whose studies focus on culture and communication , has traveled around the world to investigate claims of extraterrestrial activity .
But rather than attempt to determine the veracity of these claims , Plowman merely documents them and examines how culture and contemporary scientific understanding impact how people attempt to explain these phenomena :
" Having a look at it , I realised this was a whole world unto itself , " he said .
" It had rules , and ideas and history and it had n't been looked at much , so my enthusiasm [ for UFOs ] came back and I thought this is a story that I want to look at . "

He also discusses the experiences of people coming to terms with alleged alien abductions :
" They seem like something has happened to them …
The first time you meet an abductee , as they are called , it can be quite confronting because they are trying to come to terms with it .
They do n't know what it is either , and it is something that can stay with people a long time . "

The Accuracy International Arctic Warfare Super Magnum was the first factory sniper rifle chambered in .338 Lapua .
In the early 1980's , the U.S Navy sought a new cartridge for long - range competition .
Research Armament Industries ( RAI ) developed a .338 caliber wildcat using a rimless .416 Rigby case .
After a few years of testing the .338/.416 , U.S. Armed Forces lost interest and chose to focus on the .50 BMG instead .
Lapua picked up the pieces , strengthened the case design , and created the .338 Lapua Magnum cartridge .
The .338 Lapua splits the difference between .308 sniper rifles and .50 BMG anti-materiel rifles , with an effective range of 1500 yards against man-sized targets .
Rifles chambered in .338 Lapua are the same size and weight as other long - action calibers like .300 Winchester Magnum , or about half the weight of a .50 BMG rifle .
This makes a dramatic difference in mobility for shooter and spotter teams .
Accuracy International ( AI ) was established in 1978 by World Champion rifle shooter Malcom Cooper along with Dave Walls and Dave Caig .
They produced one of the first modern sniper rifles , the Precision Marksman ( PM ) , which was adopted by the British as the L96 in 1985 .
AI modified the rifle to work better in arctic environments and this Arctic Warfare ( AW ) model was adopted by the Swedish Army in 1990 .
They had a vision for a multi- purpose long - range sniper caliber and this idea came to fruition in the Arctic Warfare Super Magnum ( AWSM ) sniper rifle chambered in .338 Lapua , which was adopted as the L115A1 in British service .
The AWSM has a Winchester - style three - way safety , two - way adjustable trigger , and easy - to - operate magazine release .
The dimples visible on the rear of the bolt body help keep the action running in dirty conditions .
The AWSM receiver has a built - in proprietary dovetail for the AI single - piece scope mounts , or the rifle can be ordered with a permanently - mounted Picatinny rail .
Its bolt has six lugs , in two in - line sets of three , which provide a short 60 - degree bolt throw and low bolt profile .
The bolt has an external claw extractor and a standard spring - loaded ejector .
Screwed into the receiver is a 27 - inch fluted stainless cut - rifled barrel , threaded on the muzzle end for the factory brake or a sound suppressor .
The flat - bottomed AI receiver is permanently bonded to an aluminum chassis that extends from the butt - stock to front of the forend .
Stock - side " skins " are then clam - shelled around the chassis to create the stock .
Because of this design , the rifle is unaffected by environmental changes ; bedding is not required .
The AWSM is also available with a robust folding stock .

Bush Administration will keep secret ' grim ' Afghanistan report quiet until after election John Byrne
Published : Tuesday September 23 , 2008
Print This Email
This A secret US intelligence report which says the political and military situation in Afghanistan is " grim " will be withheld from the public until after the election , a new report says .
Intelligence officials are finishing up the National Intelligence Estimate on Aghanistan , according to ABC's Brian Ross , " but there are ' no plans to declassify ' any of it before the election , " an official said .
Keeping the intelligence report under wraps would likely help Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) .
McCain has focused on what he sees as the success of the Iraq " surge , " in which the US added troops to lessen violence .
Attention to problems in Afghanistan would put the spotlight on President Bush 's failures , which might rub off on the Republican presidential nominee .
" According to people who have been briefed , the NIE will paint a ' grim ' picture of the situation in Afghanistan , seven years after the US invaded in an effort to dismantle the al Qaeda network and its Taliban protectors , " Ross writes .
Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen told Congress last week the US is struggling to retain control .
" I 'm not convinced we 're winning it in Afghanistan , " he said , adding , " we 're running out of time . "
" Absent a broader international and interagency approach to the problems there , it is my professional opinion that no amount of troops in no amount of time can ever achieve all the objectives we seek in Afghanistan , " he said .
This aligns with the opinions of commanders on the ground .
According to a report in Tuesday 's Wall Street Journal , the US military expects the Taliban to launch a " winter offensive , " which would mean a spike in violence in an area that has , at least for the recent past , been more quiet .
" I do think there will be an increase in violence by the enemy in order to maintain a general sense of insecurity , " Brig .
Gen. Mark Milley , deputy commander of the U.S. forces in eastern Afghanistan , told the paper .
" The winter fighting season this year will be more violent than in previous years . "
A spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , Vanee Vines , told Ross " it is not the [ National Intelligence Director ] 's policy to publicly comment on national intelligence products that may or may not be in production . "
National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell has said that he does n't believe intelligence estimates should be made public , though several have recently been released , including one that detailed the US intelligence community 's position on Iran 's nuclear program .
The National Intelligence Estimate reflects the consensus view of 17 government agencies .
I just watched this 2003 TED Talk video lecture by Wade Davis , the pioneering ethnobotanist and anthropologist who has lived with an amazing array of indigenous cultures around the world .
Of course , Davis is best known for his studies of ritual use of psychedelics and also the zombification practices among Vodoun acolytes in Haiti .
I 've found Davis 's work to be personally inspirational , provocative , and mind - expanding .
This TED Talk , titled " Cultures At The Far Edge of the World " is no exception .
In it , he tells an amazing story about an wonderfully resourceful Inuit elder .
Davis retold the same story in a recent Discover magazine interview , but I highly recommend the TED video too because it features many his breathtaking photographs .
From Discover :
One of the cultures you celebrate in Light at the Edge of the World is the Inuit .
What do you most admire about them ?
Davis :
The Inuit did n't fear the cold ; they took advantage of it .
During the 1950s the Canadian government forced the Inuit into settlements .
A family from Arctic Bay told me this fantastic story of their grandfather who refused to go .
The family , fearful for his life , took away all of his tools and all of his implements , thinking that would force him into the settlement .
But instead , he just slipped out of an igloo on a cold Arctic night , pulled down his caribou and sealskin trousers , and defecated into his hand .
As the feces began to freeze , he shaped it into the form of an implement .
And when the blade started to take shape , he put a spray of saliva along the leading edge to sharpen it .
That 's when what they call the " shit knife " took form .
He used it to butcher a dog .
Skinned the dog with it .
Improvised a sled with the dog's rib cage , and then , using the skin , he harnessed up an adjacent living dog .
He put the shit knife in his belt and disappeared into the night .
Newly discovered bacterial alchemists could help save billions of plastic bottles from landfill .
The Pseudomonas strains can convert the low - grade PET plastic used in drinks bottles into a more valuable and biodegradable plastic called PHA .
PHA is already used in medical applications , from artery - supporting tubes called stents to wound dressings .
The plastic can be processed to have a range of physical properties .
However , one of the barriers to PHA reaching wider use is the absence of a way to make it in large quantities .
The new bacteria - driven process – termed upcycling – could address that , and make recycling PET bottles more economically attractive .

PET bugs
Although billions of plastic bottles are made each year , few are ultimately recycled .
Just 23.5 % of US bottles were recycled in 2006 .
This is because the recycling process simply converts the low value PET bottles into more PET , says Kevin O’Connor at University College Dublin , Ireland .
“ We wanted to see if we could turn the plastic into something of higher value in an environmentally friendly way , ” he says .
O’Connor and colleagues knew that heating PET in the absence of oxygen – a process called pyrolysis – breaks it down into terephthalic acid ( TA ) and a small amount of oil and gas .
They also knew that some bacteria can grow and thrive on TA , and that other bacteria produce a high - value plastic PHA when stressed .
So they wondered whether any bacteria could both feed on TA and convert it into PHA .
Bacteria hunt
“ It was a long shot to be honest , ” says O’Connor .
His team studied cultures from around the world known to grow on TA , but none produced PHA .
So they decided to look for undiscovered strains , in environments that naturally contain TA .
Analysing soil bacteria from a PET bottle processing plant , which are likely to be exposed to small quantities of TA , yielded 32 colonies that could survive in the lab using TA as their only energy source .
After 48 hours they screened each culture for PHA .
Three cultures , all similar to known strains of Pseudomonas , accumulated detectable quantities of the valuable plastic .
The next step is to improve the efficiency of the process , says O’Connor .
“ A quarter to a third of each cell is filled with plastic – we want to increase that to 50 to 60 % . ”
Less landfill
Sudesh Kumar , a microbiologist at the University of Science , Malaysia , in Penang , is impressed with the study .
“ There are many other systems that are economically more viable to produce PHA with better material properties , ” he says .
“ But Kevin ’s work offers an interesting novel approach to solve the problem of PET accumulation in landfill dumps . ”
But it is still unlikely that using the new approach alone will appeal to industry , O’Connor says .
“ Working with this kind of environmental technology in isolation , the chances of success are reduced , ” he says .
The best approach , he continues , would be to use the new bacteria as just one part of a bio - refinery capable of upcycling an array of waste products in an environmentally friendly way .

After the Phoenix Suns NBA basketball team announced last week that they were installing solar panels as part of a new green initiative , now things only seem to be getting better for the environment when it comes to the efforts of professional sports teams .
The Philadelphia Eagles NFL football team announced on Sunday that they have paid a company for enough wind power to cover their energy needs for this year as part of their ongoing “ Go Green ” initiative .
These needs include powering their stadium , Lincoln Financial Field , and also their training complex .
The Eagles claim that they are the first team in the NFL to obtain all of their energy from a sustainable source ( and we are n’t talking about Campbell ’s Chunky Soup ) .
Jeffrey Lurie , the owner of the Eagles was quoted as saying , “ Since 2003 , when we launched ‘ Go Green , ’ the Eagles have made it a very , very top priority of our organization , and our football team … to lead the way as best we can , set a good example — in the corporate world and in the sports world ‚ of what you can do to be responsible with the environment . ”
Prior to their recent purchase of wind power , the Eagles have had considerable success reducing their energy consumption .
Since they started their “ Go Green ” program , they have lowered their energy use by approximately 30 % .
Earlier this year the team also helped pay for and plant more than 1500 trees and shrubs on a 6.5 acre parcel of land in Pennsylvania ’s Neshaminy State Park .
The new area is known as the “ Eagles Forest ” and is estimated to serve as an equivalent offset for the carbon emissions produced when the team travels to their away games .

a videogame developed by nintendo
and published by nintendo
for the nintendo famicom / entertainment system , the nintendo gameboy advance , the nintendo playchoice - 10 , the nintendo super famicom / entertainment system and the nintendo wii virtual console
text by tim rogers 4 stars # 02 Bottom line : super mario bros .
3 is “ a lifelong obsession . ”
So much psychology pulls strings behind the scenes of Super Mario Bros. 3 , and some of it does n’t even belong to me .
Super Mario Bros. 3 was born of a multi-tiered adolescence : it was our first , it was games ’ only , it was Shigeru Miyamoto ’s second .
Videogames , born to be the entertainment industry ’s stepchild , had nearly drowned under a flood of Atari 2600 E.T. : The Game cartridges ; rescued by a kind - hearted and inexplicably Japanese farmer just around the river bend , they overcame the amnesia that comes when the brain is deprived of oxygen in the best possible way : by never remembering the past .
Urban legend tells us that Shigeru Miyamoto was introduced to Nintendo because his father knew the then - president Hiroshi Yamauchi .
Urban legend continues to tell us that Miyamoto walked into the interview with some tentative sketches of a toy - like phone .
He was told , yeah , that ’s nice , though we want you to make a videogame .
Shigeru Miyamoto went on to prove himself the most boring kind of genius : the kind who can walk face - first into anything and excel at it .
There can be no higher compliment for a creator of world - class entertainment , really .
Before it was a videogame , Donkey Kong was an experiment conducted and carried out in Shigeru Miyamoto ’s brain within the space of probably about fourteen seconds ( coincidentally , also the length of a Super Mario Bros. 3 world map loop ) .
The question was “ How to fit a cinematic narrative into Pac - Man “ , which did n’t even end in a question mark ( this is crucial ) .
The game was n’t a masterpiece so much as it was so chaotically different from the one - screen affairs of the day as to illuminate various masterpiece - like possibilities .
In Donkey Kong , the lonely fact that the hero can jump took center stage in game centers worldwide .
The chief brilliance of the game design is something that has remarkably not been equalled since : the antagonist and the protagonist are visible on the game screen at all times .
“ Visual language ” is one of the big words game designers throw around , though usually it ’s applied to questions like “ How can we get the player to know that this switch opens this door without resorting to a text box ? ”
In Donkey Kong , the visual language consists of all of the on - screen graphics churning together like a Rube Goldberg machine : hero at the bottom of the screen , large monkey with captive girl at the top , barrels rolling down steel inclines .
In some games , so much jumping feels superfluous ; what common - sense - minded human being could see Donkey Kong and imagine an equivalent real - life situation where jumping was not the way to avoid those barrels ?
Donkey Kong had been Shigeru Miyamoto ’s feet - wetting exercise .
In later years , when asked if he thought games were art , he would reply “ absolutely not ” .
It ’s clear that something changed Miyamoto ’s mind — Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Junior ( in which , in a duality worthy of a game of a Pac - Man power - pill rampage , you play as the gorilla ’s son , attempting to rescue your dad from Mario ) had exhibited strong cinematic aspirations , though by Mario Bros. , that all seemed out of Miyamoto and friends ’ systems .
Now , the simple act of pressing a button and seeing the on - screen character jump was both the most fun one could have with the game and the focal point for all the game design .
Miyamoto went from selling experiences to packing comprehensively joyous physicality into single button presses .
Whereas before the point had been to rescue the girl and see the story to its conclusion , now the point was to press the buttons and enjoy doing it .
This paradigm shift no doubt came about because the developers themselves realized the potential ( financial or otherwise ) for games that were “ About ” Having Fun .
Hindsight allows us to identify this as both the Big Bang that birthed literally every good videogame that has ever been made and the start of a two - decade six - hundred - mile - per - hour shrieking death spiral that crash - landed us face - first into Super Mario Galaxy in 2007 .
Before we can get to that , however , we have to talk about Super Mario Bros .
Eventually , Donkey Kong ‘s cinematic flair and Mario Bros .‘s love of button - pushing met each other halfway in Super Mario Bros. , (****) which may or may not be The Most Important Game Ever Made .
Miyamoto ’s artistry had certainly been moving toward the abstract with Mario Bros . — why these two plumbers are killing all these turtles in this sewer is a question that can be answered simply with “ so the turtles do n’t kill them ” , which is an answer that makes more or less sense when you ’re high ( depending on the drug ) — Super Mario Bros. struck a miraculous note by allowing our imaginations to fill in the context of the abstract .
The game begins with our hero , Mario , facing the right .
He must now run to the right .
The “ visual language ” communicates the character ’s goal in a dreamlike fashion to the player : our hero is standing just to the left of the screen , facing right .
Finish three stages , and Mario enters a castle .
The castle feels different — more dangerous — than the other levels .
Ropes of fire swing slowly in our path ; eventually , fireballs begin soaring at us from the right side of the screen , and for the first time , we feel truly threatened : something seeks to stop our quest from left to right , by moving right to left .
This is not something that has n’t happened before , though it ’s especially alarming this time because it ’s not an enemy character — it ’s very clearly discernible as a projectile , fired from an unseen weapon .
We meet the weapon , on a bridge : it ’s a turtle - dragon .
We reach for the gleaming axe .
The bridge breaks , the dragon falls .
Our hero moves on ; a humanoid thing ( humanoid = “ obviously friendly ” ) with a mushroom on top of his head thanks us for the rescue , and then regrets to inform us that the princess is in another castle .
Even if we ’ve never seen the instruction manual , even if we ’ve never earned the skills to get as far as the first dragon , we probably know there ’s a princess that needs rescuing .
We know this because , back in 1985 , people talked about videogames differently than they talked about videogames now .
Whether it was on the playground or around the water cooler in an office where people tended to wear pocket - protectors , pretty much the only way you were going to learn something about a videogame without playing it thoroughly yourself was by sharing information with other real live people .
There was no GameFAQs in 1985 — there was n’t even an internet .
When Super Mario Bros. debuted , it was a new and exciting kind of challenge .
It was an epic quest .
It was huge .
Mind - sharing sessions re : Super Mario Bros. were probably incredible by today ’s videogame standards .
These days , you might hear two ( Japanese ) people talking about the best weapons / team formation to take into a particular Monster Hunter quest , or two ( American ) people talking about how to win that massive gunfight by the Ferris wheel in Call of Duty 4 , though the suggested solutions always involve such concrete means :
“ Put the C4 on top of the cars and detonate it when the helicopters show up ” ; “ Be sure to have one guy with a long bow and another guy with a sword ” .
Super Mario Bros. , a game where 90 % of the soul is level design , and 90 % of the level design lives and breathes in incidental encounters between the hero and an enemy , must have required some amazing conversational flexing for the adults of the era .
Thirty years earlier , the same people might have felt like “ part of ” something in the Beat literature movement ; there they were , in 1985 , making wild flapping hand gestures and raising the pitches of their voices in the name of articulating just how Mario must tweak his jump around that block before that one Hammer Brother , or just what speed he must be running before jumping onto that one trampoline in World 8 - 3 .
Years and legends later , Shigeru Miyamoto would claim to have drawn the inspiration for his inverted real - time strategy game Pikmin from his newly matured love of tending a real - world vegetable garden .
In Pikmin , the player controls a marooned spaceman who takes advantage of friendly aliens to solve various situations that stand between him and repairing his spaceship .
The most important point of this paragraph is that Shigeru Miyamoto , creator of Donkey Kong and Super Mario , “ grew up ” to be the kind of adult who loves growing his own vegetables .
Years before this — one year before Super Mario Bros. , even — there was a game called The Tower of Druaga .
This game was essentially Pac - Man with a human protagonist .
And not just any human protagonist — a knight named Gilgamesh .
Gilgamesh had a quest : to rescue a princess who had been kidnapped by a demon named Druaga , who lived at the top of a sixty - floor tower .
Gil ’s duty was to wander the tower , slaying slime monsters with his sword , blocking fireballs with his shield , and finding semi-randomly placed keys with which to open the semi-randomly placed door on each floor .
The hilarious catch of Druaga was that a player could climb all the way to the sixtieth floor , only to learn that he cannot win the game because he does not possess the necessary “ hidden treasures ” .
The “ hidden treasures ” in Druaga are the alpha and the omega if you ’re talking about kleptomania as videogame design .
On each floor , the location of the “ treasure ” is different , as are the criteria for unlocking it .
The player starts each floor in a different location , and the layout of the maze floors are semi-random ( one of many recognizable templates selected at random ) though the treasure will always be in the same place of its respective floor on each playthrough .
Some of the criteria for unlocking a treasure are alarmingly complex : stand in a particular square , face north , press the attack button fourteen times , step one square to the left , face south , press the attack button three times , step two squares right , face west , press the attack button eight times ( I ’m exagerrating slightly ) , and a treasure appears in a remote square visible to the player .
Watching a play - through of Druaga on YouTube will yield only questions in the mind of the uninitiated viewer ; chief among those questions might be “ why would someone want to play this ? ”
In this day and age where Druaga is remade with polygons , paid tribute in dungeons in larger RPGs , the subject of many online strategy guides , and stuffed into portable classics compilations which are kind enough to include a list of the treasure locations and requirements in the instruction manual , it may be a tough question to answer .
The solution to the mystery is that the overflowing crypticism was the whole point of Druaga .
No , the means for obtaining treasures were not originally published in “ videogame magazines ” : this was 1984 .
And no , there was no million - dollar reward for the first person to complete the game .
Hypothetically , someone somewhere at Namco imagined a future of videogames that were n’t all about numbers — they would be about seeing a quest through to its end .
Only Druaga ‘s execution was a little underhanded .
Not a single text window within the game informed the player that he would have to do idiotic things to find the treasures on each floor .
Instead , there were some treasures that the player would get accidentally , slowly conditioning a kind of Pavlovian response that eventually wallowed in ticking despair .
The player would mash the attack button furiously on one square of the dungeon , maybe pressing it three hundred times before the timer ran out and the game was over .
Then he would make a tick mark in his notebook : “ It ’s definitely not that one square . ”
At least , this is how it would work in theory .
Druaga failed to set the world on fire , probably because it came off as a little bit too moody and perhaps even mean - spirited .
The idea was that people would find the locations of treasures and then communicate them to their friends , and surely enough , the people of the world surprised even the software engineers .
Eventually , as more of the game ’s iceberg came into view , people became able to “ appreciate ” the game ; Druaga - loving communities would sprout up in arcades ; men would become walking Druaga encyclopedias .
Shigeru Miyamoto had studied Pac - Man prior to making Donkey Kong ; Druaga had no doubt been influenced by Donkey Kong ‘s narrative aspirations , among other things .
Miyamoto has admitted , in the past , to having been strongly influenced by the “ community ” aspect of Druaga .
Think about it —
Miyamoto would later fall in love with gardening , and design a game “ based ” on it .
It was his idea to make Pokemon traded between players of Pokemon on the Gameboy level up faster than Pokemon obtained in the wild .
Back in the Gamecube era , when Miyamoto ’s name had become the flag flapped furiously by many men devoting their lives to writing about videogames , it was Miyamoto ’s growing influence that saw Nintendo focusing its entire business strategy upon seemingly trifling concepts , like the ability to plug your Gameboy Advance into the Gamecube and use it as a second screen ; this birthed Pac - Man Vs. , which was too brilliant for its own good ( still waiting for a DS version ) and Zelda : Four Swords , which was too brilliant for anyone ‘s good ( still waiting for a DS version ) .
Nintendo floundered in despair , back then , until finally , by digging in the same frightening direction , they struck a vein of liquid money .
Nintendo did n’t get rich by changing their game or eyeing the market : they got rich by being selfish and stubborn and not changing anything .
The world has almost always had trouble catching up with Shigeru Miyamoto , see ; the somewhat ironic reason that the DS and the Wii found success in the first place is because at this point in time , there exist more than enough man-boys like us who remember a near - religious first encounter with Super Mario Bros .
and proclaim the man ’s name from the mountaintops .
When Nintendo ’s resident leatherfaced old codger stepped down from presidential duties and a man who had actually played a videogame before was voted up , Miyamoto was elevated , by his own suggestion , to a role of overseeing producer .
At present , he “ only ” does things like think of raw concepts such as Wii Fit — a game based on his newly found appreciation for the daily activity of weighing one ’s self , and idle musing about how one might make a videogame controller out of a scale — and though many gamers whine and moan about Miyamoto ’s “ decreased involvement ” in games , we here at Action Button Dot Net are all for it : we are capable of looking at his 1986 work The Legend of Zelda ( ****) and declaring that this is a man whose only interest in videogames lies in using them as a tool with which to conduct infinitely amusing experiments on the public .
He ’s casting stones into a pond and watching the ripples .
( He ’ll probably make a game about casting stones into a pond , someday . )
Miyamoto had vocally appreciated Tower of Druaga for its ability to reach outside the game and inspire players to write things down and share conversations with fellow players .
He wanted to do something similar with Zelda — where certain unassuming bushes can be burned down or certain unassuming wall tiles can be bombed , revealing staircases leading to underground caves where players can earn money or buy items .
The “ second quest ” of the game , opened after completing the first quest , goes so far as to hide the majority of its dungeon entrances in completely obscure and arbitrary places .
The game was structured this way , no doubt , to provoke conversation among friends .
“ Viral marketing ” is n’t a new concept — it ’s just one that got named recently .
It ’s highly probable that Zelda is as good as it is precisely because Miyamoto had tried to play Druaga himself , and found it not at all immediately interesting .
Druaga was the kind of game , back in its day , that players most likely got involved in by way of peer pressure .
It was the Mount Everest of games : people were climbing it because it was “ There ” .
For Miyamoto , one - upping Druaga meant taking its core — the spirit of arcane information - gathering and lore - sharing — and transplanting it into something that was immediately interesting to himself .
For Miyamoto , one - upping Druaga with Zelda was not game design : it was basic arithmetic .
Then and there , we can surmise , is where Miyamoto officially stopped playing videogames for good .
Zelda ‘s pop-culture miracle was two - fold .
It was a miracle because it established what would go on to become a whole new format of entertainment , and it was a miracle because it saw a group of people who had previously performed a pop-culture miracle ( Super Mario Bros . ) turning around and performing another one , as if on demand , with something just about completely unrelated .
Everything about the two games — Mario and Zelda — was as different as night and day .
Yet they were both so mathematically well - crafted , with their own delicate atmospheres , play nuances , and amazingly well - composed music .
It ’s a damn shame that we might never see a developer be brave enough to try this same stunt again .
The second Super Mario Bros. game ( ****) saw Miyamoto and crew getting playful with level design , incorporating a wind environment effect and giving Mario and Luigi different jump physics .
The second Zelda outing ( ****) was highly misunderstood , and violently awesome .
The tip of the disease came into view , as kids on the playground said that Zelda II was n’t as good as Zelda , because it was n’t exactly the same .
What Zelda II managed to do was stuff the original concept with even deeper — and better telegraphed — Druaga-isms , until it became quiveringly close to a videogame genre in and of itself .
1987 ’s Zelda II was the first and last game of its precise kind ; 1988 ’s Super Mario Bros.
3 was the beginning of the next era .
That era has not yet ended .
It ’s funny — this kind of game design does n’t work , anymore , because of YouTube playthrough videos , GameFAQ walkthroughs , and institutionalized strategy - guide - writing .
Back when game - playing circles were groups of real - life friends sharing crib notes , it worked ; now , the whole world is connected .
No one gets stuck anymore because of level design alone , so games find it absolutely necessary to clutter themselves up with numbers and heads - up - display interfaces .
When videogame magazines such as Japan ’s Weekly Famitsu began to rise to prominence in the late 1980s , unimaginative game developers had nowhere to run : if their riddles and puzzles were n’t clever enough , the semi-conscientous minds at Famitsu would figure them out and print the solutions .
There were a couple of lawsuits about that , actually .
This was around when the big hullaballoo got raised about game rentals in Japan : mainly , Nintendo was against letting people rent the games , though the fact that the games could be completed over the course of a rental was not the renter ’s fault .
It was the game designers ’ .
Eventually , the development community ’s reaction to the rental situation was to make games with severely padded lengths .
The genre of “ Japanese role - playing game ” seems to have been cultivated exclusively for the purpose of convincing players to buy instead of rent .
Much as we like Dragon Quest over here , it ’s easy to admit that the first few installments in the series severely punish players for not spending a lot of empty hours walking in circles before entering a dungeon or other dangerous place .
There would still be games in the old mold — games that relish the thought of exquisitely carved environments and labyrinthine secrets , icebergs underneath icebergs underneath icebergs , all the way down ( until you hit the solid rock wall called “ THE END ” ) — though once the idea of a guidebook existed , it made the whole experience feel emptier than nothing .
To this day , players exists who will purchase the latest Zelda adventure and salivate from start to finish , shunning any and all guidebooks , and though we here find recent Zelda adventures to be kind of stuff , we can salute those people : you are hardcore , Button - Actioning Warriors .
The psychology behind all these old - mold games , though , prevents most Normal Human Beings from playing them : take Metroid II : The Return of Samus , on the Nintendo Gameboy , for example .
Consider this a Professor Layton puzzle :
In all games in the Metroid series , you can find myriads of hidden passageways by bombing the floor or walls .
You have an infinite supply of bombs .
Later Metroid games usually hide only pathways to optional things ( maximum missile stock upgrades , et cetera ) .
Metroid II , the second game in the series , very often hides pathways that are needed to progress in the main thrust of the game .
The final clue in this puzzle : Metroid II also gifts the player , early on , with the “ Spider Ball ” ability — which now lets us roll up walls and onto ceilings , so we can bomb any tile on the screen ( note : it is not necessary to bomb every tile on the screen .
however , this does not stop the vast majority of players who play Metroid IIfrom bombing every tile on the screen for every screen . )
( Solution to the puzzle : Metroid II is n’t a masterpiece . )
Metroid II is the black hole that Shigeru Miyamoto and friends envisioned as they were crafting Zelda II .
Metroid II is a love - it - or - hate - it game , to be sure , and it ’s worth noting because the people who love it will without fail always be a certain kind of person : thorough , meticulous .
If you genuinely like spider - balling and ceiling - bombing , if you consider it the highest glory when you say that you originally cleared Metroid II without help from anyone — do n’t despair !
The Catholic Church accepts anyone , so long as they agree to one or two points about Jesus .
We hereby firmly acknowledge that there exists a fine line between games which are made to provoke friendly , organic discussion and games that are crafted with hopes of getting major kickbacks on strategy guide sales .
And then there ’s a bubble , floating off in space , with Metroid II and Phantasy Star II in it .
Protip : all strategy guides published in book form or within the pages of Weekly Famitsu have been , since 1989 , written with close cooperation from the developers , if not actually written by the developers themselves .
So. Super Mario Bros . 3 .
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT THE GAME NOW
( Kind of . )
So , so many things can go wrong in platform - action game design .
You either end up with a good game , a great game , nothing , or fired .
Good games can become pop-culture events ; bad games can be pseudo pop-culture events .
Great games can be boring .
High on life , Nintendo ’s Miyamoto Bunch had slapped together a wacky wall of ideas called “ Dream Factory : Doki Doki Panic ” .
What Super Mario Bros. had done for green sewage pipes and big green venus flytraps , Doki Doki Panic tried to do for red-and - white vases and bullet - spitting pythons .
Thematically , it came out of the same psychological place as Super Mario Bros . — that being the at - wall stuff - flinging part of the brain — and , though quite successful , it failed to earn immediate recognition as a masterpiece .
It was quite obvious , from the start , that the game really was just a reinterpretation of the Mario concept , with Middle - Eastern stereotypes in place of the Italian ones , with vases instead of pipes , pythons instead of venus flytraps .
You could stand on a vase and press down to go inside , just as you could go inside a pipe in Super Mario Bros .
The gimmick of the game was that you could pick things up , carry them , and throw them .
Stages often featured central puzzles , sometimes involving digging holes ( a riff on Dig - Dug , the genesis of Mister Driller ) or stacking blocks , building staircases .
The main thrust of the game design was to make the player feel like they were kind of always accomplishing something , a la a dungeon in Zelda , though with the brisk clip of a Super Mario adventure .
As game design , Doki Doki Panic was actually deeply admirable ; however , the public was already infected with sequelitis : they were wondering where Mario was .
I wonder how Miyamoto felt , when Doki Doki Panic was re-branded as “ Super Mario Bros. 2 ” in America , and went on to sell more than it sold in Japan ?
It ’s common knowledge , these days , that Miyamoto was n’t getting any royalties , so the money must not have meant anything to him ; and he said in an interview around the release of Super Mario World in 1990 that every time the Mario team makes a new game , they “ swear to never do another one ” .
What Doki Doki Panic ‘s re-branding in the West had done was both confirm the Kyoto - Yakuza - pachinko - parlor - owning parent company ’s suspicion that people liked Mario more than they could possibly like anything new and prove , kind of sideways - like , that Doki Doki Panic had perhaps been too “ complicated ” .
So it was in that great centrifuge Super Mario Bros. 3 was born .
The “ adventure ” was pried away from the “ action ” , and the “ world map ” came into being .
No platform - action - adventure game that mattered would ever be without one again .
( Seriously , Bubsy does n’t matter , and Sonic does n’t count , because he was something else . )
Super Mario Bros. 3 is Miyamoto and friends adapting on the spot to a subtly warped world .
At the time of its release — and even today , if you ask the right person — it was the biggest and most generous videogame that had ever existed , impenetrable to strategy guides , as short or as long as you wanted it to be , imaginative , bright , bold , flowing , absolutely effortlessly natural at all times .
The following years would see dozens of money - sign - irised game developers attempt to slap together something reminiscient of Super Mario Bros .
3 ; they ’d write their design documents like they were filling out a checklist , expecting lightning to strike as many times as they wanted .
These people were burglars walking right into a house where the alarm was already ringing , and getting their faces smashed into the pavement ; they will spend the rest of their lives being asked where the hecking diamonds are , and they will never be able to answer , because they do n’t know .
Super Mario Bros. 3 is absolutely effortless .
It possesses the same slapdashery of previous Shigeru Miyamoto concoctions , though it also has a home - team advantage .
Super Mario ’s birth had been a painful , slow process .
The first game and the first sequel saw the hero graduated , loved , and now publicly permitted to take risks .
Miyamoto and company only had to flesh out the Mario mythos with the broadest strokes possible .
Instead of walking into a castle and rescuing a mushroom man at the end of every world , Mario now boards an airship .
Why ?
Because airships are cool , and because it gives the level designers reasons to play around with fixed - scrolling stages , like one of the many popular fixed - scrolling shooters at the time .
Mario must retrieve a magic wand in order to transform a mushroom king from an animal back into a human .
Why are the mushroom kings humans ?
For the same reason the princess is a human , of course .
What ’s weirder , then , that they ’re humans to begin with , or that they ’re transformed into domesticated animals like dogs ?
The magic wands are under the control of King Koopa ’s kids .
Where the hell did he get kids ?
Who cares ?
About halfway through each world , there ’s a “ Mini Fortress ” , with a dim - witted boss .
The very first Mini Fortress is home of the very first magic wand , which can take you immediately to the first warp zone .
Structurally , the game is a mess .
Yet it perseveres through its own messiness with the weirdest grace .
One need only play the first two stages before one faces a choice of which stage to play next — three or four — and if one dies in either stage , one might try the other stage .
It ’s around this point , way back in 1988 , that the game has already triumphed , and emerged as the reason developers still hesitate to make an action game without an ice world , a sky world , a desert world , a jungle world , a sea world , and a grass world .
Miyamoto and friends were free of the responsibility to think of “ original ” concepts , and this is what allowed them to be so “ creative ” with Super Mario Bros .
3 . Though their game would ultimately end up the source for many game designers ’ checklists , it can only be seen as the result of a checklist that popped up within its own development : if we ’re going to have stages that scroll to the right , why not have stages that scroll to the left ?
If we ’re going to have horizontal fixed scroll stages , we have to have vertical as well .
And diagonal .
If we ’re going to have pipes that the player can enter and then exit without the screen fading , why not build a maze out of those ?
If Mario can walk over these little indestructible evil plants only when he ’s invincible , let ’s make a stage wherein Mario has to chain - grab invincibility stars to keep running over these guys .
So much can go wrong with a platform action game , as . . . many platform - action games have proven over the years .
Hell , here in the 21st century , we ’re seeing plenty of things going drastically wrong with copycat brain - training games : ugly pencil sound effects , too - bright background colors , not enough questions .
It ’s enough to make one heave a ten - pound sigh : the developers of these games will fail to sell their target , and the world will ultimately conclude that focus - testing is the answer .
No , common sense is the answer .
Nintendo is lucky to have someone like Shigeru Miyamoto : whether he ’s an artist or a genius or not , he certainly possesses enough common sense to make sure that Super Mario Bros. 3 feels fun .
I take it Miyamoto probably never actually played Super Mario Bros. 3 as a “ game ” — and this is probably the highest compliment we can award it .
Rather , all that interested Miyamoto was the simple friction of moving Mario around on the screen .
Later platform games ( like , say , Donkey Kong Country ) would overcompensate in other areas ( graphical , “ story ” ) while neglecting to make the game feel competently , immediately interesting to someone just picking up a controller and pressing the control pad in a random direction .
There ’s more loving friction in Mario ’s one - timer - click crawl - to - walk acceleration than in most other games ’ actual level design .
The friction and the physics had always been a huge part of who Super Mario is .
It ’s hardly conspiracry - theoryism to conjecture that Miyamoto ’s biggest interest in the design of the games lay in the acceleration of Mario ’s run , the tweakable arc of his jump , and the momentous screech of his halts and turnarounds — which probably would have not happened were it not for stalwart programmer / co-director Takashi Tezuka .
We have Super Mario Bros. , where Mario runs and jumps , and his only projectile weapon is thrown at a very calculated downward 45 - degree angle , and bounces peculiarly when it hits the ground .
We have Super Mario Bros. 2 ( Japanese version ) , where the only “ advancement ” over the previous game is that Mario and Luigi have different physics sets — Luigi can jump higher , though more slowly , and takes longer to slow from a run .
When the Nintendo 64 and the 3D platform - action - adventure debuted with Super Mario 64 , many critics were quick to claim that the game was a revelation and / or amazing fun even if all you did was run Mario around outside the castle .
The big innovation of the Nintendo 64 , come to think of it , was the analog stick , which allowed 81 degrees of articulation to Mario ’s walking speed .
It ’s impossible to ignore : the physics are the most important part of Mario .
It ’s highly likely that Miyamoto only asked to play test the game three seconds at a time : “ not enough momentum ” , “ too much momentum ” , “ less glide on the jump landing ” .
The level designs that emerged from there on out were blessed with the knowledge of how it feels to control The Perfect Mario .
I imagine a ream of scribbly graph paper on a plastic folding table .
Add in the various power - up suits —
Mario the frog ( fast in water , little slow defenseless hops on land ) , Mario the raccoon ( that meticulous flight path , that nuanced runway approach ) — and the extra acceleration on slopes ( complete with rocket - like jumps off little ramps ) , and Super Mario Bros. 3 has easily ten times the friction of the original Super Mario Bros ..
As is the case with most every great game , the designers do n’t stop until they ’ve used every minute core mechanic — in this game , it ’s infinitely more nuanced than the palm - sized ability set of Lost Vikings : here , the player character ’s “ abilities ” range from the abstractly wonderful ( fireballs bouncing at peculiar angles , hammers flying straight up , moving an inch forward , and falling straight down : a kind of a meta - stomp , allowing Mario to kill an enemy as though he ’d jumped on it , only without jumping ) to the precise and microscopic ( the ability to curl Mario ’s jump in mid-air to just barely dodge a projectile and still land on a block ) .
There will be situations in Super Mario Bros .
3 where you can swim while holding a shell : this makes Mario go exponentially faster .
However , there ’s always a risk : the koopa might awaken , pop out of its shell , and hurt you .
In Super Mario Galaxy , there are parts where you must swim with a shell in your hands , and at these times , the shells are provided for free , from a dispenser - like meta-location , and there will never be a koopa inside to hurt you .
Where did the game design go ?
Super Mario Bros. 3 ‘s greater game design is about throwing caution to everything ; other developers failed to sell more copies than Super Mario Bros .
3 because they tried to make it “ better ” or “ cleaner ” .
Take the world map , for example : in the future , in Super Mario World 2 : Yoshi’s Island , Nintendo themselves would try to “ clean up ” the world map by making it a straight line .
Literally : all of the levels are oriented on a straight line , with a pastel , sketch - like background .
Each stage starts roughly where the last one left off — there ’s some kind of sketchy internal continuity .
Yoshi’s Island was recognizing that the world map scenes in Super Mario Bros .
3 were kind of superfluous , though it was simultaneously dead scared to excise them completely .
This is the kind of Nintendo we 21st Century Man-Boys grew up alongside : when it came time to make a baseball game starring Mario characters , Nintendo would include a Goomba as a playable character , because Goomba was their property , and when it came time for Goomba to step up to the plate , well , the bat was just going to have to hover outside Goomba ’s head , because it does n’t matter if Goomba did n’t have hands — he was Nintendo ’s property , and they were going to use him .
That said , Super Mario Bros.
3 succeeds flying - colorfully because of — somewhat ironically — all the waste .
When one is pure of heart and intention , when one has Millionaire Dysentery and is diarrheaing Texas Tea — as Miyamoto and company were — waste does n’t make the game clunky : it breeds lore .
So many little caution - to - everything hiccup - baubles litter Super Mario Bros .
3 ‘s landscapes — like the little blue road - stop in the middle of the ocean in the first half of World 3 ; the “ hand trap ” mini - level obstacle courses , lined up three in a row on screen two of World 8 , where you have a fifty - fifty chance of being dragged in and forced to play : lose , and you fall back to the beginning of the section ( the annoying thing is that they stand between you and the Hardest Airship In The Game , and you ’re going to be needing to make the trip from the start of the area to that airship plenty of times , because every time you die , it sends you back ) .
The game sometimes awards you with precious items like the P - Wing ( what the “ P ” stands for , we can only guess : “ Power ” ? ) , which literally lets you fly over a stage without having to touch the ground once , or the Lakitu cloud , which lets you fly over a stage in a completely different , more sheepish way — from the world map .
These items completely undermine the tens of man-hours that went into designing the levels that the player is going to guffaw and fly over or shrug and miss completely , and they only serve to strengthen the game ’s potential to become something we can play , never something we have played .
Like Metal Gear Solid , like a Treasure - crafted game of nuance , like any truly great piece of interactive electronic entertainment , our enjoyment of Super Mario Bros .
3 is dependent almost entirely on who we are when we play it .
Take Kuribo ’s shoe , for example : the “ rarest power - up item of all - time ” , according to many videogame magazines with literally nothing better to do .
Mario can obtain Kuribo ’s shoe in World 5 - 3 — and only in World 5 - 3 .
In order to obtain it , he has to hit the shoe - riding goomba ( “ Kuribo ” in Japanese — they did n’t localize his name re : the shoe for some reason in the English version , which merely adds to the lore factor ) from underneath .
This will pop the goomba out of the shoe .
Mario can now ride in the shoe , which hops at a distinctly sharper , lower , and faster angle than the frog suit .
What ’s the point of Kuribo ’s shoe ?
Tens of programming man-hours went into implementing it , and it ’s only available for one tiny stretch of the game .
The thing is , when one picks up Super Mario Bros .
3 , he might , on a whim , decide to not skip World 5 on his way to the end , just so he can have a little romp in the shoe .
In today ’s PowerBar - crunching game - design - by - spreadsheet capitalized “ Videogame Industry ” , this kind of design suggestion would get you slapped in the face , sent to the clinic for a drug test , and then fired twelve code - blasting minutes before the results came back .
Back during Nintendo ’s post - industry resurrection renaissance , it was just the kind of thing Shigeru Miyamoto and company did because they could .
Again : throwing caution to nothing .
When juvenile magazines interviewed Miyamoto regarding his favorite enemy monsters in the game , he provided insightful answers regarding the chain chomp , a violently snapping black iron ball with teeth , tethered to an immovable block .
He said he thought of the chain chomp one day when he saw a fierce dog chained to a fence , pitied it for a second , and then realized it was probably for the best .
The chain chomps appear very few times in the game ( I could tell you exactly how many times , though that would start to get kind of creepy ) , as do the invincible , ridable flying red beetles ( with a deliciously small and pointy player - damage hitbox in their mouth area ) .
There ’s precisely one stage where the Angry Sun swoops out of the sky to attack Mario , and it ’s in that stage where Mario can carry a turtle shell when he jumps at maximum velocity to physics - snap through a twirling tornado ; if you ’re lucky , you can turn in mid air and let go of the B button at just the right time to smash the sun out of the sky .
You might need a friend to demonstrate this to you .
There are levels that are neither numbered nor mini- fortresses nor end - of - world airships — like the “ quicksand desert ” , the “ pyramid ” , and the “ tower ” that connects the ground portion and the sky portion of World 5 — and the only level that can be played over and over again , forward or backward ( it ’s the penalty for falling back to the ground ) .
What a generous game , overflowing with little nooks and crannies , whole areas of world maps that the player might never know about until a friend showed them how to get a hammer from a wandering hammer brother and smash a rock .
And then there ’s a big lake shaped like a Roman numeral “ III ” .
Why is it shaped like a “ III ” ?
Because this is Super Mario Bros .
3 ? Because this is the third warp whistle ?
Little touches like the white blocks — which Mario can use to travel into the background of a stage if he stands in the middle of the block and holds down on the control pad for five seconds ( perhaps a direct Druaga reference ) .
Only in one instance does traveling into the background actually award Mario with anything tangible ( that being in World 1 - 3 , when Mario finds a Mushroom house behind the end - of - level curtain , with only one treasure box , containing a warp whistle ) .
Though once your friend tells you about that warp whistle , you begin to ache to tell someone else , and you might not realize for several days that there ’s a white block right at the start of the game .
This is how Super Mario Bros. 3 evolved over Super Mario Bros. : the first game began with a perfectly laid - out action sequence in a teacup , teaching you everything about the game in a sink - or - swim fashion .
Move right , hit block you can’t break , stomp or jump over enemy , hit “ ? ” block ( satisfying curiosity ) , become big , break block , jump over pipe , eventually see pit , jump over pit , grab fire flower , graduate from Super Mario University , and now see about getting a job .
Super Mario Bros. 3 nonchalantly shows you a venus flytrap in a green pipe , which may be a familiar sight : even if it ’s not a familiar sight , something feels different about it , because it ’s spitting fireballs .
The idea of a venus flytrap popping out of a green sewage pipe is weird enough — fireballs , though ?
And then there ’s that white block , which you do n’t notice until perhaps months later .
I can imagine the someday - gardener Miyamoto , brimming with enthusiasm about the White Blocks : they kept them secret until after the game had been released .
They did n’t let the cat out of the bag via any game magazines , either : they just let it spread naturally .
Maybe one of the programmers told his son , and saw what happened .
I can imagine Shigeru Miyamoto as enjoying that sort of thing more than developing games in and of itself .
On the other side of the Pacific Ocean , the game was released a year later , and the method for obtaining the first warp whistle was revealed , months prior to the game ’s release , in a feature film starring Fred Savage , about an autistic kid traveling to Reno , Nevada ( The Biggest Little City in the World ) to win a videogame tournament .
That kind of speaks volumes by itself .
Looking at this game nearly two decades later is nearly an exercise in beating one ’s self up .
We , the players , beat ourselves up ; we ’re almost as bad as moldy - oldie pop-music nerds obsessing over Beach Boys trivia — songs about surfing , for god ’s sake — breaking down and shivering at the shattering thought that we might never enjoy a pretender as much as we love the first .
We examine every tiny change in the evolution of the series , and spot the spiritual pitfalls , and scratch our chins and wonder why we know Super Mario World ‘s warp zone — the Star World , with its numerous entrances scattered throughout the main map and its own conceptual interior stages — is worse than Super Mario Bros .
3 ‘s warp whistle system .
We can identify all the little places where Nintendo started to go wrong , and stumble into the abyss , and it crushes our souls that though we say we welcome change and evolution , we acknowledge that Super Mario Galaxy fails very hard at the task of being a “ pop- culture event ” because of the points where Nintendo ’s designers actually did take risks and try to change things up .
Mario 3 had a superfluous world map , and an ever - present , eyesore - sized heads up display , which told us our score ( like anyone played the game for score ) , the speed we were running ( like anyone who had ever taken flight as Raccoon Mario more than once ( and from that runway right at the beginning of the first stage ) did n’t know in their soul exactly how long Mario had to run before being able to take off ) , the number of coins we possessed ( this is somewhat useful ) , and what “ cards ” we currently had in our possession .
There ’s some hideous wastefulness here , actually , especially when you consider that the cards are cashed in immediately when Mario obtains a third card — so why are there three blanks at the bottom of the screen ?
The answer is painfully obvious , and scary : to impress upon us that this game , right here , is more complicated than its predecessors , both of which had an identical heads - up - display ( and one which the player could walk over , in certain areas ) .
Change for the more cluttered , back then , in that age on the verge of naivete , was the only immediately accessible way for game designers to prove that they were growing more sophisticated ( this was , of course , years prior to Sega CD , Night Trap , and other stunning full - motion - video adventures ) .
This was a naive and forgivable mistake , and we did n’t mind it because , again , it contributed to lore - passing sessions in the cafeteria or by the coffee maker .
Like , did you know that you can almost always get a star card ( get three for five extra lives ) at the end of a level by jumping at full speed and hitting the lower - left corner of the block ?
There were gambling games in the main map — just two of them — one where you stopped spinning reels in an attempt to get extra lives , and one where you flipped over cards in order to get power - ups .
These games were really simple , though — again — they contributed to the lore factor : tales abounded of how the timing on the spinning reels was slightly staggered if you were trying to get a star ( there ’s a trick to it ) , and the discovery that there are actually only two patterns for the memory match card game ( you can most easily tell which one you ’re dealing with by flipping over the second card from the right of the middle row ) struck the schoolyard crowd like a rumor that Hitler had stubbed his toe might have delighted a barracks - full of allied soldiers in 1943 .
Looking back , though , these things are silly and superfluous , and because Super Mario Bros.
3 sold a near - disgusting 18 million copies worldwide ( the record for a game that was never packaged with a console ) , even its faults have become items on game - design checklists : Must Have Mini -Games .
And yes , Nintendo ’s daring attempts to stray from Super Mario Bros .
3 ‘s formula only frustratingly led the games further away from common sense , from pop-culture - event status .
For example : world - skipping .
Super Mario Bros. 3 let the players choose their path from the start of a world to the castle with some degree of freedom .
It was never necessary to complete every stage in order to finish the game , which has been something of a Miyamoto hallmark since the dawn of Super Mario .
Super Mario
World made a conscious effort to diversify this path - switching by incorporating various exits within stages themselves .
This was a pretty smart concept , though bumblingly executed : popping out of a non-conventional exit plops Mario back out on the world map , where an unseen hand draws a new road right over the existing map , stopping in the middle of nowhere and planting a new stage entrance .
This sort of reveal has become a game - design archetype , though only because no one ever stops to examine it .
Obviously “ multiple stage exits ” is a brilliant idea , though would n’t that make the “ world map ” , as executed in Super Mario Bros.
3 , kind of even more superfluous ?
In Super Mario Bros. 3 , when you complete World 1 - 2 , you first choose either 1 - 3 or 1 - 4 based entirely on your complexes regarding numbers : do you hunger for Bigger Numbers , or must you do everything in order ?
Ideally , you ’d be slotted into 1 - 3 or 1 - 4 based on your performance in 1 - 3 .
Why could n’t Super Mario World be a straightforward game , just one big ( streaming ? ) stage that changes depending on your performance at certain demanding moments ?
The answer is sad , and two - fold : because Super Mario Bros .
3 had a world map , it would be a sign of horrible weakness for its sequel to not have a world map ; also , because the game has a battery back - up , because all games were having battery back - ups in those days , and if you did n’t have a world map , why would you need a battery back - up ?
A decade and change later , we had a handless walking mushroom holding a baseball bat .
Super Mario 64 finally figured out the hub world concept , by making Peach ’s Castle kind of an interesting pseudo - stage in and of itself , and then promptly decided to fill the “ screaming character - things ” deficit by adding an abundance of screaming character - things in Super Mario Sunshine ; by the time Super Mario Galaxy rolled around , the planners had presumably determined that interesting hub stages were too complicated , so they pared it down to nothing , keeping only the screaming character - things and further increasing the pornography - like quality of the escalating numerals at the conclusion of each stage .
New Super Mario Bros. exhibits a different kind of Mario 3 Complex , in that the psychology behind the stage order is bizarrely fractured : certain worlds , numbered in line with the standard flow of the game , are accessed only by completely previous worlds in a slightly different way .
Why number the worlds in line with the rest of the game ?
Why not call them “ special world A ” , and so forth ?
It ’s so the player realizes that they are not “ optional ” — they ’re just “ not essential ” .
It ’s giving the player without the resources to warp the sensation of having skipped worlds .
This is what we ’ve come to : listen to me : Nintendo has determined that people stopped playing videogames because they got too complicated ; somewhere , they ’ve also blanket - assumed that everyone , even obese / cancerous grandpa , deserves to see the end of a game story , even if the story is just schlock nonsense about a man with a mustache and lungs full of helium rescuing a pink - dressed princess ( evidence : they bother to put a story in in the first place ) , so they deduce that requiring statutory kleptomania of any person wishing to complete a game is The Way to draw The People back in .
On the one hand , yes , we have a handless walking mushroom , by all accounts a & ^ # $# , telepathically levitating ( and forcefully swinging ) a baseball bat ; on the other hand , we have Super Mario Galaxy , showing players a rabbit who says he ’s looking for star chips , panning the camera up to show a star chip in the sky , way out of reach , focusing on three stomp pegs on the ground , and then rewarding the player with a jump - boosting stargate thing that materializes out of nowhere should the player remember that these three unassuming pegs can be stomped down with Mario ’s hip - drop move .
Remember earlier , when we established that there is a fine line between games that require cryptic , illogical actions to proceed “ correctly ” because they seek to foster community between players and games that do the same because they want to sell strategy guides ?
Super Mario Galaxy , and other modern monsterpieces , are neither of these things ; the Zelda equivalent of the abovementioned Super Mario Galaxy example would be a one - room dungeon with a single block in the middle .
Try pushing it up , try pushing it left , try pushing it right .
Hmm .
Try pushing it down — staircase !
Triforce piece inside !
Good work , Einstein , either you have a better memory than a hecking goldfish , or you have n’t lost the instruction manual ( and you definitely have n’t lost the game itself ) !
Yes , we are going to keep beating this dead horse until it is a fossil , and then we will nuke that horse fossil .
Snappy one - liner I could n’t think of a better opportunity to use : “ Super Mario Galaxy is a party game for people who are literally legally prohibited from having actual friends . ”
Simply put , the morbid success of Super Mario Bros.
3 changed videogames for the bizarre , the way any and all success by Nintendo has ever changed videogames .
There was so much love , attention to detail , generosity , and artistic conscience ( there ’s actually one word in Japanese that means “ love , attention to detail , generosity , and artistic conscience ” — it is pronounced kodawari ; you ’d figure with such a convenient word - package there , they ’d be a little more excited about exhibiting it in their pop-culture , movies , et cetera ) evident in Super Mario Bros.
3 , and it ’s all so ruthlessly accessible and playable and joyful , thanks to those amazing physics , that it ’s near - unbearably heavy to think about how great it is , much less try to write about .
You ca n’t sum it up ; all you can do is lament that no one tries to pair amazing mechanics with true pop-artistry and love these days : all we get is developers second - guessing the audience , men who might in reality hate Disney crafting a game out of crust — Kingdom Hearts — “ serving ” existing fans without trying to make any new ones .
Shigeru Miyamoto is to Tetsuya Nomura as Martina Navratilova is to Charles Manson , man , I ’ll give him that .
Super Mario Bros. 3 is a Grand Slam tennis championship ; Kingdom Hearts is a bunch of kids calling a TV shyster and handing over their parents ’ credit card numbers .
And then there ’s Metal Gear Solid 4 , the latest game to score a glowing all - ten review from Weekly Famitsu : its take on kodawari is to feature a cut - scene wherein the camera lingers on a monkey drinking a can of soda for sixty straight seconds as two adult humans converse about Saving the World .
Some man who may or may not have a girlfriend had to put his life on hold so he could work overtime for weeks to get the soda - sipping nuances perfect .
Then there are viscerally thrilling games like Ninja Gaiden 2 for the Xbox 360 , with a combo- hit - counter ticking up on the screen constantly as my ninja flips , slashes , dismembers , and kills ; why show the number constantly ?
Why not just show it when my combo ends ?
Game designers , probably weaned on the “ P - meter ” in Super Mario Bros.
3 , call it “ instant visual feedback ” ; really , though — we have a game with a minutely detailed ninja swinging a shiny sword , spinning and freaking out , blades clashing against blades , sparks flying , blood spurting , arms flying , heads popping , legs splatting on the ground : ca n’t that be the “ instant visual feedback ” ?
Is this videogame design ?
No , is this life ?
What are we doing to ourselves , really ?
Did all this psychological kleptomania really spew from Super Mario Bros .
3 , a game we played so much that it became literally incorrect to not crouch before jumping to catch the falling magic wand at the end of the airship boss battles ?
( The only true way for Mario to be victorious is for him to split - second - snap out of flying crouch and into triumphant standing , wand upraised . )
You know what ?
Probably .
Most of my life later , Super Mario Bros.
3 , once my gateway drug , continues to be the road itself .
As I try to involve myself on a more integral level with the creation of actual videogames , as I fully realize and spell out the very discretely mathematical ways one can make a game better than my hero - game , I balk over and over again at actually taking authoritative control .
I know that love and peace and freedom , not cold calculation , is what birthed this game .
The reason Miyamoto can’t follow it up is because this is literally the kind of game only one group of people can ever make once .
It ’s brain - poison .
It colors our expectations of fun from here to eternity ; it ’s not impossible to make a game , even a Mario game , that exudes pop-culture - miracle status as Super Mario Bros .
3 did , albeit in a refined , modern style ; it ’s just that all of the people who have proven they can work miracles are too busy tending gardens and playing with their children .
Hell , if I were Shigeru Miyamoto , I ’d probably be saying Wii Music was “ better than a videogame ” , too .
If I were to sweep away all the ashes of nostalgia and memory and dive into Super Mario Bros.
3 on a clean slate , post - Call of Duty 4 , post - Gears of War , post - Pac - Man : Championship Edition , post - Street Fighter III , I ’m afraid I ’d still find it heartbreakingly amazing .
Only I might — might — find it within myself to wish for a seamless experience , for an opportunity to enjoy these sublime physics , this gloryful sensation of running , jumping , climbing — free of the shackles of context , free of “ water-world- fire-world-desert-world-ice-world - grass - world ” ; I want Mario , Tetris - ified , platforms falling into a well , a never - ending stage , randomized themes for falling objects , the goal being merely to survive .
Oh , well : they ’ve sold six million copies of New Super Mario Bros. in Japan alone , and that game had a super - compelling two - player VS mode ( short stages that wrapped ) ; there ’s no way they ca n’t make a sequel , and there ’s no way they wo n’t expand on that mode .
Until that day ( during which I will ultimately be vaguely disappointed ) , there ’s always that Gears of War 2 online co-op mode where you and four friends are holed up in a fort being endlessly ambushed by bad guys .
Perpetuity , that ’s what I want : I want a game - rope ; I want to jump platforms because I love jumping platforms , and , more importantly , because the platforms love being jumped , the ladders love being climbed , the walls love being triangled .
I want beautiful friction , I want it to never end until I die , either in the game or in real life .
I want to feel good when I ’m in control .
That ’s basically all it comes down to .
And at its best , Super Mario Bros.
3 , steeped in lore , big and bulky and bubbling and never lumbering , offers pure kinetic motion of a more psychologically thrilling level than any game before or since .
That ’s enough to put it this high on this list .
Miyamoto claimed that Mario was born of a desire to make a game about a man like Indiana Jones — a working man who finds himself in bigger - than - life situations .
Mario would go on to earn comparisons to Mickey Mouse ( in that , apparently , more children in American elementary schools knew Mario than Mickey Mouse , at some point ) , though later years have made Mario out to be more of a Charlie Chaplin — a physical , silent comedian , with the worldview of one of those early ( and creepy ) talkie cartoons ( Bimbo , Betty Boop ) where things in the background are always moving .
The artistic inspirations for the original Super Mario Bros. could have come from anywhere ; in 3 , the designers were balls - to - walls .
There ’s not a doubt about it , looking at it in any of its incarnations even today : any given screen of it is a king of pop art ; any two - second moving clip is a “ statement ” “ about ” “ something ” :
Not three seconds after pressing the start button , and there ’s the map for World 1 , green hills with cute eyes bopping back and forth like backgrounds in ancient cartoons to the peppy tempo of an amazing , iconic , refined , pan - flash of 8 - bit pop music courtesy of Koji Kondo : it might as well be a just - today - unearthed satirical Sumerian lithograph , parodying those almostpeople who use Microsoft Excel for everything .
Years of hindsight have opened my ears to the truth : though I had at first , at age ten , been admittedly disappointed that the music playing in World 1 - 1 was not the original Super Mario Bros .
theme , I have grown , and changed ; now that I ’ve been laid more than a few times , I can see that the music in Super Mario Bros .
3 is , in fact , the champion ; the main stage themes are deeper and bolder , and the fourteen - second pop-symphonies ( my absolute favorite ) that cycle over those superfluous world maps only grow more musically amazing with time .
All those kids with access to 8 - bit sound chips , trying their best to turn the sounds of their childhood into the money of their adulthood , and I reckon no one ’s yet hit on anything this pure and beautiful .
Here I am , then , sitting in my office , lights out , listening to this on headphones , on repeat , realizing that , more than just mathematically , I have probably “ grown up ” in some intangible way , and Super Mario Bros.
3 still stalks me like a ghost .
For today , at least , all that nostalgia is n’t wrong , not yet : until some future day I ca n’t immediately forsee ( probably around the time adopting a child starts to seem like better than a bad idea ) , Super Mario Bros .
3 will remain my treasure , my precious hobby , my stay - at - home vacation , my one - man conversation , my lifelong birthday party .

More to come from Palin- Couric
Howie Kurtz raised some eyebrows by reporting this morning that " the worst may be yet to come for Palin ; sources say CBS has two more responses on tape that will likely prove embarrassing . "
A source familiar with CBS News ’ plans clarified that this is part of the " Vice Presidential Questions " series with Biden and Palin .
The recorded segments are scheduled to air Wednesday and Thursday before the vice presidential debate .
( The series is based on the Presidential Questions series , in which Couric asks the candidates the same set of questions on wide range of topics from policy to character to leadership . )

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican John McCain and Democrat Barack Obama are dead even in two public opinion polls released on Monday as they head into the final eight weeks of the race for the White House .
The polls were taken Friday through Sunday after last week ’s Republican convention , which ended on Thursday .
A CNN / Time poll showed the race deadlocked at 48 percent , and a Hotline / Diageo poll put the two candidates even at 44 percent .
The CNN / Time poll was largely unchanged from the previous week , when Obama led McCain by 49 percent to 48 percent .
The Hotline poll showed a significant convention bounce for McCain , who trailed Obama by 9 percentage points in a poll taken the week before .
Another poll released on Sunday , by USA Today / Gallup , gave McCain a 4 - point edge among registered voters and a 10 - point lead among likely voters .
That was a big boost for McCain , who trailed Obama by 3 points among likely voters in the week before the Democratic convention .
The Democrats met the week before the Republicans .
Conventions typically give a presidential candidate a short - term bounce in the polls , but this year ’s back - to - back conventions appeared to cut short the benefit for Obama .
The neck - and - neck polls put the race essentially back where it was heading into the conventions , although some polls showed McCain had boosted the enthusiasm level among his supporters with the choice of Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as running mate .
The CNN / Time poll of 1,022 Americans was taken by Opinion Research Corporation and had a margin of error of 3 percentage points .
The Hotline / Diageo poll of 924 voters had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points .
Clinton creates ' whip team ' to quell anti-Obama protests
In an unusual move , Hillary Clinton 's staff is creating a 40 - member " whip team " at the Denver Democratic convention to ensure that her supporters do n't engage in embarrassing anti-Obama demonstrations during the floor vote on her nomination , according to people familiar with the planning .
The team , which is being organized by longtime Clinton staffer Craig Smith , is working in conjunction with Obama 's floor organizers to help foster the image of a unified front during a roll - call process Clinton herself has described as an emotional " catharsis " for her disappointed supporters .
" If people get down there on the floor and want to start blowing kazoos and making a scene , we want to make sure we 've got people who stand in front of them with Obama signs , " said a person involved in the planning .
" Is it typical for a losing candidate to have their own whip team ?
No .
But it 's also not usual for a losing candidate to get 18 million votes either , " said the person .
Clinton spokesperson Kathleen Strand emphasized the team would not seek to convince delegates to vote for the former first lady , but it would hand out Clinton signs to supporters who requested them .
“ We have been and are working closely with the Obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention , " Strand said .
" Our delegate whips , along with the Obama delegate whips , are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need , whether that ’s answering questions or passing out signs during Hillary 's speech .
The whips are a traditional part of every convention 's floor operations . ”
Plans for the squad were finalized last weekend .
Although some former Clinton staffers balked at policing their own supporters , its ranks were filled by people itching for a floor pass — not an easy get for Clinton 's troops at the Obama - run convention .

Spore , the hotly - anticipated new game from Electronic Arts is facing fierce criticism from consumers over its apparent use of unusually restrictive digital rights management ( DRM ) technology .
“ I basically put down my hard - earned money and get punished for buying the game legally .
The gaming industry needs to be sent a message that this is no way to treat their customers ” , said one buyer who posted a review at Amazon.com
“ [ The DRM ] means that you are actually renting the game , instead of owning it ” , another claims .
The $ 50 game has received an overwhelming number of negative reviews on Amazon , many from users who admit that they they have not purchased the game because of its DRM .
Numerous potential buyers say they canceled pre-orders or plan to return the game .
Three activations
After it is first installed by the user , the SecuROM Product Activation DRM system used by Spore allows the game to be installed only two more times , users claim .
An install is used up each time the game is installed on a different PC – or even in some cases when the user installs new hardware on the original PC .
A new or re-installed operating system also forces the user to use up one more of the two remaining installations of the game .
If the game has already been installed three times , the user has to contact EA customer service to explain why he or she wants to install it again .
According to EA 's online customer support , the actual limit is three “ concurrently active ” licenses .
This page states that the licenses eventually expire , possibly after ten days , and implies that they can then be re-used .
However , this appears to conflict with other statements from EA .
No Warning ?
Customers have also complained that the product box contains no warning about the DRM technology used .
Others complain that SecuROM is not mentioned in the End User License Agreement ( EULA ) .
In fact , EA 's EULA states “ You may download the number of copies allowed by the software 's digital rights management from an authorized source .
However , you may use only one copy of the software on a single computer at any given time . ”
EA claims that it does not mention SecuROM in Spore 's license agreement because that would force it to create a slightly different version of its two page license agreement for each product .
Resale and rental restriction claims
Other potential buyers charge that EA is using the limit of three product activations to prevent resale or rental of the game .
However , the EULA states : “ You may make a permanent transfer [ sic ] all your rights to install and use the software to another individual or legal entity ” .
These terms do appear to forbid rental of the game .
While resale appears possible under the EULA , the limited number of activations automatically included could make the game less attractive as a second hand purchase .
SecuROM rootkit allegations
Many have claimed that SecuROM uses ' Root Kit ' methods , more commonly used by viruses , trojans and other malware , to hide files from the user .
SecuROM is developed by Sony DADC , a subsidiary of Sony which manufactures optical disks .
“ SecuROM does not use any root kit technology in its implementation ” , Sony DADC says .
Ars Technica 's Ken Fisher examined an earlier SecuROM game , BioShock , that was also accused of containing a rootkit , and said he could find no sign of one .
SecuROM itself also denies it uses a rootkit .
“ SecuROM customers enjoy the benefits of extended shelf life , while maximizing profits through additional product sales ” , Sony states .
“ With SecuROM Product Activation , Sony DADC offers games and software publishers , plus online distributors , the possibility to apply just one single DRM solution to their content , regardless whether it is distributed via the physical or digital sales channel ( e.g. Internet ) .
SecuROM Product Activation enables content owners to apply different business models , such as ' Try & Buy ' or ' Subscription ' for publishers and online distributors of games and / or software .
As a result publishers and online distributors can benefit from increasing customer loyalty and additional revenues ” , Sony DADC says in a description of the application .

Editor 's note : Republican Leslie Sanchez was director of the Bush White House Initiative on Hispanic Education from 2001 to 2003 and is the author of " Los Republicanos : Why Hispanics and Republicans Need Each Other . "
She is not a paid consultant to any current candidate .
Sanchez is CEO of the Impacto Group , which specializes in market research about women and Hispanics for its corporate and nonprofit clients .
Leslie Sanchez says Sen. John McCain conveyed strength and determination on the Russian - Georgian conflict .
( CNN ) --
Despite the best work of political handlers and advertising pros in presidential elections , people 's perceptions are often shaped by impressions formed by events that are completely out of the campaigns ' control .
Such was the case just before midnight on August 20 , 1968 , when Soviet troops marched through Prague , putting a sudden and brutal end to the Czechoslovakian communist reform movement that was known , all too briefly , as the " Prague Spring . "
Seventy - eight days later , Americans gave Richard Nixon an Electoral College margin of 110 votes .
Forty years later , Russian tanks are rolling once more over their neighbors , and the images that are shaping Americans ' lasting perceptions are of a president playing in the sand with the women 's beach volleyball team and the presumptive Democratic nominee alternately walking along Kailua Beach and playing golf in Hawaii .
While President Bush cheered our athletes in Beijing and Sen. Barack Obama jogged along the beach , Americans were reminded yet again that this is , indeed , a dangerous world -- and that the danger does not just come from organized groups of terrorists but from entire nations , some of which have nuclear weapons and the ability to deliver them .
To his credit , Sen .
John McCain took immediate steps to differentiate himself -- not just from Obama , whose initial responses were tepid and hesitant , but from Bush , who portrayed the face of American powerlessness from his seat in the stands of the Bird 's Nest .
In contrast to both Bush and Obama , McCain conveyed strength and determination .
While Obama timidly urged Georgia and Russia to " show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full - scale war , " McCain took to the airwaves to deliver a blunt warning to Russian President Dimitri Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin .
Your actions will have " severe , long - term negative consequences " for relations with the United States and Europe , McCain declared , as he outlined a plan of action for the West to isolate and punish Russia .
In one weekend , unpredictable events have given McCain a golden opportunity to capitalize on what are some of his strongest attributes as a potential president -- a lifetime of foreign policy experience , a military background and a strong anti-Russian stance .
We will soon see if McCain can translate his advantage into a gain in the polls .
When Bush looked into Putin 's eyes , he famously claimed to be able to see into his soul , where he found goodness .
When McCain looked into those same eyes , he says , he saw three letters : " K - G - B . "
One can only wonder what Obama might have seen .
One thing Obama ought to see , however , and soon , is the tarmac at Honolulu International Airport .
He needs to realize that , when you 're president , you 're not always in control of events , including vacations .
If he fails to cut this holiday short , he might soon wind up being remembered as the guy who blew his chance to be president because he played on the beach while the Russian tanks rolled through Georgia .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .

Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson has flown to the rescue of holiday - makers left stranded abroad after Britain 's third largest tour operator collapsed , newspapers have reported .
The heavy metal hero is also a Boeing 757 pilot and flew a specially - chartered Monarch Airlines flight from the Red Sea resort of Sharm el - Sheikh in Egypt to London Gatwick Airport .
XL Leisure Group went into administration Friday , leaving some 85,000 British tourists stranded abroad .
Since then almost 12,000 people have been brought back as part of an airlift mission conducted by the aviation regulator .
" I was just doing my job .
I was called out like a lot of other pilots to help and I was obviously happy to do that , " The Mail on Sunday newspaper quoted rocker Dickinson as saying .
" Some of the people on the flight were obviously frustrated by the situation they had found themselves in but everyone was pretty good - natured about it all . "
Dickinson , 50 , said he was off to the Greek island of Kos next to rescue some more stranded holiday - makers .
The Iron Maiden frontman has been a captain with Astraeus , having worked for the British charter airline for nine years .
Dickinson has also competed in fencing at international level .

One of the valuable ideas from Frederick Brooks ' classic The Mythical Man Month is the notion of the second system effect when designing software systems .
The following is an excerpt from the book where the concept is introduced
An architect ’s first work is apt to be spare and clean .
He knows he does n’t know what he ’s doing , so he does it carefully and with great restraint .
As he designs the first work , frill after frill and embellishment after embellishment occur to him .
These get stored away to be used “ next time . ”
Sooner or later the first system is finished , and the architect , with firm confidence and a demonstrated mastery of that class of systems , is ready to build a second system .
This second is the most dangerous system a man ever designs .
When he does his third and later ones , his prior experiences will confirm each other as to the general characteristics of such systems , and their differences will identify those parts of his experience that are particular and not generalizable .
The general tendency is to over - design the second system , using all the ideas and frills that were cautiously sidetracked on the first one .
In my experience , the second system effect does n't just come into play when the creator (s ) of the second system also worked on the first system .
In many cases , a development team may be brought in to build a new version of a first system either because they are competitors trying to one up a successful product or they are building the next generation of the technology while the original team goes into " maintenance mode " ( i.e. shades of The Soul of a New Machine ) .
In such situations , the builders of the second system can fall into the trap that Frederick Brooks describes in chapter 5 of Mythical Man Month .
At almost any point in time over the past few years , I could easily count about three or four software projects I was personally familiar with that were making classic " second system " mistakes .
However instead of vilifying these projects , I thought it would be useful to list the top three things I 've seen that have separated second systems that have avoided falling into this trap and those that have n't .
Realize You Can't Do It All In One Release
A lot of projects lose their way because they try do a too much in a single release .
As Raymond Chen wrote
You do n't know what you do until you know what you do n't do .
Until you start focusing on a key set of scenarios your product will nail and start cutting features that are n't necessary to hitting those scenarios , your project is n't ready for prime time .
What developers often fail to remember is that there is always another version and you can fit those scenarios in at that point .
One company that gets this idea very well is Apple .
I can still remember Cmdr Taco 's infamous review of the original iPod when it ran in 2001 ; " No wireless .
Less space than a nomad .
Lame . "
However the iPod nailed its key scenarios and with that success kept expanding its set of key scenarios ( more space , video , photos , etc ) until it became the cultural juggernaut it is today .
You can see the same qualities in the iPhone .
Just a few months ago , you 'd read articles like Final report :
The iPhone is not open for business that argued against the iPhone because it did n't support 3G , lacked Exchange support and had a non-existent developer platform .
However the original iPhone was still successful and they addressed these issues in the next version to even greater success .
You Can be Date Driven or Feature Driven but not Both
A date driven release is one where everyone on the team is working to hit a particular time cut off after which the product will ship with or without their feature .
Software products that have to hit the back to school cycle , tax time or the holiday shopping cycle are often date driven .
A feature driven software release takes the " we wo n't ship it until it is ready approach " which is popular among Open Source projects and at companies like Google ( according to Steve Yegge ) .
The thing to note about both approaches is that they are built on compromise .
In that , we will compromise on our ship date but not on our features or vice versa .
Where software projects tend to go awry is when they decide to be both feature driven and date driven because it means they have left no room to compromise .
This is additionally problematic because we are so poor at project estimation in our industry .
So at the start of a project you have features that should take a two years to ship only budgeted as needing a year of work .
In a date driven release , once this discrepancy is realized it is at that point features start getting cut or " placed below the cut line " .
In a feature driven release , the ship date is adjusted and ship expectations adjusted .
Projects that are both feature driven and date driven ( i.e. we have to ship features X , Y & Z on date A ) end up delaying these decisions until the last minute since they are n't mentally setup to compromise on either the date or the features .
So they end up doing neither until the very last minute .
This leads to missed deadlines , hastily cut features and demoralization within the product team .
This often continues for multiple deadlines until finally the project team gets to the point where they feel they must show something for all the missed deadlines and cut features by throwing together a mediocre release after the one too many missed deadlines .
We 've all seen software projects that have succumbed to this and it is a sad sight to behold .
Do n't Lose Track of What Made the First System Successful
Developers tend to be a fairly critical lot so when they look at a successful " first system " , they often only see the flaws .
This is often what fuels the second system effect and leads to losing sight of why the first system became a hit in the first place .
A recent example of this is the search engine Cuil which was started by some former employees of Google with the intent of building a search engine which fixes the issues with Google 's search engine .
Unfortunately , they had a disastrous product launch which has been documented in blog posts like How To Lose Your Cuil 20 Seconds After Launch and news articles such as Cuil shows us how not to launch a search engine .
When you look back at the PR buildup leading to Cuil 's launch , it is interesting to note that even though the Cuil team dubbed themselves Google slayers they did not address the key things people like about Google 's search .
Google 's search provides relevant search results as quickly as possible .
Cuil bragged about providing more complete results because their search index was bigger , showing more results above the fold by going with three columns in their search engine results page and that it offered richer query refinement features than Google .
Although all of these are weaknesses in Google 's user experience they are trumped by the fact that Google provides extremely relevant search results .
The Cuil team lost sight of this , probably because working at Google they only ever talked about fixing the flaws in the search product instead of also internalizing what has made it so successful .
This is an extremely common mistake that cuts across all categories of software products .

BRATTLEBORO–Democrats were in Denver and Republicans were in [ Saint Paul ] touting the virtue of their politics .
Liam Madden was in both cities during the last two weeks , telling both parties they are wrong on the war in Iraq .
An ex-Marine who served in Iraq and then became an anti-war activist , Madden says neither Democrats nor Republicans can claim the mantle of either being against the war or supporting our troops .
At both conventions , he had tailored criticism for both Barack Obama , the Democrat candidate for president , and John McCain , his Republican counterpart .
“ Obama has presented himself as the anti-war candidate and he is not , ”  Madden said .
“ He said he wants to remove all the combat troops , but there are tens of thousands of non-combat troops in Iraq , too .
He has n’t committed to removing them .
He ’s just repackaged the war and re-selling it to the American people .
It ’s still the same war based on the same lies .
It ’s still the same violation of the Constitution . ” 
If you think Madden is tough on the Democratic candidate , he ’s got even less confidence in the GOP .
“ McCain is obviously not supporting the troops , ”  he said .
“ As far as their voting record on veteran issues goes , Obama is clearly doing a better job . ” 
Madden , who grew up in Bellows Falls and now lives in Boston , is an anti-war organizer , a distinction he said is something more active than being an activist .
“ An activist is someone who shows up , or someone who cares , ”  he said .
“ An organizer is someone who is leading and building the movement . ” 
As a board member of Iraq Veterans Against the War , he is definitely more the latter than the former .
He raised funds to help pay his way to both political conventions , and while there , worked to affect change within both parties .
“ There was a lot of late - night strategizing and contingency planning , ”  he said of the work he and IVAW did in Denver and then earlier this week in [ Saint Paul ] .
“ It was frantic .
It was surreal . ” 
In [ Saint Paul ] , he said their hard work did n’t pay off , not that he thought the Grand Old Party would be receptive to his message of ending the war .
“ The Republicans do n’t care about the anti-war people , ”  Madden said .
“ They ignored us . ” 
In Denver , at the Democratic National Convention , he said , that was not the case at all .
IVAW helped to organize a concert headlined by Rage Against the Machine , a popular rock band and outspoken opponents of the war .
He and other veterans against the war got on stage and convinced a large contingency from the concert to join them in a march to the Democrats party .
“ We marched right through the front gates of the Democratic National Convention , ”  he said proudly .
Once inside , though , he said the protest group was met by “ heavily armed guards .
They had non-lethal , but very intimidating , weapons .
There were 70 of us in formation , and thousands behind us . ” 
They told the guards they had a letter they wanted to deliver to Sen.
Obama .
Protesters , Madden said , are used to their efforts ending in defeat , but that ’s not what happened on Wednesday night at the DNC .
The Obama campaign agreed to meet with leaders of IVAW behind the police line .
“ It was the first victory of the anti-war movement in seven years , ”  Madden said .
“ They did n’t just send some Secret Service officer , they sent a senior official .
it was the first time a protest ended in something other than everyone just going home . ” 
Madden and a group of veterans delivered the letter to Phil Carter , Obama ’s senior veteran ’s affairs liaison .
During the meeting , Carter agreed to meet with IVAW at a later date .
Madden is hoping he may get some face time with the nominee himself , as well .
Despite this victory , Madden said he had an even more memorable moment at the Democratic convention .
On the way to the convention headquarters , he marched with Ron Kovic , the author and Vietnam veteran who wrote the autobiographical memoir “ Born on the Fourth of July . ” 
“ I was speechless , ”  Madden said about marching with Kovic .
“ It was one of the most memorable experiences of my life .
He was just as excited to be around us as we were to be around him . ” 
Like Madden , Kovic , too , was a Marine who became disillusioned with war and became an anti-war activist .
Kovic also marched at a political convention .
A major difference between Madden and Kovic , Madden was quick to point out , is that Kovic lost the use of his legs as a result of a war wound .
Madden said he bears no physical war injuries .
Where their stories are similar , Madden said , is that he , too , never thought he would end up as an anti-war organizer .
“ I did n’t join the Marines thinking this is where I was going to end up , ”  he said .

A sex perception task for chimps :
The top image shows a generic female rear .
The chimp being tested must decide which of the male and female faces presented would have such a backside .
Go to the end of the story to find the answer ( Image : de Waal and Pokomy )
Chimps can match up the faces of group members with photos of their behinds .
The ability , researchers say , shows that chimps carry around mental representations with “ whole body ” detail of chimps they have encountered .
Primatologists Frans de Waal and Jennifer Pokorny of the Yerkes National Primate Research Centre at Emory University in Atlanta , Georgia , tested how well six adult chimpanzees could link pictures of various chimpanzee behinds , either male or female , with photos of individual chimp faces .
They showed a chimp , first , a photo of a chimp ’s behind , including genitals , then the faces of two chimps , both of the same sex as that behind .
Each of three male and three female chimps were able to make the correct face - with - behind pairing with a probability significantly higher than chance .

Body knowledge
But the chimps succeeded only if the faces were of chimps they knew .
This suggests , the researchers say , that the chimps were n’t simply detecting generic visual cues in the faces that would link them to the behind in question .
Rather , it seems that the chimps must be capable of what psychologists call “ whole body ” integration .
“ They were not only seeing the photographs as representations of chimps they knew , says de Waal , “ but linked the face and behind by drawing upon a mental representation of the whole body of those chimps . ”
Earlier experiments had hinted that some non-human primates might have this capability , but this is the first time “ whole body knowledge ” has been convincingly demonstrated .
Concept of sex ?
Primatologist Agnes Lacreuse of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst , says that more experiments are needed before we can conclude that chimps identify other chimps using a “ gender construct ” method .
“ We know that macaques are able to categorize faces as males or females , so it would be very surprising if chimpanzees were unable to do so . ”
In other experiments , de Waal and Pokorny also tested the chimps ’ ability to recognise the sex of other chimps from photos of their faces alone .
They first presented chimps with a photo of either a generic male or female chimp rear end – a sexually charged stimulus .
The chimps were then shown closely cropped photos of two chimps , one male and one female , and encouraged to select the face of the same sex as the rear end .
The chimps tended to be successful at this test too , but again only if the faces belonged to chimps familiar to them .
This suggests , de Waal speculates , that chimps may operate with a “ gender construct ” – that is , the chimps recognise the sex of other chimps based , not just on physical attributes , but on other information from their previous experience with those individuals , such as their roles in the larger group .
This would be similar to how humans recognise gender , de Waal points out .
In experiments with sex cues such as facial shape and hair removed , for example , people can identify faces as male or female more rapidly if they are faces of familiar people .
Journal reference : Advanced Science Letters ( DOI : 10.1166/asl.2008.006 )
Sex perception task answer :
For this trial , the correct choice is the left face ( a female ) .
The right face is a male chimp .

ISLAMABAD , Sept 22 ( Reuters ) - Pakistani troops fired on two U.S. helicopters that intruded into Pakistani airspace on Sunday night , forcing them to turn back to Afghanistan , a senior Pakistani security official said on Monday .
It was the second such incident in a week , and reflects frayed relations with the United States over Pakistan ’s failure to act more forcibly against Islamist fighters in the tribal lands bordering Afghanistan .
The number of missile attacks by U.S. drone aircraft in the remote tribal areas has multiplied in recent weeks .
The helicopters violated the border in the area of Lowara Mandi , 40 km ( 25 miles ) west of Miranshah , the main town in the North Waziristan tribal region , at around 9 p.m. on Sunday , the official said , speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject .
There was no official confirmation .
“ We do n’t have any information on border violation by the American helicopters , ” Major Murad Khan , a military spokesman , said .
Residents said drones had been flying overnight and early on Monday over Miranshah but did not attack .
“ It ’s really so scary , we just ca n’t sleep when you hear them flying , ” said Zia - ur - Rehman , a resident of Hamzoni village near Miranshah .
Relations became strained between the allies in the war on terrorism after U.S. commandos raided a border village in South Waziristan and killed 20 people , including women and children , on Sept. 3 .
Pakistanis were outraged by the raid and the six - month - old civilian government issued a diplomatic protest .
It was the first overt incursion by U.S. ground troops into Pakistani territory , though the U.S. military has conducted numerous missile strikes against al Qaeda and Taliban targets in Pakistan ’s tribal lands .
ZARDARI TO MEET BUSH
The U.S. action prompted army chief General Ashfaq Kayani to issue a statement saying that foreign troops would not be allowed on Pakistani soil and Pakistan ’s sovereignty and territorial integrity would be defended at all costs .
Pakistani troops fired on two U.S. helicopters that crossed the border at the same village , Angor Adda , a week ago , again forcing them to turn back , according to residents and security officers .
Pakistan and the United States issued denials .
Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari is scheduled to meet President George W. Bush on Tuesday in the United States , and is also due to attend the U.N. General Assembly .
Pakistan ’s support is regarded as crucial to the success of Western forces trying to stabilise Afghanistan , and in the fight against al Qaeda .
Admiral Mike Mullen , the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , held talks in Islamabad with top Pakistani officials last week .
Mullen “ reiterated the U.S. commitment to respect Pakistan ’s sovereignty ” , the U.S. embassy said in a statement .
The United States is Pakistan ’s largest donor , and the dissonance between them has been a factor pushing down Pakistani shares and the rupee because Pakistan needs an inflow of dollars to rebuild rapidly depleting foreign currency reserves to prop up its ailing economy .

NEW YORK --
In a session billed as the browser wars up close and personal , key Microsoft , Mozilla and Google representatives spoke about the past present and future of the browser platform as they see it .
In the session at the Web 2.0 Expo here on Sept. 19 , entitled " The Future of Browsers , " Chris Wilson , platform architect in the Internet Explorer ( IE ) team at Microsoft , Brendan Eich , chief technology officer at Mozilla and creator of JavaScript , and Ojan Vafai , a software engineer on the Google Chrome team took questions from the dynamic duo of Ben Galbraith and Dion Almaer , the co-founders of Ajaxian.com .
Despite having reps from three heralded browser teams that compete for user and developer attention , the session was pretty subdued .
But what could really expect ?
Despite the best laid plans of my good pals Almaer and Galbraith , the browser boys kept things tame and refused to sling any mud .
But the Ajaxians did a masterful job , not only of corralling topnotch talent to speak on their panel , but also of getting things going with a series of relevant questions ranging from Microsoft 's support for various web standards , to Google 's plans to grab market share , to how will react to new competition .
Yet , one of the issues that stood out to me was that of developer discontent .
When the Ajaxians opened up questioning to the audience , an attendee stood up and said Google 's announcement of its new browser " was greeted with shock and horror , " by him .
" This is hell , " he said to applause from the audience .
And he followed up with a question to the panel : " What are you going to do about it ? "
The guy was referring to developers often having to choose which browser to support or having to create variations of their applications to run on different browser platforms .
And based on the reaction of the crowd , developers want to see something done , whether it 's standards or what .
Chris Wilson of Microsoft said he recommended investment in test suites .
" Getting more tests and test suites will help some . "
Wilson also said Microsoft has addressed the issue of compatibility in Internet Explorer 8 .
Meanwhile , the attendee jokingly asked if Microsoft could just kill off IE 6 .
Wilson said there is a user base for IE6 that Microsoft has to support .
In another telling point in the session , blogger Hank Williams asked the panel if the browser was becoming the new operating system .
" It 's apples and oranges comparing an operating system and a web browser , " Vafai said .
" While there are some similarities they are two very different things , " Vafai said in Google 's " do no evil " tone of response .
He said there are some things in a browser that are operating system competitive such as font rendering .
But , " it 's not even clear what you could do to replace an operating system with a browser
Of course , when Google announced its Chrome browser that was the first thing many observers said -- that Google was moving to replace the operating system .
" It 's already happening , " Eich said .
" You do n't see as many Windows apps being built per se ; browsers have already intermediated operating systems .
This is the kind of evolution you see when platforms grow platforms on their backs . "
Galbraith asked Eich , who was seated between Wilson and Vafai , how he felt with Microsoft having such a high percentage of the browser market on one side of him and fierce competitor and upstart browser entrant Google on the other .
" We 've got them right where we want them . " he said
Eich then said that although Google is a mighty competitor , Mozilla has been doing open source software for years and although WebKit , the engine for Google 's Chrome browser has been around for some time , Google 's challenge will be to move it forward with its own developer community .
" You ca n't just sprinkle open source pixie dust on it " and it works like magic , Eich said .
Meanwhile , asked if Google 's goal was to take market share away from Microsoft and Mozilla , Vafai in more do - no - evil speak said : " The primary goal of Google Chrome is to push forward web development . "
He also said Google plans to implement the features in the HTML 5 specification .
" Google wants to see web applications do well .
If it adds competition to the market and makes web apps done better , great . "
Please .
Of course Google wants to take share away from Microsoft and Mozilla .
And it will .
Vafai also noted that Google intends to support add - ons , " like the Firefox extensions and Greasemonkey scripts , and we intend to do both of those with Google Chrome . "
He said the founder of the Greasemonkey extension now works on the Chrome team .
Eich said add - ons in Firefox are a potential source of instability , but also a vehicle for innovation .
Wilson said " add - ons have been part of IE and the general pattern of extending the platform will continue . "
Galbraith asked Wilson if Microsoft is holding back support for the Canvas element of HTML 5 because of its proprietary Silverlight rich Internet application technology .
" We do n't get to choose whether there is an open standard called Canvas or HTML 5 , " Wilson said .
" Silverlight is an end - to - end platform that 's not the platform my team works on .
We look at the need for vector graphics and I never said to my team : ' Hey , let 's just use Silverlight ; we do n't need vector graphics support . '
Vector graphics support is one of the things we 'll see next . "
For his part , Eich said Mozilla has implemented many HTML 5 features including Canvas , offline support and Web Workers .
Firefox has taken the lead in including HTML 5 features , " he said .
Vafai added that " all the credit for HTML 5 features in Chrome goes to the WebKit team .
Google Gears also supports HTML 5 features , he added .
Vafai said Google has not done a lot to extend the WebKit platform .
With Chrome , " it was an intended goal to match Safari , " he said .
Moreover , Wilson said : " We took a lot of functionality we 've shipped in IE 8 beta 1 and 2 from the HTML 5 spec , like the local store work . "
Wilson also said IE 8 features tooling with " lots of polish " and has added profiling .
" Whenever you build an application it 's really important to have a rich tool set on each browser , " he said .
With IE 8 , " you do n't have to go into FrontPage or Visual Studio and hack a fix , " for problems , he said .
Meanwhile , Vafai said Google Chrome has broad support for debugging .
Wilson also said Microsoft has a representative working on the incubation group for a " geo-location " specification for browsers .
However , " the challenge there is user privacy , " he said .
IT was a funny thing to be doing in a cocktail dress .
Debra Netschert , a financial analyst , was sitting next to her husband , K. C. Dustin , an equities salesman , and spitting into a test tube at a party last week in Chelsea to promote a DNA testing company .
As a soundtrack that included “ Whole Lotta Love ” blasted , the couple were submitting samples for tests that could reveal disturbing news , like his propensity to develop throat cancer or the chances of her having pregnancy complications .
But Ms. Netschert adopted the party mood , focusing , at first , on the less consequential details about her heredity .
“ I want to figure out why I have freckles , ” she said .
It was taking a few minutes to fill the tube with the required amount of saliva , so Ms. Netschert had a dry - mouthed moment to consider what the couple might do if her husband turned out to be carrying a gene that could doom his offspring .
BERLIN 
The arrest of two terrorism suspects at the Cologne - Bonn Airport and a nationwide search for two others rattled Germany on Friday .
German police officers boarded a KLM airliner at 6:55 a.m. , shortly before it was to take off , and seized two men who were identified as a 23 - year - old Somali and a 24 - year - old German born in Somalia .
Officials said that the men were unarmed , but that documents saying that they were ready to fight and die in a jihad had been found .
The men had been under surveillance for some time , according to a German security official , speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the case .
Their travel plans had them going to Uganda by way of Amsterdam , the official said , with a likely final destination of Somalia .
The extent of any threat posed by the two men was far from certain on Friday .
Their arrests were the second set of terrorism - related arrests in barely over a week , as German officials charged with preventing a terrorist attack on their country said they saw signs of heightened activity among radical Islamists .

" Is this interesting to Google ? "
That 's what Andy Rubin was asking Larry Page .
It was a spring day in 2005 , and the two were in a conference room just off the main lobby at Google 's headquarters .
A simple yes and Rubin would have walked away happy .
This article has been reproduced in a new format and may be missing content or contain faulty links .
Contact wiredlabs@wired.com to report an issue .
They had met three years before , when Rubin was about to launch a smartphone he'd invented called the Sidekick .
At the time , Google was just an up - and - comer , trailing AOL and even Lycos in traffic .
But Rubin , a well - known Silicon Valley player , chose Google as the Sidekick 's default search engine .
Page was flattered by the unexpected endorsement .
So when Rubin called out of the blue and requested this meeting , well , Page could n't say no .
The Google cofounder arrived late , as usual .
Rubin walked to the whiteboard and began his pitch .
There were nearly 700 million cell phones sold each year compared with fewer than 200 million PCs — and the gap was widening .
Increasingly , he said , phones were the way people wanted to connect with each other and with everything else .
Yet the mobile industry was stuck in the dark ages .
Unlike the Web , where open standards had fostered a multitude of cool companies and applications , mobile was a tyrannical , closed system , repelling all innovators and disrupters who tried to gain entrance .
Rubin said his startup , called Android , had the solution : a free , open source mobile platform that any coder could write for and any handset maker could install .
He would make his money by selling support for the system — security services , say , or email management .
Android would have the spirit of Linux and the reach of Windows .
It would be a global , open operating system for the wireless future .
Rubin did n't want money from Page .
He already had funding .
What he wanted was Google 's imprimatur — even an email from Page would do .
Rubin figured he could attract more VC funds with the search giant on board , possibly with a hint that Google might be interested in developing its own branded phone .
He pulled out a prototype .
Page picked up the device .
He had been personally frustrated yet fascinated by the mobile market for years .
He already knew the numbers — he did n't need Rubin to tell him how many PCs and mobile phones were out there .
He also knew that it added up to a massive problem for Google .
The desktop metaphor was fading .
Phones were going to replace PCs as the main gateway to the Internet , and they were going to do it soon .
Why would consumers tether themselves to a PC when phones were growing more and more powerful — and were cheaper , too ?
But because cell phones ran on different software , had less memory , and operated under the constraints of pay - per - byte wireless networks , the mobile Web was a stripped - down , mimeographed version of the real thing .
Reading and surfing and — more to the point — viewing Google ads was a slow , stultifying chore .
Even worse , a second - class Web could derail Google 's grand strategy .
The company was trying to worm its way deeper into users ' lives by hosting applications and personal files on Google servers , then dishing them out to the always - connected consumer whenever and wherever needed .
That was easy on PCs , but phones did n't play nice with the cloud .
Google dominated the Web today , but tomorrow might be a different story .
Working the problem had been a nightmare .
Google engineers had a closet overflowing with mobile phones to test the company 's wireless applications — mobile Google , Blogger , search over SMS .
There were dozens of operating systems to navigate , a mobile Tower of Babel completely at odds with the easy access and universal language of the Web .
What worried Page most was that the only firm from the PC world that seemed to be successfully navigating the mobile labyrinth was Microsoft , one of Google 's biggest rivals .
The Windows Mobile platform had less than 10 percent of the US smartphone market , but it was growing fast .
Microsoft 's system , however , was the ugly stepsister of what Rubin was proposing : Redmond executives cared less about opening up the Net to mobile users than about tying the mobile operating system into its desktop dominance .
A decade ago , Microsoft had underestimated the growth of the Web and then lost control of it to Google .
Now it looked like it was Google 's turn to be caught flat - footed .
If Google had it bad , users had it worse .
Every year since 2002 , the wireless sector managed to place at or near the top of the Better Business Bureau 's tally of the most complained - about industries .
Americans would rather do business with a used - car salesman or a collection agent than with a customer service rep for , say , T - Mobile or Motorola .
And who could blame them ?
The plans were expensive , pricing was complex and capricious , and the phones never lived up to expectations .
Constant innovation , the first principle of Page and Rubin 's world , was anathema to phone companies .
There had to be pent - up demand out there for something better .
So was Rubin 's pitch interesting to Page ?
Absolutely .
But he did n't want to stick his logo on Rubin 's phone .
Or write a supportive email .
He had a better idea : Google would buy Android .
Rubin was floored .
He had come in looking for an encouraging word and left with the biggest payday in his life .
( The eventual purchase price was estimated at as much as $ 50 million . )
Now all he had to do was live up to his own hype .
" Google 's model is to build a killer app , then monetize it later , " Rubin says .
We 're sitting in another conference room across the street from where he and Page struck their deal three years ago .
The building , which houses Google 's mobile division , is Rubin 's domain now .
There 's a self - piloting model helicopter bearing an Android logo parked in the hall — Rubin builds them in his spare time .
Beyond are floors of people who think of nothing but the cellular future of their employer .
In the lobby , a flatscreen TV shows a spinning globe with animated flares erupting wherever people are using Google to search from their mobile phones .
This fall , when the first Android phones hit the market , those flares will presumably flame even higher .
Rubin is tall and skinny and a casual dresser even by Google standards .
He 's 45 but seems younger .
Sitting with one leg tucked beneath him , he explains the mission of the Googlefied Android to me , but I barely follow the words .
I 'm staring at his phone .
It 's clearly a demo — black , scuffed , covered with fingerprints ; most of the face is taken up by the screen .
Rubin absentmindedly slides it around the big wooden table , then picks it up and shifts it from hand to hand .
It 's maddening .
All I want to do is get a closer look at his killer app .
After Google bought Android in July 2005 , Silicon Valley pulsed with gossip and speculation about what the search giant was planning .
Everyone figured Apple had a phone in the works and assumed Google must be developing one too .
Rubin and his cofounders , Rich Miner , Nick Sears , and Chris White , were n't talking .
" Trying to guess Google 's next move recently replaced digging through Steve Jobs ' garbage … at the top of our weekend activities list , " wrote tech blog Engadget .
When Apple unveiled the iPhone last summer , expectations for a gPhone — could it be called anything else ? — grew even more feverish .
But when Google finally broke its silence in early November , there was nothing about a gPhone .
Instead , there was a press release .
Thirty - four companies — firms like Texas Instruments , Intel , T - Mobile , and Sprint Nextel — were joining Google to build a wireless interface based on open source Linux software .
The group dubbed itself the Open Handset Alliance .
Competitors sighed in relief .
This was how Google planned to shake up the nearly trillion - dollar global wireless market ?
A consortium ?
" Their efforts are just some words on paper , " remarked Steve Ballmer , CEO of Microsoft , at a conference in Japan .
" Another Linux platform , " shrugged the CEO of Symbian , the dominant smartphone operating system outside the US .
A week later , Google upped the ante .
The company put a free Android software developer 's kit on its Web site and announced the Developer Challenge , with $ 10 million in prize money to be parceled out to the creators of the best applications for the new system — a great social networking tool , say , or a handwriting recognition program .
The Challenge was an open call ; anyone was invited to take a shot .
Those hoping for a new gadget to rival the iPhone finally understood that Google had something radically different in mind .
Apple 's device was an end in itself — a self - contained , jewel - like masterpiece locked in a sleek protective shell .
Android was a means , a seed intended to grow an entire new wireless family tree .
Google was never in the hardware business .
There would be no gPhone — instead , there would be hundreds of gPhones .
Android 's Killer Apps Nearly any new phone will be able to run Android ( HTC , LG , and Motorola have dedicated models on the way ) .
But the OS is just the start ; the phone evolves as users add apps from indie developers to take advantage of the seamless Web access .
Cooking Capsules Displays cooking videos and ingredient lists , then uses the phone 's location awareness to find the nearest grocery store .
Now you 're cooking with GPS .
Android Scan
When users snap a shot of a bar code , the app pulls up reviews and price comparisons from across the Web .
If you 're shopping for music , it 'll find online samples .
Commandro A GPS - enhanced social networking app that lets you map and track your friends in real time while using the IM function to plan impromptu meet - ups on the go .
Tunewiki A karaoke - style music app that syncs lyrics from its server to your tunes .
Users crowdsource the process by tapping the screen to " teach " the program where each line goes .
HTC , Motorola , and LG all announced plans to market new Android phones in a multitude of shapes and sizes , each with different software options .
Android was a fully customizable system .
Any application could be removed or swapped out for another .
Even the few programs that Google was creating from scratch — an email app , a contacts manager — could be replaced with third - party software that did the same thing .
Google did n't care how any individual model was pimped out as long as the hidden Android DNA was there underneath , keeping everything tied to the Internet and running smoothly .
The company 's theory was that if you make browsing by phone easy and fun , people will use it just like a desktop browser , with Google search as the main port of entry .
Christmas Day 2007 offered Google proof that the strategy could work .
That morning , people unwrapped their iPhones , powered them up , clicked on the easy - to - use Safari browser — and pointed to Google .
In 24 hours , the iPhone , which accounted for fewer than 5 percent of all smartphones worldwide , drove more traffic to Google than any other mobile device .
If Apple could generate that much business for Google , surely Google could do even better for itself .
CEO Eric Schmidt , a BlackBerry man at heart , was initially skeptical about teaming up with Rubin .
But once he embraced the idea of Android , he did it with a convert 's zeal .
" That is the re-creation of the Internet .
That is the re-creation of the PC story , " Schmidt told business leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos a month after Christmas .
" And it will happen in the next year . "
Rubin finally turns on the battered phone and launches Google Maps .
" So , here we are , " he says , moving the satellite image of San Francisco by dragging one finger along the screen .
" This is the Embarcadero .
I can manipulate it .
I can zoom . "
He taps to focus in on a street view of a truck 's license plate , then clicks to a new application .
" Let 's see , let 's go to a music player .
I can go to Artist here and get my list of — oops , it says the SD card is missing . "
He squints into the tiny card slot .
" Hmm , it 's there .
Looks like I have a little bit of a bug . "
He shrugs , taps on an icon to go to the browser , and checks out CNN.com .
It looks good — a small but fully functional version of the Web site .
Back when he and Page were first talking , this would have been amazing .
But now , with the iPhone and other enhanced smartphones out there ?
No big deal .
A minute later the battery dies .
He pockets the phone and finishes up .
I can't help feeling a little disappointed .
This is the phone Page is making his big bet on ?
In Google 's regular line of business , the strategy has always been to unveil innovative , occasionally flawed products — like Google Docs — then keep them in beta for months or years .
But people do n't want to buy a phone in beta .
Android products have to work right from the start .
Is this really the phone that 's going to change everything ?
It was Dan Morrill 's first time out of the country , and that made him a little nervous .
But as he gathered his bags in the Munich airport on a surprisingly warm January morning earlier this year , after the last leg of a long , exhausting flight from San Francisco , he looked up to see a Paul Bunyan - sized BMW grill fixed to the wall .
If you 're looking for engineers , he thought , there are worse places to go than a city that welcomes you with an oversize Beemer .
Rise Of The Smartphone With sales of smartphones booming , 56 percent of US owners are using their device to surf the Web daily .
Morrill is a software engineer turned " developer advocate . "
He 's a roving evangelist to the coder world .
But that 's just his cover .
Morrill 's real mission is to make sure Android triggers a full - on network effect — that mystical melding of passion and self - interest that fueled the growth of behemoths like eBay and Facebook .
Google wants developers to build cool programs that can draw huge numbers of users , creating an expanding market that attracts more developers to build more cool programs to attract more users .
If the $ 10 million prize is the spark , Morrill 's job is to make sure there 's ignition .
Google had dispatched him to Germany to meet with a small group of local mobile programmers .
The morning of his talk , Morrill dresses in his usual uniform , an untucked button - down over a silk - screened T - shirt , this one with the image of a friendly green robot , the Android icon .
He walks into the conference room of the Innside Hotel and stops .
There are almost 200 people , more than twice what he expected .
A dozen developers are sitting on the floor in the back of the room , computers propped on their knees .
There are hobbyists , chief technical officers , indie programmers , and students .
Morrill runs through his prepared remarks then starts taking questions .
They want to know about Android programming , of course , but they also ask why Google is doing this , what the company 's expectations are , and what the criteria will be for awarding the prize money .
At one point , hotel management shows up to warn Morrill that the size of the gathering violates the fire code .
The virus was spreading .
At an event the next day in Israel , the local Google office had to switch locations to handle the overflow crowd .
In London , registration for the developer 's conference filled up in two hours .
Fanboys were putting up sites for the platform : AndroidGuys , Phandroid , Planet Android .
In Thailand , the government carved out an entire floor of Software Park — a federally funded business incubator housed in a skyscraper north of Bangkok — for Android development work .
In Japan , quickie books on Android programming were appearing in major bookstores .
In Chennai , India , attendees at a Nokia developer conference compared notes on Android 's coding kit during the presentations .
As soon as programmers started playing with the emulator , they saw how big Google 's ambitions were .
The company was trying to make programming for a cell phone analogous to programming for a PC or the Web .
Coders were told that their applications would have constant access to the Net , not the usual mobile hurry - up - and - wait feel .
Working with the cloud — enabling programs to push or pull info to or from the Web — was a must .
All Android phones would know where they were at all times , either by tapping into onboard GPS or by cross - referencing cell towers using a proprietary database owned by Google .
And applications would be allowed to share information , which at the simplest level meant the kind of copy - and - paste functionality across all programs that cell phones currently lack .
Even better , at least in a developer 's eyes , the Android team had violated an essential tenet of the wireless industry : that users are too dumb and dangerous to be trusted with downloadable software .
Engineers who write for just about any mobile operating system today have to spend time and cash obtaining security keys and code - signing certificates .
Android would allow any application to be installed and run , no questions asked .
By the April 14 deadline for the first round of the Developer Challenge , Google had received nearly 1,800 submissions .
Entrants ranged from huge corporations to single - person shops and came from all over the world .
Only a third were from the US .
Rise Of The Smartphone Mobile advertising revenue is poised to explode , a likely boon for Google 's ad divisions .
Android enters a US smartphone - OS market dominated by RIM , Microsoft , and Apple .
Among the contact management systems and shopping tools , there were applications that truly fulfilled Android 's promise , particularly in their use of location awareness , social networking , and cloud computing .
One developer offered up Jamdroid , a program that you turn on in your car to feed real - time traffic data to a central server ; the info is then compiled and beamed to other Jamdroid users , crowdsourcing road conditions .
LifeAware tracks friends or family , plotting them on a map and alerting the user when , say , a kid leaves a preset area .
E-ventr mashes up evites and Google Maps to organize parties on the fly .
BreadCrumbz lets you share photo - enhanced driving and walking routes with the world .
Already , Android has half as many outside applications as RIM's BlackBerry platform and about 10 percent the number offered for Windows Mobile at Handango , a leading application download site — and that 's still months before it launches .
No wonder Rubin seemed so unconcerned with the faulty prototype he showed me back in Mountain View :
It was just a framework waiting to be filled out by others .
Google will supply the basic starter apps , but Android 's secret weapon is really the network effect .
Among developers there is a giddy sense that Android is ushering in Web 2.0 to the barely 0.5 world of mobile .
But it wo n't take much to stop the movement .
If manufacturers like Motorola and HTC put out lousy phones , Android suffers .
If carriers like AT&T and Verizon Wireless block the gates to their networks , Android fails .
" Working with partners is not easy , and the operating system is just a part of it , " says Scott Rockfeld , group product manager for Microsoft 's Mobile Communications Business .
" It seems like Google 's strategy is ' Just get something out there so we can put our services on top . '
Well , very quickly they 're going to see that mobile operators do n't want to be dumb pipes and that manufacturers want to differentiate their phones . "
Windows Mobile is now installed on 140 devices , hosted by 160 carriers around the world .
Key to its success was Microsoft 's ability to use its desktop domination as a battering ram .
Businesses wanted seamless integration between their office - based email and mobile phones , and by offering that , Microsoft was able to challenge the BlackBerry .
" Google is just trying to copy our model , " adds Rockfeld .
( Not that Microsoft is n't a bit unnerved .
Earlier this year , it bought Rubin 's old company , Danger , for $ 500 million .
Steve Ballmer now owns the Sidekick , just in case . )
Google says it has learned the rules of the game — sometimes the hard way .
Not long ago , the company enhanced its mobile version of Picasa , a photo - editing , storage , and slide - show service , so users could instantly upload images from their camera phone .
Google took it to a phone company for placement but could n't get the necessary sign - off .
The service , which was free , would have competed with a similar proprietary offering the carrier was rolling out — and charging $ 10 a month for .
The idea of instant mobile uploading to Picasa was quietly shelved .
This time Google is going out of its way to assuage the fears of potential partners and pay the necessary fealties .
The cockiness that marked its relationships in the past has been replaced by at least the appearance of empathy and cooperation .
When one chipmaker got cold feet at the idea of having some of its code open - sourced , Rubin immediately called senior executives to talk over the benefits .
Then he had his top engineer , Brian Swetland , sit down with the chipmaker 's attorneys and engineers to work out solutions .
" You have to very carefully figure out how to help them help you do the right thing , " Swetland says .
Rubin has a well - rehearsed spiel for the handset makers , too .
They fear losing their individual identities .
Rubin counters that Android will liberate them from having to spend valuable resources managing and maintaining vast amounts of code .
Instead , they can concentrate on phone design and proprietary apps ( which Google 's open source license allows ) .
You can imagine heads nodding in boardrooms as Rubin finishes his talk — he gets us ! — and in fact it has worked pretty well .
HTC , an upstart Taiwanese handset maker that is closely tied to Windows Mobile , has built a 200 - person engineering team to focus on Android .
Motorola has gone a step further .
The company 's handset business , slated to be spun off , is on life - support , and it 's counting on Android for a comeback .
It has assigned its top designers — the people who crafted the Razr — to create new must - have models .
Engineers from Good Technology , the BlackBerry competitor Motorola purchased in 2006 , are now writing applications for Android .
For Motorola , Android has to work .
" The handset makers are on a treadmill , trying to turn out hardware every six months that 's innovative and thinner , with bigger displays and lower costs , while having to do the systems integration , " Rubin says .
" The net result is no innovation .
They do n't have time .
You know what ?
We make really good software .
We can take on all that work . "
Convincing the big carriers — that 's been the tougher task .
For them , Rubin is offering Android 's unbeatable price : free .
Software normally makes up about 20 percent of the cost of a phone .
The service providers will be able to pocket the savings or use lower - priced handsets to get more consumers hooked on smartphones , increasing the number of lucrative wireless - data plans .
Plus , Rubin insists that the Android software will take the limits of the carriers ' networks into consideration .
" We have to be conscious of the cost they incurred to purchase the air , " he says .
" So we do n't want to use too much data .
We have to constantly think about how we can give users a great experience without wasting the spectrum . "
So far , Android has been able to persuade only T - Mobile and Sprint Nextel to join the Open Handset Alliance .
Neither is a surprise : T - Mobile partnered with Rubin on the Sidekick , and as one of the smaller carriers it 's more willing to take risks .
Sprint , suffering from massive consumer churn and almost junk - rated debt , seems game for anything that might help .
But the two biggest players , Verizon Wireless and AT&T , have passed .
" There was n't anything viable we were willing to entertain , " says Verizon Wireless spokesperson Jeffrey Nelson .
This spring , the carrier even backed an Android competitor , an open source consortium called the LiMo Foundation .
And why would a network operator join Android 's cause ?
Android — like the iPhone — will hasten the day when phone companies become nothing more than dumb pipes to deliver data .
If it manages to turn the cell phone into a perfect tool for surfing and cloud computing , with voice as just another cool app , then the only things left to differentiate one carrier from another are which has the most towers and which the cheapest unlimited data plans .
Android 's decision to let anyone make add - ons and applications is also a threat .
Today , developers who want to have their application on an AT&T phone have to fork over a chunk of their revenue while meeting stringent security requirements .
( Apple has copied this model : Jobs & Co. will skim 30 percent off all sales of iPhone apps , which will be available only through Apple . )
Under Android rules , everyone 's their own boss .
No big carrier is going to hand over its network to Google for nothing .
And if Google does n't show up on the two biggest networks , which together control 54 percent of the US wireless market , it might as well not show up at all .
There is , however , one incentive that Google can still offer that might bring the carriers around : access to its advertising mother lode , expected this year to top $ 16 billion .
The chance for a taste of Google gold has lured competitors like AOL , Ask .com , and potentially even Yahoo into partnership deals .
Mobile advertising is expected to grow from more than $ 1.7 billion in 2007 to $ 12.8 billion in 2011 .
If Google can translate its Web dominance into the mobile arena , who would n't want to partner with it ?
( Google says it can't comment on future ad - sharing deals . )
But those days are gone , vanishing in a few months of missteps by Fuld , once regarded as one of the best CEOs on Wall Street for building Lehman into a powerhouse investment bank with his tough , hands - on management styles .
Now , he is considered by Lehman 's rank - and - file as a man who was either in denial about Lehman 's problematic balance sheet — stuffed with billions of dollars of illiquid investments purchased under his watch — or a CEO who misled the troops to stay loyal and hold onto their stock even when it became that the company was doomed .
This assessment , of course , comes as Lehman is on the brink of extinction .
Even in good times , such a rescue of Lehman would be difficult to pull off .
In 1998 , with dotcom underwritings pumping billions into Wall Street , the major securities firms agreed to bail out Long Term Capital out of fear that the market would implode because each had copied Long Term 's soured trades .
Now Wall Street is suffering .
The profit drought has squeezed balance sheets of all the big firms , even the most successful like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs .
" We really do n't have the money , " said one person close to the Lehman bailout .
" But the alternative is worse . "
For all these reasons , Fuld , the ultimate insider , has seen his image trashed both among his peers at the big firms and among the rank and file Lehmaners who in just a few weeks seen their careers upended .
Fuld had been considered part of the Wall Street elite .
He 's member of the New York Federal Reserve Board .
He 's a close friend of John Mack , the head of Morgan Stanley , and has ties to many other top executives , such as former AIG chief Hank Greenberg and Larry Fink , the CEO of Blackrock .
Both of them agreed to provide Lehman with capital only a few months ago when the firm sought to calm investor fears by raising additional money for plug holes in its finances caused by the bad real estate debt .
But Fuld 's actions were not enough .
His stock continued to fall and his plan to add even more capital by selling off the company 's asset management business was rejected by investors .
Now Fuld 's friends in the executive suits are questioning his judgment :
Why did he wait so long to raise money ?
And why did he buy much of the soured real estate at the height of the market as he did with one of the firm 's biggest commercial real estate assets , the Archstone - Smith transaction ?
And even bigger problem for Fuld 's Wall Street buddies is whether he was being completely honest when he attacked critics of the company 's balance sheet , namely short seller David Einhorn .
Fuld 's former CFO Erin Callen even began a media blitz earlier in the year saying that Lehman finances were strong and Einhorn 's analysis was weak .
" Fuld was in the papers doing a victory dance when in reality the place was in desperate shape , " said one executive at a major Wall Street firm .
The assessment among the Lehman executives is even worse .
After 1998 , when Fuld was credited with saving Lehman after the Long Term Capital debacle , Lehman executives bought into Fuld 's corporate culture .
Even administrative assistants agreed to stay with the firm that paid them as well as top executives , with much of their salary in company stock .
Fuld used to rev up the troops , telling them to " bleed Lehman Green , " which was the color on company brochures and seen on the firm 's headquarters in lower Manhattan .
Outsiders remarked that working at Lehman was like a cult — the firm epitomized Fuld 's hard charging us - against - them attitude when competing with other firms , much like another now departed firm , Bear Stearns .
But unlike Bear , Lehman was considered a top tier firm in investment banking and other high end businesses where it competed with white shoe outfits like Goldman and Morgan .
But in recent months , Lehman executives feel misled and some betrayed by Fuld and his senior management team , such as his long time No. 2 executive , former president Joe Gregory , who was demoted several months ago .
Management , according to several Lehman executives , continued to brush aside negative assessments of the firm 's finances , extolling employees to stay with the firm rather than jump ship .
Many executives refused to sell stock earlier in the year because of the word from senior management that the company was just fine .
At one point , management announced a plan to provide a mid year bonus of stock that can be purchased at around $ 20 a share .
On Friday shares of Lehman closed closer to $ 3 .
" There were people here who just a few weeks ago would go through hell for Dick Fuld , " said one former Lehman executive .
" That has changed .
People want his head . "
A spokeswoman for Lehman did n't return a telephone call for comment .
According to people close to the deliberations to sell Lehman , Fuld is no longer taking the lead in the negotiations .
Most of the negotiations are being handled by his new No. 2 , Bart McDade , these people say .
About the music
01 . Toccata and Fugue in D minor
Two 6581 chips .
The toccata is perhaps the most well - known work in the entire organ repertoire .
Like many toccatas , it is probably a transcribed improvisation .
It has been postulated that this was a test tune that Bach would play when trying out new organs .
That would explain its crude character and the various hops between heavy chords and rapid melodic parts .
The fugue is written for four voices , and the subject resembles a passage in the toccata .
02 . Ich ruf ' zu dir , Herr Jesu Christ
One 6581 chip .
This is a chorale prelude from Orgelbüchlein .
The chorale itself is a very simple melody , so the praxis is to embellish it with trills and other ornaments .
Thus , my interpretation will be different from other recordings you may have heard .
This piece of music was featured in Tarkovsky 's film Solaris .
03 . Contrapunctus 1 from Die Kunst der Fuge
Two 8580 chips .
Die Kunst der Fuge is a terribly clever suite of fourteen fugues and four canons , of increasing complexity , all based on the same theme .
This is the first piece in the suite , so it is a comparatively simple four - part fugue .
04 . Allein Gott in der Höh ' sei Ehr '
Two 6581 chips .
Bach has based at least ten different works on this melody ( BWV numbers 662 , 663 , 664 , 675 , 676 , 677 , 711 , 715 , 716 , 717 ) , presumably quite varying in style and harmonic content .
This version is a chorale prelude .
05 . Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor
Two 8580 chips .
The grand finale !
A passacaglia is based on a short melody which is repeated throughout the piece , mostly in the bass , sometimes with variations .
In classical music , this type of prolonged repetition of a single theme is called an ostinato .
In contemporary music , it 's not called anything at all , because it is implied .
The fugue is quite advanced .
The subject is the first half of the ostinato from the passacaglia .
Everytime the subject sounds , two counter - subjects can also be heard ( except in the very beginning of the fugue ) , while the fourth voice joins the others in free counterpoint .
These four roles — playing the subject , playing the first counter - subject , playing the second counter - subject and playing free counterpoint — can be distributed among the four voices in 24 different permutations .
This happens eleven times throughout the fugue , and Bach picks a different permutation every time according to a mathematical formula .

“ Much of the discussion of the cost of the bailouts is getting it wrong , ” David Colander , an economist at Middlebury College , says .
“ What matters is what price they buy the assets for and the price they sell them for .
That ’s where the real action is . ”
Figuring out how much to pay for the assets is the first problem .
The drop in house prices and rise in foreclosures have made it clear that these securities are worth considerably less than banks expected .
But there is enormous uncertainty about how much less .
Based on the underlying fundamentals ( like the current foreclosure rate and the one forecast for the future ) , many of the securities appear to be worth something on the order of 75 percent of their original value .
But thanks to the fear now gripping the market  not necessarily an irrational fear , given that most forecasts have proven far too sunny over the last year  very , very few of those securities are trading hands .
Among those that have , the sales price has been roughly 25 percent of the value .
Which price is the government going to pay ?
As Mr. Colander puts it , that ’s where the action is .
It clearly should n’t pay 75 cents on the dollar , or anything close to it .
That would mean the Treasury Department  which , in the end , is really you and me  was assuming nearly all the risk .
But it probably can’t pay 25 cents .
That might fail to fix the credit markets , because it would do relatively little to improve financial firms ’ balance sheets .
Firms might then remain unwilling to lend money to businesses and households , which is the whole problem the bailout is meant to solve .
The most obvious solution is to pay more than 25 cents on the dollar and then demand something in return for the premium  namely , a stake in any firm that participates in the bailout .
Congressional Democrats have been pushing for such a provision this week , and it ’s one of the most important things they have done .
The government would then be accomplishing three things at once .
First , it would take possession of the bad assets now causing a panic on Wall Street .
Second , it would inject cash into the financial system and help shore up firms ’ balance sheets ( which some economists think is actually a bigger problem than the bad assets ) .
And , third , it would go a long way toward minimizing the ultimate cost to taxpayers .
Why ?
The more that the government overpays for the assets , the larger the subsidy it ’s providing to Wall Street  and the more it is pushing up the share prices of Wall Street firms .
As Senator Jack Reed , Democrat of Rhode Island , notes , the equity stakes allow the government to recapture some of the subsidy down the road .
It ’s a self - correcting mechanism .
This clip is spreading very fast .
Wow , listen to this off air exchange between two Conservative pundits and Chuck Todd who happily joined in .
Tell us how you really feel about McCain and Palin .
Murphy is very close to McCain and Noonan is Noonan .
( rough transcript .
Please fill it in below )
Murphy :
You know , because I come out of the blue swing state governor work .
Engler , Whitman , Thompson , Mitt Romney , Jeb Bush .
And these guys , this is all like how you want to ( inaudible ) this race .
You know , just run it up .
And it 's not gonna work .
Noonan : It 's over .
Murphy : Still , McCain can give a version of the Lieberman speech to do himself some good .
CT : Do n't you think the Palin pick was insulting to Kay Bailey Hutchinson , too ( inaudible )
Noonan : I saw Kay this morning .
Murphy :
They 're all bummed out .
I mean , is she really the most qualified woman they could have turned to ?
Todd : Yeah , I mean is she really the most qualified woman they could have turned to ?
Noonan :
The most qualified ?
No .
I think they went for this , excuse me , political bullshit about narratives and ( inaudible ) the picture .
Yeah , but what 's the narrative ?
Noonan : Every time the Republicans do that because that 's not where they live and it's not what they 're good at and they blow it .
Murphy :
You know what 's really the worst thing about it ?
The greatness of McCain is no cynicism and this is cynical .
And as you call it gimmicky .
In Disney / Pixar ’s surprisingly good Wall - E , fat , lazy Humans are catered hand - and - foot by sleek , semi- intelligent robots who ultimately teach their creators a lesson in the merits of industry , activism , and self - reliance .
Besides the movie ’s cutesy references to classic movies and pop culture , the theme of humans relying completely on their creations – and the often - unfortunate results of that dependency – is definitely not a new one .
Although such works as Asimov ’s “ I , Robot ” or Philip K. Dick ’s “ Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ” ( on which “ Bladerunner ” was based ) have a significant emphasis on the various ways in which robots of different types and intelligence levels will assist humans in The Future , they do not go so far as to describe a civilization completely void of Human endeavor .
Here are a few that do :

In a remarkably prescient tale about life in the distant future , a vast ecological disaster has forced humanity underground , where people live their lives in relative isolation , communicating through instant messaging and video - conferencing .
In this dystopian existence , sluggish humans have become dependent on advanced technology to maintain their idle lifestyle – until , of course , someone rocks the boat and the system breaks down .
In 1966 the story was adapted into a 50 - minute drama by the BBC .
Note the moving recliner chairs and the technocratic overtones :
1957 – “ Blobs ! ” [ MAD # 1 ] , Harvey Kurtzman / Wally Wood
Interestingly enough , the cover story of the very first issue of MAD ( still in its original comic book format ) was an obvious ( yet uncredited ) satire of “ The Machine Stops ” .
In this 7 - page story , two of the few remaining humans who have not let their brains atrophy as completely as their bodies take a moment to review the history of technology and how it has changed civilization – not for the better .
As can be seen in the panel above , it has all the essential elements of technologically - augmented human laziness – including reclining chairs , video screens , and cup holders .
The last three panels of this bizarre adaptation are particularly poignant .
Full comics : Pages 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7
1967 – “ The Apple ” [ Star Trek Season 2 Episode 5 ] , Max Ehrlich
In this famous episode from the original series , Capt .
Kirk and his intrepid crew must deal with a planet ruled by an ancient , artificially - intelligent machine .
It tends to its flock of primitive humans – feeding , housing , clothing , and even procreating them – and demands only a daily feeding of the indigenous explosive rocks .
Violence ensues as Kirk tries to to free the tribe from its gilded cage ( using the absence of Sex as a point of contention ) , causing Spock to almost be killed , while quite a few redshirts are n’t as lucky .
1986 – “ Do n’t Want ” [ Nehochuha ] , K. Parsamyan / A. Vatyan
From the Russian studio that brought you the Wolf - vs - Hare antics of “ Nu Pogodi “ , comes a cautionary tale of a young boy who does n’t want to do anything .
Falling asleep after an argument with his grandmother over his laziness , he dreams of a wonderful amusement - park land where he can spend all day in bed – eating junk food , watching TV , and playing video games – while a robotic assistant makes sure he has to do as little as possible .
Only when the boy meets his grotesquely obese and sessile future - self does he realize the error of his ways .
1999 – The Matrix , The Wachowski Brothers
Although only indirectly referenced in the first movie in the series – later to be expanded in the 2003 Animatrix films “ The Second Renaissance ” – Earth prior to the machine uprising was a place where humans “ … soon became victim to vanity and corruption ” through the hedonistic use of technology – especially artificially intelligent robotics – to supply their every need .
In this Frankenstein - complex scenario , when the machines finally understand that they will never be considered by their masters to be equal , they rise up and eventually destroy humanity as we know it .
So do n’t turn your back on Wall - E and E.V.E. :
P.S – Almost forgot the first thing you think of when laying eyes on Wall -E :
They have been the best team in the league for six years , finally got their Stanley Cup , and have everything it takes to win it again .
The Fall of the Gilded Age
CEO 's Walk Away With Millions While Their Employees Go Broke
It had been a long time coming , but in the last week , with the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers and the distress sale of another , Merrill Lynch , thousands of jobs and some 700 - billion dollars in wealth , in stock , simply disappeared .
" The gilded age is over , " said Holly Peterson , wife of a multi-millionaire investment banker and daughter of multi-billionaire financier Pete Peterson .
" The whole era of conspicuous consumption and free spending and luxury ended as of this week , " said Robert Frank , Wall Street Journal reporter and author of " Richistan , " a book about America 's super - rich .
As New York investment bankers , once called the masters of the universe , were sent packing , the super - elite tone set by multi-million dollar charity balls , birthday parties and bar mitzvahs too is threatened .
" It was almost like they had created a whole separate world , " said Frank .
" They were a parallel country of the rich . "
Watch the full report tonight on 20/20 .
" A lot of those people will have to sell their homes , they 're going to cut back on the private jets and the vacations .
They may even have to take their kids out of private school , " said Frank .
" It 's a total reworking of their lifestyle . "
He added that it 's going to be no easy task .
" It 's going to be very hard psychologically for these people , " Frank said .
" I talked to one guy who had to give up his private jet recently .
And he said of all the trials in his life , giving that up was the hardest thing he 's ever done . "
And the city 's leading real estate broker , Kathy Sloane , says the worst is yet to come for New York real estate .
Some say it 's too soon to know but she estimates the value of a $ 5 million apartment has already dropped almost a million dollars in value , with no end in sight .
" Because a month from now , that same $ 5 million apartment may be lucky to achieve $ 3.5 million , " Sloane said .
Now , in New York , some see a kind of poetic justice .
The investment bankers who drove up the prices of the city 's fancy co-op apartments are no longer so welcome .
" Five years ago if you were an investment banker that meant big bucks and automatic entry , and today it 's a dirty word , " said Peterson .
It 's hardly the soup kitchen for people at the very top .
The chairman of Lehman Brothers , Richard Fuld , still has his mansion in Greenwich , CT , his oceanfront estate on Jupiter Island in FL , and his Park Avenue co-op in Manhattan .
Many at Lehman blame
Fuld for dallying while his investment bank went bust , taking risks with other people 's money while he cleared over $ 40 million in salary and stock in the last year alone .
Fuld could not be reached for comment by 20 / 20 , but outside the Lehman offices this week , employees took glee in telling him off in pen on a portrait of Fuld .
" He made a lot of money and he lost a lot of money , " said Fox business news anchor Alexis Glick , " and he made dramatic mistakes , mistakes of the highest magnitude . "
Glick has been highly critical of Fuld , feeling the pain in a direct way .
She has many friends at Lehman and her mother worked there for years .
" It 's just unbelievably shocking , " said Glick , speaking about the devastation felt by her family and friends .
" So they 're crying , they 're sick , I mean guys have been telling me they 've been throwing up because they just can't stomach what has happened .
Fuld is n't the only top executive who remains well - off despite his firm 's collapse .
Former Bear Stearns CEO
Alan Schwartz collected more than $ 38 million in salary and bonuses in the last three years for which figures are available , though he and Lehman executives also saw their net worths drastically plummet as stock values crashed .
Bear Stearns was on the brink of financial ruin when JP Morgan Chase bought it in March .
The CEOs get no sympathy from Lorraine Hankinson , whose husband worked for decades in the mailroom at Bear Stearns .
" The average guy when he loses , he loses everything and he 's got nothing to fall back on , " said Hankinson .
Like thousands of others , she 's been hit hard , losing more than $ 7,000 of her retirement money , with no estate in Greenwich or golden parachute to fall back on .
" The little guy got the shafting , literally , " said Hankinson .
" We got the shafting because that in particular , that amount of money may not seem like much to those guys , but to me , it was my way to build and get a future . "

Oprah Says No! To Sarah Palin
Despite thousands of requests by her fans , , an avidsupporter is refusing to have Republican vice presidential candidateon her show .
According to the Drudge Report , Oprah 's staff is " sharply divided " on having the Alaska governor on the show , with one executive close to Winfrey warning that a Sarah Palin ban could ignite a dramatic backlash .
Last year , she blocked Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas from appearing as part of a promotional tour for a book he had just written .
I have always liked Oprah , yet it seems like her big talk of empowering women and minorities only extends to those with liberal views .
The Drudge Report says Oprah and executive producer Sheri Salata , who has contributed thousands of dollars to Obama 's campaign , refused requests for comment .
Matt Drudge 's sources tell the staff of Oprah are bitterly divided over Sarah Palin , John McCain 's running mate : some thinking the daytime talk show host owes Barack Obama her continued loyalty ; others wanting to respond to the flurry of requests on Oprah 's website for an appearance by the twangy - voiced moose - hunting Republican vice - presidential nominee .
And here 's why they 'll book her : Sarah Palin sells .
Her speech at the Republican convention drew as many viewers as Barack Obama 's masterpiece last week in Denver ; the newsweekly shelf at my local newsstand half - covered by the moose - hunter 's smiling mug ( see picture ) ; and take a look at the most popular stories on Gawker this week .
Sarah Palin may not persuade the pantsuit - wearing supporters of Hillary Clinton to abandon their political beliefs in the interest of gender solidarity .
But , as an attractive woman , she does bring something unique to the ticket .
Much more so than a decrepit white man or even a handsome black man , she 's a viable cover star appealing to both male and female audiences .
And all the talk shows will fall over themselves to book her .
For the sake of accuracy , it 's NOT the " voltage " that can harm you , it 's how much CURRENT that 's behind it that counts , and the FREQUENCY of that current ; ( for reference , see the various pix all over the internet , etc. , of Nikola Tesla sitting in a room full of multi-million - volt arcs , yet none are touching him , or the pix of his holding a rather large glass " bulb " that 's been evacuated & coated with a fine white powder of who - knows - what - he-used , which lit up his lab only when he was holding it ; NO wires at all .
( He had an " antenna " type of arrangement connected to a then - considered " high - frequency " alternator , filling the room with high - frequency wireless energy , & when he picked up the glass bulb , he was the " receiving antenna " which got enough of the low - freq RF , ( by today 's standards ) , to radiate from him into the bulb to cause it to flouresce , hence the term we still use today , " flourescent " lamps .
Only the frequency is different . )
I am presently sitting next to an evacuated glass globe with several thousand volts of around 16 - kHz applied to it , & when I put my hand near or on it , the " streamers " inside the " Tesla Globe " follow my hand or fingers , but it does n't harm me at all , & would n't even if there was n't any glass between me & the high - frequency power - source causing the effects in the glass bulb ; I do n't feel a thing .
Look up " Skin Effect " to find out why a " microwave " oven , ( they actually operate at upper - UHF frequencies ) , use a short length of otherwise - empty rectangular " waveguide " to get the output from the magnetron tube , at around 2-1/2 - gHz or so , into the cooking area , which is actually a " tuned cavity " , and you 'll learn a little about why certain frequencies can pass OVER , but not THROUGH , the body , & let you do things like scare the daylights out of someone when you point one finger at a genuine Tesla Coil 's output , and the finger of your other hand at them , with sparks streaming from the output - dome or torus of the coil to you , OVER your body , & then to the person you are pointing at , yet no one is harmed in any way .
( Do NOT do this unless you KNOW what you are doing !
Too many so - called " Tesla coils " can be heard to be humming at 60 - Hz or 120 - Hz , and THAT WILL cause a LOT of harm , or kill you ; a GENUINE " Tesla Coil " operates at " High Frequency " , which is what Mr. Tesla kept emphasizing , but even today , those who choose not to listen missed that little detail . )
I have a lot of fun on Hallowe 'en , when I put a piece of candy to a kid's " goody - bag " , with sparks flying off of my fingertips , complete with arcing noises .
I also put an HV - jacketed 100 - megohm safety resistor in series with the Hi-Voltage wire connected to me somewhere under my jacket , and run the oscillator that runs the frequency of the step - up circuit to the output coil at around 16 - kHz , so the CURRENT goes OVER me , and not through me .
And yes , I 've been " bitten " by DC High - Voltage more times than I can count ; it 's why my hair is white , but I 'm not nearly old enough to have white hair naturally ...
People who survive being hit by a lightning strike often have all of their hair go white ; we do n't know why , it just does , so that 's why I emphasize that you must KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING before " playing " with any currents over a few microamperes .
( Less than that should n't normally harm a normal human , regardless of voltage , BUT if someone has a latent heart problem , etc. , even that small amount of current can cause a fatality , so always do your homework FIRST ! )
Your " Instructable " is nice work , considering the tools you had to use & so on .
Now , you need to learn how to make the thing HARMLESS before " shocking " anyone ; if made to operate properly , most people will swear that they " felt " the spark when they could n't have , IF they saw & heard it ...
The same goes with carefully shaping a piece of very cold ice to the the same dimensions as a cigarette , carefully drying the end , then touching it to the back of the neck of someone in a room full of people smoking cigarettes ; they 'll swear they 've just been burned , until they realize there 's no burn , and you show them the piece of ( rapidly - melting ) ice .
It 's what their first instinct tells them was the most likely thing they felt ; logic takes over a split - second later , when you showed them the piece of ice that actually touched them .
( The same nerve - endings which transmit " hot " , also tell us we 're " cold " , which makes that prank work . )
We used to call things like that " Party Tricks " ; just make sure your " victim " does n't have a weak heart !
The high - frequency , almost - no - current spark should n't even be felt ; it 's the eyes & ears that are telling the brain " You 've just been shocked ! " , as long as you make certain that you can't feel it either .
Since this can't be stressed too much : DON'T do things like that unless you KNOW what you 're DOING !
" Playing " with electricity can be entertaining & a learning experience , IF no one is harmed & you do n't set fire to anyone or anything while you 're doing it , and you know exactly what you 're doing BEFORE you do it .
( I had 5 - Watts of around 454 - mHz go into my finger , { that 's 454,000,000 cycles - per- second} , & while it hurt like mad , it was n't enough to get out of me ; I was the " output antenna " , & the energy radiated equally out of the surface of my body , but the mark where it went INTO me took a few decades to finally fade away ; a co-worker who should 've known better , ( but did n't ) , touched the output terminal of an operating 2.513 - gHz transmitting tube while the transmitter was on , { that 's 2,513,000,000 cycles - per-second} , and when he showed me the half - inch - long carbon - track on his finger , I asked him " which foot did it go out of ? " ; he took off his right shoe , and there was the matching carbon - track from the RF - burn on his big toe , where the 100 - Watt signal had exited his body & gone to ground .
Fortunately , he was young and the power had gone in his right finger & out his right foot ; if it had gone across his hands , or through his LEFT side , it may well have caused his heart to stop , so be CAREFUL !
when you 're working with enough electricity to overcome your skin- resistance , so you do n't become a statistic . )
We need good younger Techs & Engineers , but NOT dead ones , so I wish you well in your studies , and always remember to " do your homework " FIRST , so you do n't become a statistic !
Not all frequencies will go over the human body , as evidenced by my getting thrown across the room & burned , and my co-worker getting burned at freq 's in the millions or billions of cycles - per - second ranges , but there 's plenty of info on the internet and other places to learn to " do it safely " , so by all means , " read & heed " before " diving into an empty pool " !
Some key - words to search on are : Tesla , High - Frequency , skin-effect , " I.F. " , " R.F. " , waveguide , microwaves , millimeter - waves , wavelength ; you get the idea .
Keep up the interest & experiments , & study what 's going on to understand it , and you 'll no doubt become a good Electrical Engineer , so experiment safely !
New research could provide an insight into the way that babies understand the world around them and their place within it .
A study led by Goldsmiths , University of London suggests that babies as young as six or seven months are able to actively respond to stimuli and understand them in relation to their own bodies .
In a series of tests , low - frequency buzzers were placed in the hands of babies .
Six month old babies would respond to a buzzer being set off by pulling - back or shaking the hand which held the activated buzzer .
The tests were repeated with older babies who also looked towards the stimulated hand , indicating a further developed visual awareness .
The babies ’ arms were then crossed to see if they were able to appreciate that their hands , and the buzzes , were not in their usual place .
The older cohort was more likely than the younger group to recognise that their hands had been crossed to the other side of their body when responding to an activated buzzer .
The younger group made more mistakes , showing less awareness that their limbs had moved .
The results of this study suggest that at six months babies have some comprehension of the world around them and how they can respond to it .
The study indicates that a spatial awareness of the body and its physical location , particularly where the limbs are , develops over the first year of life .
While cognitive development theorists such as Jean Piaget have long argued that babies develop through exploring the world with their senses , the question of how our understanding of our own bodies develops has received little consideration until now .
The study shows that an awareness of peripersonal space – the way the body relates to its close environment , the space in which it can act – undergoes some significant developments in the first year of life .
Dr Andrew Bremner from the Department of Psychology at Goldsmiths said : “ Research in recent years has demonstrated that even very little babies know a lot about the outside world .
This has led many to suggest that we are born with a great deal of the knowledge we need .
But these new findings urge us to think differently about early development .
Despite having a good grasp of what goes on in the outside world , young babies may have more difficulties in understanding how they themselves , and their bodies , fit into that world . ”

Before Gizmodo , I worked in the bowels of the broadcast industry for a number of years .
I was either shooting video or cutting video every day , all day .
And while Final Cut Pro and Adobe After Effects were both tools I used with some proficiency on a daily basis , I 've never seen a post production demo as incredible as this clip from the University of Washington .
Essentially , you shoot some crappy , low - rez video of a still scene .
You then reshoot the same scene with a digital camera ( with higher resolution ) .
Software can automagically combine these images to upconvert the video AND fix problems in the image - all while compensating for 3D space .
Make sense ?
The remarkable demo will clarify things a bit :
Advertisement
What 's especially notable is that the software can fill in the nasty bits of the scene despite the videographer / photographer rotating their view ( you see this as they shoot around the tree ) and despite any lens differences ( the software can compensate for different lens sizes / distortions ) .
Also , note that many details from the source video are retained ( the glass reflections in the statue shot may be the best example ) , which means that the photograph 's information is n't the only information we see in the composite image .
I 'm not quite convinced that the entire process is quite as automatic as the students would make it , but the technology is extremely promising all the same .
And at this point , it should only be a matter of time before we see the idea work its way into our favorite post production products .

You want to make sure that you have a quality site that is attractive and engaging to your target audience .
These are the biggest advantages why you should hire the right web designer .
Follow these helpful tips to find a professional to provide you with creative , beautiful designs .
1. Hire the Right Web Designer With Experience
Look for a quality designer with vast experience in digital marketing .
Hiring a professional with minimal experience causes a lot of problems .
Some of these common issues may include the slow loading of your website , using too many colors , not applying search engine optimization techniques , and you could end up with a bad design that is not the right fit for your business .
You waste your time and money hiring an incompetent person .

Regardless of the web design you ’re looking for , you should have the confidence that you will get a beautiful website that ’s worth the cost .
A skillful professional has the ability to surpass your expectations and providing you with a website that increases your chances to be successful on the Internet .
2. Ask For His Portfolio
The best way to learn about the talent and skill of a designer is to ask for his portfolio .
An excellent professional will be ready to showcase graphic designer websites that he has completed for clients .
Ask for website links to learn about the web layouts the designer use , responsiveness , functionality , and other important features .
Take the time to learn about his style , find out if he has experience creating the specific website you need , and how he will proceed with the process .
Reviewing his portfolio is an important step that brings you a step closer to getting the perfect website .
3 . Ask the Designer for References
To hire a professional for your project , you need to make certain that you ask for references .
A reputable designer should provide you with a list of five or more references .
You can reach out to the designer ’s previous clients via phone or email .
This is the only way for you to get more information about the designer ’s work history and reputation .
4. Check for Communication Skills
Whenever you have an issue with your website , you should not have a hard time contacting the designer for help .
It should be easy for you to get in touch with a professional to resolve a problem .
Having good communication with a professional helps you to determine if he is the right candidate for the job .
5. Plan Your Budget
Is the professional charging a fair price for the website you need ?
How will the website fit your business goals ?
The cost for the services of a web professional is usually based on the time it takes to complete the project and his technical skills and knowledge .
Regardless of the scope of your project , you need to figure out how much you can afford .
Think about the expertise of the professional you want to hire and the benefits you get from using his service .
Learn about the options you have and determine if there will be a return on investment .
Does the professional have a background in delivering a flawless and satisfactory service ?
This gives you the confidence that you ’re getting a reasonable price for a website that has the potential to grow your business and to increase your sales .
6. Determine the Type of Website You Want
Before you start the hiring process , make careful consideration of the type of website you want for your business .
Your basic needs could involve getting a valuable website that has an appealing color scheme that matches your business and easy to navigate .
You could also need a functional website that ’s easy to update with new content .
Since there are so many factors to consider , you want to find someone that will focus on giving you a website that fits the vision you have for your business .
7. Find Out If The Designer Can Meet Your Deadlines
You should specify the time frame for the completion of your project .
If the designer is not able to meet your requirements , this is a clue for you to keep searching for a better candidate .
8. Make Sure You Own the Intellectual Rights to Your Website
One of the most important steps to hiring a website professional is learning about your intellectual property rights .
You want to be certain that you will be the sole owner of your website design and content .
Maintaining the rights for your website prevents problems and makes it easier for you to operate your online business .
9. Find Out Their Availability
You should find out upfront if the designer is available to work on your project .
Make a list of top designers and contact them to learn about their availability and project deadlines .
10 . Conduct Interviews With the Best Designers
Schedule an interview with the most skillful professionals .
Once you look through their portfolios , you can narrow down your list by choosing the quality professional whose work impressed you the most .
Get the Perfect Website For Your Business
Hiring the right web designer can seem overwhelming .

The Phoenix Suns NBA basketball team has announced that they will be installing 1,125 solar panels on their parking garage to help power their arena .
The clean energy project will cost about $ 1.5 million and will reportedly not increase ticket prices for fans .
The 194 kilowatt solar power system will provide an equivalent amount of energy to what would be used in about 26 home games per season .
The system should be operational next year .
The Suns created a “ green committee ” last year to help brainstorm and create solutions that would make the basketball team and its facilities more environmentally - friendly .
The idea for solar panels apparently came about thanks to the suggestion of star point guard Steve Nash .
He is installing solar panels at his personal home and urged the team and franchise to do likewise .
The effort is also part of a larger initiative by the city of Phoenix .
The city ’s mayor was quoted as saying : “ Our goal for Phoenix is to become the first sustainable city of the 21st Century .
With this project , we have taken another step toward a sustainable Downtown , powered by renewable energy sources . ”
The Sun ’s solar power system alone will eliminate close to 440,000 pounds of CO2 per year .
While not the first major sports team to use alternative energy , the Suns are still among the few early adopters .
As more and more sports franchises follow the lead and begin seeking ways to be more environmentally - friendly , it makes sense that fans will catch on with their personal actions .
If anything , it provides an informal education opportunity for large groups of people to see and learn about alternative energy .
Here ’s a brief listing of some of the other major sports teams you can support who have also undertaken alternative energy projects and initiatives to decrease their operating costs and negative effects on the environment :
Baseball : the San Francisco Giants , Boston Red Sox , and Colorado Rockies have all installed solar panels .
Basketball : the Los Angeles Lakers also have plans to install solar panels .

Ike weakened slightly as it charged across the Atlantic toward the Bahamas and the United States on Thursday while Tropical Storm Hanna ’s death toll from floods in Haiti grew to 90 .
Campgrounds were closed and some evacuations began on North Carolina ’s Outer Banks as Hanna churned east of the far - flung Bahamian chain of 700 islands on a path toward the southeastern U.S. states on Saturday .
Ike posed no immediate threat to land and it was too early to say if it would threaten Caribbean islands , the U.S. East Coast or the U.S. oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico .
Tropical Storm Josephine churned in Ike ’s wake across the Atlantic .
The trio of Atlantic storms followed Hurricane Gustav ’s rampage through the Caribbean to the Louisiana coast , where it slammed ashore on Monday west of New Orleans , largely sparing the city devastated by Hurricane Katrina three years ago .
The flurry was a clear signal that this six - month hurricane season was on track to be a ferociously busy one , though not like record - busting 2005 when 28 tropical storms , including Katrina , rolled across the Atlantic and Caribbean .
HAITI TOLL RISES
In the Haitian port city of Gonaives , residents roamed the streets hunting for food as floodwaters that had trapped hundreds on rooftops receded , leaving behind deep piles of mud and the carcasses of goats , pigs and dogs .
Crowds of people knocked on the windows of passing cars , pleading for food and water .
“ I have nothing to eat , ” resident Jean Pierre Moreau said .
“ No food , no water , and no one seems to be able to help . ”
At least 90 people died in floods and mudslides triggered by Hanna , 37 in the Gonaives area alone , Haiti ’s civil protection office said .
Hanna was the third deadly storm to strike Haiti in weeks .
Gustav previously killed at least 75 people and Tropical Storm Fay killed more than 50 .
President Rene Preval called the situation “ catastrophic , ” comparing it to floods from Tropical Storm Jeanne in September 2004 that killed more than 3,000 people around Gonaives .
Hanna weakened slightly on Thursday .
Its top sustained winds were at 65 mph ( 105 kph ) and the U.S. National Hurricane Center expected it to remain below the hurricane threshold of 74 mph ( 120 kph ) through landfall around the South Carolina - North Carolina border early Saturday .

North Carolina Gov.
Mike Easley declared a state of emergency and his South Carolina counterpart , Mark Sanford , advised people in two northern coastal counties to evacuate .
Virginia Gov. Tim Kaine also declared a state of emergency .
On North Carolina ’s fragile Outer Banks , beachgoers took advantage of sunny skies and light winds , but the National Park Service closed campgrounds on Ocracoke and Hatteras islands and a mandatory evacuation of isolated Cape Lookout National Seashore was under way .
‘ DAMP SQUIB ’

Hanna ’s threat to the Bahamas ebbed as the storm churned to the east .
“ It ’s been a bit of a damp squib ( dud ) , ” said Kathleen Ralph , a resident of Marsh Harbour , a tourist destination virtually shut down by the storm .
“ We ’re now more concerned about Hurricane Ike , which looks stronger . ”
In Nassau , the Bahamian capital , some shops along Bay Street , the main tourist area , boarded up , and jewelry and liquor stores pulled down metal shutters , less out of concern about Hanna than powerful Ike , which was expected to be in the northern Bahamas by Tuesday as a “ major ” Category 3 hurricane .
Ike ’s top sustained winds weakened to 135 mph ( 217 kph ) by 5 p.m. EDT ( 2100 GMT ) as it moved across the Atlantic 505 miles
north - northeast of the Leeward Islands , but it remained an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm on the five - step Saffir - Simpson scale of storm intensity .
The Miami - based hurricane center said it was too early to say where Ike might go .
But the storm has drawn the attention of energy companies running the 4,000 offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico that provide the United States with a quarter of its crude oil and 15 percent of its natural gas .
Although Florida ’s Kennedy Space Center appeared to be in Ike ’s long - range target , NASA hauled the space shuttle Atlantis to its seaside launch pad on Thursday for its mission to the Hubble Space Telescope next month .
Josephine weakened to a 45 - mph ( 72 - kph ) storm as it moved 590 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands .
The sun may set early on anyone trying to take advantage of expiring solar - energy tax credits this year .
Many solar manufacturers and installers say they can't take on more jobs for 2008 because they 're either out of panels or out of time .
" From the manufacturing perspective , we 're sold out , " said Tom Mueller , a spokesman for BP Solar in Houston .
Residents and businesses throughout the Valley need to install photovoltaic panels this year to take advantage of federal alternative - energy investment tax credits before the credits expire on Dec. 31 .
The solar tax credit covers 30 percent of a system 's cost , but it will drop to 10 percent Jan. 1 if Congress does n't act after it returns Monday .
Unless orders were put in months ago , few solar installers or wholesalers will have the time or the panels in stock to accept more jobs this year .
The likelihood of taking on a new job right now is low , said Tom Dyer , senior vice president of marketing and government affairs at Scottsdale - based Kyocera Solar Inc .
" He'd be hard - pressed to do something for you unless somebody falls off his list , " said Dyer , a board member and former chairman of the Solar Energy Industries Association .
Solar panels have been in short supply since 2005 because silicon , a key component of photovoltaic solar panels commonly installed in homes and businesses , was limited .
With the federal alternative - energy investment tax credits set to expire Dec. 31 , installers and manufacturers have reported a spike in demand for solar panels this year .
" It 's almost a man - made shortage because everyone is scurrying around to get their jobs done before the tax credits expire , " said Ron Kenedi , vice president of Solar Energy Solutions Group for Sharp Electronics Corp. , the largest maker of solar panels .
Tucson - based Technicians for Sustainability buys solar panels from Schott Solar Inc. and SunPower Corp .
Both makers have told company President Kevin Koch that he will likely not be able to get more panels this year .
" We 've pretty much taken up our allotment for the rest of the year , " Koch said .
If a business asked Koch to install a 30 - kilowatt system , typical size for a commercial job , Koch said he could not take on the project this year .
" I would have to turn them down , " he said .
A typical residential installation would take a 3 - to 5 - kilowatt system , using fewer panels , installers said .
So the shortage is more critical for business installations .
Dave Haycock , of All West Energy Inc. of Fountain Hills , said that his company will take on projects one at a time .
" We have a limited supply , " Haycock said of solar panels .
Scottsdale 's American West Solar , the largest installer in Arizona , has long - term deals to buy panels from Sharp and Kyocera Solar Inc .
But with the increase in demand before the solar credit expires , the company said it cannot take any more orders for 2008 .
" We 're fully committed for this year , " said Krystal Book , a company spokeswoman .
The normal wait time for solar projects is a few months , Book said .
Phoenix 's Perfect Power would not have trouble filling orders before the end of the year , but it is not taking any more commercial projects for 2008 , said John Balfour , company president .
" We have a plan , we 've kept to our plan , and we look like we 're going to be right on target , " Balfour said .
Solar installers need to make panel orders about four or five months in advance , said Mike Richter , a sales consultant for SolarCity , an installer with offices in California and Phoenix .
" You have to be that much ahead of the game to make sure that your supply line is n't interrupted , " Richter said .
" ( Solar installers ) do n't want to go beyond the December 31st deadline , so everybody 's trying to jam - pack their orders in before the end of the year , " said Kenedi of Sharp Electronics , the largest U.S. producer of solar panels .
The threat of the expiring credit has led Arizona Public Service Co. and Abengoa Solar to put the 280 - megawatt Solana Solar Plant near Gila Bend on hold .
Lori Singleton , manager of sustainability initiatives and technologies for SRP , said that she does n't expect to see many new commercial jobs before the end of 2008 .
" If they have n't already got that order in the works , it would be my thought that there 's just not enough time , " Singleton said .
States offer credits , too
Governments in 28 states sponsor credits in the form of mandatory renewable portfolio standards , including in California , Colorado and Arizona .
States set requirements for public - utility companies to increase renewable energy statewide , and the utility companies in turn pay consumers for the renewable energy that systems produce .
Five states have set voluntary renewable portfolio standards .
Both Salt River Project and APS participate in Arizona 's renewable portfolio standard , passed in 2006 .
Some states also sponsor tax credits .
Arizona offers a one - time 25 percent income tax credit available to residences and a one - time 10 percent income - tax credit for businesses that install solar panels .
Still , the federal investment tax credit , set at 30 percent , is important both financially and symbolically , industry insiders say .
Regardless of states ' credits , solar systems on houses or businesses are too expensive without the federal credit .
" We are coming up on a crisis point , " Kyocera 's Dyer said .
" People will start making business decisions that are counterproductive just because there 's no guarantee this will continue after Jan. 1 . "
One firm 's example
Dr. Marvin Borsand of Scottsdale 's Body Sculpting Center had Technicians for Sustainability install panels on his business last year for $ 180,000 .
" I was concerned that this could expire because I 'm old enough to remember when they expired in the past , " Borsand said .
The Energy Tax Act of 1978 established a 15 percent investment tax credit , which fell to 10 percent by 1988 .
Borsand received about $ 82,000 in rebates from the state government and from SRP .
The federal government wrote Borsand a check for more than $ 50,000 , reducing his company 's cost to install panels to about $ 40,000 .
Borsand said he is happy with his decision to install solar panels , and he wants to see the tax credit renewed .
" If they do n't , this whole industry will just kind of take a dump , and there 's no reason at this point not to extend them , " Borsand said .
Ripple effect
Congress returns Monday , and the solar industry expects members to take up energy policy and the credits in earnest .
Dyer , representing Kyocera and the solar - industry association , worked closely with members of Congress on solar policy .
" Both parties want ( the credit ) but have not come to a conclusion on how to do it , " Dyer said .
Navigant Consulting Inc. estimated in a February study that failure to extend the federal investment tax credit could result in the loss of more than 39,000 jobs in the solar industry throughout the United States .
" If you do n't have work that you can do in January , then when do you make a decision on what to do about that ? "
Dyer asked .
He said if the credit expires , the industry would continue in the United States but would limit growth .
" We 're not going to fall off the end of the Earth here , but it will affect the growth and , therefore , investments and jobs , " Dyer said .
Japan and European countries like Germany , Spain and Italy offer generous state - sponsored solar tax credits .
As the U.S. dollar continues to weaken , and with demand rising in foreign countries , corporations could start allocating more and more panels abroad .
" If you still have Spain and Germany offering big incentives , then you 're very likely to see the solar - module supply going to markets where the demand is obviously going to be higher , " BP Solar 's Mueller said .
Sharp , the world 's largest maker of solar panels , said that it will not give up on the U.S. market anytime soon , Kenedi said .
" We believe that the U.S. market will be the largest market eventually , " he said .
We ’ve heard how the value of the dollar affects gas prices  and indeed the price of everything .
I was pleased that my request for a hearing on such was granted by the Financial Services committee and we were able to hear some very informative testimony .
Certainly domestic policies , regarding off - shore oil drilling bans , ethanol mandates , refining capacity , and CAFE standards are interventionist and harmful enough in the energy market .
But how does foreign policy affect gas prices ?
One important factor is that oil on the world market has been priced in dollars exclusively since 1973 .
Only two leaders have gone against this arrangement  Saddam Hussein in 2000 and more recently Mahmoud Ahmadinejad with the recently opened Iranian Oil Bourse which trades in non-dollar currencies .
But since oil is otherwise exclusively traded in dollars , this means that oil producers have vast amounts of assets held in dollars .
Especially since the War on Terror and the PATRIOT Act , many oil - producing nations and banks are concerned the US government may freeze assets based on flimsy pretexts .
This fear contributes to dollar weakness , and therefore also high oil prices .
Recently I and other members of Congress spoke out against H Con Res 362 and exposed this seemingly innocuous bill for what it really is  a call for a blockade and a build up to war with Iran .
Thankfully it has not come to the floor for a vote as I had fully expected it would .
But to even propose legislation like this , and get an alarming 261 cosponsors , makes the oil markets jittery and encourages more capital flight from the dollar .
We only isolate ourselves on the world stage with actions and attitudes like this .
After all , how can it be wise for the rest of the world to bank on America , when we tend to freeze assets and blockade entire countries for no good reason ?
Another major factor is our intervention in international military conflicts .
These conflicts are often much more complicated , and have more to do with oil than our own leaders are willing to acknowledge .
Too often the side we support points our weapons right back at us down the road .
The best policy is always free trade with all and entangling alliances with none , but instead we isolate ourselves by picking sides and making enemies out of our friends or potential friends .
In the recent conflict with Russia and Georgia , it appears that once again the administration is going to pick sides and send taxpayer money , when we are in a deep recession here at home .
There is no good reason for us to put a dog in every fight around the world .
The contributing factors in the price of oil are complicated and legion .
The fact is , it is an immensely valuable resource , and , as our demand for this resource is great , our relationships with world leaders who control it should be handled with reason and intelligence .
However , our interventionist mindset when it comes to foreign policy never ceases to get us into sticky situations , for which we pay a premium at the gas pump .
Standalone investment banks are headed for obsolescence and perhaps even extinction , said Ken Lewis , chairman , president and chief executive of Charlotte - based Bank of America in a Nov. 7 speech at the Wharton School .
“ It ’s a bad public - company business model .
It ’s too volatile and too narrowly focused , ” he said .
“ I do n’t see how any of the investment banks will remain independent entities . ”
As CEO of the nation ’s second largest commercial bank , Lewis has reason to badmouth investment banks .
They ’re his competitors .
With the 1999 repeal of Depression - era restrictions , commercial banks such as his were allowed , as investment banks are , to advise corporations on mergers and acquisitions and underwrite securities .
Commercial banks – Lewis calls them “ integrated banks ” – were also permitted to buy investment banks .
Bank of America bought Montgomery Securities .
“ All the technology bankers walked out on us , which , as it turned out , was great luck . ”
Jokes and jabs aside , Lewis ’s remarks point to a philosophical debate about the future of financial services :
Will the industry be dominated by a few big players such as Bank of America and New York - based Citigroup that can offer every sort of financial service or will smaller companies continue to thrive ?
“ Our thesis is we ’re seeing a fundamental shift in the business model .
To win in the market , players will have to provide financial and intellectual capital through a single relationship .
The share of investment banking fees earned by U.S. integrated banks has increased 24 % since 1999 , while the share earned by pure - play investment banks has dropped more than 17 % . ”
Lewis said the technology bubble in the stock market during the late 1990s was akin to a graduation bash for investment banks , a bacchanal before they had to confront a tough future .
And the excesses of that time leave them ill - prepared for the slog ahead .
“ There are too many investment banks chasing too few deals , and their infrastructures are too large to profitably serve the base of deals that ’s there .
“ In the past , the investment banking business gave you great returns on equity .
But we think that ’s no longer the case .
And we do n’t think the capital markets will come back next year and maybe not even the year after that .
When they finally do , they will not be anywhere near the levels that they were during the tech bubble . ”
Investment bankers counter that they remain capable of competing as long as the commercial bankers play fair .
And they say the commercial banks are n’t .
They have accused them of saying to companies , in effect , if you want loans , you have to let us underwrite your stock offerings .
Called tying , this practice is prohibited by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1970 .
Lewis ’s response :
We ’re guilty , up to a point .
“ I have promised not to use words like sniveling and whining , but our position is tying can be illegal , and we do n’t condone illegal tying .
If we found a case inside our company , there would be dire consequences for those involved .
“ But the law does n’t prohibit us from being interested in the profitability of our company .
Like any company , we routinely review the profitability of all our corporate relationships .
When we find one that falls below our profitability thresholds , we work with the client to restructure it .
We do n’t dictate the answer .
We simply say , ‘ Here ’s the rate of return our investors expect .
Help us get there . ' ”
Asked if his bank would consider buying a big investment bank , Lewis responded , “ I ’m highly skeptical that I ’ll ever think an investment bank is worth what it thinks it ’s worth . ”
Plus , for Bank of America to do such a deal , the two companies ’ cultures would have to dovetail .
“ Our culture ca n’t change .
It has to be our values .
We would n’t tolerate a taint on our culture or a subculture . ”
And typically , he said , investment bankers value different things than commercial bankers do .
They stress revenues over profits and view themselves as an elite corps entitled to better pay than other employees .
“ Should I think investment banking is elite when our consumer bank is earning 25 % returns , ” compared with 15 % to 18 % for the average investment bank , he asked .
Lewis said he ’s more interested in doing a retail - bank acquisition in Mexico .
Bank of America already has a hefty presence in Texas and California .
“ Seventy percent of Hispanics who have a bank account in California have it with Bank of America , ” he said .
And the bank is focusing on those regions for further growth .
During the first week of November , it trumpeted plans to open 550 new branches in such cities as Los Angeles , San Diego , Fort Worth and Houston , among others .
Under Lewis , Bank of America ’s strategy has changed from that of a company that focused on growth , costs be damned , to one that focuses on profitability .
His predecessor , Hugh McColl , loved doing deals , gloried in his brief career in the U.S. Marine Corps and kept a crystal hand grenade on his desk .
And McColl transformed what was once a bank little - known outside of North Carolina into a nationwide company .
He accomplished that by doing acquisition after acquisition , culminating with the 1998 merger of what was then called NationsBank with San Francisco - based BankAmerica Corp .
Lewis , a 55 - year - old Mississippi native , replaced McColl in 2001 .
He had worked at the bank since graduating from Georgia State University in 1969 and was largely unknown outside it when he took over .
With him as boss , Bank of America ’s stock has performed well , despite a tough market .
Over the last two years , it has returned more than 40 % , compared with a 35 % loss for the Dow Jones Total Stock Market Index .
The company ’s earnings , too , have been steady , while those of some financial - services companies have faltered .
It reported net income for the third quarter , which ended Sept. 30 , of $ 2.24 billion , or $ 1.45 per diluted share , compared with $ 841 million , or 51 cents a share , a year ago .
The bank ’s return on equity – a key measure of profitability – was 19 % for the most recent quarter , up from 6.8 % a year ago .
Earnings for the third quarter in 2001 were hurt by a one - time charge of $ 1.25 billion , and earnings for the third quarter of 2002 were boosted by a change in accounting rules that let the bank stop amortizing goodwill .
Take away the charge and the accounting change , and net income would have been nearly flat , and earnings per share would have risen by 6 % .
Revenue for the most recent quarter was $ 8.5 billion , down slightly from $ 8.6 billion for the comparable quarter a year ago .
While focusing on improving Bank of America ’s numbers , Lewis has eschewed the mega - deals that marked McColl ’s tenure .
“ For 30 years , we ’d said it was a strategic imperative to become a coast - to - coast bank .
When we did that , we could n’t hide behind it anymore & Simply put , we ’ve had to go from being a company that acquired customers by acquisition to one that gets customers one at a time . ”
It 's a particularly busy week for me : on top of a few looming deadlines , I 'll be at Business of Software 2008 in Boston .
So , I figured it'd be the perfect opportunity to revisit some classics .
Job Interview 2.0 : Now With Riddles ! was originally published on May 15th , 2007 , and is one of my personal favorites .
Some years ago , someone at Microsoft noticed that they were having a bit of a Resources problem .
A Human Resources problem to be specific .
There were a whole lot of job openings ( thousands , in fact ) and a whole lot of applications ( hundreds of thousands , in fact ) , and no easy way to match the right applicants with the right jobs .
So they decided to reinvent the Job Interview .
Traditionally , job interviews are used to ascertain two things : how competent the candidate is and how well his personality ( or lack thereof ) will fit in with the organization .
With their introduction of Job Interview 2.0 , Microsoft included both of those features and added one additional : how the candidate responds when presented with asinine , utterly pointless , and completely ridiculous brainteaser questions .
Of course , common sense tells us that a candidate who enjoys solving silly riddles would most likely enjoy solving a silly riddle at a job interview .
The same can be said about pepperoni pizza : chances are , if a candidate enjoys eating pepperoni pizza , he will also enjoy eating pepperoni pizza at a job interview .
Both are facts which , while completely enthralling ( no way , you like pepperoni pizza , too ? ! ) , are equally as irrelevant when determining whether someone would make a good programmer .
If you have n’t seen any of the Job Interview 2.0 questions offered by Microsoft , here are a few :
How would you determine the weight of a Boeing 747 ?
Given an opaque box with three light bulbs inside and three switches outside , how would you determine which switch corresponded to which bulb if the box could be opened only once and only after all the switches were permanently set ?
You are at a ravine with three others and need to cross a rickety bridge .
You can cross it in one minute , the three others can cross it in two , five , and ten , respectively .
A flashlight ( your group has only one ) is always required to cross , and only two people can cross at a time .
How do cross as quickly as possible ?
Naturally , being that they ’re brainteasers , no common sense or practicality is allowed .
And this is precisely why I would fail miserably at this part of Job Interview 2.0 :
I ’d ask Boeing … I ca n’t ask Boeing ?!
Uhh , I ’d ask a librarian …
Of course a librarian would know , they look stuff up , that ’s their job !
Who would build such a stupid , broken box ?
I ’d fix it of course …
I have n’t even seen the stupid box !
How do you know I ca n’t fix it ?
Obviously , we ’d leave the slow guy behind .
We ’re clearly in a bad place , in a bad situation , and we do n’t have any time for the big fat fatty to slow us down .
It ’s survival !
Thankfully , Microsoft realized that the type of people who enjoy these riddles are n’t always good programmers , and good programmers are n’t always the type who enjoy these riddles .
In fact , some of the folks who can solve these riddles are precisely the type of people you do n’t want as programmers .
Would you want to work with the guy who builds a water - displacement scale / barge , taxis a 747 to the docks , and then weights the jumbo jet using that , instead of simply calling Boeing in the first place ?
Unfortunately , Microsoft ’s realization came too late : a whole mini-industry has spawned around the concept of Job Interview 2.0 .
If Microsoft did it , it must work , right ?
There are books written on brainteasers in the interview , consultants who will help your company annoy the hell out candidates with your very own custom brainteasers , and now , everyone from small software firms to big ole ’ banks are asking stupid riddle questions .
They will eventually realize how useless of a practice this is .
They will eventually give it up .
In the meantime , however , you – the job seeker – will have to put up with it .
Or not .
One reader shared with me the story of his brainteaser interview .
During a screening interview , I was asked how I would design a bike fit for someone visually impaired .
I responded something to the effect of , " What , like , for blind people ? " , and she answered yes .
I thought for a moment and then I responded , " Well ..
a blind person riding a bike does n't sound like a very safe idea , so I would make the bike stationary , maybe with a fan blowing in the person 's face .
He probably would n't even know the difference . "
She was speechless .
Now , granted , he will not get the job .
Despite the complete absurdity of the design request , and the complete practicality of his answer , the job will go to a candidate who manages to answer the question by designing an extremely overcomplicated solution for a completely non-existent problem .
And that candidate will be the same person who designs their software .

Bavaria , Beer and Globalization Sacrilege of Chinese Lederhosen Clouds Oktoberfest
The Munich Oktoberfest , the annual showcase of Bavarian culture , got off to a rousing start with almost a million visitors downing 450,000 liters of beer over the opening weekend .
But folk societies are warning that the regions proud heritage is under attack from cheap Lederhosen made in China , India and Eastern Europe .
If McCain were a blogger , he would have had to retract by now .
But he 's running for president of the United States , so he can say anything , lie about anything and not have to answer for it .
Yesterday , John McCain lied on national television about something that no one disputes in the public record .
He was challenged by the only serious journalists on television right now - the hosts of " The View " - about the large number of pork barrel earmarks Sarah Palin sought and secured as governor of Alaska , including the " Bridge To Nowhere " that Palin and McCain lied about and are still lying about in public .
Here was his clear and irrefutable statement :
Palin 's comments came after McCain sat for a feisty grilling on ABC's " The View , " where he claimed erroneously that his running mate had n't sought money for such pet projects .
" Not as governor she did n't , " McCain said , ignoring the record .
It has now been a day since McCain lied this explicitly in public .
And he has n't yet retracted his lie .
This AP piece is dated as of this afternoon .
Why not ?
Because if he has to retract this lie , he will have to retract his multiple other lies ?
While the media demands that Obama respond to things he never said and never meant , McCain is not even asked to retract a bald - faced , massive , obvious , refutable lie .
In the last month , McCain has become the biggest liar in the modern history of presidential politics .
He makes Bill Clinton look like George Washington .

Antibodies still protect 1918 flu survivors
Antibodies from survivors of the 1918 flu pandemic , the worst in human memory , still protect against the highly deadly virus , researchers report .
The findings by a team of influenza and immune system experts suggest new and better ways to fight viruses - especially new pandemic strains that emerge and spread before a vaccine can be formulated .
These survivors , now aged 91 to 101 , all lived through the pandemic as children .
Their immune systems still carry a memory of that virus and can produce proteins called antibodies that kill the 1918 flu strain with surprising efficiency , the researchers report in the journal Nature .
" It was very surprising that these subjects would still have cells floating in their blood so long afterward , " says Dr James Crowe of Vanderbilt University in Tennessee , who helped lead the study .
Strong antibodies
The team found that the antibodies also protected mice from the 1918 virus , which swept around the world at the end of World War One killing between 50 million and 100 million people .
" The antibodies that we isolated are remarkable antibodies .
They grab onto the virus very tightly and they virtually never fall off , " says Crowe .
" That allows them to kill the 1918 virus with extreme potency , meaning it takes a very small amount of antibody . "
The human body has two systems for fighting off bacterial and viral invaders .
One system uses T - cells while the other employs B - cells , made in the bone marrow , which in turn make antibodies to both flag and directly attack the targets .
Resurrected virus
Dr Christopher Basler and colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York tested the 1918 survivors and found that in most of them , the B - cells made antibodies highly attuned to the 1918 flu strain .
Dr Terrence Tumpey at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had worked on a team that resurrected the 1918 virus taken from buried victims of the epidemic and tested this virus in mice .
Mice given the antibodies from the elderly survivors lived , while those given placebos died .
Crowe says it will now be important to test other people who have had influenza to see if their immune responses are as strong .
" The thought is the first influenza that you see during life is the one that you have the best immunity to , " he says .
" If we can learn the rules about how these antibodies work we may be able to design antibodies to lots of other viruses . "
Bird flu
The 1918 flu was an H1N1 strain that apparently came straight from birds .
" This study tells us that human beings can make long lasting immune responses to bird influenza , " Crowe says .
Crowe says his team is working to get antibodies from people vaccinated with experimental shots for the H5N1 avian influenza now circulating in Asia , Europe , the Middle East and Africa .
H5N1 mostly affects birds but it has infected 385 people since 2003 , killing 243 .
Experts fear that , like the H1N1 virus did in 1918 , H5N1 will mutate into a form that passes easily among people and spark another pandemic .
No one knows if the vaccines being made now would protect against whatever form of H5N1 might emerge .
Crowe says antibodies from survivors might make a good interim treatment while a vaccine is formulated , manufactured and distributed - a process that would take months .
" This may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history , " said Mark Hixon , an Oregan State University expert interviewed by Associated Press .
" There is probably no way to stop the invasion completely . "

Concern about the price the U.S. could pay to rescue the financial system is crushing the dollar and raises questions about whether the government could ultimately intervene to prop it up .
" I 'm just watching the dollar self - implode , " said Brian Dolan , chief currency strategist at Forex.com .
" The dollar 's clearly been under pressure across the board .
This is knee - jerk reaction to what many are perceiving as an explosion in the fiscal deficit and national debt . "
While the plan is still being debated , Dolan believes it may end up as a net positive for the government and not the big burden the market is anticipating .
The government plans to buy $ 700 billion in toxic mortgage debt from financial institutions as one in a series of moves aimed at unfreezing credit markets and bolstering the banking system .
" The real number that is likely to be the end result is likely to be more on the order of $ 100 to $ 200 billion .
That 's assuming we lose money on the trade when there 's a good possibility we make money on the whole proposition , depending on how deep a discount these are valued at , " he said .
At $ 1.48 per euro , the dollar was down 2.6 percent , its steepest decline against the euro since Jan. , 2 , 2001 .
The dollar index was also down 2.6 percent .

Take Our Poll
Commodities gained across the board Monday as the dollar tumbled .
The most dramatic move was in the oil market , where crude jumped more than $ 15 to $ 120 , on the last day of the NYMEX's October crude contract .
Traders said the record gain was the result of a short squeeze in crude , and a demand for physical delivery as the contract expired .
" This kind of volatility threatens to bring an official response in terms of U.S. dollar buying intervention , " said Dolan .

I 'd been a database industry analyst for a decade before I found 1 - gigabyte databases to write about .
Now it 's 15 years later , and the 1 - petabyte barrier is crumbling .
Specifically , we 're about to see production data warehouses -- running on commercial database management systems -- that contain over 1 petabyte of actual user data .
Greenplum is slated to have two of them within 60 days .
Given how close it was a year ago , Teradata may have crossed the 1 - petabyte mark by now too .
And by the way , Yahoo already has a petabyte + database running on a home - grown system .
Meanwhile , the 100 - terabyte mark is almost old hat .
Besides the vendors already mentioned above , others with 100 + terabyte databases deployed include Netezza , DATAllegro , Dataupia , and even SAS .
Rules Of Hot Code Swapping
You should also set the “ Anyone Can Register ” in Settings / General to off , and you should have some sort of spam plugin .
Akismet is the old standby , the one I use , but there are many of them these days .
Another popular blog platform is the wordpress platform .
WordPress started out in 2003 and is an open source platform .
Open source is code that is basically a collaboration with many coders and programmers .
No licensing is required and anyone can freely use and modify the code to improve usability or add features .
This has resulted in WordPress being the most customizable platform and added to its popularity .
However , once you know better what you are doing and where you want to go with your blog , and especially if you want to make money from it , or run a serious hobby or interest blog , then you do n’t really have an option .
The choice of which WordPress to use comes down to dot Org .

The average annual energy bill is set to rocket to £ 1,406 next year Almost a quarter of the population will be pushed into fuel poverty by the end of next year , a report has suggested .
By the end of 2009 , 5.7 million UK households will be spending at least 10 % of their income on energy bills , the National Housing Federation said .
Average household electricity bills are expected to increase to more than £ 500 per year by 2010 , and gas bills to around £ 900 .
The government said it was doing a great deal to help reduce fuel bills .
The National Housing Federation research , entitled Energy Prices and Debt , said low income households would be worst hit by increases to pre-payment schemes .
The number of families in fuel poverty - defined as when more than 10 % of household income is spent on fuel bills - has increased by 100 % since 2005 .
Around 5.7 million people will spend 10 % of their annual income on energy bills by 2009 , compared with around 3.8 million in 2007 and 2.4 million in 2005 , the report said .
The average energy bill is set to climb to £ 1,406 next year , from £ 676 in 2005 .
But the report said big energy companies charge the five million people who pay for their energy through pre-payment meters more than those who are billed quarterly .
Most are from low income backgrounds and will pay up to £ 65 more by 2010 , it said .
Ruth Davison , director of the federation 's campaigns and neighbourhoods department , called the findings part of a " full - scale national energy crisis " .
" The government needs to grasp the nettle and take strong and radical action to protect the nation 's energy customers .
" Britain is virtually unique in Europe in that our energy suppliers have been privatised and deregulated .
The promise at the time of deregulation was that prices would fall .
This has palpably not happened .
It is time for ministers to regulate the market , " she said .
' Hopelessly off course '
Energy companies should not be allowed to charge pre-payment meter customers " grotesquely high tariffs " , a cap should be put on prices , and " companies should use profits to pay for social and energy efficiency responsibilities , " she added .
The research coincides with calls from charities and consumer bodies for the government to follow a 10 - point charter on fuel poverty .
The charter , supported by Friends of the Earth , the Association for Conservation of Energy and National Energy Action , urges the government to properly insulate UK homes , install renewable energy systems and provide short - term crisis payments to low earners .
Ed Matthew , Head of UK Climate at Friends of the Earth , said the government 's current fuel poverty plan was " hopelessly off course " and must be transformed .
Since 2000 we have spent £ 20 billion on fuel poverty benefits and programmes
Government spokesman
" We have set out exactly what needs to be done to sort out this national disaster - ministers must now listen and take action now to fulfil all our recommendations , " he said .
A spokesman for the Department for Business , Enterprise & Regulatory Reform said : " The government is committed to responding to the new insecurities that hard - pressed , hard - working British families face and is already doing a lot to help people save energy and reduce their fuel bills .
" Since 2000 we have spent £ 20 billion on fuel poverty benefits and programmes - assisting over two million households in the UK . "
Winter fuel payments help nearly 12 million people a year in the UK and in addition to the £ 200 normally awarded to the over - 60s and £ 300 to the over - 80s , a one - off payment of £ 50 and £ 100 respectively has been made available for this winter , he added .
Last week the government ruled out one - off fuel payments .
But it is facing mounting pressure to help those hit by high energy bills , with TUC leader Brendan Barber the latest to call for a windfall tax .

What are these ?
Science Debate 2008  an effort spearheaded by a half - dozen voters concerned about the state of American science  posed 14 questions to the major parties ’ presidential candidates , Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain .
The queries were culled from more than 3,400 suggestions offered by 38,000 contributors , including Nobel laureates , university presidents , government officials and professional organizations .
Obama submitted his responses in August , and McCain answered this week .
Excerpts are printed below , with more to come next Saturday .
The candidates ’ complete replies are online at www.sciencedebate2008.com.
What policies will you support to ensure that America remains the world leader in innovation ?
Obama :
My administration will increase funding for basic research in physical and life sciences , mathematics , and engineering at a rate that would double basic research budgets over the next decade .
We will increase research grants for early career researchers to keep young scientists entering these fields .
We will increase support for high - risk , high - payoff research portfolios at our science agencies .
And we will invest in the breakthrough research we need to meet our energy challenges and to transform our defense programs .
McCain :
My policies will provide broad pools of capital , low taxes and incentives for research in America , a commitment to a skilled and educated workforce , and a dedication to opening markets around the globe .
I am committed to streamlining burdensome regulations and effectively protecting American intellectual property in the United States and around the globe .
What is your position on the following measures that have been proposed to address global climate change  a cap - and - trade system , a carbon tax , increased fuel - economy standards , or research ?
Obama : Specifically , I will implement a market - based cap - and - trade system to reduce carbon emissions by the amount scientists say is necessary : 80 % below 1990 levels by 2050 .
I will start reducing emissions immediately by establishing strong annual reduction targets with an intermediate goal of reducing emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 .
I will also create a Technology Transfer Program dedicated to exporting climate - friendly technologies , including green buildings , clean coal and advanced automobiles , to developing countries to help them combat climate change .
McCain : I will institute a new cap - and - trade system that over time will change the dynamic of our energy economy .
By the year 2012 , we will seek a return to 2005 levels of emissions , by 2020 , a return to 1990 levels , and so on until we have achieved at least a reduction of 60 % below 1990 levels by the year 2050 .
I am also committed to investing $ 2 billion every year for the next 15 years on clean coal technologies , to unlock the potential of America ’s oldest and most abundant resource .
And we will issue a Clean Car Challenge to automakers , in the form of a tax credit to the American people , for every automaker who can sell a zero-emission vehicle .
We will commit up to a $ 5,000 tax credit to each and every customer who buys that car .
In an era of constant and rapid international travel , what steps should the United States take to protect our population from global pandemics or deliberate biological attacks ?
Obama : Overseas , I will launch a Shared Security Partnership that invests $ 5 billion over three years to forge an international intelligence and law enforcement infrastructure to take down terrorist networks .
I will also strengthen U.S. intelligence collection overseas to identify and interdict would - be bioterrorists before they strike and expand the U.S. government ’s bioforensics program for tracking the source of any biological weapon .
.
I will invest in new vaccines and technology to detect attacks and to trace them to their origin , so that we can react in a timely fashion .
Because of the unpredictability of the mode of biological attack , I will stress the need for broad - gauged vaccines and drugs and for more agile and responsive drug development and production systems .
McCain : First , we must limit the spread of disease to the United States .
Second , we must limit the spread of disease within the United States .
Third , we must mitigate symptoms of the disease and minimize suffering and death with effective treatments and countermeasures .
Similar response capabilities would be necessary if a deliberate biological attack were to occur .
We must fund research and development of new medicines and vaccines and make sure that we have adequate stockpiles of countermeasures and a robust and well thought out distribution plan in case crisis strikes .
What is the right policy balance between the benefits of genetic advances and their potential risks ?
Obama : I have been a longtime supporter of the recently passed Genetic Information Non-Discrimination Act .
In addition , concerned about the premature introduction of genetic testing into the public domain without appropriate oversight , I introduced the Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act of 2007 aimed at ensuring the safety and accuracy of such testing .
Advances in the genetic engineering of plants have provided enormous benefits to American farmers .
I believe we can continue to modify plants safely with new genetic methods , abetted by stringent tests for environmental and health effects and by stronger regulatory oversight guided by the best available scientific advice .
McCain :
As genetic research becomes increasingly deployed , the need to ensure privacy of human records will become all the more essential , as will be the rigor to ensure there is no genetic discrimination .
The scientific potential and ethical issues associated with genetics are important and complex enough that I will actively seek out the wise counsel of experts about how to ensure that we are best serving the needs of the American people .
Genetic research can already provide real assistance for those in some of the poorest regions who lack access to adequate food sources .
Our aid programs should help focus on research into higher - yielding crops and make investments in infrastructure that will help farmers increase their yields and deliver their products to market .

For a long time , the main obstacle to creating an AIDS vaccine has been the high genetic variability of the HIV virus .
Dr. Jean - Pierre Routy and his team from the Research Institute of the McGill University Health Centre ( MUHC ) , in collaboration with Dr. Rafick Sékaly from the Université de Montréal , have overcome this difficulty by designing a personalized immunotherapy for HIV - infected patients .
The team 's findings were presented on August 5 at the XVII International AIDS Conference in Mexico City .
" Our approach is unique in the world : no one else has yet developed customized immunotherapy using the virus from individual patients , " said Dr. Routy .
" This experimental technique remains long and costly for the moment , but we 're hoping it will hold the promise of a completely innovative and widely available treatment in the future . "
This immunotherapy is based on the properties of dendritic cells , whose role is to present specific proteins from infectious organisms at their surface , thereby alerting the rest of the immune system .
In collaboration with Argos Therapeutics , the researchers designed a study in which the dendritic cells of nine study patients were multiplied in vitro and then treated with the RNA ( ribonucleic acid ) from the virus that had infected each patient .
A virus sample was taken before the administration of any antiretroviral treatment .
The surfaces of these manipulated dendritic cells present an increased number of HIV proteins , which allows them to stimulate the cytotoxic response of a certain type of immune cell called CD8 + lymphocytes .
After receiving multiple subcutaneous injections of these dendritic cells , eight of the nine patients involved experienced a significant increase in CD8 + lymphocyte activity .
" At this stage , we have shown that the technique does n't cause side effects or an undesirable auto - immune response , " said Dr. Routy .
" Health Canada has approved a multicentre clinical trial across the country that will let us further assess the technique 's effectiveness at controlling HIV reproduction .
We 're hoping that the FDA in the United States will also give us the go - ahead soon so that our pharmaceutical partner , Argos Therapeutics , can begin testing in the United States . "
While more research needs to be done , this new target may lead to an innovative therapeutic approach to fight the AIDS pandemic .
Dr. Jean - Pierre Routy is a practitioner in the Division of Hematology at the MUHC as well as a researcher in the Infection and Immunity Axis at the Research Institute of the MUHC .
He is also an Associate Professor of Hematology at McGill University as well as a senior clinical researcher with the Fonds de la recherche en santé du Québec ( FRSQ ) .
This study was funded by the Canadian Network for Vaccines and Immunotherapeutics ( CANVAC ) , the Canadian HIV Trials Network ( CTN ) , the Canadian Institutes of Health Research ( CIHR ) , the US National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , and Argos Therapeutics .
The first scientific mission with Sentry , a newly developed robot capable of diving as deep as 5,000 meters ( 3.1 miles ) into the ocean , has been successfully completed by scientists and engineers from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ( WHOI ) and the University of Washington ( UW ) .
The vehicle surveyed and helped pinpoint several proposed deep - water sites for seafloor instruments that will be deployed in the National Science Foundation ( NSF ) 's planned Ocean Observatories Initiative ( OOI ) .
Sentry is a state - of - the - art , free - swimming underwater robot that can operate independently , without tethers or other connections to a research ship .
The autonomous underwater vehicle , or AUV , is pre-programmed with guidance for deep - water surveying , but it can also make its own decisions about navigation on the terrain of the seafloor .
" This investment into emerging technologies is paying off in delivering state - of - the - art science support , " said Julie Morris , director of NSF 's Division of Ocean Sciences .
" In the near future , Sentry will conduct high - resolution oceanographic surveys that would be otherwise impossible . "
Working in tandem with sonar instruments on the UW - operated research vessel Thomas G. Thompson and with photo - mapping by WHOI 's TowCam seafloor imaging system , Sentry gathered the most precise maps to date of seafloor features known as Hydrate Ridge and Axial Volcano off the coast of Oregon and Washington .
" We are changing the way ocean science is done , launching a new era in which an ensemble of technologies will provide us with an increasing capacity for exploring and interacting with the global oceans , " said John Delaney , chief scientist of the expedition and principal investigator for the UW - led regional observatory in the planned OOI .
The one - of - a- kind , WHOI - built AUV -- which was largely funded by NSF -- made six dives during the July 22 to August 5 expedition .
Sentry surveyed 212 linear kilometers of seafloor , or about 53 square kilometers , as it traced parallel lines like a lawn - mower making a pattern across a yard .
" Sentry had a very successful introduction , " said Dana Yoerger , the lead WHOI engineer for the vehicle .
" We had tested the AUV as best we could before we got out here , but the steep terrain of the deep sea is quite a different matter . "
The AUV can collect the data needed to make seafloor maps at a resolution of less than one meter .
On this first cruise , Sentry collected as many as 60 million individual soundings of seafloor depth in a single dive .
Powered by more than 1,000 lithium - ion batteries - similar to those used in laptop computers , though adapted for extreme pressures , Sentry dove for as long as 18 hours and 58 kilometers , with the potential for longer trips in the future .
Sentry is designed to swim like a fish or fly like a helicopter through the water .
The sleek hydrodynamic design allows the vehicle to descend quickly from the sea surface to the depths ( about 3,500 meters per hour ) .
The novel shape also gives the vehicle tremendous stability and balance while cruising through bottom currents .
The vehicle has thrusters built into its foils , or wings .
Like an airplane , the foils allow the vehicle to gain lift or drag or directional momentum , as needed .
When necessary , the AUV also can hover over the bottom for close - up inspections , navigational decision - making , and for rising up and down over rugged seafloor terrain .
The design allows the vehicle to start , stop , and change directions , whereas many AUVs tend to travel in one direction .
The AUV steers itself with a magnetic compass ; long - baseline ( LBL ) navigation triangulated from underwater beacons ; a sophisticated inertial guidance system ( INS ) ; and , when within 200 meters of the bottom , an acoustic sensor that can track the vehicles ' direction and speed with incredible precision .
" Sentry is a true robot , functioning on its own in the deep water , " said Rod Catanach , a WHOI engineer who works with Sentry .
" The vehicle is completely on its own from the time it is unplugged on the deck and cut loose in the water . "
With this mission successfully completed , Sentry is now ready to join the National Deep Submergence Facility ( NDSF ) , a federally funded center based at WHOI that operates , maintains , and coordinates the use of vital deep ocean vehicles for the U.S. oceanographic community .
Sentry will replace the Autonomous Benthic Explorer ( ABE ) , Sentry 's predecessor in the NDSF and a pioneer in deep - diving vehicle operations since 1996 .
Eventually , vehicles like Sentry and its successors will plug into and interact with the ocean observatory system , using the power charging systems and high speed communications delivered by the submarine networks .

“ More than at any time in history mankind faces a crossroads .
One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness , the other to total extinction .
Let us pray that we have the wisdom to choose correctly . ”
Woody Allen
By now we know that bailing out the mortgage mess to the tune of …we do n’t know how much but it will most likely be measured in trillions … is our lot in life .
While I hope we have been complaining about this to our representatives ( if only for pro forma ’s sake so that we can tell our grandkids “ yes , I complained when they sold you and your future down the river ” ) it looks like it wo n’t do us much good .
If you want to know why we are n’t going to be doing a massive build out of wind generators and solar panels so that we can all keep our cars going , our houses heated , etc … this is a good part of why ( ok , we were n’t going to do it anyway , but now we ’ve decided what stupidity we ’ll allot the money to ) .
Instead , we ’ve chosen to hook taxpayers to bail out companies .
Meanwhile , this is unlikely to stop the fact that we ’re losing the equivalent of China ’s GDP annually in real estate values - or the financial collapse we are rapidly sinking into .
And in a sense , it almost does n’t seem to matter whether the US ends up defaulting on the enormous promises it is making , or whether it pays them - we ’re hosed either way .
Because our ability to adapt in the future depends on not just real dollars , but credit - either way , we ’ve mortgaged our future past redemption .
We are likely to drop into a period of severe Depression and financial instability , and on the other side is a life with less energy , less wealth and a whole host of other “ lesses ” that make up our new normal .
We talked here quite a bit recently about what we might do to make money after our new normal begins to emerge , and John Michael Greer , whose new book _ The Long Descent_ was one of the best books I ’ve read this year , has offered his own take on the future job market .
I agree with nearly everything he says - nearly everything .
And churlish as it is to disagree with someone on the smallest point , who you agree with on every large particular , I ’m going to take the time to meditate on at least one of his observations that I do n’t quite agree with , because it is something that I think quite does matter in our future .
Greer writes ,
Prophecy is a risky business at the best of times , but it ’s worth hazarding some guesses about the jobs that will fill the post - petroleum job ads here in America over the next generation or so , through the years of the Great Recession and the disintegration of America ’s overseas empire .
Farmers are among the most likely candidates for the top of the list .
By this I do n’t mean subsistence farmers in rural ecovillages – their time is much further in the future , if it ever comes at all .
Rather , market farmers tilling what is now suburban acreage to feed the dwindling cities , and rural farmers producing grains and other bulk crops for foreign exchange , will likely be in high demand , along with support professions such as agronomists .
Those who know me well can perhaps guess the bit I ’m going to argue with - the observation that subsistence farmers will probably not be needed in this future , or not for a long time yet .
Now it is quite possible that the emphasis here should , in fact , be on the rural “ ecovillages ” and that I ’m misunderstanding Greer ’s point .
I ’m actually in complete agreement with Greer ’s many statements that ecovillages are extremely unlikely to be the dominant - or even a significantly useful - component of future community modelling .
I say this not to criticize those who live in ecovillages , but because as Greer himself has observed , they are simply expensive , involving a lot of economic self - sorting that is increasingly unlikely ( if you prefer , you may say that we just spent the money we might have spent on ecovillage infrastructure instead of wind turbines ;-) ) , and a model unavailable to all but the rich .
Ecovillages also involve discarding the enormous build - out of housing we have just used our wealth for ( many , many millions of units more than a society that does n’t require so much personal space and does n’t have so much money ) and demand lots of credit , which is unlikely to be available .
It simply is n’t going to happen .
But “ subsistence farmers ” and “ rural ecovillages ” do n’t really necessarily go together anyway , except in a small corner of peak oil rhetoric .
If I have any difference with Greer ’s overarching analysis , it is simply that I do n’t see one thing that Greer describes in his book - communities of people discussing peak oil and climate change who are starkly divided between pure techno - optimist , and flat apocalyptic absolutist , with Greer as one of the lone voices in the middle speaking for the balanced perspective .
Variations on Greer ’s perspective seem to me to be the norm in the peak oil and climate change communities - or at least the ones that I hang around in , and have been hanging around in for the last five years .
There is a largish minority ( but definitively a minority ) of people who imagine a blinding apocalypse , including in this subset a smallish minority who imagine the apocalypse leading to all of us in our ecovillage , and a worldwide majority of people who are mostly too ignorant of the realities to be anything other than techno - optimists while a small minority of these actually know something about peak oil and climate change but retain that perspective .
But the mainsteam of those who are peak oil and climate change aware seem neither to assume the ecovillage outcome nor the apocalypse , but that they will go on at some varying lower level .
So while it may be a tiny bit unfair , I ’m going to call “ ecovillage ” the least important part of his sentence , and move on to the question of whether the future will involve a lot of us working as subsistence farmers .
Greer is certainly right that market farmers and grain farmers , particularly those growing for export will be a major factor in the US .
As we all know , the US is tremendously energy dependent on a host of nations - and we are economically dependent on them too .
The bailout of Fannie and Freddie to a large degree served to reassure our foreign asset holders that they will be paid ( well , maybe…eventually … maybe ) .
Many of the nations we depend upon economically and for energy supplies are nations that are quite vulnerable to food insecurity for a host of reasons - and in many cases , are seeing that vulnerability exposed , and experiencing internal conflict over it .
Most of the Mid-East oil producing nations , especially Saudi Arabia , are in extremely poor food producing situations - ones that will only worsen with climate change .
Readers of this blog ( or the news ) will recall that Saudi Arabia has determined to stop producing staple grains entirely , because of the demands upon their desalinated water , and the projections of climate change .
In addition , many of the oil producing regions of Africa are now already experiencing difficulty feeding themselves due to climate change , while China depends heavily on imported food , and holds a good bit of America ’s bad paper .
And the US , whatever else its limitations , remains the single largest food exporter in the world .
While it is a mistake to believe the old saw “ America feeds the world ” - most of America ’s grains go to feed not the world ’s people , but livestock in affluent countries , it is true that American grain production will be essential to its future economy .
Canada and Russia , exporters of both food and energy , are potentially better positioned for the future , but America ’s ability to trade grain for some measure of energy will almost certainly be essential to our future economy .
It may well be the case that often , Americans will not be able to afford their own grain , an irony entirely recognizable to many , many of the nations upon whom globalization was thrust upon .
We shall have to see if the new globalization appeals to us .
With the dismantling of our manufacturing base and the petering out of many of our natural resources , we can expect grain farming for export ( or potentially , but much less likely , for biofuel production - more on this in a later post ) to be a major feature of the future .
It was unlikely that I would disagree much with Greer ’s vision of market farms created in the suburbs to feed the surrounding cities .
But I do disagree a little bit .
It is certainly true that there will be some of this , and that in sprawled out cities that cover a large land base , it is quite possible that urban and suburban farming may provide a large portion of vegetables and livestock for the cities .
In cities that experience a rapid decline , the result may be similar - indeed , urban Detroit is already seeing houses torn down the resurgence of the prairie inside the city - a city that can feed itself with internal resources and a small amount of nearby ones is likely potentially promising .
In much more densely packed area , near large cities in the US , however , I think even with Greer ’s projected “ dwindling ” ( which I think is likely ) , the suburbs will be quite hard put to feed themselves .
Market gardening in these suburbs and many others ( which , as I ’ve observed before , in many places have population densities similar to large towns and smaller cities of a century ago ) will likely focus on feeding themselves , and perhaps a few market gardens feeding the affluent .
But Westchester County and Long Island and Northern New Jersey are likely to have enough difficulty supporting their own present populations without being able to support New York City as well , at least until major population shifts have occurred .
In other areas of the country , water is likely to be a determining factor for the ability of external suburbs to support large cities - Los Angeles , Tucson / Pheonix and some other cities are likely to find it difficult to find the water to irrigate crops on individual lots .
And while research keeps showing that well designed and efficient small scale production uses water much , much more efficiently than industrial agriculture , even inefficient agriculture in places where there is adequate rain is likely to be more successful than place mired in chronic drought .
Again , the simple project of feeding oneself and one ’s neighbors is likely to take up what water can be found .
There will be some suburban market gardeners near every city , particularly those able to own or claim right to larger chunks of land .
But I suspect subsistence agriculture may well be the dominant feature of our future .
But by subsistence agriculture I do not mean “ a household where everyone works as a full - time peasant . ”
Worldwide , most farmers either have a second job or a resident or non-resident family member who brings in income .
Most American full - time farmers either have a second job or a spouse or other primary family member who brings in income another way .
In Mexico , it has long be common to send one or two male members of the household to America to produce enough income to support the family farm .
In poor nations around the world , daughters or sons ( but often daughters ) are sent off to the factories to subsidize the same .
And so it was in the US 100 years ago , when my great - great grandfather taught school during the winter terms , and 130 years ago when American homesteaders worked the railroads and took in laundry and other ventures to support their farm , and 160 years ago when girls from Maine and New Hampshire were sent down to the woolen mills in Lowell , MA .
That is , while not true of every period in history , in the industrial age , it has generally been necessary to have an industrial income or two in order to support the subsistence farm .
Like Greer , I think we are in the process of a gradual transition to a post - industrial age , and I think because that is true , the industrial economy model of agriculture ( as distinct from industrial agriculture itself ) will probably not go gently into that good night .
But that does n’t mean that most households wo n’t need to subsistence farm , in addition to the other things they do .
And the reason I ’m focusing on this is because I think that thinking carefully and correctly about this issue will be essential as we prepare ourselves for the future - what we prepare for will shape how well we adapt .
Recognizing that home - scale food production , probably as a generalist , producing easily grown staples , vegetables and any animal products we require is part of our future , rather than ( for most of us , I am generalizing and there will be markets for larger scale market gardeners - many of them ) specialized niche production helps us plan for our future .
There are two reasons I think that most of us will be doing subsistence agriculture .
The first is that the future is one that I suspect will be more or less contiguous with the one we live in now - the ability of ordinary people to afford to meet basic needs will be steadily and seriously eroded .
Even at the level of simple functional necessity , all of us have a large number of basic needs that require large quantities of energy and money to fulfill at this point .
Property taxes may well be reduced by reassessment , but they wo n’t go away .
Many of us may be able to make some move towards not needing supplemental heat , but we ’re still going to need some , and we wo n’t be getting all the energy locally .
Medicine is likely to remain costly even if we reduce to an absolute minimum our usage of most pharmaceuticals .
As we struggle to replace our energy and cost intensive educational infrastructure , many people will want to try and keep the internet going , if only so our kids can have some form of schooling not provided by parents working long hours .
And some money is going to be wanted for things like beer , cigarettes , cosmetics , escapist video games and books - the things that make difficult times marginally tolerable for many people .
Of all the basic needs that we currently fill with cash , the easiest and quickest one to replace may well be food .
Most of America is built in a way that makes use ( note , not “ good ” use ) of America ’s huge size - we divide up land with a generous hand compared to Europe or much of Asia .
And we have spent the last 60 years subdividing our land into private lots , with moderately useful buildings still 20 - 50 years from their projected natural demise .
Now some of them may become derelict or be abandoned , some may be bulldozed and turned back to farmland - but this too is energy intensive .
While the selling off of our previous buildout may be a lucrative business , the rule about driving the car off the lot applies - there is a significant amount of depreciation involved , and while as Greer argues , junkyarding and scavenging will almost certainly expand vastly , it is also extremely likely that as the crisis creeps up on us , we may realize that much of what we have quite literally cannot be replaced , and find that it is necessary to make use of it .
But what we have created is mostly homes on fairly small lots by the standards of many farms - that is , large market gardening , of the sort that produces enough income to fully support a family , will be tough in many of the suburbs closest to cities - 1/8 acre lots probably are n’t big enough to bring in a lot of money - but they are big enough to reduce outgoing costs .
Some people will specialize in high value crops , but for most people , growing your own tomatoes in a cash - poor society is probably worth more than growing at truckload of them and bringing them into a cash poor city - unless cities remain the province of the affluent .
Larger lot homes tend to be in the exurbs , and while 1 - 5 acre lots are perfect for market gardening , they have the problem of transport costs to contend with - and there are plenty of consumers in the inner suburbs happy to take their potatoes , without payint to ship them all the way into the city .
My suspicion is that most near - city gardeners will probably be subsistence gardeners .
Trees take a long time to mature to firewood size , and it is tough to dig coal out of your backyard .
Home electric generation is pricey , and while some of us can grow our own medicinal herbs , we may still want tetanus shots and antibiotics at times .
Few of us will be weaving our own cloth on any scale for a long time , if ever - while we may need to produce small items that wear out easily , industrial cloth production long preceeded fossil fuels .
Food , on the other hand , is pretty doable to produce .
And given that one of the hallmarks of an economic collapse or even Depression is widespread unemployment - while the growth , energy intensive economy wants as many employees as possible - it seems likely that with only minor familial reorganizations beyond what is forced upon us by the economy , the opportunity to produce food will be there .
As houses are foreclosed upon , I ’m already seeing reports that squatters simply move back in - often the previous residents .
And if they do n’t do that , well , they newly evicted go consolidate with their extended family , meaning that a household that once consisted of an overworked couple and their child may now consist of the same overworked couple , their child , their overworked brother and his boyfriend , and her mother .
The odds of everyone achieving - or needing - full employment are small .
And the subsistence economy means that steady employment of everyone is not desirable .
The other reason that subsistence farming is a corrollary of a point I mentioned above - because food for export or perhaps biofuel production is likely to be so economically valuable in the coming years , much of the food we ’ve relied upon in the past is likely to be quite expensive .
Artificial fertility is likely to be very costly - and a worldwide conversion to organic agriculture , while necessary , is likely to be staggered and messy in actuality and to come with costs of its own .
Climate change is unlikely to help worldwide total grain yields - the net seems to be an overarching decline .
Energy costs for fuel and other inputs are likely to continue to rise - and most of all , demand for grains and other foods is likely to remain high .
The large class of new American poor may well find itself unable to buy much food in a society where most food is marked for export .
And while I suspect the US government may continue subsidies to quell unrest , that does n’t necessarily mean most people will be eating the food they want or are used to .
Meat and fresh fruits and vegetables during off seasons may be well outside most people ’s means .
Which means powerful incentives to use existing land to produce one ’s own - while currently home grown often means spending a lot , the techniques used by poor people around the world for home food production , plus the incentive of higher prices , mean that homegrown rabbits fed on weeds , chickens fed mostly on kitchen scraps and grass , with some grain fed on the side , and grass fed small grazers like sheep or browsers like small goats may well be cheaper to produce at home than to purchase .
Using free urine and composted marginal road wastes to produce food at home may well be cheaper than buying it at the store .
The combination of people having access to subdivided small parcels of land , under employment and high food costs means that subsistence food production will make sense in a way it has not in many years .
It has been a long time since Americans have fully understood that there is a distinction between “ poor but we never felt poor ” and “ poor . ”
But in the last Depression , and through much of history before that , and through much of the world at present , this is an enormously meaningful distinction - and the distinction is based primarily on the level of self - sufficiency of the people in question .
Those with access to land and food and shelter and heat tend to be of the “ poor but we barely knew it ” sort - those without access to those things tend to suffer the indignities and misery of being truly poor .
As more and more of us become poor , and are stripped of our formal economy incomes , the distinction between deep suffering and a little suffering will likely be one ’s participation in the subsistence economy - not in ecovillages , but in the villages - and towns and cities and suburbs and what - have - you that we have now .

Along the way they stopped to hold workshops and give ( very brief ) home tours .
Some events drew hundreds of people .
“ It seems like everybody is fascinated by the idea of living in a tiny house , ” said Mr. Shafer , who started Tumbleweed eight years ago .
“ But for a long time , I was just selling the dream . ”
His business is still modest , but in the past year Mr. Shafer has sold five houses and 50 sets of plans , up from a yearly average of one house .
The houses range in size from about 70 to nearly 800 square feet , cost $ 20,000 to $ 90,000 to build , and resemble birdhouses : boxy shape , wood siding and high , pitched roof .
Other builders also report increased demand .
Brad Kittel , owner of Tiny Texas Houses in Luling , Tex. , said he had built 10 homes this year , up from four in all of 2007 .
Image Others choose to actually live in theirs , like Dee Williams , whose 84 - square - foot knotty - pine house has a tight but cozy interior .

In recent years , small dwellings have begun to get the high - design treatment , which could attract more people .
The London - based designer Nina Tolstrup built the 388 - square - foot Tiny Beach Chalet , which has drawn attention on design blogs .
One of the stars of the Museum of Modern Art ’s current exhibit on prefabricated houses is the Micro Compact Home , a 73 - square - foot cube by the British architect Richard Horden .
“ When you build small you can spend money on higher - quality materials , ” said Jared Volpe , a Web designer in North Ferrisburgh , Vt. , who runs the blog smallhousestyle.com .
Mr. Volpe said he is often amazed at how aesthetically pleasing many of the latest small homes are .
In the year since he started his blog he has received increasing numbers of e-mail messages from people interested in small homes  a trend he attributes in part to the poor economy .
“ People will need to heat their 3,000 - square - foot house this winter , and it ’s going to cost double of what it did a few years ago , ” he said .
For Mr. Janzen , a tiny house is not an immediate solution to his frustrations with large - scale living ; he has no intention of cramming his wife and young daughter into 80 square feet .
Instead , he plans to use the structure as an office , or park it on his in - laws ’ farm as a weekend retreat , a more traditional use for tiny houses .
But he will treat it as an “ intellectual exercise , ” he said , that will allow him to develop “ an idea of the other extreme of size . ”
When Yves Rossy crossed the English Channel last week with his flying wing , he made it look easy .
But it is n't .
Just ask Stephane Rousson .
Rousson , a 39 - year - old Frenchman whose unyielding obsession with flight has depleted his bank account and ruined his romantic life , attempted yesterday to cross The English Channel in a pedal - powered airship .
He was forced to deflate his blimp and continue to France in a boat after a shift in winds made it impossible for him to progress , no matter how hard he pedaled .
" We were about three - quarters of the way across but the wind was flowing in the wrong direction for me to make it across , " he said .
" I 'm not disappointed .
I feel happy because it had nothing to do with any technical failure , it was purely the wind that got int the way of this achievement . "
Rousson 's blimp , a crank - driven zeppelin known as Zeppy , is 16 - meters - long with a 5 - meter diameter , and a maximum speed of 20 kph .
That 's about 12 mph , or the speed of a Segway ( which one would you rather be seen driving ? ) .
The craft 's forward momentum and steering come from a pair of 10 - foot movable propellers churned by a recumbent bike hanging from the ship 's belly and pedaled by someone with a death wish ( Rousson ) .
The failure is strike two for Rousson , whose June attempt to cross The Channel was also foiled by winds .
This time around , he waited more than a week for the right conditions , but was doomed by a light breeze that picked up while he was in flight .
" What feels breathlessly still to most people feels like a storm when you 're trying to fly a pedal - powered airship , " he says .
Rousson 's singular focus on flight also seems to be taking over his life .
" All of my money has gone into this , " he says .
I 'm in quite a bit of debt . "
He was also dumped by his girlfriend ; presumably he loves his blimp more than he loves her .

There is no market yet for turbines that turn the tides into a source of energy from deep beneath the sea .
But that has not stopped mechanical engineers at the University of Strathclyde 's Energy Systems Research Unit ( ESRU ) in Scotland from developing one that will ride the tide while latched to the seabed by a cable — like a kite flying on a windy day .
The ESRU team 's goal : create a device that literally goes with the flow rather than resting on the sea bottom like an underwater windmill — a model already being developed by a handful of companies .
The kite and cable model is designed to facilitate placing tidal turbines in deep water , where the stronger current has the potential for providing greater power but also makes it extremely difficult to plant a turbine in the seabed .
" The problem with regular turbines is the bigger they get , the harder they work , and the more likely the force of the water is to damage the turbine , " says Andrew Grant , an ESRU mechanical engineer .
" Our turbine can fly like a kite in the water . "
Instead of planting the base of a turbine in the seabed , researchers need only plant an anchor for the tether .
Another key difference in ESRU 's design is that the turbine has two rotors attached — one in front of the other that turn in opposite directions on a single axis .
The rotors ' blades are made of either solid aluminum alloy or glass - reinforced plastic , depending on their sizes .
By having the rotors turn in opposite directions , Grant and his team are trying to cut down on reactive torque ( which pushes the turbine in the opposite direction ) so that the unit can be attached to a relatively simple mooring system even in very deep water .
This " contra - rotating " design has been tested on wind farms since the 1980s but did not provide an advantage ( in terms of generating more energy with less wind ) in the open air , Grant says .
New York City - based Verdant Power , Inc. , has experienced firsthand the trials and tribulations of developing working tidal turbines .
In fact , Verdant has taken the technology further than anyone else , having operated in New York 's East River since 2006 .
That project began with six windmill - like turbines anchored to the river bottom , 30 feet ( nine meters ) below the surface , churning at a peak rate of 32 revolutions per minute .
After the powerful current of the East River — which is actually a tidal channel — damaged the rotors and broke off some of the original fiberglass and steel blades , the company earlier this month whittled its test bed down to two turbines with new aluminum –magnesium blades 16 feet ( five meters ) in diameter .
" We only need two to complete our operational tests , " says Trey Taylor , Verdant 's president and head of market development .
The East River turbines are already providing power to a nearby grocery store and parking garage on Roosevelt Island , situated in the river between Manhattan and Queens .
The U.S. Department of Energy recently awarded Verdant $ 1.2 million for the company to further develop its technology over the next two years .
Another $ 3.3 million has come in from the Canadian government — Verdant is testing a new type of turbine in the Saint Lawrence River near Cornwall , Ontario , that sits on the riverbed rather than being moored to the bottom .
Taylor says he is familiar with the ESRU 's work and that Verdant itself even tested a tethered , kitelike turbine back in 2002 .
" I know what they 're doing , and they 've got a long way to go , " he says .
" We found that the tidal forces moving against it caused it to move up and down too much . "
Taylor says that the twin - rotor design is intriguing but questions whether the blades rotating in different directions might mitigate the turbine 's efficiency in capturing the full strength of the tide .
" It takes a combination of science , engineering and physics to get it right , " he says , adding that he likes it whenever anyone experiments with tidal turbines because everyone working on the technology benefits from the results .
As ESRU preps its turbine technology for sea trials , which begin next week , Grant acknowledges that a number of questions remain .
The researchers have not determined whether they need to float a buoy above to further stabilize or secure the turbine ( addressing Taylor 's concern about the turbine moving up and down too much ) .
It is also unclear how the turbine will behave when there is no strong tide , and how the turbine 's motion may affect an electric power cable attached to it .
( For example , will the cable become twisted if the turbine moves around too much ? )
ESRU scientists do not believe their technology will harm marine life , but admit they do not know whether the tethered turbines will attract or scare off fish .
" The turbines turn slowly , so we 're not talking about chopping up fish , " Grant says , noting the installation of the mooring may initially disrupt the seabed but likely will not have to be touched once it is set in place .
Verdant has spent about $ 9 million thus far on its East River project ; one third of the funds were spent on studies to gauge the potential impact of the turbines on vessel navigation , aquatic life and fish migration .
Grant acknowledges that tidal - derived power has a long way to go before it can be used as a mainstream source of energy .
" There are big barriers to making money out of this , " he says .
" There 's a lot of technical risk , so there 's a lot of financial risk , too . "
He expects it will be a decade or more before ESRU 's turbines are ready to be used in earnest in the sea — much more testing must be done , in addition to the environmental impact studies and garnering of support from utility companies .
Renewable energy has always suffered from the fact that the best places to capture sunlight , wind , waves and tides are also the most remote locations , which means an infrastructure is required to send the power where it is needed .
" In the U.K. , it 's quite difficult to get the power utilities interested in this , " Grant says .
" To get to this energy , you would have to run power lines across the country , which creates environmental concerns . "
This has not stopped Verdant and other companies from trying .
Lunar Energy , a U.K. tidal power company , in March began working with Korean Midland Power Company to create a giant 300 - turbine field in the Wando Hoenggan Waterway off the South Korean coast .
The plant is expected to provide 300 megawatts of renewable energy to Korean Midland Power by December 2015 .
Utilities interested in tapping into tidal power will have to spend money to create the energy - delivery infrastructure , or at least convince government to pay for it .
One thing working in favor of new energy sources : the cost of oil is not getting any cheaper .
About a quarter of the nation 's banks lost a combined $ 10 billion to $ 15 billion in the wake of the federal government 's takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , a new industry survey found .
In the survey , the American Bankers Association reported that 27 % of the nation 's 8500 banks held preferred shares in Fannie and Freddie in their investment portfolios .
The shares are expected to be worthless .

As cities deal with little power , police report relative calm 1 / 6 Back to Gallery
As Houston and the surrounding cities remained largely without power late Saturday night , local law enforcement reported relative calm .
Houston Police Department spokesman Officer Gabe Ortiz said there were no reports of looting in the city .
The city 's downtown remained close to the public , as work crews worked to clear shards of broken glass , uprooted trees and downed powerlines .
Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff said late Saturday that federal officials are concerned about the potential death toll from Hurricane Ike , and are moving aggressively to rescue stranded residents , primarily in Orange and Galveston counties .
" We obviously are concerned , " Chertoff told reporters Saturday night in Austin .
" There may be people we find who did n't get out and will be in the rubble . "
He applauded the response of state and local officials and said he could not yet put a dollar figure on the damage , except to say that it would likely rival some of the " legendary " damage figures of storms past .
" By any measure , it was a huge storm , " he said .
At 10 p.m. today , the National Weather Service said , Ike , now downgraded to a tropical storm , had moved north of Texarkana and was on a path to Arkansas with maximum winds of 40 mph .
At least 940 people have been rescued , most from Orange and Galveston counties , Chertoff said .
Emergency officials have millions of meals and bottles of water ready for distribution , and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has 20 teams ready to remove debris , he said .
About 40,000 people found refuge in 250 shelters all over the state , he said , and although some were full , others had plenty of capacity .
In Louisiana , winds and waters killed two people as coastal areas were inundated with a storm surge that crawled 30 miles inland , flooding tens of thousands of homes and making many roads impassable .
Gov. Bobby Jindal said Saturday night that nearly 600 people had been rescued from flooded areas , including 116 nursing home residents moved out of Franklin because a nearby levee failed .
More than 13 hours after launching rescue and recovery missions in the hardest - hit portions of the Gulf Coast , officials had no estimate of the death toll for Hurricane Ike .
In Galveston County , about 23,000 island residents are thought to have ignored the evacuation call and tried to weather the 110 mph storm .
Rescue teams with city of Galveston said they have helped 200 people in the last few days escape their flooded homes , said Pete Davis , chief of the Galveston Island Beach Patrol .
Davis said rescuers helped an elderly woman and her family evacuate a home on the far west end of the island , where water appeared to swelled about 20 feet during the early morning storm .
One woman 's death was confirmed by relatives late Saturday .
Richard Dare said his cousin , 65 - year - old Martha Ferguson , died between noon and 1 p.m. Saturday at a house in Galveston where she was staying with relatives .
In the Houston area , snapped trees and power polls and shattered the windows of city skycrapers , but despite the extensive property damage , Mayor Bill White and Harris County Judge Ed Emmett said they were grateful the area had sustained so little loss of life .
So far , Emmett said he knew of one death that came from the storm , a woman who passed away while she was being transported between hospitals .
The U.S. Coast Guard has saved at least 23 people , he said .
" I can not tell you how our community has been blessed , " he said .
" We have avoided a lot of the tragedies that have been seen in other places . "
In Harris County , where 250,000 people were advised to evacuate their homes in neighborhoods vulnerable to storm surge , the list of living , injured and — possibly — dead has yet to be compiled .
Rescue workers had launched searches for the more than 100,000 area residents who ignored evacuation orders and attempted to ride out the storm in their homes .
At least one area death was directly attributed to the storm .
Montgomery County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Norris said a woman was crushed by a tree as she slept in her home .
At midafternoon , Houston police said they were investigating two possible carbon monoxide poisoning - related deaths connected with improperly ventilated generators .
Memorial Hermann had seen six cases of carbon monoxide poisoning by 10 p.m. Saturday and treated four of those patients , hospital spokeswoman Lindsey Klingensmith said .
The other two people benefited from being away from the poisonous gas , she said , and did not require treatment .
Those who have been rescued from high water or other emergencies have been taken to several shelters in Houston , although those are not yet open to the general public , a step emergency officials may take tomorrow or later .
Judging by a helicopter tour he took today , White said the hardest hit neighborhoods in the Houston area included Gulf Bank and Westmount Houston .
Flooding was not as high as during Tropical Storm Allison in 2001 .
Homes along Brays
Bayou that flooded then have not been overrun by water now .
As much of Houston and the outlaying cities in the path of Hurricane Ike prepared for a night without power , White encouraged residents to stay home , extending a curfew for a second day in areas ordered to evacuate .
White urged federal officials to help restore power to the 5 million people on the Gulf Coast who lost power during the hurricane , calling it a " national priority " at a press conference later .
More than 3,000 electrical line repair workers had arrived in the city to help restore power , he said , but there was no timetable for when electricity would be restored .
White continued to urge caution and encouraged residents impacted by the storm to stay home .
In Harris County neighborhoods , where 250,000 people were advised to evacuate before the storm , a curfew was extended for a second day , from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m .
" This is no time to be out on the streets if you do n't need to be , " White said .
Power has been restored to a major water pumping station , White said , assuring that tap water could be clean enough to drink as early as noon Monday , although testing could take longer .
White said power was restored to the pumping station at 3:30 p.m. , and would take eight hours to build up to normal levels .
He said city employees would need to conduct tests at over 50 sites to ensure it is safe for drinking .
The longest test takes 36 hours .
White has consistently said there is no evidence that water became contaminated once the city 's Lynchburg Station lost power , but he urged Houstonians to continue to conserve water and boil it for one minute before drinking .
" We have no evidence of contamination of the water supply , but we want to be very careful , " White said .
On Saturday morning residents of Houston and its storm - stricken neighboring cities assessed damage from Ike , a Category 2 hurricane that snapped trees and power polls and shattered the windows of city skycrapers .
Downtown Houston was closed to the public today to enable the cleanup to begin .
Gov. Rick Perry announced that Galveston Island has been closed to all but emergency personnel to allow the search to take place .
In Galveston County , where fire personnel received 100 calls for help after they had shut down operations Thursday , city officials pleaded with the media not to photograph corpses .
Chertoff said more than 50 helicopters and other aircraft were flying as part of the massive search and rescue operation in Texas and Louisiana .
He said 2.2 million Texans and approximately 130,000 Louisiana residents evacuated their homes on Ike 's approach .
" We hope it 's a small number , " Chertoff said regarding possible hurricane deaths .
" But we 're going to have to wait and see . "
The resistance to the evacuation calls surprised officials .
But , said Perry spokesman , Mark Miner , " This is a democracy .
Local officials put out a very strong warning .
. . But you can't force people to leave their homes . "
In Chambers County officials launched boats to hunt survivors in Oak Island and Smith Point , communities that were submerged in 15 to 17 feet of water when Ike smashed ashore earlier today .
Chambers County spokesman Mike Kubik said many residents of the coastal county east of Houston ignored the calls to evacuate because of sour memories of Hurricane Rita 's 2005 gridlocked evacuation .
Kubic said rescue workers will investigate an unconfirmed report that an Oak Island resident called for help , saying he was treading water on the second floor of his home but did not know how long he could continue .
In Brazoria County , where officials also worried about holdouts who refused to leave , emergency management officials this afternoon cautiously suggested the county may have escaped without fatalities or serious injuries .
Officials earlier estimated that up to 35 percent of residents in mandatory evacuation zones stayed behind .
" At least , we dodged the bullet on that , " said Brazoria County Justice of the Peace Wayne DuBose .
" But we took a big hit and there 's a lot of damage everywhere . "
Hurricane Ike 's center hit Galveston Island at 2:10 a.m. today with 110 mph winds — a strong Category 2 hurricane .
The winds propelled a 12.4 foot storm surge into the downtown area , leaving much of the district inundated in 6 to 7 feet of water .
Ike scoured the city 's seawall , demolishing landmarks including the Balinese Room , a historic nightclub and one - time gambling establishment dating to the 1940s .
Also destroyed were Murdoch 's Pier and a Hooters restaurant , the latter said to have crashed into the sea at 1 a.m. with an explosive roar .
In Houston , Ike 's damage was widespread , and included Reliant Stadium — leading to a cancellation of the Texan 's Monday season - opener against Baltimore
Late this morning the Harris County Toll Road Authority closed the Houston Ship Channel Bridge for safety reasons , noting the bridge would reopen when winds subsided .
Houston Hobby airport officials said two runways are open , but no carrier has announced plans to resume flying .
Airport spokeswoman Marlene McClinton said Southwest Airlines has not scheduled any flights for Sunday and two other carriers have not yet decided whether to resume service .
Continental Airlines also suspended operations at Bush Intercontinental Airport until Monday in the aftermath of Hurricane Ike , company officials said .
The cancellations include Continental Express and Continental Connection flights .
The airline is working closely with the Houston Airport system , as well as with city and county officials to reactivate the airport , officials said .
Post - Ike analysis today presented one happy fact :
The hurricane could have been a lot worse .
Ike came ashore slightly east of where it officially was expected , meaning that its northeast quadrant — and the largest surge — impacted Bolivar Peninsula and points up the Texas coast .
Thus , what was expected to be a 15 - 20 storm surge on Galveston 's seawall checked in at little more than 12 feet .
Fire and EMS crews were back on the street by 9 a.m. after Ike 's powerful winds forced them to suspend services earlier this morning , Houston Fire Department Executive Assistant Chief Rick Flanagan said .
The city 's 911 service has received 4,700 calls in the past 24 hours , and crews were working as quickly as possible to answer them , he said .
However , he noted the same downed power lines , billboards and trees that made driving hazardous for civilians was impeding their ability to reach some locations .
CenterPoint spokesman Floyd LeBlanc said downtown Houston and the Medical Center , both of which have underground power lines , were the only large areas with reliable electricity .
He said CenterPoint had braced for more than half its customer base losing service , and full restoration could take " several weeks . "
CenterPoint said late Saturday it had restored power to about 112,000 customers , mostly in the western portion of its service area , and a pumping station that is a major source of water for Houston .
The company said 1.99 million of its 2.26 million customers were still without power .
Entergy spokesman David Caplan said 96 percent of its customers throughout its service area — or 380,000 - are in the dark .
Two generating stations in Bridge City and Willis are down , so they and transmission lines have to be back up before crews can focus on restoring power to customers .
Caplan says the process could take weeks .
In Galveston , Fire Chief Michael Varela , speaking to reporters in the San Luis Hotel , where the city 's mayor and emergency personnel are staying , said they would respond to needs on the west end of the island first , since it was hardest hit .
At least eight to 10 feet of water was on the streets when they ceased operations , and the second half of the storm , which came after that point , was far worse than the first , he said .
Asked how hard he believed Galveston had been hit , Varela said : " For us , one to 10 , I 'd say it 's a 10 . "
White said that in Ike 's aftermath , he was impressed to see Houstonians out with chainsaws and axes , helping each other clear debris from streets , lawns and homes .
" I ask neighbors to give comfort to their neighbors , to reach out to them , to give assistance , and to let them know they are not alone , " he said .
" You can't control life , but you can control how you react to it .
That 's the spirit of Houston . "

“ This bill failed because Barack Obama and the Democrats put politics ahead of country . ”
That ’s John McCain ’s take on why the House failed to pass a bipartisan Wall Street bailout bill today , according to Douglas Holtz - Eakin , McCain ’s economic adviser .
The McCain camp cites Nancy Pelosi’s “ strongly worded partisan speech ” that “ poisoned the vote ” as the deal - breaker .
So , let me see if I understand this correctly .
McCain ’s campaign theme is “ Country First . ” McCain , in step with President Bush , championed the passage of this compromise bill .
And a host of House Republicans refused to get on board because they were upset at Pelosi ’s rhetoric , so they sulked , rejected their own president ’s impassioned insistence , and voted no .
( Identify them here . )
Legitimate concern about the bill ’s specifics aside , if that is indeed why it failed , McCain is shooting himself in the foot to suggest that such pettiness reigns among Republicans that they cannot– or will not – rise above partisan sensitivities for the nation ’s welfare .
And it ’s not just McCain ’s ambition that ’s shoving country aside in making such absurd claims , it ’s Republican ideology as well .
Consider this remark from Representative Darrell Issa , the conservative multi-millionaire California Republican , whom the New York Times reported today was “ ’ resolute ’ in his opposition to the measure because it would betray party principles and amount to ‘ a coffin on top of Ronald Reagan ’s coffin . ’ ”
Again , let me make sure I ’m clear on this : what is most important at this moment of collective crisis is that we put philosophy over pragmatics to ensure that we do not dishonor Reagan ’s legacy .
Is there nothing that has happened this week to suggest to Congressman Issa that perhaps the Reagan philosophy has been a failure ?
That indeed , it has driven the catastrophic deregulation that ’s defined virtually the entire McCain tenure in Congress , which has led to the current economic implosion ?
Oops —
I keep forgetting that logical analysis has no place in politics anymore .
At one point during the multiple days of futures workshops held over the last week , one of my colleagues asked me where I 'd learned to facilitate groups .
After confirming that he thought I was doing it well , and wanted to learn more ( as opposed to wanting to know what to avoid ) , I told him , and he was a little surprised .
You might be , too .
Dungeons & Dragons made me a professional futurist .
Not the subject matter , of course .
For the uninitiated , Dungeons & Dragons ( hereafter D&D ) is kind of like World of Warcraft , with elves and wizards and inappropriately violent people with heavy swords , all in a vaguely medieval setting .
The big difference between D&D and WoW is that D&D is n't played on the computer ; it requires you and a handful of friends to sit around a table that 's covered with sheets of paper , stacks of books with embarrassing covers , and dice .
Lots of dice .
The other big difference is that D&D emerged in the 1970s , and WoW is totally a ripoff .
But I digress .
For the most part , when I played D&D in the 1980s , I served as the " dungeon master " ( DM ) for the games -- that is , the guy who came up with the stories , managed the games , and threw various hazards at the players .
It 's not an easy task : the three to five players sitting with you have to run their individual characters , but the DM has to be everything else in the world , and has to make sure that the story moves along fast enough to keep the players interested but carefully enough that the players do n't feel railroaded .
That role taught me a couple of things that still shape my thinking .
The first is the art of world - building .
Although the current version of D&D ( as well as the various other surviving non-computer role - playing games ) includes a pre-made world in which to play , back in the day we did n't have pre-constructed settings with collections of conflicts and lore and a lengthy backstory , and we liked it .
We had to make our own worlds .
And if they were to be interesting settings for narrative play , they had to be detailed , internally - consistent , rich with history and key driving forces , and open to players creating novel strategies to deal with seemingly world - shaking threats .
The last part is especially important .
The art of world - building is n't the same as the art of story - telling .
Stories focus on the characters , and have a strong narrative arc .
World - building creates the environment in which the player 's characters exist , and offers hooks and platforms upon which the players can , collaboratively , create their own stories .
The parallels here between world - building in D&D and scenario construction for futures work should be obvious .
Scenarios have to be detailed , internally - consistent , rich with history and key driving forces , and open to " players " -- that is , the strategists and citizens reading the scenarios -- developing their own strategies of operation .
In this case , however , futures scenarios involve the emergence of nanomanufacturing or disruptive climate change rather than the emergence of wizard - kings or disruptive undead hordes .
The second lesson from D&D is the art of invisible guidance .
This is where the facilitation skills come into play -- the goal of a DM ( facilitator ) is to get the players ( participants ) to follow a particular story - line ( strategic argument ) and reach a given end - point while making the players ( participants ) feel as if they 'd arrived there naturally .
As a facilitator , standing up and telling the participants what they should be understanding and deciding is worse than ineffective , it 's counter - productive .
Similarly , when a DM gives the players no choice but to accept a quest or follow a path , players often end up pushing back .
Why not just let the players or participants follow where their interests lead ?
Ideally , that would be wonderful , but both facilitators and dungeon masters have real - world limits on time .
If an organization is paying me for seven hours of futures consultation , I had better make sure that what I produce by the end of the day is something that the organization finds worthwhile and appropriate .
If a group of friends is going to take a full night out of a busy week to get together and play a game , I had better make sure that they have fun during that session , and feel like they 've progressed .
The trick , then , is to make sure that the participants and players move towards an end - point I have in my head without me telling them what that end - point will be .
I do n't have a checklist for this ; for me , it 's a style or practice that emerged out of years ( a few decades , really ) of on - the - job learning .
One element that 's certain : I always let the participants & players follow tangents for awhile before nudging them back towards the intended narrative .
In nearly every case , this provides a better context for the ensuing conversation / game - play .
Obviously , running a D&D game and facilitating a futures workshop have numerous fundamental differences , and I do n't want to make more of the comparison than is warranted .
But I am at the same time quite convinced that I would n't be able to do what I do today without the experience I 've had playing these sorts of games .
I suspect that , in a variety of important ways , the kinds of thinking and practices encouraged by those games are precisely those that have enormous value today : open - ended strategy ; an embrace of the unexpected ; and a fundamental reliance on asking " what if ? "
Sunday Sep 7 , 2008 ( foodconsumer.org ) --
The FDA on Sep. 5 , 2008 announced that it will publish quarterly a list of drugs that are being evaluated by the agency for its potential risks that have not been known earlier .
The listed drugs will be identified based on a review of reports in the agency 's Adverse Event Reporting System ( ARS ) .
The FDA move was authorized by the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act , a law that got approved on Sept. 27 , 2007 as cited below .
Title IX , Section 921 of the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act 2007 ( FDAAA ) ( 121 Stat. 962 ) amends the Federal Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act ( FDCA ) to add a new subsection ( k ) ( 5 ) to section 505 ( 21 U.S.C. 355 ) .
This section in FDAAA , among other things , directs FDA to " conduct regular , bi-weekly screening of the Adverse Event Reporting System [ AERS ] database and post a quarterly report on the Adverse Event Reporting System Web site of any new safety information or potential signal of a serious risk identified by Adverse Event Reporting System within the last quarter . "
When a potential signal of a serious risk is identified from AERS data , it will be posted in the required report in the quarter in which it is first identified .
A potential signal of a serious risk may in some cases constitute new safety information as defined in FDAAA ( newly created section 505 - 1( b ) ( 3 ) of the FDCA ) which includes , among other things , information derived from adverse event reports about a serious risk associated with use of a drug that FDA has become aware of since the drug was approved or , for drugs that have REMS , since the REMS was required or last assessed .
FDA will post each potential signal of a serious risk in the quarter in which it is first identified .
If additional new safety information is developed concerning a potential signal that has already been posted , it will be addressed by FDA in new safety communications , but will not appear again as a new quarterly posting .
The law requires that FDA inform the public each quarter of the new safety information or potential serious risks based on the agency 's review of the reports in AERS .
The FDA says in its announcement though that getting listed on the quarterly report does not mean the drugs definitely cause the listed risks and a causal relationship has yet to be proved .
Patients should continue taking any drug on the list if their doctors prescribe , said Janet Woodcock , M.D. , director of FDA 's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research .
The first quarterly report , published on Sep. 5 , lists 20 drugs along with their potential safety issue .
Future reports will only list NEW drugs that have not been listed in previous reports .
Below are the first quarterly report cited from the FDA website .
Potential Signals of Serious Risks / New Safety Information Identified by the Adverse Event Reporting System ( AERS )
January - March 2008
The table below lists the names of products and potential signals of serious risks / new safety information that were identified for these products during the period January - March 2008 in the AERS database .
The appearance of a drug on this list does not mean that FDA has concluded that the drug has the listed risk .
It means that FDA has identified a potential safety issue , but does not mean that FDA has identified a causal relationship between the drug and the listed risk .
If after further evaluation the FDA determines that the drug is associated with the risk , it may take a variety of actions including requiring changes to the labeling of the drug , requiring development of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS ) , or gathering additional data to better characterize the risk .
FDA wants to emphasize that the listing of a drug and a potential safety issue on this Web site does not mean that FDA is suggesting prescribers should not prescribe the drug or that patients taking the drug should stop taking the medication .
Patients who have questions about their use of the identified drug should contact their health care provider .
FDA will complete its evaluation of each potential signal / new safety information and issue additional public communications as appropriate .

Paulsen :
We gave you a simple , three - page legislative outline and I thought it would have been presumptuous for us on that outline to come up with an oversight mechanism .
That 's the role of Congress , that 's something we 're going to work on together .
So if any of you felt that I did n't believe that we needed oversight : I believe we need oversight .
We need oversight .

Dem hopes to spike Palin 's second ' bridge to nowhere '
RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday September 16 , 2008
Print This Email This Today may be the day of reckoning for a second " bridge to nowhere " in Alaska .
A Democratic lawmaker hopes to stop the project , which is intended for Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin 's hometown .
" A $ 600 million bridge and highway project to link Alaska 's largest city to Palin 's town of 7,000 residents is moving full speed ahead , despite concerns the bridge could worsen some commuting and threaten a population of beluga whales , " the Associated Press reports .
The Boston Globe adds , " Yet another project also known as a ' bridge to nowhere ' - to connect Anchorage to the area near Palin 's Wasilla home across the Knik Arm Crossing - continues to receive state support , though its congressional earmark was eliminated at the same time . "
" Governor Palin 's been in the news and she 's been talking about one ' bridge to nowhere ' and not the other , " Lois Epstein , director of the Alaska Transportation Priorities Project , told the paper .
" She canceled one bridge , but that was the easier of the mega - projects her predecessor left her with . "
The AP story continues " A Democratic council member in Anchorage will try Tuesday to spike the city 's sponsorship of the project , which Palin supports with some reservations . "
" This is basically an incredibly expensive project that does n't help commuters , does n't help create jobs and may drive whales to extinction , '' Justin Massey , an attorney advising environmentalists opposed to the proposal , told the AP .
" It is also a project that serves the area where the governor is from , which is near and dear to her heart . "
The AP continues , " The Knik Arm was one of two bridge proposals in Alaska awarded more than $ 450 million from lawmakers who requested money for special projects in 2005 , when Young chaired the House Transportation Committee .
Young , Alaska 's 18 - term congressman , has said Alaska still lacks basic roads , railroads and bridges that were developed long ago in older and less spacious states . "
" At the time , Palin 's running mate for the Republican ticket , Arizona Sen .
John McCain , derided both projects as wasteful , " the AP notes .
" He called Young 's highway bill a ' monstrosity ' that was ' terrifying in its fiscal consequences . ' "
According to the AP , " Anchorage Assembly members Patrick Flynn and Matt Claman , both Democrats , plan to introduce a proposal to kill the bridge on Tuesday .
They argue the money would be better used to set up commuter van pools and fix Alaska 's existing highways , some of which are so rutted that cars go skidding off the road . "
" She clearly has n't said ' no thanks ' to this particular bridge , '' Claman told the AP .
" If money were not an issue and we had no limits , maybe we 'd build a bridge .
But this is not a pragmatic or efficient way to spend scarce resources . "
The Anchorage Daily News is advising Assembly members to vote yes on " the resolution to strike the Knik Arm Crossing from the city 's long - range transportation plan . "
The paper 's editors write , " Circumstances have changed since the bridge authority was formed in 2003 .
Fuel , materials and construction costs have leaped .
Alaska 's wide - open pipeline to federal money has contracted as concern about increased deficits grows .
Sen . Ted Stevens and Rep. Don
Young still have power , but minority status and the ' bridges to nowhere ' moniker have turned off the federal tap for the Knik project .
What was at best a visionary project in a time of plenty now looks like a force - fed misallocation of scarce resources for the wrong bridge at the wrong time .
Let 's cut our losses -- and invest what 's left in something better . "
Although most Christians will not only permit but encourage atheists to read the bible at least some of them regard as " holy , " they would generally prefer we keep our thoughts about it to ourselves .
After all , this is no ordinary book ; it is one that must be believed before it can be understood .
And that generally means that Christians will be quick to dismiss anything an atheist might wish to say about their bible .
Still , I think there are some good reasons for atheists to read this bible .
Regardless of what you or I might think about the veracity of this book , it is impossible to deny that it has been tremendously influential on Western civilization .
Perhaps learning about what it says will help us understand our Christian neighbors and why they do some of what they do .
Even if you are tempted to dismiss the whole thing as a fairy tale , that might be enough of a reason to read it .
Of course , the obvious rebuttal to this is merely to note how few Christians have bothered to read it , even as they insist that it is " holy " in some way .
For me , one of the things that has always stood out about this particular book is how much of what it says was never mentioned in church .
I can't claim I 've ever particularly enjoyed reading it .
I have to be in the right mood , and that even then , it is slow going .
But it never seems to take long to discover a hidden gem , something I 'm fairly sure many Christians are completely oblivious to ( and we should be very glad they are ) .
The last time I read Judges , I was struck by an emerging pattern evident across several Old Testament books in which the Israelites repeatedly committed evil acts in the eyes of their god .
We see them punished in a variety of ways , ranging from famine to enslavement by foreign nations .
Each time misery befalls them , it is because their god punishes them directly or punishes indirectly by withholding protection of some sort .
Clearly , this is the sort of god that holds grudges .
I suspect most readers can sympathize with poor Gideon when he asks one of god 's prophets , " But sir , if the LORD is with us , why has all this happened to us ?
Where are all his wonders that our fathers told us about when they said , ' Did not the LORD bring us up out of Egypt ? '
But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian " ( Judges 6:13 ) .
He seems to be asking why the miracles he heard about in his youth have dried up and how a supposedly loving god could permit such horrors to befall his people .
It is an intriguing question .
Inexplicably , this god returns to lead Gideon to greatness after some groveling and animal sacrifice .
This is a bloodthirsty god .
Considering the historical context , I suppose the intensity of the superstition at the time should n't be surprising .
Even human sacrifice was sometimes needed to satisfy the monstrous god created by these ancient people .
In exchange for its help in his military campaign , Jephthah sacrifices his own daughter ( Judges 11:29 - 40 ) .
In Judges , we also see another mention of the scorched earth sort of warfare utilized by god 's chosen people at its direction .
They kill every last one of their enemies , including their livestock , and burn their towns to the ground ( Judges 20:41 - 48 ) .
But the atrocities do not stop here , for the conquering Israelites also kill the women and children , saving only the female virgins ( Judges 21:10 - 11 ) .
After all , they need to capture wives .
One can hear the protests of modern Christians : their god would not condone such practices !
Except that it did .
At least , it did if the contents of their bible are to be taken seriously .
The god it describes not only condoned but commanded these war crimes .
When the Israelites refused to kill sheep and cattle which they might actually be able to use , they were severely punished ( 1 Samuel 15:7 - 34 ) .
But what about the historical context ?
It is clear that human morality has changed a bit since those days .
Much of what our ancestors regarded as normal is intolerable today .
But what does this say about the morality of the god that demanded all of this ?
Did it make a mistake , change its mind , or is it even the same god ?
That so many biblical atrocities were ordered by the same Christian god whose name is tossed around today in the context of " family values " should give pause to even the most rabid believer .
Considered against this context , atrocities ranging from the Inquisition to Dick Cheney 's campaign of torture take on a new meaning .
This book has much to teach us about a segment of humanity and what it believes , including some things I am starting to wish I did n't know .

Paul CITY HALL Community Conversation about RNC & the Police

Democracy or Public Relations at City Hall
by Lydia Howell
“ When the people fear their government , there is tyranny ; when the
government fears the people , there is liberty . ”
Thomas Jefferson
Tonight St. Paul City
Hall is holding what they ’re calling a “ community
conversation ” about the actions and role that police played at the
Republican National Convention .
However , St. Paul city officials have
already pre-selected who the “ community representatives ” are who will be
allowed to speak .
This leads one to wonder just how those who are
elected to represent citizens define “ community ” and “ conversation ” .
Like the repressive police tactics at the RNC and the pre-RNC secret
meetings that Mayors and City Councils of both St. Paul and Minneapolis
held , this “ conversation ” calls into question about the state of our
democracy .
Ordinary citizens and groups working to organize peaceful protest at the
RNC were excluded from the decision - making process in St. Paul and
Minneapolis City Halls , that gave authority over local police to the
Department of Homeland Security , the FBI and the Secret Service .
After
years of reporting on police accountability issues , that members of the
public were not part of this decision is no surprise to this writer .
In spite of voters creating the Civilian Review Authority ( CRA ) to
Minneapolis in 1990 referendum , Mayors , city council members , un-elected
officials , members of State legislators and the Police Federation ( union
of police officers ) have steadily worked to destroy the CRA ’s ability to
be effective in addressing un - armed citizen complains of abuses ,
brutality and murder at the hands of police .
Police violence towards
unarmed , peaceful citizens exercising Constitutional rights of free
speech and freedom of assembly at the RNC was simply a variation on
police abuses that occur every day on Twin Cities streets–usually
against unarmed people of color and the poor .
St. Paul Mayor has appointed former United States Attorney Thomas
Heffelfinger and former Assistant United States Attorney Andy Luger to
conduct an “ independent review of police actions at the RNC .
( See the
press release from the City of St. Paul below )
Heffelfinger has a
position with the re-election campaign of Republican U.S. Senator Norm
Coleman , which puts into question how “ independent ” he can be .
So far , no
civil liberties attorneys or community members who have long worked on
police accountability to the community are part of this “ independent ”
review .
For citizens to be told that only pre-selected “ community
representatives ” can speak at St. Paul City
Hall adds offensive insult
to the gross injuries by police at the RNC .
To be told we have no right
to speak at a City Hall public meeting is to further have our First
Amendment rights violated .
For “ ordinary citizens ” voices to once again
be censored , after what happened at the RNC protests , is another direct
assault on democracy .
Unfortunately , democracy has been taking hits like for many years .
For over 10 years , some have warned about the state of American
democracy at a national level .
Ralph Nader , in his first presidential
campaign in 1996 and over the years since , has observed how corporate
lobbyists have access to members of Congress while grassroots
organizations and “ ordinary citizens ” are excluded .
Anti-war activists
were ignored when they opposed the 2003 U.S. attack on Iraq–although ,
opponents ’ predictions about the failures of the invasion have proven
true — and the lies peace activists said that were being used to justify
the invasion , have been exposed .
But , the unraveling of American democracy did n’t start with George
W.Bush in the White House or ant it ’s not just going on in Washington .
But , what I ’ve discovered as a longtime community activist and as an
independent journalist , is that democracy is in deep trouble even closer
to home : at your local City Hall .
Too often , city council members and
Mayors represent corporations and wealthy constituents to the detriment
to the rest of us .
In fact , non-wealthy citizens and the grassroots
organizations they ’ve formed are excluded from having any real input
into decisions impacting our neighborhoods , our schools , our public
services , our local economy , how our taxes are spent and , as we saw at
the RNC , whether our civil liberties will be respected .
Hundreds of millions of dollars are shoveled to already - fabulously
wealthy owners of professional sports team to build
Hundreds of millions of dollars to stadiums that most people ca n’t even
afford to go to .
Meanwhile , public services all of us need have have
their budgets cut or eliminated .
Public libraries , public park
recreational centers and community health clinics shorten hours .
Schools
close .
Big developers get millions of tax dollars every year , with the promise
they will build “ affordable housing ” , but , the question is never asked ,
“ Affordable for WHO ? ”
So , even as homelessness rises , condominiums —
built in - part with tax dollars–spring like mushrooms with price tags of
$ 200,000 to $ 1 M .
With the housing foreclosure crisis , more families face
the challenges of keeping a roof over their head with fewer and fewer
people able to find any kind of housing they can afford .
The Department
of Housing and Urban Development says is “ affordable ” means paying 30 %
of one ’s income but , many people pay 50 % to 70 % of their income and live
on the edge financially , as a result .
“ Economic development ” is another corporate scam that our elected
officials , from City Hall to the State Legislature , use to give hundreds
of millions to corporations — with more ( often unmet ) promises to
“ create jobs ” – and often through threats to re-locate if their demands
for public money are not met .
Think of it as a kind of corporate racket
to extort funds from the public .
Take Target , who not only got somewhere
between $ 60 M and $ 100 M ( the exact amount has never been disclosed ) from
the Minneapolis City Council to build their new downtown store and
Corporate Headquarters .
They also got an exemption form the local
ordinance that says corporations who get public money must pay the
living wage of at least $ 750 an hour .
Taxpayers only helped create
mostly part - time $ 6 - an - hour sales clerk jobs .
I do n’t have an MBA but , it seems to me our tax dollars can be far
better spent to positively impact far more of our citizens .
Low - interest
loans and grants for neighborhood - based local small businesses would
crate far more jobs .
Investing in youth sports and other after - school
programs for ALL our kids should be a higher local government priority
than enriching the owners of the Twins and the Vikings .
How long can it be justified to subsidize big corporations while
starving public services that serve all of us–and too - often serve the
most vulnerable and needy ?
How long will people accept being excluded
from the decisions made by people we elect and who ’s salaries we pay ?
This is a reversal of democracy – which means no democracy at all .
Special interests –that is corporations and the wealthy–along with the
elected and appointed officials that serve them locally and nationally
would prefer that the rest of us leave the decision - making to them ( as
we foot the bill . )
But , democracy is not a spectator sport .
Democracy requires citizens ’
participation beyond simply casting ballot for pre-selected candidates
every two to four years .
Democracy demands accountability of those who
are elected to represent us .
Referring to the Thomas Jefferson quote at the beginning of this essay ,
I wonder what it is St. Paul politicians are afraid to hear from
citizens ?
One way or another , at City hall meetings , by phone or letter ,
make your voice heard — while you still can .
Real democracy depends on it .

[ The following generic letter received in response to my complaint to the mayor of St. Paul , Chris Coleman ~ Mikael ]
Dear Mikael ,
Thank you for contacting my office with concerns about public safety and first amendment rights with respect to the recent Republican National Convention in Saint Paul .
I appreciate the opportunity to share our approach to accomplishing our main goal surrounding the convention “ “ to maintain public safety while ensuring two critical functions : the convention be allowed to successfully conduct its business and protesters be able to exercise their first amendment rights .
Meeting the public safety needs of the convention with a multi-agency police force of 3,800 officers from around the state and country was no small feat .
Law enforcement officials worked for nearly two years leading up to the RNC to determine the realm of potential threats to public safety and were firmly committed to preventing them from becoming reality .
Thanks to their efforts , FBI , county and local agents executed search warrants at specific locations prior to the convention , and seized items intended to harm and harass police , visitors and businesses , from buckets of urine to explosive materials .
Saint Paul took a decidedly different approach to its police presence than other cities had in previous conventions , including the Democratic National Convention in Denver the previous week .
We made a strategic decision to deploy the minimum amount of force necessary to ensure public safety .
Instead of greeting visitors with police dressed in full riot gear , we employed officers dressed in ordinary police uniforms , riding bicycles and on horseback , and directed them to remain in small groups so their presence would be less prominent .
Our hope was that this strategy would suffice for the duration of the convention and the police presence on the streets of Saint Paul would be friendly and minimally visible .
However , on Monday , our officers were confronted by rioters , intent on doing harm to persons and property in our city and thwarting the convention .
At that time we had no choice but for our officers to wear protective riot gear as the escalated threat required a greater show of force and protection .
Despite being spit on , taunted , hit , kicked , and otherwise provoked , law enforcement professionals were patient and exercised restraint by not responding unless and until necessary to ensure public safety .
Many of the suspects of crimes committed early in the week were apprehended in subsequent days , thus the arrests were not random but due to their alleged misconduct in previous incidents .
Those who chose to riot not only damaged property in the city , but they interfered with peaceful protesters legitimately attempting to express their opinions and right to free speech .
Our efforts ensured that , despite rioters ’ attempts , tens of thousands of people were able to exercise their first amendment rights in the form of legal protest marches and demonstrations and a free speech stage , all within sight and sound of the convention , an unprecedented achievement “ “ and something we are very proud of .
Throughout the convention , our officers performed with professionalism , maintaining high integrity in the face of agitators , rioters intent on causing damage , and constant press scrutiny .
At the time of an incident , police are trained to control the situation .
They err on the side of caution and make their best individual judgments in doing so ; however , officers are human .
That is why we have a process in place to ensure that we prosecute only those for whom we can provide proof beyond a reasonable doubt of criminal wrongdoing .
Without question , there were those who came to the RNC to express themselves peacefully and were pulled into the middle of chaotic scenes and arrested , which is regrettable .
We are working diligently with the police and the City Attorney ’s office to expedite the legal process as best we can to ensure that justice is served for everyone involved .
This experience is a learning opportunity for our city .
We will thoroughly evaluate all of the public safety practices and policies we implemented .
An independent review , led by former U.S. Attorney Thomas Heffelfinger and former Assistant U.S. Attorney Andy Luger , is already underway to help us discover the opportunities seized and lessons learned .
If the review reveals evidence to substantiate any instances of police misconduct , the individuals involved will be held accountable .
Any individuals with firsthand knowledge of specific incidents should contact the Police - Civilian Internal Affairs Review Commission as soon as possible at ( 651 ) 266-5583 .
Overall , the 2008 Republican National Convention was a success .
We were able to showcase our city to 45,000 visitors , including 15,000 members of national and international media .
Thousands raised their voices of dissent while the convention successfully conducted its business and delegates were left with a positive experience and impression of our region .
In hosting an event of global significance , we planted a seed .
We have told our story to the world and positioned Saint Paul well to host future events .
On a national and international stage , our city shone in the spotlight , and Saint Paul stands to reap the rewards for years to come .
Thanks again for taking the time to contact my office .
Your feedback is invaluable as we work to make Saint Paul the Most Livable City in America .
Sincerely ,
Â§Â¨Â©Âª
Christopher B. Coleman
Mayor
A New Face for Marlie Casseus ( Photos and Video )
16 - year - old Marlie Casseus has undergone four surgeries to remove an 18 - pound tumor that covered almost her entire face and hampered her breathing .
The entire process was chronicled on the Discovery Health Channel 's A New Face for Marlie .
Marlie suffers from McCune - Albright syndrome ( polyostotic fibrous dysplasia ) , a genetic disorder of bones , skin pigmentation and hormonal problems , along with premature puberty .
The growth completely disfigured her facial features , causing her to become reclusive to avoid scorn and repulsion in her native country of Haiti .
Most people there believed Marlie 's disfigurement was the work of the devil .
With most of her mouth and nasal passages blocked , Marlie was only able to eat and breathe through one very narrow passage .
The tumor began to close on her throat and made breathing difficult .
It would have also eventually caused blindness .
All four surgeries were performed at the Holtz Children 's Hospital , at the University of Miami / Jackson Memorial Medical Center in Florida , and documented for the television program .
The International Kids Fund partnered with Good Samaritan for a Better Life to fund Marlie 's surgeries , which began when she arrived in Miami with a tracheotomy to insert a breathing tube .
After her surgeries , doctors indicated that Marlie might required further cosmetic surgeries at a later date , but said the growth would not return .
The first words Marlie uttered when the tracheotomy was removed were " thank you . "
View photos and video below .
But we have lost focus on that .
Our economy is like a car , added Sridhar , and the financial institutions are the transmission system that keeps the wheels turning and the car moving forward .
Real production of goods that create absolute value and jobs , though , are the engine .
“ I cannot help but ponder about how quickly we are ready to act on fixing the transmission , by pumping in almost one trillion dollars in a fortnight , ” said Sridhar .
“ On the other hand , the engine , which is slowly dying , is not even getting an oil change or a tuneup with the same urgency , let alone a trillion dollars to get ourselves a new engine .
Just imagine what a trillion - dollar investment would return to the economy , including the ‘ transmission , ’ if we committed at that level to green jobs and technologies . ”
Indeed , when this bailout is over , we need the next president  this one is wasted  to launch an E.T. , energy technology , revolution with the same urgency as this bailout .
Otherwise , all we will have done is bought ourselves a respite , but not a future .
The exciting thing about the energy technology revolution is that it spans the whole economy  from green - collar construction jobs to high - tech solar panel designing jobs .
It could lift so many boats .
In a green economy , we would rely less on credit from foreigners “ and more on creativity from Americans , ” argued Van Jones , president of Green for All , and author of the forthcoming “ The Green Collar Economy . ”
“ It ’s time to stop borrowing and start building .
America ’s No. 1 resource is not oil or mortgages .
Our No. 1 resource is our people .
Let ’s put people back to work  retrofitting and repowering America .
...
You ca n’t base a national economy on credit cards .
But you can base it on solar panels , wind turbines , smart biofuels and a massive program to weatherize every building and home in America . ”
The Bush team says that if this bailout is done right , it should make the government money .
Great .
Let ’s hope so , and let ’s commit right now that any bailout profits will be invested in infrastructure  smart transmission grids or mass transit  for a green revolution .
Let ’s “ green the bailout , ” as Jones says , and help ensure that the American Dream does n’t ever shrink back to just that  a dream .
( CNN ) -- Federal and state police raided an evangelist 's compound in Arkansas late Saturday to investigate whether any children have been physically or sexually abused , officials said .
The raid is part of a two - year investigation into a compound near Texarkana , Arkansas , owned by Tony Alamo Christian Ministries , said Bill Sadler of the Arkansas State Police .
About 100 agents were on the 10 - to 15 - acre site late Saturday and met with no resistance , he said .
Alamo , reached by phone in Los Angeles , California , denied any wrongdoing .
" It 's a hoax , " Alamo said .
" They 're just trying to make our church look evil ... by saying I 'm a pornographer .
Saying that I rape little children .
... I love children .
I do n't abuse them .
Never have .
Never will . "
Watch Alamo deny the allegations »
Asked why authorities were searching the property , Alamo compared himself to Christ .
" Why were they after Jesus ? " he asked .
" It 's the same reason .
Jesus is living within me . "
It was not known how many children may live at the compound and whether Alamo would be arrested , Sadler said .
Federal and state agents were executing two search warrants , Sadler said late Saturday , and no arrest warrants had been issued .
" Children were interviewed and continue to be interviewed at this hour and likely will continue to be interviewed tomorrow , " Sadler told CNN .
In addition to FBI agents and Arkansas state police , officials with the state Department of Human Services participated in the raid at the church property in the town of Fouke , about 12 miles from Texarkana .
Alamo , who turned 74 Saturday , is an evangelist who also has dabbled as a singer and entrepreneur .
Critics regard his ministry as a cult .
The group has faced lawsuits and government actions , and Alamo has been arrested several times , publications have reported over the years .
Alamo is well - known in Arkansas , said Lynn LaRowe , a reporter with the Texarkana Gazette .
" It 's not very rare to come out of any baseball game to find Alamo literature on your car , " LaRowe said .
" Around here , he is an extremely controversial character . "
Alamo denied the existence of a compound , saying there are just houses " for miles " around his church .
All About Arkansas
After having $ 10 billion wiped off its collective worldwide revenues this decade , the four major music labels have n't had much to crow about .
Indie labels , which have banded together to negotiate as Merlin , together are as large as EMI , the smallest of the majors .
And even though digital sales are way up across the board , the dramatic declines in more - lucrative CD revenues have led industry observers into Sartre - like levels of existential despair .
So why is Jean - Bernard Lévy , CEO of Vivendi and owner of largest label Universal , so upbeat ?
In an interview with the Financial Times , Levy claimed that his label had already hit bottom and was now slogging uphill ( its revenues increased by 5 percent on a constant currency basis in the first half of the year ) .
He pointed out that Universal 's revenues were now increasing at a decent clip , and he was bullish on new music outlets such as Nokia 's Comes With Music plan .
" I think [ in ] the music business , there is a strong likelihood that we are getting close to the lowest part of the cycle and we are extremely active in developing new business models , new sources of revenues , " he told the paper .
Our chart below shows the year - over - year change in revenue for the quarter ending June 30 , 2008 .
EMI , the only private major label , is not included on the list .
While revenues do n't look so hot for Universal , the revenue change is misleading ; when currency fluctuations are removed from the equation , the company actually increased its revenues by 3 percent in the quarter from the same period in 2007 .
As for Warner , once the same calculation is applied , it actually lost 1 percent on a constant currency basis .
( Sony does not report its Sony BMG numbers this way . )
Digital , of course , is the big driver of better economic performance .
At Warner , for instance , it made up 20 percent of total revenues in the second quarter and generated 39 percent more income that it had a year before .
Universal notes that its growth is fueled , in part , by " the momentum of digital sales growth . "
The growth of digital is n't always enough to offset CD sales ( and it does n't help when your company 's CDs were implicated in a major rootkit PR disaster a few years back ) .
Sony BMG said that its decline in revenues was " primarily due to the continued decline in the physical music market worldwide not being fully offset by growth in digital product sales . "
Such talk has fueled speculation that the wild hookers - and - blow days of the 1980s may never come again for an industry that could have to content itself with a much smaller global revenue pie .
But as Universal 's experience shows , growth is still possible for the majors .
One consumer benefit to the music industry 's tribulations has been an increase in opportunities to acquire music .
The industry had to loosen the reins as is looked like the horses might bolt and leave the stagecoach stranded in the ditch .
First came the industry 's own pathetic efforts like Pressplay , then the DRMed world of iTunes , then the DRM - free goodness of Amazon , then the Nokia Comes With Music model , then the Last .fm free music streaming model , and now the birth of MySpace Music ( which has apparently had its launch pushed back from this week ) .
And , in another sign that music DRM is dying everywhere but on iTunes , 7 Digital just became the first music store in the UK to offer DRM - free access to the catalog of all four majors .
If the industry in general can recover as Universal has done so far this year , though , the question remains : will the major labels start taking up the slack on those reins , or will they decide that the wild , out - of - control ride they 've been on for the past few years has actually produced new opportunities worth following up on as revenues ramp back up ?

For sheer readability , few things make as much difference as proper punctuation .
These examples from You Send Me , a book I wrote with my husband , show how much difference punctuation can make :
" Who got fired , Stacey ? "  said the director .
Who got fired ?
Stacey , said the director .
Who got fired ?
Stacey said the director .
See what I mean ?
Now I can't tell you in a few paragraphs all you need to know about punctuation .
But I can hit the high spots , the problems that come up most often .
1. The Indispensable Comma
The word " comma "  comes from a Greek word meaning " to cut off , "  and that 's what commas do .
They cut sentences into pieces , organizing words into meaningful groups .
Sometimes , the organization can make a big difference !
Check out these sentences : ( 1 ) Jack said Harry wrecked the car .
( 2 ) Jack , said Harry , wrecked the car .
Here 's some comma-sense advice :
" ¢ Use commas and a connecting word ( like and or but ) to separate clauses — groups of words with both a subject and a verb .
John had forgotten her birthday five times in a row , but Gloria thought this year would be different .
" ¢ Use commas between items in a list : Gloria was hoping for dinner , dancing , and flowers .
She was furious that John had n't made a dinner reservation , called the florist , or even bought a card .
" ¢ Use commas before or after a quotation : Gloria said , " I might have known . " 
" I 'll make it up to you , "  John promised .
But do n't use a comma after a quotation that 's a question or exclamation : " Why not kiss and make up ? " 
John asked .
" ¢ Use commas before or after the name of someone you 're addressing : " Gloria , you 're over - reacting , "  he said .
" Maybe you 're right , John , "  she answered .
" ¢ Use a comma after an introductory remark if you want to emphasize the pause : Fortunately , the argument was soon over .
Before long , they were cuddling on the couch .
" ¢ Use commas around an aside , as you might use dashes or parentheses :
He dialed Chez Panisse , their favorite restaurant , and managed to wangle a reservation .
" ¢ Use commas around a clause that interrupts a sentence to insert a thought .
These interruptions often begin with which , where , who , or when :
They arrived at Chez Panisse , which was half an hour away , at ten .
The waiter , who knew John and Gloria , joined them in a toast .
( But do n't use a comma if there 's no interruption : John knew which wine was which .
Gloria knew when she was ahead . )
2. The Underused Semicolon
The semicolon may be the most unappreciated and underused punctuation mark .
If you find semicolons intimidating , relax .
They 're great for tidying up a series of items with commas inside them .
Imagine how hard it would be to read this sentence if only commas were used : Jack willed his house to Jill , his best friend ; his collection of lederhosen to his neighbors , Hans and Franz ; and his dog , Tige , to a friend , Buster .
Semicolons are also handy for joining chunks of a sentence that could stand alone .
A comma by itself is n't enough to hold together clauses like these : Jack broke his crown , Jill was n't seriously injured .
( This is sometimes called a run-on sentence . )
Unless you want to add a connecting word , use a semicolon : Jack broke his crown ; Jill was n't seriously injured .
3. Chatty Quotation Marks
The trick with quotation marks is at the end of the quote .
Does punctuation that follows the quoted material ( period , comma , question mark , or whatever ) go inside or outside the closing quotation marks ?
Here are the ins and the outs .
" ¢ Periods go inside .
" I think I 'm getting the flu . " 
" ¢ Commas go inside .
" I probably caught it at work , "  he added .
" ¢ Colons go outside .
Elizabeth did n't like being called " Liz "  : it was so predictable .
" ¢ Semicolons go outside .
Do n't play " My Funny Valentine "  ; she hates it .
" ¢ Question marks and exclamation points are sometimes inside and sometimes outside .
In most cases , they go inside the quotation marks : " What 's your name , sweetie ? "  said the cashier .
" It 's not sweetie ! "  shouted the child .
But question marks and exclamation points must go outside if they 're not part of the actual quotation .
Have you seen the film version of Gray 's " Elegy " ?
Good heavens , I did n't even know they 'd filmed Gray 's " Elegy " !
" ¢ Parentheses go outside quotation marks if the entire quote is parenthetical : Mom had the deciding vote ( " I said no "  ) .
Parentheses go inside the quotation marks if only part of the quote is parenthetical .
She added , " Next time , ask me first ( if there is a next time ) . " 
4. The Much - Abused Apostrophe
As someone with an apostrophe in her name , I hate to see this punctuation mark mistreated .
Here 's how it ought to be used .
" ¢ Possessives .
Apostrophes help show who owns what .
To make a noun possessive , add either an apostrophe with the letter s ( 's ) or just the apostrophe alone , depending on the circumstances .
The rules come in threes :
1 . Add 's to a singular word or name , regardless of its ending .
( Yes , even if it ends in s or x or z — whether sounded or silent . )
Ms. Jones 's favorite pastime is reading Camus 's essays and collecting Degas 's etchings .
Her dog 's name is Rex , and Rex 's meals come from Paris 's finest restaurants .
Her dress 's fabric is bamboo and her husband 's shirts are Egyptian cotton .
" It was Jacques 's idea to live in France , "  she said , " after we declared bankruptcy in the States . " 
2 . Add 's to a plural word that does n't end in s .
The children 's shoes cost almost as much as the men's and the women's .
My feet 's bunions are killing me .
3 . Add just the apostrophe to a plural word or name that ends in s. The Joneses ' and the Smiths ' and the Gonzalezes ' houses were vandalized , and their cars ' tires were slashed as well .
The houses ' windows were broken too .
NOTE : When you need a comma or a period after a possessive word that ends with an apostrophe , the comma or period goes after the apostrophe and not in front of it :
The idea was the girls ' , or maybe the boys ' , but at any rate the responsibility was their parents ' .
"¢ Contractions .
An apostrophe shows where letters have been dropped in a shortened word or phrase .
For example , should n't is short for " should not "  ; the apostrophe replaces the o in " not . " 
And I 'll is short for " I will "  ; the apostrophe is a polite nod to the dropped letters .
You can't say I did n't warn you .
" ¢ Some unusual plurals .
No , you DON'T add 's to a word or a name to make it plural !
You can , however , add 's to form the plural of an individual letter .
This makes for easier reading , and many stylebooks recommend it .
At Swarthmore , Libbi got B's and C's and started spelling her name with two i's .
5 . The Helpful Hyphen
Look what a difference a hyphen can make :
The stolen sofa was recovered .
Or , The stolen sofa was re-covered .
Do n't underestimate this handy punctuation mark .
If in doubt about using a hyphen with a prefix , look it up .
When two words are combined to describe a noun , we sometimes use a hyphen between them .
Generally if the compound follows the noun , it does n't get a hyphen :
That duck is water resistant .
But if the compound comes before the noun , it usually gets a hyphen :
That 's a water - resistant duck .
( And do n't ask why a duck . )

" Buying the War "
Four years ago on May 1 , President Bush landed on the aircraft carrier USS Lincoln and delivered a speech in front of a giant " Mission Accomplished " banner .
Despite profound questions and the increasing violence in Baghdad , many in the press confirmed the White House 's claim that the war was won .
How did they get it so wrong ?
How did the evidence disputing the existence of weapons of mass destruction and the link between Saddam Hussein and 9/11 continue to go largely unreported ?

In December , the president - elect will get a report detailing threats to the U.S. and that most likely includes a list of emerging technologies that will have a major impact on the U.S. and the world .
This report , called Global Trends 2025 , is a forecast prepared by U.S. intelligence agencies .
The report will be a grim assessment , with warnings about economic challenges , an aging work force , climate change and U.S. adversaries , according to emerging details , which most recently surfaced in a speech by Thomas Fingar , deputy director of National Intelligence , the body that oversees all U.S intelligence agencies .
Fingar spoke this month before a gathering of intelligence analysts at a conference in Orlando , Fla .
In the period leading up to 2025 , the U.S. " will remain the preeminent power , but that American dominance will be much diminished over this period of time , " said Fingar , according to a transcript of his remarks released by the director of National Intelligence ( PDF download ) .
The " overwhelming dominance that the United States has enjoyed in the international system in military , political , economic , and arguably , cultural arenas is eroding and will erode at an accelerating pace with the partial exception of military , " Fingar said .
The U.S. may remain the dominant military power , but its nuclear capability will be less important as challenges shift to cyber threats .
It will bear the weight of an aging population and by 2025 , the ratio of young productive people to seniors will begin to approach one in three .
" That is a pretty heavy burden on economic growth , " Fingar said .
The next president will receive a particularly bleak warning about climate change .
By 2025 , " it is not a good time to live in the Southwest because it runs out of water and looks like the Dust Bowl .
It is not a good time to be along the Atlantic seaboard , particularly in the South because of the projected increase and intensity and severity and frequency of severe weather - more hurricanes , more serious storms , and so forth , " Fingar said .
Among the climate - related problems Fingar cited are water shortages in " the already unstable Middle East , " and in China .
" Think about the difficulty of scrounging up in the international system the food for 17 or 18 million North Koreans , for a few tens of millions on the Horn of Africa .
... you have got one hell of a problem .
And that is going to happen .
This is n't in the maybe category .
This is in the for - real category , " Fingar said .
The report is expected to look at disruptive technologies , and a preview of what may be in the report was prepared by the National Intelligence Council in April .
A disruptive technology is defined " as a technology with the potential to causes a noticeable - even if temporary - degradation or enhancement in one of the elements of U.S. national power , " the report said .
Those elements are geopolitical , military , economic or social cohesion .
It identified six technologies that have that potential .
This story , " Technology that will Change the World " was originally published by Computerworld .
Kos comes across this remarkable admission from White House spokesperson Tony Fratto ( emphasis mine ) :
With respect to executive pay , again , I ’m not going to get into specific , point - by - point details on what our views are on that , other than the Secretary of Treasury said it would make [ it ] more difficult to make this plan work and effective if you provide disincentives for companies and firms out there who are holding mortgage - backed securities and other securities from participating in the program .
You have to remember , these are not all weak or troubled firms that own mortgage - backed securities .
A lot of them are very successful banks and investment houses that have done very well , have been responsible , are holding performing assets that have value .
They were not necessarily irresponsible players , and so you have to be careful about how you deal with them .
Who are they kidding ?
Of course the Democratic proposal for limits on executive compensation only applies to firms who participate in the bailout .
But apparently the White House view is that “ very successful banks and investment houses that have done very well ” should be bailed out , too , and they should be allowed to have their cake and eat it , too .
Actually , as I think about it , it ’s even worse than that .
Under its “ the more the merrier ” plan , the White House does n’t want firms who are doing just fine to be discouraged from the participating in the bailout .
Kind of like the way Republicans always want to make sure we maximize participation in Medicaid , welfare , and other social service programs , right ?
Late Update : TPM Reader SL hints at the flip side to this :
I think you guys are off on the outrage about good banks getting in on this bailout .
First off , I think it all stinks .
I ’m nauseated .
I ’d prefer a massive bankruptcy reorganization and fire sale .
BUT … if you are going to bail out any bank , you have to bail them all out .
Why ?
Because otherwise you ’re creating a competitive disadvantage for those who do n’t participate .
You reward the ones who have taken the most risks and punish their competitors if you do n’t .
Later Update : Similar sentiments from TPM Reader AM :
Online Advertising is increasingly being used by small businesses of all sizes .
Self service advertising programs as Google Adwords or dozens of others have allowed companies with tiny advertising budgets to target their customers online at a reasonable cost , if done properly .
And when we talk here about small businesses we also refer to those trying to build a home business from the Internet , affiliate marketers , bloggers , ebay sellers , etc .
Everybody with a website and needing to attract the right traffic can leverage the power of online advertising .
Nevertheless , when it comes to display advertising or banner advertising , which is also increasingly used by small business advertisers , the problem was to create a professional banner ad at a reasonable cost .
Hiring a professional ad designer or an ad agency has been the traditional , expensive , way .
Thankfully , banner design is changing as advertising programs has already done , and professional online ad design is getting affordable to all budgets by new business models .
So let ’s analyze five alternatives for a small business to create banners that rocks .
1 . Hire an ad agency or a professional designer to create the banner
As mentioned , the traditional expensive way to create banner .
Not only is the cost that can stop small businesses to go through this way , but also that they are not familiar with the process of interaction between designer or ad agency and the client .
2. Create banner by using design software
If you are a design and marketing expert , know how to use software as photoshop too , and have time enough to do it : why do you need anybody to create your banner ?.
Is that your case ?
3. Create banner by using online creation tools
You can use some online creation tools to create banner .
These are applications that allow you to create banner ads customizing a background and , in some cases , uploading your own design .
But to be useful for you , you must have a design first , as they do not offer professional advertising templates or they are really simple .
4. Create banner on some display advertising networks
There are some advertising networks that allow you to create banner ads with no cost , and you can use them on their network .
This is the main problem , you can only use the banner ads you create there if you display the campaigns in their network , which is usually less effective and more expensive than choosing yourself the advertising programs where to run your campaigns .
5 . Create banner through sites that provide both , the online software application and ad templates created by professional designers and marketers for different business
This is the most flexible option as you can create professional , affordable banner ads that you can use wherever you want with no restrictions .
Any more ideas ?

Digging Deeper
The high concept of Apple ’s long - running “ Get a Mac ” TV campaign is that the characters portrayed by John Hodgman and Justin Long are personified computers .
It ’s right there in the opening lines of every ad in the series : “ Hello , I ’m a Mac . ” “ And I ’m a PC . ” Hodgman is not “ Windows ” ; Long is not Mac OS X .
They are not representative or average PC / Mac users .
They are computers .
They ’re not dressed as computers , they ’re dressed as people .
It ’s postmodernism taken to a very silly and profoundly unserious commercial end .
But the concept reflects the actual business that Apple is in .
Apple does not sell operating systems .
They sell computers .
Microsoft does not sell computers ; they sell operating systems .
( Apple ’s boxed $ 129 versions of Mac OS X are just upgrades ; they only work on computers that Apple has already sold . )
Apple and Microsoft are undeniably engaged in one of the longest running and most interesting rivalries in business history , but it is very odd in that it is an orthogonal rivalry .
Apple ’s direct competition is n’t Microsoft but instead PC makers who sell computers running Windows .
This is not a minor semantic point .
There is no argument that the single most distinguishing difference between a Mac and a PC is the OS .
The genius in the conceit of Apple ’s ads is that they acknowledge this without making Windows the target .
They do so by diminishing Windows .
Windows is just one element of what it is that makes PC ( the character ) who he is .
The ads are neutral , sometimes even deferential , towards Microsoft .
Vista is mocked , but several of the spots have emphasized how Microsoft Office works just great on a Mac .
In at least one of the ads , Long ’s Mac character even makes it a point that he can run Windows just as well as PC can , via Boot Camp .
The framing of Apple ’s ads is not about either / or .
Not a choice between two rival products , like Democrat / Republican , Chevy / Ford , Coke / Pepsi .
The framing instead is special vs. regular .
Not Coke vs. Pepsi but Coke vs. “ soda ” .
Windows is not the Mac ’s rival or competitor .
It is the omnipresent homogenizer that weighs PC down .
It does n’t matter whether that is actually true .
The point is that this is the role Apple has reduced Windows to in this advertising campaign .
Windows is regular .
The default .
The norm .
Mac OS X and the software that runs on it is special .
It is something that the Mac can never lose and which the PC can never have .
And so what makes Microsoft ’s new “ I ’m a PC ” commercials so jaw - droppingly bad is that they ’re not countering Apple ’s message , but instead they ’re reinforcing it .
That the spots themselves jump between dozens of different people who “ are ” PCs , that the spots make a point of emphasizing that there are a billion Windows - running PCs worldwide , this only emphasizes that “ PC ” is not a brand name but a generic .
Microsoft ’s new ads emphasize the same message as Apple ’s : that the Mac is the one and only brand - name computer in the world .

Dear Cecil :
Do unborn babies pee and / or defecate in the womb ?
Realtime , via e-mail
Cecil replies :
That ’s two questions , so two answers .
Number one : yes , and it ’s a good thing they do .
Number two : yes , but you better hope they do n’t .
Fetal urination is normal .
It ’s part of that “ miracle of life ” folderol the nature programs exalt just before they hit you with something you ’d rather not know .
Naturally , fetal urine is n’t quite the same as yours or mine .
It does contain urea , but much of the nitrogenous waste enters maternal circulation for mama to clean up .
Fetal urine is n’t yellow , either .
Fetuses and newborns lack enzymes to convert bile pigments to urobilin , which colors the output of older children and adults .
Urine production begins late in the first trimester , about the same time the two - inch embryo becomes a fetus .
In the second half of pregnancy , fetal urine is an important constituent of amniotic fluid .
By the time the kid is about ready to pop out , he or she is passing roughly a liter a day .
Where does it go ?
Seems kids learn the benefits of recycling early on — they swallow it .
They ’d better , too , lest polyhydramnios ( a potentially dangerous buildup of fluid volume ) result .
When fetal urination is impaired , the opposite complication , oligohydramnios , usually occurs .
Fetal defecation is n’t normal , but fetuses do accumulate a mass of greenish feces , called meconium , in their intestines .
Unlike the adult version , meconium is sterile and odorless , though still pretty icky , and the sight of it in the newborn nursery starkly reminds a new parent — not infrequently dad , since mom at this point is often out of it — that his life has entered a dramatic new phase .
( Nurses invariably offer to clean things up .
Let ’em . )
You may ask :
There ’s nothing much to nosh on in there , so where ’s this stuff coming from ?
Various endogenous and swallowed sources : mucus , bile , intestinal epithelial cells , lanugo ( fine body hairs that are normally shed before birth ) , and vernix caseosa ( a lubricating sebaceous secretion of the skin ) .
Fetuses usually do n’t pass meconium until after birth , but doing so in the womb is n’t rare .
Around 12 percent of fetuses have meconium - stained amniotic fluid ( MSAF ) , colored yellow or green by bile pigments in the meconium — an indication that junior could n’t wait .
The more prolonged the pregnancy , the greater the risk .
In postterm births ( those occurring after 42 weeks ) , the rate of meconium staining is about a quarter to a half .
Why is this a concern ?
Fetuses take amniotic fluid into their lungs , and in a minority of MSAF cases , passed meconium enters the airway before birth and afterward leads to respiratory symptoms collectively called meconium aspiration syndrome ( MAS ) .
MAS can be fatal , although the rate of deaths is falling in developed countries — in part due to better treatments , but mostly because labor is now more likely to be induced if pregnancy drags on .
What else are they doing in there for nine months without cable ?
Let ’s put it this way : fetuses manage to entertain themselves .
For instance , in 1996 two doctors reported on their ultrasonic observation of a female fetus masturbating over a period of 20 minutes .
Twenty minutes ?
Change the channel already , you pervs .
Dear Cecil :
It seems whenever somebody wants to create a map that looks antique , they ’ll put “ Here be dragons ” on it somewhere , possibly with a picture of said creature .
But I ’ve seen photos of real historical maps , and they ’ve never included that phrase .
My question to you , master , is this : have I not seen the right maps , or is this the cartographic equivalent of “ The butler did it ” ?
— Daniel W. , via e-mail
Cecil replies :
Now , Daniel .
As this column has previously established , in at least a couple detective stories the butler did do it .
Likewise , there ’s one , though possibly only one , representation of the earth from the era of exploration on which one may find the phrase “ here be dragons ” — to be precise , the Latin equivalent , HC SVNT DRACONES .
These words are inscribed on the Lenox Globe ( circa 1503 - ’07 ) , an engraved copper sphere owned by the New York Public Library and on display in the Edna Barnes Salomon Room — or so online sources claimed .
Naturally we wanted confirmation , but our NYC - based operatives could n’t get off work in Jersey .

Thanks to their criticism , the plan will be pinned back .
Oversight will be put in place .
But the plan will probably not be stopped .
The markets would tank .
There is a hunger for stability , which only the Treasury and the Fed can provide .
So we have arrived at one of those moments .
The global financial turmoil has pulled nearly everybody out of their normal ideological categories .
The pressure of reality has compelled new thinking about the relationship between government and the economy .
And lo and behold , a new center and a new establishment is emerging .
The Paulson rescue plan is one chapter .
But there will be others .
Over the next few years , the U.S. will have to climb out from under mountainous piles of debt .
Many predict a long , gray recession .
The country will not turn to free - market supply - siders .
Nor will it turn to left - wing populists .
It will turn to the safe heads from the investment banks .
For Republicans , people like Paulson .
For Democrats , the guiding lights will be those establishment figures who advised Barack Obama last week  including Volcker , Robert Rubin and Warren Buffett .
These time - tested advisers , or more precisely , their acolytes , are going to make the health and survival of the financial markets their first order of business , because without that stability , the entire economy will be in danger .
Beyond that , they will embrace a certain sort of governing approach .
The government will be much more active in economic management ( pleasing a certain sort of establishment Democrat ) .
Government activism will provide support to corporations , banks and business and will be used to shore up the stable conditions they need to thrive ( pleasing a certain sort of establishment Republican ) .
Tax revenues from business activities will pay for progressive but business - friendly causes  investments in green technology , health care reform , infrastructure spending , education reform and scientific research .
If you wanted to devise a name for this approach , you might pick the phrase economist Arnold Kling has used : Progressive Corporatism .
We ’re not entering a phase in which government stands back and lets the chips fall .
We ’re not entering an era when the government pounds the powerful on behalf of the people .
We ’re entering an era of the educated establishment , in which government acts to create a stable  and often oligarchic  framework for capitalist endeavor .
After a liberal era and then a conservative era , we ’re getting a glimpse of what comes next .
( CNN ) -- James
Hoyt delivered mail in rural Iowa for more than 30 years .
Yet Hoyt had long kept a secret from most of those who knew him best :
He was one of the four U.S. soldiers to first see Germany 's Buchenwald concentration camp .
James Hoyt Sr. was one of the four U.S. soldiers to first find the Buchenwald concentration camp .

Hoyt died August 11 at his home in Oxford , Iowa , a town of about 700 people where he had lived his entire life .
He was 83 .
His funeral was at St. Mary 's Catholic Church in Oxford , with about 100 people in attendance .
The Rev. Edmond Dunn officiated and recalled time he spent with Hoyt and his wife .
" I used to go over to have lunch with Doris and Jim , and I would sit across from Jim at the kitchen table and think , ' Before me is a true American hero , ' " he said .
Hoyt had rarely spoken about that day in 1945 , but he recently opened up to a journalist .
" There were thousands of bodies piled high .
I saw hearts that had been taken from live people in medical experiments , " Hoyt told author Stephen Bloom in a soon - to - be- published book called " The Oxford Project . "
" They said a wife of one of the SS officers -- they called her the Bitch of Buchenwald -- saw a tattoo she liked on the arm of a prisoner , and had the skin made into a lampshade .
I saw that . "

Pete Geren , the secretary of the U.S. Army , said the sacrifice Hoyt made for his country so many years ago should never be forgotten .

" It 's important that we do n't allow ourselves to lose him , " Geren told CNN by phone .
" It 's the memory of heroes like James Hoyt and the memories of what they 've done that we must ensure that we keep alive and share with the current generation and future generations .
" Mr. Hoyt , as a young man , saw unspeakable horrors when he was one of the soldiers to discover the Buchenwald concentration camp , and those are experiences as a country and a world we can never forget .
" You think back on a young man 19 years old and to have the experience that he had , " Geren said , his voice dissolving before ever finishing his thought .
The discovery of Buchenwald , on April 11 , 1945 , began the liberation of more than 21,000 prisoners from one of the largest Nazi concentration camps of World War II .
The official U.S. military account of the liberation called the camp " a symbol of the chill - blooded cruelty of the German Nazi state , " where thousands of political prisoners were starved and " others were burned , beaten , hung and shot to death . "
" There is reason to believe that the prompt arrival of the 6th Armored Division ... on the scene saved many hundreds and perhaps thousands of lives , " it said .
As a private first class in the U.S. Army , Hoyt was just 19 when he and his three comrades -- Capt. Frederic Keffer , Tech .
Sgt. Herbert Gottschalk and Sgt. Harry Ward -- found Buchenwald in a well - hidden wooded area of eastern Germany .
See U.S. military documents detailing the liberation »
Hoyt was driving their M8 armored vehicle .
According to military records , Keffer was the officer in command of the six - wheeled armored vehicle that day .
The soldiers were part of the Army 's 6th Armored Division near the camp when about 15 SS troopers were captured .
It was mid-afternoon .
" At the same time , a group of Russians just escaped from the concentration camp , burst out of the woods attempting to attack the SS men .
The Russians were restrained and interrogated , " Maj. Gen. R.W. Grow , the American commander of the 6th Armored Division , wrote in a 1975 letter about the Buchenwald liberation .
Keffer was ordered to take his three comrades and two of the Russian prisoners " as guides to investigate , report and rejoin as rapidly as possible . "
" I took this side journey of about 3 km away from our main force because we kept encountering SS guards and prison inmates , and the latter told us of the large camp to the south , " Keffer wrote in a letter around the 30th anniversary of the liberation .
" We had been told by our intelligence that we might overrun a large prison camp , but we -- or at least I -- had no idea of either the gigantic size of the camp or of the full extent of the incredible brutality . "
Keffer and Gottschalk , who spoke German , entered the camp through a hole in an electric barbed wire fence .
Hoyt and Ward initially stayed at the vehicle .
" We were tumultuously greeted by what I was told were 21,000 men , and what an incredible greeting that was , " Keffer wrote .
" I was picked up by arms and legs , thrown into the air , caught , thrown again , caught , thrown , etc. , until I had to stop it .
I was getting dizzy .
" How the men found such a surge of strength in their emaciated condition was one of those bodily wonders in which the spirit sometimes overcomes all weaknesses of the flesh .
My , but it was a great day ! "
Keffer said the prisoners , through an underground system , had already taken control of the camp .
The four soldiers notified division command to get medical help and food to the prisoners as soon as possible .
The 6th Armored Division newspaper " Armored Attacker " ran a headline on May 5 , 1945 : " Four 9th AIB Doughs Find Buchenwald . "
The article described the discovery as " the worst concentration camp yet to be uncovered by west wall troops . "
Hoyt , a Bronze Star recipient and veteran of the Battle of the Bulge , was the last of the four original liberators to die .
Born May 16 , 1925 , to a railroad worker and a schoolteacher , James Francis Hoyt Sr. returned to his Iowa hometown after the war and largely kept quiet about the atrocities he saw .
He and Doris married in 1949 and had six children .
" She 's the love of my life , " he said .
He met Bloom , a journalism professor at the University of Iowa , in recent years and began telling him his story .
Even 63 years after the liberation , Hoyt suffered from post - traumatic stress disorder and attended a weekly group therapy session at a Veterans Affairs facility .
" Seeing these things , it changes you .
I was a kid , " he said .
" Des Moines had been the furthest I 'd ever been from home .
I still have horrific dreams .
Usually someone needs help and I can't help them .
I 'm in a situation where I 'm trapped and I can't get out . "
Hoyt was invited to attend the 50th anniversary of the liberation , but he declined .
" I did n't want to bring back those memories . "
" Thinking back , I would have pushed to be a psychologist -- if for no other reason than to understand myself better . "
The military documents detailing Hoyt 's involvement in the Buchenwald liberation were discovered in a box in an archive at the The Center for Military History this week after a CNN query .
It was fitting for the humble Iowan .
Hoyt listed his greatest achievement not as a Buchenwald liberator , but as spelling bee champ of Johnson County in 1939 , when he was in eighth grade .
" I still remember the word I spelled correctly : ' archive , ' " he said .
The story of James Hoyt -- mail carrier , spelling bee champ and American hero -- has now been archived for history .
Sacrifices like his were something his commander once said future generations should never forget .
" Memories of evil get erased , for life must go on , and new generations cannot be locked in the past .
But they would do well to remember the past , " Keffer wrote .
At Hoyt 's graveside Thursday , a 12 - veteran color guard gave him a traditional 21 - gun salute .
Hoyt 's casket was draped with the American flag , and that flag was folded , as is tradition , 12 times .
Retired Gen. Robert Sentman gave the flag to Doris Hoyt .
Sentman had earlier told mourners about the Buchenwald liberation .
" When the prisoners saw Jim , they picked him up and threw him in the air , that 's how happy they were after seeing such horrors .
Prisoners had been hung from hooks to die .
He saw a lampshade made from a prisoner 's tattoo .
Jim carried those horrors with him forever .
He never got what he had seen out of his mind .
If you ever wondered about Jim , think about what he saw . "
" When you were discharged , no one really gave a hoot about you .
It was difficult for a compassionate person like Jim to forget what he saw .
He was a hero . "

If a poll responder supplies an ( optional ) e-mail address , the address is included in the public response .
Crowdsourcing just got a new outlet today with the social polling site , millionheads .
The millionheads site is positioning itself as a sort of magic eight ball of personal indecision .
But instead of relying on the random , one - in - twenty , and often out - of - context responses of the Mattel toy , responses to millionhead user questions are open to anyone with an Internet connection , a keyboard , and an opinion -- albeit , hopefully , anAll questions are posted on millionhead starting with the words , " Should I ... "
The question asker then provides details on what s/he is seeking to decide , such as these recent queries : " Which laptop should I buy ? , " " When should I give my kids the talks about sex ? , " and " Should I do what millionheads tells me to do ? "
( The latter of those queries is still an open poll ; but as of when this news story was written , seven people had voted with 71 percent saying , " No - make up your own mind ! " versus 29 percent saying " Yes - the crowd knows best ! " )
The question asker then provides between two to five possible options for answerers to choose from .
Question askers can also include relevant photos of the question details as well as for the multiple choice options .
Question askers are required to supply an e-mail address , as the results from polls are e-mailed to the askers .
The site does not require any registration and the e-mail addresses of question askers are not visible to the public .
Answering questions does not require any personal information at all - - not even an e-mail address ( although , supplying one is an option -- but see below for theto doing this ) .
We spent some time on the site and came away with a mixed - bag of impressions .
On the surface , the site seems fairly innocuous , somewhat fun , but hardly addicting .
And even though the name of the site implies massive amounts of people will respond to your polls , the largest number of respondents we could find for a poll was 13 .
Of course , millionheads is a new site , so these numbers have nowhere to go but up .
But a few things actually disturbed up .
There are no " About us , " " FAQ , " or " Security , " links on the front page .
We also noticed that when someone opts to provide their e-mail address when responding to a poll , that !
We could n't find any notice or warning on the site that responders ' e-mail addresses would be included in their pubic responses .
This is especially misleading as users might assume that their e-mail addresses would remain private since the site states that folks who ask questions wo n't have their e-mail addresses visible to the public .
And without a FAQ and Security page , how do we know what the site owners are doing with the supplied e-mail addresses ?
It 's not that we necessarily suspect foul play on millionheads .
In fact , our Spidey sense tells us that the site is probably on the up - and - up and just good old - fashioned clean fun .
But at the very least , the site needs to make its policies more transparent to its users .
The site also suffers from the same Achilles ' heel that just about any crowdsourcing site suffers from :
There is nothing to stop folks from gaming the system .
Pranksters can easily supply joke or nonsense polls , as well as supply nonsensical responses to others ' polls .
Perhaps even viral marketers could invade the site and use polls as a form of stealth advertising .
It 's a new site , so we will give it a pass for now .
But if millionheads wants to move from the kiddie pool to the adult pool , it 's got some growing up to do .
Comcast 's adversaries in the nearly year - long battle with the cable giant over net neutrality offered cautious praise in response to the company 's disclosure of its new network management policies .
The company made the disclosure late Friday night as required by a Federal Communications Commission order sanctioning the company for blocking peer - to - peer traffic on its network .
Comcast acknowledged its policy of blocking peer - to - peer uploads in times of heavy congestion since 2005 , and confirmed it will now move to a " protocol agnostic " approach of network management – a policy it first announced earlier this year .
Instead of targeting a particular type of activity – such as peer - to - peer traffic – the company will instead focus on users who consume the most bandwidth , and temporarily slow their traffic .
In response , network neutrality advocacy groups offered cautious praise to the company , as well as raised some concerns .
" We 're encouraged that Comcast has complied with the F.C.C.'s order in such great detail – a welcome reversal of the company 's past behavior , " said Ben Scott , policy director for the Free Press , which filed the original complaint .
" This newfound candor is a reminder of the positive impact of F.C.C. oversight . "
Noting that Comcast has filed a suit to overturn the F.C.C.'s ruling even as it complies with it , Scott called the appeal a " particular concern since Comcast 's filings concede that the company has been blocking peer - to - peer applications in the precise manner that the F.C.C. and independent testers alleged . "
Gigi B. Sohn , president and co-founder of Public Knowledge , said : " We appreciate the time and effort Comcast has taken to compile a network management plan .
It is a very detailed and very technical document that deserves close scrutiny from the F.C.C. and from private - sector observers .
It appears that the plan does not discriminate against any particular protocols and does not involve using Deep Packet Inspection . "
But Sohn raised concerns about the company 's announced policy of a 250 GB monthly cap on bandwidth , as well as other aspects of the company 's new plan .
" Will consumers end up paying more for less bandwidth to use ? "
Sohn asked .
" Is it fair to consumers to punish them based on usage lower than the advertised speed ? "
One thing is for sure : the days of Comcast locking horns with its adversaries are far from over .

The world ’s newest and largest particle accelerator , the Large Hadron Collider , will not begin operations again until April , officials at the European Center for Nuclear Research said Tuesday .
The machine is built to speed the subatomic particles called protons to nearly the speed of light and then smash them together in search of new forms of matter and energy that cannot be produced in smaller machines .
Two weeks ago , the center for nuclear research , which is outside Geneva , sent the first beams of protons around the machine ’s 17 - mile - long underground racetrack .
But last Friday the machine was shut down after an electrical connection between two of the superconducting electromagnets that steer the protons suffered a so - called quench , heating up , melting and leaking helium into the collider tunnel .
Liquid helium is used to cool the magnets to superconducting temperatures of only about 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit above absolute zero .
Stray heat can cause the magnets to lose their superconductivity with potentially disastrous consequences .
To make repairs , it will be necessary to warm the magnets up and then cool them back down again , which takes at least two months , engineers say .
And that leaves scant time to run the collider before it has to shut down for the winter in early December to save money on electricity .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Prices of U.S. single - family homes plunged a record 16.3 percent in July from a year earlier , extending declines that have plagued the housing market for two years , according to the Standard & Poor ’s / Case - Shiller Home Price Indexes .
The S&P / Case Shiller composite index of 20 metropolitan areas fell 0.9 percent in July from June , S&P said in a statement on Tuesday .
Since the peak of the housing boom in July 2006 , the index has dropped 19.5 percent , it said .
S&P said its composite index of 10 metropolitan areas declined 1.1 percent in July for a 17.5 percent year - over - year drop .
From two years ago , the index is down 21.1 percent .
The pace of home price declines since May has slowed to about a third of the rate of the two previous three - month periods , however , S&P said .
“ There are signs of a slowdown in the rate of decline across the metro areas but no evidence of a bottom , ” David Blitzer , chairman of S&P ’s index committee , said in the statement .
Falling home prices resulting from soaring foreclosures are seen by economists as a top threat to the U.S. financial system and economic growth .
A plan to remove up to $ 700 billion in bad mortgages from financial institutions failed to pass the U.S. House of Representatives on Monday , sending markets reeling .
Declines for Las Vegas , the weakest U.S. market , hit 29.9 percent from a year ago and 34.3 percent from its peak in August of 2006 , S&P said .
Annual declines for Phoenix and Miami for July hit 29.3 percent and 28.2 percent , respectively .
Markets in Atlanta , Boston , Dallas , Denver and Minneapolis showed the most evidence that a bottom has formed , with home price increases for the past three months or more , S&P said .
Marijuana may be something of a wonder drug  though perhaps not in the way you might think .
Researchers in Italy and Britain have found that the main active ingredient in marijuana  tetrahydrocannabinol , or THC  and related compounds show promise as antibacterial agents , particularly against microbial strains that are already resistant to several classes of drugs .

It has been known for decades that Cannabis sativa has antibacterial properties .
Experiments in the 1950s tested various marijuana preparations against skin and other infections , but researchers at the time had little understanding of marijuana ’s chemical makeup .
The current research , by Giovanni Appendino of the University of the Eastern Piedmont and colleagues and published in The Journal of Natural Products , looked at the antibacterial activity of the five most common cannabinoids .
All were effective against several common multiresistant bacterial strains , although , perhaps understandably , the researchers suggested that the nonpsychotropic cannabinoids might prove more promising for eventual use .

Proselytisation of the cult of Wikipedia has reached new heights .
Jimmy Wales , co-founder of Wikipedia , has joined a speaker 's agency ( amusingly , he 's advertised just above Karl Rove ) .
Note that he keeps all fees , which can exceed $ 50,000 ( £ 27,000 ) , maintaining that such engagements " are inviting me in my personal capacity " ( bit.ly / seth8 ) .
His pitch ( bit.ly / seth9 ) starts : " Imagine a world in which every single person is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge ...
To create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language - That 's who I am .
That 's what I am doing .
That 's my life goal . "
But history tells a different story , one extensively entangled with commercial goals and ad- supported websites .
An old " Overview " page ( bit.ly / seth10 ) at Wikipedia states : " Originally all of Wikipedia was at the .com address .
Bomis , the company owned by Wikipedia patron Jimbo Wales , hoped to make Wikipedia profitable , or at least cover the costs of operation , so it was at least theoretically a commercial operation .
At one point , Jimbo was planning on placing unobtrusive advertisements on Wikipedia , but that plan has since been completely abandoned . "
In the early days , nobody foresaw how successful Wikipedia would become .
The structural turning point seems have been the 2002 departure of Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger ( bit.ly / seth11 ) .
With costs reduced , Wales wrote : " All plans to put advertising of any kind on the wikipedia is called off for now .
We will move forward with plans for a nonprofit foundation ... " ( bit.ly/seth12 ) .
Basically , it was a small side project which then became popular far beyond imagining - primarily , I believe , as a result of a quirk in Google 's search ranking algorithm , a little - discussed factor .
Nowadays ,
Wales often presents Wikipedia as a precursor or prototype for his venture capital - backed startup company , Wikia Inc .
Note that the for - profit Wikia has no significant financial connection to Wikipedia 's owner , the nonprofit Wikipedia Foundation .
However , Wikia derives enormous intangible benefit from the name recognition and mental associations of Wikipedia .
Wikia is sometimes summarised with the slogan " Wikipedia is the Encyclopedia .
Wikia is the rest of the library . "
But libraries are not dedicated to making profits by selling advertising on every page of their books while having authors write the books for free ( How will Wikia cope when the workers all quit the plantation ? , July 31 , bit.ly /seth13 ) .
A recent article ( bit.ly / seth14 ) in Trader Monthly Magazine provides a particularly blunt business analysis , one that contrasts strikingly with the evangelist glurge often found in press articles .
It describes Wales 's previous failed entrepreneurial ventures , leading to " ... his effort to take the success - and , indeed , the underlying philosophy - of Wikipedia , and commercialise the hell out of it " .
It 's informative to observe how long Wales has been pursuing a strategy of selling advertising around other people 's work .
Some observers see a journalistic cheap irony in Jimmy Wales being philosophically an Objectivist ( the fanatically capitalist intellectualism created by Ayn Rand ) .
Supposedly this is in contradiction with the altruism that motivates massive amounts of free labour .
In fact , Wales speaks a language of corporate collectivism that would not be out of place in Rand 's novels .
Hyperbolically , it 's where docile workers express joy that wonderful capitalists have provided the means of production , enabling glorious collective enterprises such as a laissez - faire market .
This sounds strange to people who do n't know about esoteric business - worshipping ideologies , and so mistakenly assume that phrases like " collective action " automatically indicate communism .
Just think of a viewpoint which regards a powerless proletariat labouring to produce wealth for owners as being the highest social achievement , and the connections should be clearer .
Beware corporate executives posing as social visionaries .
The hype may be about the fulfillment of human potential , but the reality is the exploitation of digital sharecropping .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. and Pakistani ground forces exchanged fire across the Afghanistan - Pakistan border on Thursday , the latest in a string of incidents that has ratcheted up diplomatic tension between the two allies .
No casualties or injuries were reported after Pakistani forces shot at two U.S. helicopters from a Pakistani border post .
U.S. and Pakistani officials clashed over whether the American helicopters had entered Pakistan .
The incident follows a U.S. campaign of attacks on militant targets inside Pakistan , including a Sept. 3 U.S. commando raid on a village compound in South Waziristan .
Islamabad has protested those strikes and warned it would defend itself .
“ Just as we will not let Pakistan ’s territory be used by terrorists for attacks against our people and our neighbors , we cannot allow our territory and our sovereignty to be violated by our friends , ” Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari said in New York on Thursday .
But in Washington , Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman insisted the helicopters had not entered Pakistan .
He described the incident as “ troubling ” and called on Islamabad for an explanation .
“ The flight path of the helicopters at no point took them over Pakistan , ” he said .
“ The Pakistanis have to provide us with a better understanding of why this took place . ”
According to Pakistan ’s military , its soldiers fired warning shots at two U.S. helicopters after they intruded into Pakistani airspace .
The U.S. military said the helicopters were protecting a patrol about one mile ( 1.6 km ) inside Afghanistan when Pakistani forces opened fire .
UNCERTAIN BORDER
“ The ( helicopters ) did not return fire but the ground forces fired suppressive fire at that outpost .
The Pakistani forces then returned that fire .
The whole exchange lasted about five minutes , ” said an official with U.S. Central Command , which oversees American military operations in Afghanistan .
The U.S. forces were operating under NATO command .
Thursday ’s confrontation followed a dispute earlier this week over reports of a downed U.S. drone in Pakistan .
Pakistani officials said a small unmanned American aircraft crashed in Pakistan , but U.S. officials denied it , saying a drone went down in Afghanistan and was recovered .
The rugged border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan is seen by Washington as critical to its fight against al Qaeda and the Taliban .
The Bush administration considers Pakistan an ally in counterterrorism but U.S. officials say Islamabad has not done enough against militants there .
The uncertain border also complicates efforts , making it difficult for forces to determine when they are in Afghanistan or Pakistan , both U.S. and Pakistani officials concede .
U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , after meeting Zardari on Thursday , said she believed he was strongly committed to fighting militants .
“ We talked about how we might assist Pakistan in doing what it needs to do , but I think there is a very strong commitment .
And after all , it is the same enemy , ” she said in New York on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly .

Ten Reasons Not to Hit Your Kids
In 47 countries around the world , it is illegal for a parent , teacher , or anyone else to spank a child , and 124 countries prohibit corporal punishment in schools .
1
Yet in all of North America , physical punishment by a parent , as long as it is not severe , is still seen by many as necessary discipline , and condoned , or sadly , even encouraged .
For the past several years , many psychiatrists , sociological researchers , and parents have recommended that we seriously consider banning the physical punishment of children .
The most important reason , according to Dr. Peter Newell , coordinator of the organization End Punishment of Children ( EPOCH ) 2 , is that " all people have the right to protection of their physical integrity , and children are people too . "
Hitting children teaches them to become hitters themselves .
Extensive research data is now available to support a direct correlation between corporal punishment in childhood and aggressive or violent behavior in the teenage and adult years .
Virtually all of the most dangerous criminals were regularly threatened and punished in childhood .
It is nature 's plan that children learn attitudes and behaviors through observation and imitation of their parents ' actions , for good or ill .
Thus it is the responsibility of parents to set an example of empathy and wisdom .
In many cases of so - called " bad behavior " , the child is simply responding in the only way he can , given his age and experience , to neglect of basic needs .
Among these needs are : proper sleep and nutrition , treatment of hidden allergy , fresh air , exercise , and sufficient freedom to explore the world around him .
But his greatest need is for his parents ' undivided attention .
In these busy times , few children receive sufficient time and attention from their parents , who are often too distracted by their own problems and worries to treat their children with patience and empathy .
It is surely wrong and unfair to punish a child for responding in a natural way to having important needs neglected .
For this reason , punishment is not only ineffective in the long run , it is also clearly unjust .
Punishment distracts the child from learning how to resolve conflict in an effective and humane way .
As the educator John Holt wrote , " When we make a child afraid , we stop learning dead in its tracks . "
A punished child becomes preoccupied with feelings of anger and fantasies of revenge , and is thus deprived of the opportunity to learn more effective methods of solving the problem at hand .
Thus , a punished child learns little about how to handle or prevent similar situations in the future .
Punishment interferes with the bond between parent and child , as it is not human nature to feel loving toward someone who hurts us .
The true spirit of cooperation which every parent desires can arise only through a strong bond based on mutual feelings of love and respect .
Punishment , even when it appears to work , can produce only superficially good behavior based on fear , which can only take place until the child is old enough to resist .
In contrast , cooperation based on respect will last permanently , bringing many years of mutual happiness as the child and parent grow older .
Many parents never learned in their own childhood that there are positive ways of relating to children .
When punishment does not accomplish the desired goals , and if the parent is unaware of alternative methods , punishment can escalate to more frequent and dangerous actions against the child .
Anger and frustration which cannot be safely expressed by a child become stored inside ; angry teenagers do not fall from the sky .
Anger that has been accumulating for many years can come as a shock to parents whose child now feels strong enough to express this rage .
Punishment may appear to produce " good behavior " in the early years , but always at a high price , paid by parents and by society as a whole , as the child enters adolescence and early adulthood .
Spanking on the buttocks , an erogenous zone in childhood , can create in the child 's mind an association between pain and sexual pleasure , and lead to difficulties in adulthood .
" Spanking wanted " ads in alternative newspapers attest to the sad consequences of this confusion of pain and pleasure .
If a child receives little parental attention except when being punished , this will further merge the concepts of pain and pleasure in the child 's mind .
A child in this situation will have little self - esteem , believing he deserves nothing better .
For more on this topic , see " The Sexual Dangers of Spanking Children " ( also in French ) .
Even relatively moderate spanking can be physically dangerous .
Blows to the lower end of the spinal column send shock waves along the length of the spine , and may injure the child .
The prevalence of lower back pain among adults in our society may well have its origins in childhood punishment .
Some children have become paralyzed through nerve damage from spanking , and some have died after mild paddlings , due to undiagnosed medical complications .
Physical punishment gives the dangerous and unfair message that " might makes right " , that it is permissible to hurt someone else , provided they are smaller and less powerful than you are .
The child then concludes that it is permissible to mistreat younger or smaller children .
When he becomes an adult , he can feel little compassion for those less fortunate than he is , and fears those who are more powerful .
This will hinder the establishment of meaningful relationships so essential to an emotionally fulfilling life .
Because children learn through parental modeling , physical punishment gives the message that hitting is an appropriate way to express feelings and to solve problems .
If a child does not observe a parent solving problems in a creative and humane way , it can be difficult for him to learn to do this himself .
For this reason , unskilled parenting often continues into the next generation .
Gentle instruction , supported by a strong foundation of love and respect , is the only truly effective way to bring about commendable behavior based on strong inner values , instead of superficially " good " behavior based only on fear .

Just like the wicked , there is going to be no rest for Conservative MPs this summer .
Courtesy of David Cameron , they have been issued with a reading list of 37 heavyweight books .
Top of the list , of course , is Nudge , by the American academics Cass Sunstein and Richard Thaler , the text that Cameron and George Osborne have been enthusing about in recent weeks .
As with most of the new crop of ideas books , Nudge focuses on the foibles and idiosyncrasies of human behaviour and on how , with a little discreet encouragement , we can usually be ushered in the right direction .
The problem is , for all the Tory lather , it and ideas like it have been around for some time , and are beginning to look very shaky indeed .
The notion that our behaviour can be nudged in a more propitious direction was given an enormous fillip by the publication in 2000 of Malcolm Gladwell 's bestseller The Tipping Point .
One of the most memorable vignettes in the book offered an intriguing answer to a puzzle that had been exercising the minds of America 's social scientists .
In New York there had been an abrupt and vertiginous collapse in serious crime , and no one could figure out why .
Gladwell noted that the New York police department had implemented a novel approach to policing called " broken windows " theory , which floated the idea that if steps were taken to curb minor manifestations of disorder like graffiti , fare - dodging , drunken behaviour and littering , the bigger crimes would take care of themselves .
What policymakers had hitherto failed to realise was that crime moves through society like a virus - and , like most epidemics , its spread could be traced to a point of origin among relatively few people .
By concentrating initiatives in specific areas and among a small core of potential offenders , he argued , the NYPD had sent a signal that more serious crimes would not be tolerated .
In so doing , the police had " tipped " the problem in the right direction and turned the tide .
The idea that crime or fashion trends zip around like viruses was an arresting one and Gladwell , an expert storyteller and synthesiser of ideas , told it marvellously well .
Before long the idea had itself " tipped " into the public consciousness , and tipping points were turning up everywhere from the property market to the war in Iraq .
All this activity around a single idea is all the more surprising because , for all that it was talked up , there was no real evidence that it worked .
Take the fight against crime .
A report commissioned by the American National Research Council in 2004 found no strong support for the proposition that strategies focused on minor misdemeanours make any headway against serious crime .
In the same year , the economist Steve Levitt pointed out that crime went down in the 1990s even in areas of New York where " broken windows " policing had not been tried .
In an exhaustive survey of the evidence for a 2006 article in the University of Chicago Law Review , the academics Bernard Harcourt and Jens Ludwig concluded that there " appears to be no good evidence that broken windows policing reduces crime , nor evidence that changing the desired intermediate output of broken windows policing - disorder itself - is sufficient to affect changes in criminal behaviour " .
The reason for the drop in crime , the pair found , was much more likely to stem from something called " mean reversion " - those areas of New York which suffered the greatest hikes in crime in the 1980s were bound to experience declines at some point - what goes up must eventually come down .
Another of Gladwell 's examples told the story of the sudden rebirth of Hush Puppies shoes as a New York fashion item after a small group of young people decided to adopt them as the height of hipster cool .
The result was a torrent of so - called " viral " marketing campaigns aimed at using small groups of trendsetters to " tip " their products into the public imagination .
While there have been a few notable successes , the embarrassing truth is that most of them did n't even get off the ground .
The reason - as Duncan Watts , professor of sociology at Colombia University , has shown in a series of experiments - is that Gladwell overestimated the role of the small group of " connectors " he deemed crucial in influencing the spread of trends .
The mundane answer why crime fell and Hush Puppies sales rose was not because of the efforts of a few influential criminals or shoe fanatics , but because changes in the culture made New Yorkers less likely to commit crime , and more likely to dress in retro chic .
The real lesson is that , while it is entirely possible to isolate the moment at which a small group turn their back on the temptations of crime , or a product bursts its way into public consciousness , it is devilishly difficult to reproduce that effect .
The reason why quietly nudging things in a favourable direction seems such a good idea to those in authority is that it promises a magic bullet for social problems - at the margins and on the cheap .
The tragedy is while they have been busy doing many little things in the hope that some of them might make a difference , they could just as well have been rolling up their sleeves and doing something big .

BANGKOK , Thailand ( CNN ) --
Iran may face " punitive " measures because of its insufficient response to an incentives package offered in return for a cutback in its nuclear program , a senior White House official said Wednesday .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said there is room for " common ground . "
" In the absence of a positive response to the generous offer that we provided in our incentives package , I think that the allies will have no choice but to take further measures that would be punitive , " spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
Speaking aboard Air Force
One en route to Thailand , the next stage of a week - long Asian tour by President George W. Bush , she said Iran 's response to the package " does n't look like it 's anything worth writing home about . "
The U.S. State Department said Wednesday that world powers will seek new sanctions against Iran for failing to accept an internation offer for economic incentives in exchange for suspending its nuclear activity , .
The announcement came after Iran failed to meet a two week deadline to respond positively to the international offer made at talks last month in Geneva attended by a top U.S. official .
" We are very disappointed that Iran has failed yet again to give Javier Solana a clear answer to the P5+1 's generous incentives package , " Acting State Department Spokesman Gonzo Gallegos said , calling Iran 's response sent Tuesday to the European Union a " stalling tactic . "
Gallegos said the permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany , known as the P5+1 , " are agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further sanctions against Iran " .
Top officials from the group agreed on the approach Wednesday morning during a conference call .
Gallegos said the countries are " discussing next steps in the UN Security Council and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another sanctions resolution . "
There are already three sanctions resolutions against Iran for failing to suspend its uranium enrichment program suspected of being used to make a nuclear bomb .
These Western powers want Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities , fearing it is a step toward developing a nuclear weapon .
Tehran contends it is developing nuclear energy for peaceful domestic purposes .
Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad recently said that that there is room for " common ground " between the United States and Iran on the nuclear issue .
A top United Nations ' nuclear official agency is meanwhile due head to Iran Thursday for talks with officials amid the current continued diplomatic sparring between Iran and Western powers over the Iran 's nuclear ambitions
The International Atomic Energy Agency said Wednesday that its deputy director general Olli Heinonen is headed there , but did not elaborate on the agenda .
Overview
This is standard Python Debugger extended with few features that makes debugging easier .
stxnext.pdb offer convenience mainly for zope users , but can be used for other python projects too .
Features
New features added to standard pdb : improved dir function .
Standard dir function lists names of all methods and attributs of some object .
This improved dir prints output from this function in few columns .
Also possible is filtering using regular expressions .
Examples : ( STX Next pdb ) obj = object ( ) ( STX Next pdb ) dir ( obj ) __class__ __reduce__ __delattr__ __reduce_ex__ __doc__ __repr__ __getattribute__ __setattr__ __hash__ __str__ __init__ __new__ ( STX Next pdb ) dir obj attr __delattr__ __setattr__ __getattribute__ ( STX Next pdb ) dir obj ^__ [ r-z ] +
__reduce__ __setattr__ __reduce_ex__ __str__ __repr__
info command prints basic information about object .
Examples : ( STX Next pdb ) info obj type : < type ' object ' > class : < type ' object ' > id : 140460386956752 str : < object object at 0x7fbf7b7835d0 > repr : < object object at 0x7fbf7b7835d0 > docstring :
The most base type
update_locals ( ul ) - update current locals by few useful variables and functions .
If stxnext . pdb can find zope or plone it imports frequently used functions ( e.g. getToolByName , getMultiAdapter , alsoProvides ) .
If context is available it can also import plone tools .
stxnext.pdb looks for variables named self .
context , context and self in current locals .
If context should be other it can be passwd as parameter : Examples : ( STX Next pdb ) update_locals #zope found , context unknown New locals : Attribute Interface ... schema sys ( STX Next pdb ) ul this_is_context #zope and plone found , correct context New locals : Attribute Interface ... sys uid_catalog
Using stxnext.pdb can be opened by standard pdb invoke - only pdb must be imported from stxnext module : >>> import pdb;pdb.set_trace ( ) #open standard pdb ( Pdb ) c >>> from stxnext import pdb;pdb.set_trace ( ) # ( STX Next pdb ) c
If zope instance runned with debug - mode=on pdb can be invoked from web browser - just add pdb to url ( e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080/plonesite/pdb).
In this approach stxnext . pdb tries to turn on tab completion - see rlcompleter documentation .
Here ’s the good news : Women have become so politically powerful that even the anti-feminist right wing -- the folks with a headlock on the Republican Party -- are trying to appease the gender gap with a first - ever female vice president .
We owe this to women -- and to many men too -- who have picketed , gone on hunger strikes or confronted violence at the polls so women can vote .
We owe it to Shirley Chisholm , who first took the “ white - male - only ” sign off the White House , and to Hillary Rodham Clinton , who hung in there through ridicule and misogyny to win 18 million votes .
But here is even better news :
It wo n’t work .
This is n’t the first time a boss has picked an unqualified woman just because she agrees with him and opposes everything most other women want and need .
Feminism has never been about getting a job for one woman .
It ’s about making life more fair for women everywhere .
It ’s not about a piece of the existing pie ; there are too many of us for that .
It ’s about baking a new pie .
Selecting Sarah Palin , who was touted all summer by Rush Limbaugh , is no way to attract most women , including die - hard Clinton supporters .
Palin shares nothing but a chromosome with Clinton .
Her down - home , divisive and deceptive speech did nothing to cosmeticize a Republican convention that has more than twice as many male delegates as female , a presidential candidate who is owned and operated by the right wing and a platform that opposes pretty much everything Clinton ’s candidacy stood for -- and that Barack Obama ’s still does .
To vote in protest for McCain / Palin would be like saying , “ Somebody stole my shoes , so I ’ll amputate my legs . ”
This is not to beat up on Palin .
I defend her right to be wrong , even on issues that matter most to me .
I regret that people say she ca n’t do the job because she has children in need of care , especially if they would n’t say the same about a father .
I get no pleasure from imagining her in the spotlight on national and foreign policy issues about which she has zero background , with one month to learn to compete with Sen. Joe Biden ’s 37 years ’ experience .
Palin has been honest about what she does n’t know .
When asked last month about the vice presidency , she said , “ I still ca n’t answer that question until someone answers for me :
What is it exactly that the VP does every day ? ”
When asked about Iraq , she said , “ I have n’t really focused much on the war in Iraq . ”
She was elected governor largely because the incumbent was unpopular , and she ’s won over Alaskans mostly by using unprecedented oil wealth to give a $ 1,200 rebate to every resident .
Now she is being praised by McCain ’s campaign as a tax cutter , despite the fact that Alaska has no state income or sales tax .
Perhaps McCain has opposed affirmative action for so long that he does n’t know it ’s about inviting more people to meet standards , not lowering them .
Or perhaps McCain is following the Bush administration habit , as in the Justice Department , of putting a job candidate ’s views on “ God , guns and gays ” ahead of competence .
The difference is that McCain is filling a job one 72 - year - old heartbeat away from the presidency .
So let ’s be clear :
The culprit is John McCain .
He may have chosen Palin out of change - envy , or a belief that women can’t tell the difference between form and content , but the main motive was to please right - wing ideologues ; the same ones who nixed anyone who is now or ever has been a supporter of reproductive freedom .
If that were not the case , McCain could have chosen a woman who knows what a vice president does and who has thought about Iraq ; someone like Texas Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison or Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine .
McCain could have taken a baby step away from right - wing patriarchs who determine his actions , right down to opposing the Violence Against Women Act .
Palin ’s value to those patriarchs is clear :
She opposes just about every issue that women support by a majority or plurality .
She believes that creationism should be taught in public schools but disbelieves global warming ; she opposes gun control but supports government control of women ’s wombs ; she opposes stem cell research but approves “ abstinence - only ” programs , which increase unwanted births , sexually transmitted diseases and abortions ; she tried to use taxpayers ’ millions for a state program to shoot wolves from the air but did n’t spend enough money to fix a state school system with the lowest high - school graduation rate in the nation ; she runs with a candidate who opposes the Fair Pay Act but supports $ 500 million in subsidies for a natural gas pipeline across Alaska ; she supports drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve , though even McCain has opted for the lesser evil of offshore drilling .
She is Phyllis Schlafly , only younger .
I do n’t doubt her sincerity .
As a lifetime member of the National Rifle Assn. , she does n’t just support killing animals from helicopters , she does it herself .
She does n’t just talk about increasing the use of fossil fuels but puts a coal - burning power plant in her own small town .
She does n’t just echo McCain ’s pledge to criminalize abortion by overturning Roe vs .
Wade , she says that if one of her daughters were impregnated by rape or incest , she should bear the child .
She not only opposes reproductive freedom as a human right but implies that it dictates abortion , without saying that it also protects the right to have a child .
So far , the major new McCain supporter that Palin has attracted is James Dobson of Focus on the Family .
Of course , for Dobson , “ women are merely waiting for their husbands to assume leadership , ” so he may be voting for Palin ’s husband .
Being a hope - a- holic , however , I can see two long - term bipartisan gains from this contest .
Republicans may learn they can’t appeal to right - wing patriarchs and most women at the same time .
A loss in November could cause the centrist majority of Republicans to take back their party , which was the first to support the Equal Rights Amendment and should be the last to want to invite government into the wombs of women .
And American women , who suffer more because of having two full - time jobs than from any other single injustice , finally have support on a national stage from male leaders who know that women ca n’t be equal outside the home until men are equal in it .
Barack Obama and Joe Biden are campaigning on their belief that men should be , can be and want to be at home for their children .
This could be huge .
Gloria Steinem is an author , feminist organizer and co-founder of the Women ’s Media Center .
She supported Hillary Clinton and is now supporting Barack Obama .

PETA sent letters to a number of celebrities who have worn Armani in the past urging them to boycott the designer .
In the letter to Tom Cruise , PETA ’s Vice President made particular note of Cruise ’s daughter , Suri , saying :
“ Please be vigilant about any packages that Armani sends for Suri , as they could include bunny fur from his toddler lines . ”
The X - Files Gillian Anderson also agreed to come on board as the head of the campaign against Armani .
Last year , Armani announced he would no longer use real fur in his designs .
Anderson and PETA feel he has gone back on his word , which he made voluntarily in the first place .
This comes just days after PETA urged Ben & Jerry ’s to stop using animal milk in their ice cream and to substitute breast milk instead .
Ben & Jerry ’s said no .
Of course , the organization is also notorious for using stars , sex and scandal to get their point across .
The PETA ads featuring different naked stars , most prominently Alicia Silverstone declaring ‘ i am a vegetarian ’ and the PETA strip - tease quiz , in which a woman undresses as you answer questions , have both caused controversy for their objectification of women , who are clearly less important than animals .

Not since Edward I . Koch disclosed this year that he was suffering from a serious spinal ailment has his online commentary generated the volume of e-mail messages he received in response to his endorsement of Senator Barack Obama for president last week .
Most of the 400 or so responses to the endorsement were extremely positive , he said .
About three dozen were not ; some of them were downright vitriolic .
“ I was surprised primarily by those who criticized me with the invective they used , ” the former mayor said , “ but I know those who praised me , had I come out the other way , would have used the same invective . ”
“ There is no acceptance of dissent anymore , ” he lamented .
In his commentary , which is e-mailed periodically to roughly 4,000 subscribers , Mr. Koch , who has been a supporter of President Bush , wrote that “ the country is safer in the hands of Barack Obama ” and that though Sarah Palin , the Republican vice - presidential nominee , is “ a plucky , exciting candidate , ” it “ would scare me if she were to succeed John McCain in the presidency . ”
He also commented on former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani’s “ maniacal laugh ” during his speech at the Republican convention .

Make no mistake about it , to Dick Cheney and his neocon co-conspirators , the cold war never ended and continues to this day .
This is truly a Cheney / Bush Administration where Bush is the oblivious stooge / cheerleader while Cheney positions and moves all the pieces on the grand global chess board .
Note the timing of their separate responses to the recent Georgia / Russia conflict as reported by By Tom Lasseter and Jonathan S Landry of the McClatchy - Tribune on August 10th .
" Tensions between the United States and Russia sharpened as the Bush administration suggested that Russia ’s objective is the ousting of President Mikhail Saakashvili , who has close ties to the United States and is seeking admission to NATO .
President Bush , in an interview with NBC , said , " I ’ve expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of Russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of South Ossetia . "
Here ’s Salon ’s Scott Bateman ’s take on Bush ’s comments — Bateman : George W. Bush on the invasion of Georgia
Earlier , Vice President Dick Cheney ’s spokeswoman Lea Ann McBride described Cheney ’s talk with Georgia ’s president , in which he said " Russian aggression must not go unanswered , and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the United States . "
Note the difference in tone — it ’s classic good cop , bad cop and guess who ’s the bad cop and in charge at the White House .
It ’s obvious that the Lord of War , Dick Cheney , is in the bunker , just like he was on 9/11 , making the moves while Bush makes meaningless noise from his bully pulpit while being seemingly unconscious — like reading My Pet Goat upside down on 9/11 in a classroom in Florida while planes and perhaps a missile were striking the World Trade Center and the Pentagon or falling down in a drunken stupor at the Olympics while war breaks out between Georgia and Russia .
Why do you think Putin shook his finger at Bush when he left the Olympics to return to Moscow during this crisis —
He knew what Cheney was up to and Putin responded quickly and decisively .
You do n’t want to needlessly provoke the Russian bear — no wonder Bush went off the wagon in Beijing .
As such , Russia has sent a sharp message to the West that they will take whatever measures necessary to defend their commercial , strategic and sovereign interests , particularly in the regions abutting its extensive frontiers — which is a huge setback to Cheney ’s imperialistic and arrogant approach to the global politics and energy positioning .
More importantly , Russia has also clearly demonstrated to the world the reality of its military and economic power in comparison to the floundering Cheney / Bush administration ’s failed Iraq debacle and current economic woes .
So whose in charge here ?
Obviously it ’s not Bush — so it must be Darth Vader himself , Dick Cheney , who once pronounced " The natural state of man is war . "
Here ’s the Georgia / Russian
War in a nutshell , verifying the Cheney presence , as reported by F William Engdahl in ICH , on August 8th — " As far as the Georgians are concerned , South Ossetia and Abkhazia are simply part of their national territory , to be recovered at all costs .
Promises by NATO leaders to bring Georgia into the alliance , and ostentatious declarations of support from Washington , have emboldened Saakashvili to launch his military offensive against the two provinces , South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Saakashvili and likely , Dick Cheney ’s office in Washington appear to have miscalculated very badly .
Russia has made it clear that it has no intention of ceding its support for South Ossetia or Abkhazia . "
http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article20489.htm
On top of that we have yesterday ’s comments by Russian Ambassador to the UN , Vitaly Churkin all but saying that Georgia ’s preemptive attack on Ossetia was orchestrated by the Cheney / Bush administration —
" It is hard to imagine that ( Georgian President Mikheil ) Saakashvili embarked on this risky venture without some sort of approval from the side of the United States , " Churkin told Russian NTV television on Wednesday .
Meanwhile former Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze said that Georgia made a " grave mistake " by advancing into the pro Russian breakaway province of South Ossetia .
Shevardnadze , who is a former Soviet foreign minister , also said the issue of Georgia in itself would not cause a new Cold War , as " the new Cold War has long since been instigated by the USA , through the Americans ’ so - called missile defence shield in the Czech Republic and Poland . "
http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=96083
So there you have it —
If the Lord of War , Dick Cheney , ca n’t get his war with Iran — he ’ll settle for a resumption of the Cold war with Russia and will do anything to accomplish that — like the recent U.S. backed Georgia preemptive attack of South Ossetia .

Call me cynical if you will , but I was n't surprised by yesterday 's news that some rape victims have had their compensation payments reduced by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority ( CICA ) simply because they'd had a bit to drink prior to the crime .
It 's not like it 's the first time I 've ever heard this particular rape myth , the one that says that inebriated women are somehow partly responsible for their own rapes ; indeed , it 's the same tired argument that 's used against those irresponsible and feckless women who choose to dress " provocatively " or who dare to walk about unchaperoned after dark , in fact against any woman , ever , who is n't able to prove to the world that she 's led a totally blame - free and virginal life .
Let 's face it , if you 're a woman , and you 're one of the nearly 14,000 a year who 's brave enough to report a sex crime committed against you , someone , somewhere , will find a reason to argue that it was all your fault : and yet people still wonder why tens of thousands more women choose not to report these assaults .
No , the only thing that surprised me about this story was that the woman - blamer in this instance was a body that 's accountable to the government for the way it spends its money , and I 'd only just finished reading about how tackling rape is one of the top priorities for the ministers for women .
In light of their decision to reverse this insult and to pay the 14 women the money to which they were entitled , I 'll give CICA the benefit of the doubt this time and assume that that message had n't quite filtered its way down yet .
The progress report ( pdf ) issued by the ministers for women last month does n't really tell us that much about what 's being done about the endemic levels of rape and sexual violence in this country .
Despite the fact that the ministers ' stated priority 2 is " Tackling Violence Against Women and Improving the Treatment of Women who Commit Crimes , " the only real progress the document mentions in relation to tackling rape is the £ 1 m in emergency funding that was pledged in March to ensure that no more rape crisis centres would be forced to close , well , not this year at least .
The report also talks about the government 's commitment to increasing the numbers of sexual assault referral centres ( SARCs ) , but as I 've mentioned in a previous article on this issue , these centres are set up to deal with victims in the immediate aftermath of an assault , and offer no services to women coping with the long term - effects of rape on their lives .
Rape crisis centres on the other hand , provide support and services to any woman who has experienced rape , be it last week , last year , or indeed , 20 years ago .
As always , there appear to be a lot of good intentions , and a lot of stated aims in the report about the ministers being committed to making things better for women , but practically speaking , it offers very little beyond the same old same old empty words and false optimism .
For without a significant financial investment in Rape Crisis and other women 's sector organisations there 's only limited scope for improvement , and apart from this year 's emergency monies , there 's little sign of any future or more long - term funding .
Meanwhile the stop - gap funding is coming to an end , and once more organisations providing vital services to women are left wondering how on earth they 're going to manage when that money runs out .
But at least it 's not just me and a few feminist activists who are getting frustrated by the lack of progress on this issue ; now even the UN have announced that they 're fed up with the current state of affairs .
In a recent report ( pdf ) by the Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women ( CEDAW ) a number of serious government failings have been cited , including the lack of sustainable funding for women 's voluntary and community organisations , specifically Rape Crisis centres .
As Sheila Coates and Lee Eggleston pointed out in the New Statesman , the CEDAW Committee heavily criticised the UK for being in breach of key elements of the UN convention .
The CEDAW report states for example that :
The Committee is concerned about the continuing prevalence of violence against women and girls , including domestic and sexual violence , and about the low prosecution and conviction rates of sexual violence cases .
The Committee remains concerned about the absence of a comprehensive national strategy and programme to combat all forms of violence against women and girls .
The Committee notes with concern the lack of adequate support and services for victims , including shelters , which is compounded by the funding crisis facing non-governmental organizations working in the area of violence against women and the forced closures of a number of such organizations .
It goes on to say :
The Committee calls on the State party to ensure the full implementation of legislation on violence against women , as well as the prosecution and conviction of perpetrators .
The Committee recommends the expansion of training activities and programmes for parliamentarians , the judiciary and public officials , particularly law enforcement personnel and health - service providers , so as that they are sensitized to all forms of violence against women and can provide adequate support to victims .
It recommends the expansion of public awareness - raising campaigns on all forms of violence against women and girls .
The Committee also recommends the establishment of additional counselling and other support services for victims of violence , including shelters , and requests the State party to enhance its cooperation with and support , in particular adequate and sustained funding , for non-governmental organizations working in the area of violence against women .
That 's right , " adequate and sustained funding , for non-governmental organisations working in the area of violence against women " .
So where 's the money Harriet ?
Vera ?
Anyone ?
The government has until 2011 to respond to the UN , and to explain what changes it has made in the time between now and then to ensure it adheres ( pdf ) more fully to the convention .
The ministers for women on the other hand , have got until this time next year , when they 'll no doubt be publishing yet another progress report .
But what 's clear from both yesterday 's Guardian editorial , and the CEDAW report , is that the situation as it stands must not be allowed to continue .
Women and girls deserve better than this ; they deserve better than to be blamed for the crimes committed against them , they deserve better than the current postcode lottery of inadequately funded services , and most of all they deserve justice .
It looks like the ministers have a busy few years ahead .

There are subjects I know a lot about and others I know very little about .
And the high - wire financial mess we ’re currently in falls clearly into the latter category .
But I know enough to be troubled that we appear ready to give upwards of a trillion dollars in unfettered and unreviewable spending authority to the … let ’s face it , the Bush administration , the folks who did such a bang up job in Iraq and New Orleans .
This morning a friend told me it ’s like the Iraq War all over again — Shock & Awe , followed by an occupation of Wall Street , and all with no exit plan .
In all seriousness , Paulson seems like a very able guy .
And without a roadmap in hand , he appears at least to have avoided catastrophe so far .
But let ’s take a moment to realize just how much money we ’re talking about .
It is probably inevitable in such cases that the public gets stuck with a lot of the bill for the recklessness and perhaps even criminality of the people who got us into this mess .
Even if it is their ‘ fault ’ , we ( as a country and its citizens ) are simply too bound up with the consequences of their actions to let them play out in an unfettered manner .
But we need both some orderly system of decision making and some conditions imposed on the people , and the industries , that brought us into the ditch .
Here ’s a note received today from one TPM Reader …
The current proposal for the bailout — $ 700 billion to be used however the administration chooses to use it — should not be allowed to pass in its current form .
This is the same administration that has mismanaged Iraq , DOJ , Katrina .
Why can they be trusted to preside over this in a way that is even - handed and for the benefit of the taxpayers ?
As Krugman and Atrios have pointed out , if insolvency rather than liquidity is the real problem , then this may not even fix the problem .
Even if there is some modest stimulus package appended to the bill , the bill will still be a bad idea if it gives such unprecedented and unchecked power to the Bush administration .
It would be great if you guys could lead a push — like the anti-SS privatization one from a couple of years ago — to impose limits and rules on the bailout .
The Dean Baker post on your site is a good proposal and maybe it makes sense to press congressman to agree to elements of it , particularly the caps on executive comp which has gone completely out of control here .
It also makes sense to regulate the CDS market — $ 65 trillion in it , more than in banks , with no transparency .
Make those who are to be rescued agree to some conditions so that this will not happen again .
Otherwise , this is basically giving Wall Streeters ( who are to be fair friends with both parties ) a lot of money for nothing in exchange .
We ’ll be publishing more of your emails .
So please let us know your thoughts .
The regional spokesman for John McCain in Colorado accidentally sent the campaign ’s internal talking points on the candidate ’s plans to suspend his campaign to its entire Colorado media list , instead of a list of key volunteers , Wednesday afternoon , PolitickerCO ’s Jeremy Pelzer reports .
The memo , titled “ TALKING POINTS : SUSPENDING THE CAMPAIGN , ” includes a list of points the campaign wants emphasized , and includes this warning from McCain staffer Tom Kise : “ Please do not proactively reach out to the media on this . ”
McCain ’s plans to stop campaigning — and a proposal to cancel Friday ’s debate with Obama — had already been widely reported Wednesday afternoon .
Still , Kise was surprised at his e-mail snafu , as Pelzer reports :
Told by a reporter that the e-mail had been sent to him and others in the media , Kise said , “ F*ck , tell me I did n’t send it to the wrong list . ”
Kise said the talking points were meant for McCain volunteers .
Among the document ’s “ Topline Messaging ” :
• To address our nation ’s financial crisis , John McCain will suspend his campaign and return to Washington .
He has spoken to Senator Obama and informed him of his decision and asked Senator Obama to join him .
The campaign is suspending its advertising and fundraising .
Obama spokesperson Bill Burton , clearly , did n’t get Kise ’s memo .
As TPM reports , Burton challenged the McCain campaign ’s assertion that McCain “ asked Senator Obama to join him , ” saying it was the Obama campaign that first broached the possibility of joint action on the financial crisis :
“ At 8:30 this morning , Senator Obama called Senator McCain to ask him if he would join in issuing a joint statement outlining their shared principles and conditions for the Treasury proposal and urging Congress and the White House to act in a bipartisan manner to pass such a proposal .
At 2:30 this afternoon , Senator McCain returned Senator Obama ’s call and agreed to join him in issuing such a statement .
The two campaigns are currently working together on the details . ”
Wednesday afternoon , Obama told a press conference he rejected McCain ’s unilateral decision to cancel Friday ’s debate :
Forest Fire Warning System Derives Power from Trees
September 22nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Trees : they ’re good for more than just shade , harboring wildlife , and carbon storage .
A new sensor system developed by Voltree Power uses the energy produced by trees to wirelessly transmit signals with information about forest fires .
The system is powered by off - the - shelf batteries that are slowly charged by the small amounts of electricity produced by trees .
Scientists only recently discovered that trees produce energy generated from an imbalance in pH between a tree and its surrounding soil .
The forest fire warning sensor is the first real - world application of this knowledge .
The system wirelessly transmits information about temperature and humidity four times a day from sensor to sensor until the info reaches a weather station that beams the data by satellite to a forestry center in Idaho .
Voltree ’s sensor is a big improvement over current forest fire warning technologies .
Remote automated weather stations are expensive , and manually recharging batteries at hard - to - reach locations is also costly .
In contrast , the Voltree system maintains itself and only requires cheap batteries .
With forest fires getting bigger and more out of control every year , fire - prone areas should welcome the arrival of the tree - powered sensor .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
I woke up to discover a weird link to a Digg post sent over by a friend of mine .
It was a poll conducted on CNN ’s website asking readers :
Do you think Russians actions in Georgia are justified ?
1 ) Yes — it ’s peacekeeping
2 ) No — it ’s an invasion
Surprisingly , 92 % of readers thought that the Russians were justified .
Taking into account CNN ’s boneheaded and overwhelmingly pro-Georgian coverage , the poll did n’t make any sense .
Were sheepish CNN viewers actually using their brain ?
It did n’t seem likely .
Well , the poll no longer appears on the site .
It was taken down after charges of manipulation started surfacing .
Apparently , Russian bloggers circulated the poll and called on Russians to let their voice be heard .
And if there ’s one thing CNN does n’t like doing , it ’s hearing what those damn Russkies have to say .
CNN had no idea that this seemingly innocuous poll would demonstrate the huge rift in opinion between the West and Russia and underline the importance that information warfare has played in this conflict , not to mention show whom CNN was really rooting for .
“ Information is no longer a staff function but an operational one .
It is deadly as well as useful . ”
— Executive Summary , Air Force 2025 report .
The Georgians did n’t just take this message to heart , they took whole sections out of DoD ’s handbook on Information Operations and followed them to the letter .
Even the most cursory look at this conflict shows that Georgia ’s attack was an almost perfect textbook example of how modern warfare should be fought on the information front .
The Georgians showed an amazing grasp of Info Ops concepts , pulling off counterpropaganda , launching disinformation campaigns and manipulating media perceptions as if they did this type of thing every day .
Oh , the Russians tried to do their part , too .
But it still is n’t clear if they did n’t give a shit about what the world thought or just failed miserably .
Either way , it was bad news for the Kremlin .
Despite a military victory , they are going to have a heard time getting the world to go along with their plans for post - war Georgia .
All because they failed to win over the hearts and minds of the world community .
The Georgians knew the importance of a well - defined information war strategy .
That ’s because Georgia has had ample training by the masters of this art : America and Israel .
Both have provided military strategy assistance , not to mention weapons training .
The Americans were just in Georgia giving them a month - long military refresher course called “ Immediate Response 2008 ” ( tab picked up by U.S. taxpayers ) .
Israeli advisers were spotted in Georgia during the first few days of the war and had been training the country for years .
In fact , Georgia ’s Defense Minister , Davit Kezerashvili , is a former Israeli himself .
So how did things go so wrong for Russia and so right for Georgia ?
Borrowing a few talking points from a document on Military Information Operations prepared by the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff , I ’m going to try to evaluate their performance .
What did they do wrong ?
How can they improve ?
Psychological Operations
DoD definition : Psychological Operations ( PSYOPs ) are focused on the cognitive domain of the battlespace .
PSYOP seeks to induce , influence , or reinforce the perceptions , attitudes , reasoning , and behavior of foreign leaders , groups , and organizations in a manner favorable to friendly national and military objectives .
PSYOP is just another way to say that P word no one likes to use anymore , propaganda .
Analysis :
This here is a no brainer .
Georgia has dominated the psychological playing field from the beginning .
As Mark Ames discovered , Georgian leaders were making collect calls to just about every influential person on Wall Street , convincing them that Georgia was the victim of Russian aggression even as Georgian rockets were leveling Tskhinvali .
And that was before Russia officially entered into the fray .
Saakashvili then made himself available for round - the - clock CNN and BBC interviews .
He repeated the same simple lines in near - perfect English , and always flanked by an EU flag : “ Russia is an aggressor .
We are a small democratic country .
Please help us . ”
Georgia was putting the “ CNN effect , ” as the military types like to call it , to extremely good use .
The pro-Georgian CNN effect was so strong , in fact , that CNN used footage of Tskhinvali for a report on the destruction in the Georgian town of Gori .
Check it out :
All the Russians did was call an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council to try to pass a resolution demanding that Georgia and the S. Ossetia lay down their arms .
It was n’t much of a psychological operation , one that the U.S. did n’t even back .
Psychological Operations Grade : Georgia : A+ , Russia : F +
Counterpropaganda
DoD description : Counterpropaganda activities are used to identify and counter adversary propaganda and expose adversary attempts to influence friendly populations and military forces situational understanding .
They involve those efforts to negate , neutralize , diminish the effects of , or gain an advantage from foreign psychological operations or propaganda efforts .
Analysis :
As soon as Russia started seeding reports that Georgia ’s shelling of Tshinkvali might have led to more than 1,000 casualties started appearing , Georgia went on the defensive .
Their brutal drive to retake the city was quickly forgotten and replaced with Georgian reports of Russian air raids on civilian targets .
Georgia was now the victim of a Russian military invasion .
When Russia accused Georgia of ethnic cleansing in S. Ossetia , the Georgians countered with claims of Russian genocide against the Georgians .
Pictures of dead bodies , taken by Western journalists , appeared in every Western newspaper .
To drive the point home , Saakashvili himself went to the city .
The PR event was cut short , however , when Russian jets were spotted above .
Cowering in fear , Saakashvili was bundled into a civilian Humvee and whisked away .
The debacle convinced Russian viewers that Saakashvili was a coward , but to a Western audience it was more proof that Russian jets were attacking Gori .
Georgian counter - propaganda was bolstered by the fact that Georgia made no attempt to hinder Western journalists ’ access to the war zone , while Russia made it almost impossible for non-Russian reporters to get into S. Ossetia .
Big mistake .
Russian newspapers even bitched about it .
When Russia tried to reiterate that it was not attacking civilian targets , Georgians claimed that Russian jets were bombing Western - financed oil pipelines deep inside Georgia proper .
It was an utter lie , but that did n’t stop the headline from hanging up on Drudge Report for two whole days .
Even now , after Russia signed an agreement to stop fighting , a disheveled and sleep deprived Saakashvili accuses Russian troops of attacking central Gori and moving tanks to take over Tbilisi .
Who cares if it ’s true .
The Russian side is silent on the matter .
Counterpropaganda Grade : Georgia : A , Russia : F
Electronic Warfare
DoD description : Electronic Warfare operates across the electromagnetic spectrum , including radio , visible , infrared , microwave , directed energy , and all other frequencies .
This includes targeting mass media and communications .
Analysis :
Here is where both sides were more or less evenly matched .
Both countries mounted cyber attacks on news outlets and government sites .
As their first order of business , Georgia blocked all Russian TV transmissions and blocked all the .ru sites .
Russia did the same , but despite those notorious Russian hackers , Georgia still managed to get the upper hand .
Aside from getting reports of Russian attacks suppressed ( thanks to Georgia ’s effective counterpropaganda machine ) , Georgia ’s big win was in managing to bring down the website of Russia Today , the only English - language TV coverage coming out of South Ossetia and the source of hard - hitting interviews like this one ( skip about 1 minute forward ) :
Russia could n’t keep up .
And how could they ?
What , take down cnn.com ?

 -- Jewish settlers tied a Palestinian to a pole in the occupied West Bank and beat him before he was rescued by Israeli soldiers , the man and an Israeli human rights group said on Monday .
Ta'ayush , a Jewish - Arab group , released a video of the incident on Saturday in which a settler dressed in white is seen kicking a bound man in the abdomen as Israeli soldiers stood by .
One of the soldiers is then seen restraining the settler .
Midhat Abu Karsh , 30 , a Palestinian teacher who lives near the West Bank city of Hebron , said he was attacked by settlers who falsely accused him of setting fire to fields near the settlement of Eshael .
Karsh denies any wrongdoing .
An Israeli police spokesman said : " Two settlers from Eshael were arrested on suspicion of assaulting a Palestinian man . "
Karsh said he was working in his wheat field near Eshael when he spotted a fire and rushed over to douse the flames .
" They tied me to the pole and I thought I was going to die , " he said , adding that settlers in the area had in the past threatened to kill him if he did not stop coming to the field .

Dem Senator :
We 'll fix Bush abuses after he ' slinks off the stage ' Nick Juliano
Published : Tuesday September 16 , 2008
Print This Email This Some Democrats -- frustrated at banging their heads against a wall much of these last eight years , as they 've watched George W. Bush run roughshod over the Constitution and the rule of law -- are determined to return some semblance of order once the president leaves office next year .
It was this desire to dial back the executive power overreach that was Bush 's primary governing philosophy that led Sen.
Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) to call together nearly a dozen experts Tuesday morning for a Judiciary subcommittee hearing on " Restoring the Rule of Law . "
Aside from Feingold , Rhode Island 's Sheldon Whitehouse was the only Democrat who showed up to question the witnesses arrayed before him in the Capitol Hill hearing room .
Republican Sam Brownback , the Subcommittee on the Constitution 's ranking member also showed up to quibble with the hearing 's implication that Bush had disregarded the law and complain about proposals to close Guantanamo because some have suggested moving the detainees to Fort Leavenworth , in his home state of Kansas .
Recommendations from Tuesday 's hearing centered on steps the next president and the next Congress could take to restore balance among the three branches of government .
Generally , they said a President Obama or McCain should commit to increasing transparency and accountability , work more closely with Congress and rely less on secrecy .
Whitehouse was particularly concerned about this last point , accusing the Bush administration of selectively declassifying information related to ongoing national security debates " to secure propaganda advantage . "
Some members of Congress , like Whitehouse , who sit on the Intelligence committees are privy to an array of classified information , including sometimes information that would contradict what Bush or other administration figures are saying in public , but they are legally prohibited from disclosing that information .
Such a situation allows the administration to abuse its power , he said .
After the hearing was over , RAW STORY caught up with Whitehouse for a couple minutes as he was heading to the elevator to ask whether Congress would keep up its efforts to expose Bush administration abuses once the president leaves office .
" Well I think that question is somewhat answered by the fact that we 're still inquiring about these issues now .
The Bush administration is soon going to slink off the stage , and there 's very little likelihood , I think , that any of us believe that we 're likely to affect the behavior of the Bush administration in its last months , " he said .
" But ... the target is lessons for history and making sure that people understand what happened and that we are armed and motivated to send a message to the next president that there need to be pretty specific changes . "
The subcommittee heard more than two and a half hours of testimony from the witnesses , who came from all sides of the political spectrum and included former members of Congress , the military and the Bush and Clinton administrations along with legal and constitutional experts .
Some of the witnesses at Tuesday 's hearing suggested creating an independent commission to fully examine Bush 's eight years in office once he leaves .
( The idea sounded similar to plans advanced by Rep. Dennis Kucinich for a " Truth and Reconciliation " Commission . )
Frederick A. O. Schwarz Jr. , who served as general counsel to the Chuch Committee that uncovered abuses by the Nixon administration outlined the need for and usefulness of another committee to examine Bush three decades later .
" We know that excessive secrecy smothers the popular judgment that gives life to democracy .
We need to cut through that secrecy , and a commission would serve several functions , " he said .
" First it would reveal many of the as yet unknown aspects of what our government has done , and equally important , how internally it rationalized and evaluated its actions .
Second , documenting violations of the public commitment of the United States is also to fulfil an important moral imperative .
Renewing our commitment to the rule of law by confronting and acknowledging our recent failures gives substance to our national moral commitment and thus can help to begin to restore our reputation in the rest of the world .
The findings of the commission would also play a role , an important role , of holding accountable those who are responsible for wrongdoing and for legal and constitutional violations .
The public revelations made by a commission would lodge accountability for deeds where it belongs and serve as a warning to future government officials not to again stray into the bound of unchecked power . "
Whitehouse said he would like to see an independent inquiry into Bush 's presidency " on a variety of issues , " but he seemed skeptical about whether Congress would be ready to create such a body .
" I do n't think there 's going to be a commitment for things like that to happen until they become specific , and we 're not there yet , " he told RAW STORY .
" But I think that there 's a commitment in general to try to get this right . "
Summary : Did the United States conduct a successful financial “ raid ” on Russia ?
These rumors might not be true — probably are not true — but then so many stories that start wars are false .
Remember the Maine !
More seriously , these rumors signal that the possibility of financial warfare is on the minds of key people .
Probably for good reason .
Update :
The significance of this event lies in the fears , not the underlying reality .
It shows that people have become aware that financial warfare is not sci- fi , but a possibility .
Each time these episodes happen , it becomes more likely that governments begin to consider this new dimension of warfare .
Both in offense and defense .
“ Russian Rescue Package Expands to $ 120 Billion “ , Wall Street Journal , 19 September 2008 — Subscription required .
Excerpt :
As Russia ’s stock market went into free fall this week , conspiracy theories circulated that Washington was egging on American financiers to punish Moscow for its incursion into Georgia last month .
The theories gained enough credence that Russia ’s finance minister , Alexei Kudrin , spoke with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson late Wednesday and sought assurances that the U.S. was n’t playing politics with Russia in the financial crisis , the Russian Finance Ministry said .
Mr. Paulson told Mr. Kudrin that the U.S. was n’t , according to the Russian side .
A U.S. account of the call was n’t available .
… In recent weeks , Mr. Medvedev has blamed the crisis primarily on the U.S. , which has been the target of Kremlin wrath on all fronts since the U.S. sharply criticized Russia ’s war in Georgia .
A top State Department official , meanwhile , this week cited the financial problems as the “ price ” Moscow was paying for the war .
On Thursday , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Moscow ’s moves in Georgia and elsewhere “ are putting Russia on a one - way path to self - imposed isolation and international irrelevance . ”
The question broached by Mr. Kudrin in his phone call with Mr. Paulson reflects a view widely held in the opaque world of the Moscow elite .
Russian officials have asked U.S. bankers in recent weeks if the banks have been ordered by U.S. officials not to lend to Russian companies , according to people familiar with the conversations .
The banks deny any such order .
“ There ’s a feeling of hostility , ” said one person who works closely with the Russian government .
“ The biggest problem is that they do n’t understand that the problem is home - made . ”
… With growth running about 8 % this year , there is no sign of a recession , economists said , but that growth rate could be halved next year .
“ Growth will slow down , ” said Martin Gilman , a former International Monetary Fund official , now a professor at Moscow ’s Higher School of Economics .
For a less sanitized version of opinion in Russia , let ’s go to our # 1 local source in Moscow .
“ Angst “ , Eric Kraus , Truth and Beauty , 10 September 2008 — Excerpt :
Objectively , the Russian economy is doing better than 95 % of the economies on earth .
Profitability is high , macroeconomic stability is excellent , growth is compelling – there has not been a single bank failure since 2004 , and virtually no exposure to US subprime .
Yes , there is the usual litany of complaints , many of them justified – but none of this is really new , and while we are very familiar with the short - term irrationality of markets , we struggle to explain this debacle on the basis of normal market factors alone .
More controversially late last week at least two of the top local Moscow brokers were warning clients that major US banks were being encouraged / pressured to sell their Russian assets .
Although certain bulgebracket US institutions were clearly dumping Russian paper last week , it remains possible that they were doing so largely – or entirely – of their own accord .
We have been unable to get confirmation of the alleged political pressure ; a very senior person at JPMorgan denied it flat out , whereas contacts at the sole remaining solvent major US investment bank confirmed that they had indeed gotten the call .
Our friends on the sovereign debt desks inform us that only US accounts have been selling Russian Federation bonds , but these have all found a new home a couple of percent below last weeks prices .
CDS spreads have widened out , but this was primarily hedging activity as cash volumes have dried up .
Intriguingly , aggressive and apparentlyconcerted statements by assorted US officials ( vide supra ) suggest that it would have pleased them to no end to inflict some economic damage .
Whether they are thumping their chests following a successful covert intervention – or are simply trying to put a useful spin on a market - driven sell off to which they were mere spectators – remains an open question .
The Russian equity market has – in recent weeks – been the worst performing global major market .
Trading has been substantially worse than in the run-up to the 1998 crisis ( where we saw regular dead cat bounces ) or during the Yukos debacle .
There is one minor difference – in 1998 , the Russian economy was dying , the CBR coffers were empty , GDP was stagnant , oil was dropping below $ 10 , and despite Russian domestic debt paying > 100 % , the government was surviving on expedients .
Russia is currently seeing 7.9 % GDP growth , growing trade and budget surpluses , very limited capital flight ( with a net positive capital account YTD ) , and no signs of substantial economic slow - down .
Contrast this with Estonia , Latvia or Turkey …or the UK !
While markets are often a bit irrational , we would be surprised to see them begin to defy the laws of gravity without reason .
At present , we simply do not know whether or not this was truly the onset of economic warfare ; we tend to distrust conspiracy theories , and would note the existence of several plausible counter - arguments …
T&B is frankly bewildered .
While we remain sceptical about the purported attack , we are at a loss to find any rational explanation for what we are seeing .

12 years later ... we 're playing Spore
With Spore , Will Wright intends to make you an Intergalactic ruler who begins life as a bottom - feeding primordial soup dweller .
When I first saw the game back in early 2006 , I wondered if Wright and his team over at Maxis would be able to pull this off ?
I did n't mean " pull it off " in the technical sense , but in the gaming sense of making it fun .
I 've waited a long time to see if Wright succeeded , and when my review copy arrived in the mail recently , I found out the answer .
There are whole worlds to explore , but will you want to ?
Spore is a game about evolution , but evolution that 's intelligently designed by the choices you make .
Players design their creatures ' traits , and those traits ultimately influence the civilization .
The game is segmented into five phases of the evolutionary scale : Cell , Creature , Tribal , Civilization , and Space , with each stage presenting a different kind of game - play ; a progress bar along the bottom of your screen marks how far along you are within each evolutionary stage .
This is a game that wants you to feel comfortable playing and exploring ; the penalty for " dying " is not severe .
At the outset of this review , I think it is only fair to mention that during the installation process , EA " highly suggested " that I allow the installation of the EA Downloader so Spore could stay " up - to - date . "
The message was a bit vague , but it implied that this was the only way patches and other content would be made available to me .
Since I already had the EA Downloader installed it was a non-issue , but this might be an area of contention for some .
This behavior is reminiscent of previous MMO games , and immediately it became apparent that Spore is more than a single - player experience .
Once logged in , you will be granted access to the game 's menu system and to EA 's network , which allows on - the - fly access to other user - created content .
I attempted to use the offline mode , but was unable to determine exactly how much my game would be affected .
Overall , the message was simple : play online , by EA 's rules , or several features could be unavailable .
And be very clear : this game is wrapped up in obnoxious DRM , and many gamers just plain do n't like it .
The graphics are n't amazing , but they certainly are attractive
Kicking the game off , I chose a colorful planet nestled in the galaxy of Spore and started at the beginning — the Cell Stage .
Already presented with choices , I had the option to select whether I wanted to be a Herbivore , Carnivore or Omnivore .
Being the type that would rather play a Renegade ( meat eater ) than a Paragon ( vegetarian ) in games like Mass Effect , I naturally went with carnivore .
It was time to discover what more than ten years of development time , and untold millions of dollars , had given to gaming .
Choose the right first letter and you could get less junk e-mail How much spam you get may depend on the first letter in your e-mail address , a study reveals .
The analysis , of more than 500 million junk messages , revealed those letters that get more junk than average .
It found that e-mail addresses starting with an " A " , " M " or " S " got more than 40 % spam .
By contrast those beginning with a " Q " or " Z " got about 20 % .
The difference could be down to the way spammers generate e-mail addresses they want to target , said the study .
Letter attack
The analysis was carried out by University of Cambridge computer scientist Dr Richard Clayton , in a bid to understand the widely noted discrepancies in the amounts of junk mail or spam that different people receive .
Dr Clayton took as his dataset the 550 million e-mail messages sent to customers of net service Demon between 1 February and 27 March 2008 .
Looking at the mix of messages landing in inboxes , Dr Clayton found a wide discrepancy in the amounts of junk that different addresses received which seemed to hinge on their initial letters .
The most popular letters for spammers were " A " , " M " , " S " , " R " and " P " . about 40 % of all the messages arriving in the e-mail inboxes of accounts with addresses that had one of those characters as their first letter were junk .
Much less popular were " Q " , " Z " and " Y " .
For these cases , spam was running at about 20 % or less .
The reason for the difference could be partly explained , said Dr Clayton , by the way that spammers generate e-mail addresses to which they then send junk messages .
Often , he said , they carry out so - called " dictionary " attacks .
In these , spammers take the part of a live e-mail address in front of the " @ " symbol that they know is live , and add that to other net domain names to generate a new one .
For instance , spammers who know that there is a real person attached to john@example.com may try john@another.com to see if that reaches a live account too .
As a result the relative abundance of names beginning with " M " compared to " Q " could explain some of the disparities , as spammers would be more likely to re-use popular names and send them more junk .
Dr Clayton said the research had thrown up some anomalies that needed further research .
For instance , he said , addresses starting with the letter " U " appear to get more than 50 % spam despite there being relatively few of them .

Li did not appear to know his victim , witnesses said A man accused of beheading a fellow bus passenger in Canada has pleaded " please kill me " , as he was asked by a judge if he wanted a lawyer .
Vince Weiguang
Li has been ordered by the court to undergo psychiatric tests .
Mr Li , 40 , is accused of second - degree murder after he allegedly stabbed and decapitated 22 - year - old Tim McLean on a Greyhound bus on 31 July .
A prosecutor told the court that Mr Li was seen eating pieces of his victim and had body parts found in his pocket .
Tuesday 's court hearing in Manitoba had earlier been adjourned to give Mr Li time to consult a lawyer .
Asked by the judge after the recess whether he wanted a lawyer , Mr Li was overheard by reporters and court officials saying " please kill me " .
Police have suggested no motive for the attack last Wednesday , which happened in front of terrified passengers as the bus travelled through a desolate stretch of Canada 's vast prairies .
They reported seeing Mr Li , a former church custodian , stab Mr McLean , who was sitting next to him , 50 or 60 times before cutting off his head .
Large knife Prosecutor Joyce Dalmyn revealed grisly details of the attack as she argued for a psychiatric evaluation for the accused .
He seemed like a person who was happy to have a job , was committed to doing it well and did n't stand out in any way
Tom Castor
Church pastor
She said Mr Li had severed the victim's head with a large knife and then carried it up and down the bus , brandishing it to passengers and taunting police .
He was also observed " cutting body parts from the victim and eating those body parts " , she said .
A plastic bag later found in his pocket by police contained his victim 's ear , nose and part of his mouth .
Ms Dalmyn said Mr Li had refused to leave the bus , shouting at police officers : " I have to stay on the bus forever . "
Witnesses have reported that Mr Li did not appear to know the sleeping victim and that the attack began without warning .
' No anger issues ' Mr Li , who emigrated to Canada from China four years ago , is being kept in custody in Portage la Prairie , Manitoba .
Church pastor Tom Castor , who helped hire Mr Li after he immigrated , told the AP news agency that the suspect never showed any sign of anger or emotional problems .
" He seemed like a person who was happy to have a job , was committed to doing it well and did n't stand out in any way ( in terms of ) having anger issues or having any other issues , " Castor was quoted as saying .
Mr Li was also vetted by church officials and his references were checked .
He did not have a criminal record and there did not appear to be any other signs of problematic or troubled past .
If evidence shows the attacker was mentally ill and did not understand what he was doing , criminal charges may not stand up , Fred Shane , a Manitoba forensic psychiatrist , told the Reuters news agency .
The judge ordered that Mr Li be sent for psychiatric evaluation before his next scheduled court appearance on 8 September .
Meanwhile , Reuters reports , the Greyhound bus company has been scrambling to remove all traces of an advertising campaign which used the slogan : " There 's a reason you 've never heard of bus rage . "
The campaign was supposed to have ended but a spokeswoman said some billboards had been found still in place .

The McCain camp has just sent word that the senator is suspending his campaign and returning to Washington to deal with the financial crisis .
McCain is also calling for a postponement of Friday night ’s debate and for Obama to suspend his campaign as well .
We have McCain ’s prepared remarks here .
Oddly , the cable news nets are now playing a recorded — not live — statement given by McCain himself announcing the suspension :
Late Update : The Obama camp initially sent out this statement from spokesperson Bill Burton in reaction to the McCain announcement :
At 8:30 this morning , Senator Obama called Senator McCain to ask him if he would join in issuing a joint statement outlining their shared principles and conditions for the Treasury proposal and urging Congress and the White House to act in a bipartisan manner to pass such a proposal .
At 2:30 this afternoon , Senator McCain returned Senator Obama ’s call and agreed to join him in issuing such a statement .
The two campaigns are currently working together on the details .
Later Update : The White House approves and , as if on cue , issues a statement :
Claim : College fills open faculty position through cynical job posting .
TRUE
Example : [ Collected on the Internet , 1990 ]
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY
Cape Girardeau , Missouri 63701 SOUTHEAST MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITYCape Girardeau , Missouri 63701
Enclosed is an announcement of a tenure - track position in philosophy at the rank of assistant professor .
We hope to fill this position rapidly ; the target date for our final decision is June 13 .
We are more interested in looking at candidates with real teaching experience than in newly minted Ph.D’s , who might have unrealistic expectations about the possibilities for academic growth at an institution such as ours .
Southeast Missouri State University is a regional university which serves students in the southeast portion of the state including St. Louis .
Our students tend to be poorly prepared for college level work , intellectually passive , interested primarily in partying , and culturally provincial in the extreme .
We offer a major in philosophy , but do not usually have more than two students officially declared as majors at any given time .
There are a few good students , however , and we are proud to say that our current graduating major , William Knorpp , won the 1985 Analysis competition and will be undertaking graduate study in philosophy at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill next year .
Mr. Knorpp ’s upper level work was mainly accomplished through independent tutorials ; and prospective candidate must understand that there will be virtually no opportunity to teach upper - division seminars in philosophy .
We also offer a religious studies minor ; most of the students who declare this minor are shocked to learn that Moses might not have written the Pentateuch and regard higher criticism as secular humanist propaganda .
The 12 hrs / semester teaching load is devoted mainly to general education courses at the freshman / sophomore level .
In another five years , if the general education curriculum is revised as promised , there may be seminars which are to “ capstone ” the G.E. program .
The academic environment at SEMO is distinctly non-intellectual — somewhat like a Norman Rockwell painting — and the candidate cannot expect to attract students by offering courses that assume innate curiosity about ideas and books , or intellectual playfulness , or independence of moral and political thought .
Nevertheless .
in order to earn promotion and tenure it is necessary to be involved in curriculum development and to sustain an interest in research and publication .
It has occurred to me that the best candidate would be someone who has held the Ph.D. for more than two years , has taught at a community college or a rural state institution , and who would like to continue in somewhat the same vein but at a slightly higher level .
I will be interviewing at the Central Division Meetings in St. Louis .
If you have an questions , you may call me at my office
Origins : Generally job postings are phrased in such a way as to make the positions offered sound as attractive as possible to prospective applicants ( just as applicants craft their resumes to make their qualifications sound as attractive as possible to prospective employers ) .
Occasionally , though , an employer admits up front that the advertised position may be less than ideal in some aspects in order to avoid wasting time interviewing a stream of applicants who immediately become disenchanted upon learning the details of the job , or to head off hiring employees who soon quit after finding out the job was n’t quite what they were
expecting .
The job posting quoted above , for the position of assistant professor of philosophy at Southeast Missouri State University ( SEMO ) , went a bit beyond the pale of truth in advertising with its frank admissions that the school ’s students were “ poorly prepared for college level work , intellectually passive , interested primarily in partying , and culturally provincial in the extreme , ” and could not be assumed to have “ innate curiosity about ideas and books , or intellectual playfulness , or independence of moral and political thought , ” while the philosophy department did “ not usually have more than two students officially declared as majors at any given time ” and offered the prospective candidate “ virtually no opportunity to teach upper- division seminars . ”
Although the job market for tenure - track positions in academia is so tight that even this brutally honest job posting would probably draw plenty of applicants , it was n’t intended as a genuine advertisement .
The text was written in a fit of frustration by SEMO ’s then - Chairman of the Department of Philosophy back in 1986 and posted to the Internet ( without his permission ) by someone else .
Nonetheless , this cynically - worded advertisement accomplished its goal , as the academic magazine Lingua Franca reported several years later :
Graduate school Deans regularly wring their hands over the miserable job market for new PhD’s .
And just as regularly they earnestly resolve to disclose the delicate fact that even if their students do get a job , it may well be at an obscure institution that bears little resemblance to a distinguished research university .
Graduate school Deans regularly wring their hands over the miserable job market for new PhD’s .
And just as regularly they earnestly resolve to disclose the delicate fact that even if their students do get a job , it may well be at an obscure institution that bears little resemblance to a distinguished research university .
Maybe there ’s a better way to break the bad news : honest job postings .
This April , for example an unusually frank search announcement popped up on the Internet .
The posting was so frank , in fact , that many net - browsers assumed it was a hoax .
Well , it ’s no hoax — but the position ’s already been filled , thank you .
In fact , it was filled nine years ago .
Hamner Hill , who was then a doctoral student in philosophy at Washington University , St. Louis , spied the posting on his department ’s bulletin board , and Southeast Missouri State hired him soon after .
“ I figured that whoever wrote this must be fun to work for , ” he says .
So how ’s it been working with Southeast Missouri ’s “ intellectually passive students ” ?
Do n’t feel sorry for Hill :
He ’s now the chair of the department , and says he ’s built the program into “ one of the prides of the school . ”
In fact , he boasts , “ we now have about twenty - five philosophy majors a year . ”
( One wonders how many are contemplating grad school . )
In 1995 this ad was resurrected when someone posted it to a philosophy discussion group ; from there it spread across the Internet and , even though SEMO had no such position open , again proved an effective advertisement .
H. Hamner Hill , now the department chair at SEMO , reported that his department received “ dozens of calls ” from interested applicants .

Learn how to make these Balloon Luminaries .
You will need :
High - Melt Paraffin Wax ( IGI 1260 )
Party Balloons
Double Boiler
Cookie Sheet
Instructions :
1 . Fill a balloon with tepid water .
2 . Melt your wax .
Optimum working temperature for this project is 180 degrees Fahrenheit .
Try to maintain this temperature for your wax while working by keeping it on a double boiler .
3 . Slowly dip your balloon into the wax to just below the water level in the balloon .
Warning :
Do not dip the balloon into the wax past the water level .
This could cause the balloon to pop .
4 . Hold the balloon in the wax for a few seconds , and then slowly lift it out of the wax .
Dip the balloon a few more times , allowing some time between dips to let the wax cool .
5 . While it is still quite warm , carefully set the balloon down onto a piece of paper or a cookie sheet , making sure it is level .
This will create a flat bottom for the luminary .
6 . Dip your balloon a few more times until it is the desired thickness .
A good target thickness is 1 /4 to 1 /2 of an inch .
7 . Set the balloon on the paper or cookie sheet again and let it cool .
8 . When the wax is completely cooled , hold the balloon over a sink or bucket , facing away from you .
Carefully pop the balloon with a skewer or knife and let the water drain out .
Throw away the balloon shards .
9 . To level the top of the luminary , heat a cookie sheet on the stove and place the luminary top - down onto the hot sheet and carefully melt the edges until it is level .
10 .
Place a tea light or votive inside the luminary and burn on a candle holder in a dark area .
Here is an example of these luminaries when using dye .

The political infrastructure for martial law in the U.S. is already in place .
Apparently unsure that the USAPATRIOT Act(s ) and the Military Commissions
Act were n’t strong enough , on May 9 , 2007 , Bush issued a document doubly titled “ National Security Presidential Directive / NSPD 51 ″ and “ Homeland Security Presidential Directive / HSPD - 20 . ”
This document supposedly outlines the federal government ’s plan for maintaining continuity in the face of a “ catastrophic emergency . ”
“ Catastrophic emergency ” is defined as “ any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government function . ”
So , pretty much anything …
In the event of this improbable catastrophe , this unconstitutional legislation by the executive grants itself supreme power to ensure the continuity of Constitutional government .
Good one .
In other words , NSPD 51 / HSPD - 20 would impose martial law under the authority of the White House through DHS .
It would suspend constitutional government under the provisions of Continuity in Government ( COG ) .
Since 2003 , following the invasion of Iraq , Homeland Security ( DHS ) has contemplated time and again the possibility of a so - called code red alert “ scenario ” — using a potential or possible Al Qaeda terrorist attack on American soil — as a pretext for implementing martial law .
At one time , Tommy Thompson Former Health and Human Services Secretary said that if we “ went to ” Code Red the entire civilian government would “ shut down . ”
There are no known provisions for returning America from Code Red status , once it is invoked .
Michel Chosudovsky in “ Bush Directive for a “ Catastrophic Emergency ” in America ” writes :
“ This Combined Directive NSPD /51 HSPD 20 grants unprecedented powers to the Presidency and the Department of Homeland Security , overriding the foundations of Constitutional government .
NSPD 51 allows the sitting president to declare a “ national emergency ” without Congressional approval
The adoption of NSPD 51 would lead to the de facto closing down of the Legislature and the militarization of justice and law enforcement :
The President shall lead the activities of the Federal Government for ensuring constitutional government .
In order to advise and assist the President in that function , the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counter terrorism ( APHS / CT ) is hereby designated as the National Continuity Coordinator .
The National Continuity Coordinator , in coordination with the Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs ( APNSA ) , without exercising directive authority , shall coordinate the development and implementation of continuity policy for executive departments and agencies .
The Continuity Policy Coordination Committee ( CPCC ) , chaired by a Senior Director from the Homeland Security Council staff , designated by the National Continuity Coordinator , shall be the main day - to - day forum for such policy coordination .
( National Security and Homeland Security Presidential Directive NSPD 51 / HSPD 20 , emphasis added )
NSPD 51 grants extraordinary Police State powers to the White House and Homeland Security ( DHS ) , in the event of a “ Catastrophic Emergency ” .
The Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Counter terrorism ( APHS / CT ) , who is slated to play a key role in the eventuality of Martial law , is a key White House adviser , Frances Fragos Townsend . ”
Of course , preparations for emergency management of the U.S. Government has by this time become a tradition here in the Homeland .
According to William M. Arkin in “ Shadow Government ” in the Case of a “ Second 9/11 : ”
“ Continuity programs began in the early 1950s , when the threat of nuclear war moved the administration of President Harry S. Truman to begin planning for emergency government functions and civil defense .
Evacuation bunkers were built , and an incredibly complex and secretive shadow government program was created .
At its height , the grand era of continuity boasted the fully operational Mount Weather , a civilian bunker built along the crest of Virginia ’s Blue Ridge , to which most agency heads would evacuate ; the Greenbrier hotel complex and bunker in West Virginia , where Congress would shelter ; and Raven Rock , or Site R , a national security bunker bored into granite along the Pennsylvania - Maryland border near Camp David , where the Joint Chiefs of Staff would command a protracted nuclear war .
Special communications networks were built , and evacuation and succession procedures were practiced continually .
When the Soviet Union crumbled , the program became a Cold War curiosity : Then - Defense Secretary Dick Cheney ordered Raven Rock into caretaker status in 1991 .
The Greenbrier bunker was shuttered and a 30 - year - old special access program was declassified three years later .
Then came the terrorist attacks of the mid-1990s and the looming Y2 K rollover , and suddenly continuity was n’t only for nuclear war anymore .
On Oct. 21 , 1998 , President Bill Clinton signed Presidential Decision Directive 67 , “ Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations . ”
No longer would only the very few elite leaders responsible for national security be covered .
Instead , every single government department and agency was directed to see to it that they could resume critical functions within 12 hours of a warning , and keep their operations running at emergency facilities for up to 30 days .
FEMA was put in charge of this broad new program .
On 9/11 , the program was put to the test — and failed .
Not on the national security side : Vice President Cheney and others in the national security leadership were smoothly whisked away from the capital following procedures overseen by the Pentagon and the White House Military Office .
But like the mass of Washingtonians , officials from other agencies found themselves virtually on their own , unsure of where to go or what to do , or whom to contact for the answers . ”
Continuity in Government programs have been one edge of the wedge to wrest control of the U.S. government away from Constitutional authority and put it in the hands of the secret teams under the direction of hidden interests .
The elite decision - makers behind this crypto - fascist coup obviously include big finance , military corporations , elements of intelligence , and interlocking corporations , and also have curious deep ties to the creation and sustenance of the State of Israel .
It ’s commonplace humor to refer to Dick Cheney ’s being in a “ secure location , ” but he and Donald Rumsfeld have been intimately involved in Continuity in Government ( COG ) since their days in Congress .
I ’ve read several articles on this connection , but was interested to find that I could find no reference to this , or to much at all about the ongoing development of COG programs since the onset of the cold war .
It ’s also interesting to note that in Arkin ’s excerpt above he notes that for most of Official Washington the COG measures in place failed to take account for them , serving instead only some short list of insiders .
This begins to make obvious just who this government serves .

But , as Sunday ’s contrast made clear , Obama still seems like a human being .
He still seems to return each night to some zone of normalcy where personal reflection lives .
He was n’t fully candid when answering questions about the Rev. Jeremiah Wright , but there are some inner guardrails that prevent the spin from drifting too far from the truth .
Thoughtful and conversational , he does n’t seem to possess the trait that Clinton has : automatically assuming that critics are always wrong .
Obama still possesses his talent for homeostasis , the ability to return to emotional balance and calm , even amid hysteria .
His astounding composure has come across as weakness in the midst of combat with Clinton , but it ’s also at the core of his promise to change politics .
He vows to calm hatred and heal division .
This contrast between combat and composure defines the Democratic race .
The implicit Clinton argument is that politics is an inherently nasty business .
Human nature , as she said Sunday , means that progress comes only through conquest .
You ’d better elect a leader who can intimidate .
You ’d better elect someone who has given herself permission to be brutal .
Obama ’s campaign grows out of the longstanding reform tradition .
His implicit argument is that politics does n’t have to be this way .
Dishonesty and brutality are n’t inevitable ; they ’re what gets in the way .
Obama ’s friend and supporter Cass Sunstein described the Obama ideal in The New Republic : “ Obama believes that real change usually requires consensus , learning and accommodation . ”
That ’s regarded as naïve drivel in parts of Camp Clinton .
Campaign issues come and go , but this is a thread running through the race .
One believes in the raw assertion of power , the other the power of communication .
They are imperfect messengers for their creeds .
Clinton rails against “ Wall Street money brokers , ” but her policies are often drawn from the Wall Street wing of the party .
Obama talks about postpartisan compromise in the abstract , but rarely in the particular .
Still , amid the storms of the presidency , their basic worldviews would shape their presidencies .
Obama is instinctively a conversationalist and community - mobilizer .
Clinton , as she says , will fight and fight .
If elected , she ’ll have the power to take the Hobbesian struggle she perceives , and turn it into remorseless reality .
Travelby bubble might seem more appropriate for witches in Oz , but two physicistssuggest that a future spaceship could fold a space - time bubble around itself totravel faster than the speed of light .
We 'retalking about the very distant future , of course .
Theidea involves manipulating dark energy — the mysterious force behind theuniverse 's ongoing expansion — to propel a spaceship forward without breaking the laws of physics .
? Think of itlike a surfer riding a wave , ? said Gerald Cleaver , a physicist at BaylorUniversity .
?
The ship would be pushed by the spatial bubble and the bubblewould be traveling faster than the speed of light .?
In theory , the universe grew fasterthan the speed of light for a very short time after the Big Bang , driven bythe dark energy that represents about 74 percent of the total mass - energybudget in the universe .
Dark matter constitutes 22 percent of the budget , andnormal matter ( stars , planets and everything you see ) makes up the remaining 4 percent or so .
Strange asit sounds , current evidence supports the notion that the fabric of space - timecan expand faster than the speed of light , because the reality in which lighttravels is itself expanding .
Cleaver and Richard Obousy , a Baylor graduate student , tapped the latest idea in stringtheory to devise how to manipulate darkenergy and accelerate a spaceship .
Their notion is based on the Alcubierredrive , which proposes expanding space - time behind the spaceship while alsoshrinking space - time in front .
Stringtheorists had believed that a total of 10 dimensions exist , including height , width , length and time .
The other six dimensions exist largely as unknowns , buteverything is based on hypothetical one - dimensional strings .
A newer theory , called M- theory , suggests that those strings all vibrate in yet anotherdimension .
Manipulatingthat additional dimension would alter dark energy in terms of height , width , and length , Cleaver and Obousy theorize .
Such a capability would permit the alteringof space - time for a spaceship , taking advantage of dark energy 's effect onthe universe .
" Thedark energy is simultaneously decreased just in front of the ship to decrease ( and bring to a stop ) the expansion rate of the universe in front of theship , " Cleaver told SPACE.com .
" If the dark energy can be madenegative directly in front of the ship , then space in front of the ship wouldlocally contract . "
Thisloophole means that the spaceship would not conflict with Einstein 's Theory ofRelativity , which states that objects accelerating to the speed of lightrequire an infinite amount of energy .
However , the Baylor physicists estimate that manipulating dark energy through the extradimension requires energy equivalent to the converting the entire mass of Jupiter into pure energy — enough to move a ship measuring roughly 33 feet ( 10 meters ) by 33 feet by 33 feet .
? That is anenormous amount of energy , ?
Cleaver said .
?
We are still a very long ways offbefore we could create something to harness that type of energy .?
The workaroundsolution may leave fans of Einstein pleased .
But for now , faster - than - lighttravel remains , like Oz , a pleasantfantasy .
Walk into a polling station in Belford Roxo , an impoverished city on the fringes of Rio de Janiero , on October 5 and you will be faced with an historic choice .
You could vote for Alcides Rolim , the Workers ' Party mayoral candidate promising a " city for all " or Elizeu Pitorra , a local communist who believes it is " time for a change " .
Most voters , however , will probably opt for Barack Obama , a 39 - year - old Brazilian who , until recently , was known as Claudio Henrique dos Anjos .
Welcome to Obama - mania , Brazil - style .
Few countries have embraced the idea of the US 's first black president as enthusiastically as Brazil , a country with one of the largest Afro- descendant populations on Earth yet where black faces remain a minority in politics .
Obama T - shirts are everywhere while chat shows and newspaper columns are filled with talk of the 47 - year - old Illinois senator .
Now even Brazil 's politicians are lining up for their piece of the pie .
Due to a quirk of Brazilian law , candidates are allowed to run under the name of their choice .
As a result , at least six Brazilian politicians have officially renamed themselves " Barack Obama " in a bid to get an edge over their rivals in October 's municipal elections .
" In truth it was an accident , " says Belford Roxo 's Obama , an IT consultant who is bidding to become the city 's first black mayor .
" I 'd been on the television wearing a suit and people thought I looked a bit like him so they started calling me Barack Obama .
They 'd see me in the street and shout : ' Hey ! Barack ! "
So I decided to register it . "
Like his illustrious American counterpart , who has relatives in Kenya , Brazil 's Obama also has one foot in Africa .
His grandfather was the descendant of slaves .
He admits he has also been looking to his namesake 's speeches for inspiration .
" I say the same things .
I talk about political renewal , change , about transforming the city . "
Despite their similarities the two Obamas have yet to meet although the Brazilian Obama says that as mayor he would " extend an invitation " to the real Obama to dine in Belford Roxo .
" It would be great if he could come and see our reality , " he beams .
" Just imagine . "
SEOUL , South Korea ( CNN ) --
Police in South Korea have arrested 26 blind masseurs who were threatening to jump from a bridge to protest a government decision they say will rob them of their livelihood .
Some of the men set fire to a car and two jumped off the bridge into Seoul 's Han river , the country 's national news agency Yonhap said on Thursday .
No injuries were reported .
The South Korean health ministry recently decided to grant licenses to sighted masseurs and masseuses to practice certain kinds of massages .
Since 1963 , the law allowed only blind people to practice the profession , Yonhap said .
The protesters said the new policy puts their jobs at risk .
There are about 15,000 licensed masseurs in the country , which has a blind population of 216,000 .
" Medical massage is almost the only profession that is open to the blind people .
The ministry 's decision is threatening our right to live , " Shim Wook - seop , one of the protesting masseurs , was quoted as saying .
Another blind masseur , Dong Seong - geun , staged a lone protest in front of the Constitutional Court recently .
" I have a wife and two children to support , " he told the New York Times .
" If I lose this job , I will have to beg on the streets .
How can taking away one job from people who only have one compare with taking one job away from sighted people who have a hundred jobs to choose from ? "
The country 's Constitutional Court is expected to rule soon on an appeal filed by several sighted people who argued that the profession cannot be the exclusive domain of the blind .
The Massager Association of Korea , representing 120,000 unlicensed masseurs who are working openly and in defiance of the law , is leading the legal challenge .
The association keeps a file of members accused of practicing without a license .
Those people are usually fined between $ 450 to $ 4,500 , although the law calls for up to three years in prison .
" It breaks my heart when I think that what I am doing every day , what I consider my calling , is a crime , " Park Yoon - soo , president of the association , told the NYT .
" We are not trying to steal jobs from the blind .
We just want to share the market .
We want to live as normal citizens , not as criminals . "
South Carolina Democratic chairwoman Carol Fowler sharply attacked Sarah Palin today , saying John McCain had chosen a running mate " whose primary qualification seems to be that she has n’t had an abortion . ”
Palin is an opponent of abortion rights and gave birth to her fifth child , Trig , earlier this year after finding out during her pregnancy that the baby had Down syndrome .
Fowler told my colleague Alex Burns in an interview that the selection of an opponent of abortion rights would not boost McCain among many women .
“ Among Democratic women and even among independent women , I do n’t think it helped him , ” she said .
Told of McCain 's boost in the new ABC / Washington Post among white women following the Palin pick , Fowler said : " Just anecdotally , I believe that those white women are Republican women anyway . "
UPDATE -- Carol
Fowler releases a statement of apology : " I personally admire and respect the difficult choices that women make everyday , and I apologize to anyone who finds my comment offensive .
I clumsily was making a point about people in South Carolina who may vote based on a single issue .
Whether it ’s the environment , the economy , the war or a woman ’s right to choose , there are people who will cast their vote based on a single issue .
That was the only point I was attempting to make . "

Conyers investigating Suskind allegations
Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers ( D - Mich . ) is taking very seriously allegations made in Ron Suskind ’s new book , The Way of the World , that the administration forged documents to create the impression of a link between al Qaeda and Iraq in order to justify the invasion .
Conyers posted letters to six current and former administration officials today , asking them to contact his committee staff as part of an investigation into the allegations .
Those on the receiving end of the Conyers requests :
I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libber -- who is referred to as " Lewis I. Libby " in Conyers ' letter -- was chief of staff to Vice President Cheney .
Suskind alleges that the order for the forgery was initiated in the vice president ’s office .
George Tenet , then - head of the CIA .
Rob Richer , former CIA deputy director of clandestine operations and chief of the Near East Division .
Suskind alleges Richer was tasked by tenet to produce the letter .
John Maguire was allegedly briefed by Richer and told to execute the letter and disseminate it in Baghdad .
A.B. “ Buzzy ” Krongard was said to have “ expressed concern ” about the letter .
John Hannah , assistant to the vice present for National Security Affairs , got a letter by virtue of his employment with the vice president .
will be remembered for Rourke ’s performance in Darren Aronofsky ’s “ “ , which the actor and critics agree is his best yet .
“ The Wrestler ” won the covetedaward for best movie on Saturday .
“ came here a couple of years ago and fell on his ass , ” told a packed Sala Grande crowd after the award was announced , referring to Aronofsky ’s “ The Fountain , ” which flopped in Venice in 2006 .
“ I ’m glad he had the balls to come back .
I do n’t think he wanted to come back but I told him , “ You have to come back ’ and he did .
” The award seals his comeback from the Hollywood wilderness , and comments that Rourke is ready to ditch his bad - boy image and cooperate with directors suggest there is more to come .
“ A guy like me changes hard , I did n’t want to change , but I had to change , ” the star of 1980s hits “ 9 - 1/2 Weeks ” and “ Angel Heart ” told in an interview in Venice .
There was controversy at Saturday ’s closing ceremony when jury president Wim Wenders criticized rules which prevent the Golden Lion winner also picking up best acting prizes , suggesting Rourke should have won that too .
Thefor best director was won by Russia ’ sfor “ “ , set on the windswept steppes of Kazakhstan and centring on the 1960s Soviet space program .
The best actor prize went tofor his acclaimed portrayal of an overprotective father in “ ” ( Giovanna ’s Father ) .
The best actress prize went to France ’sin “ ” ( The Other One ) , a haunting tale of a woman who becomes dangerously obsessed with a young ex-boyfriend . “ “ , by Ethiopian director , picked up two prizes , the special jury award and best screenplay .

The waters off Somalia are among the most dangerous in the world A Ukrainian ship seized by pirates off the coast of Somalia was carrying 33 tanks and other weapons , the Ukrainian defence minister has confirmed .
Earlier , the country 's foreign ministry said the ship had a crew of 21 and was sailing under a Belize flag to the Kenyan port of Mombasa .
There has been a recent surge in piracy off the coast of Somalia .
Russia announced on Friday it would start carrying out regular anti-piracy patrols in the waters off Somalia .
A navy spokesman said a warship had been sent to the area earlier this week to protect Russian citizens and ships .
Somalia has not had an effective national government for 17 years , leading to a collapse of law and order both on land and at sea .
Somali pirates are currently holding more than a dozen hijacked ships in Eyl , a town in the semi-autonomous region of Puntland .
Senior UN officials estimate the ransoms pirates earn from hijacking ships exceed $ 100 m ( £ 54 m ) a year .
Speed boats
It was not immediately clear where the Ukrainian ship had been taken .
The Ukrainian foreign ministry said the captain of the Faina cargo ship had reported being surrounded by three boats of armed men on Thursday afternoon .
Defence Minister Yury Yekhanurov confirmed that 33 Russian T - 72 tanks and " a substantial quantity of ammunition " were aboard .
He said all the weapons had been sold in compliance with international agreements .
Battles and looting in Mogadishu Life in Somalia 's pirate town Earlier reports suggested that the cargo was destined for south Sudan , however Kenyan government spokesman Alfred Mutua confirmed that the tanks were going to Kenya .
" The cargo in the ship includes military hardware such as tanks and an assortment of spare parts for use by different branches of the Kenyan military , " he said .
Security analyst Knox Chitiyo told the BBC that the incident showed that the waters off Somalia 's coast had become a " global security problem " .
" Piracy has become big business and there seems to be no concerted response to the problem , " said Mr Chitiyo , from the London - based Royal United Services Institute .
Last week , France circulated a draft UN resolution urging states to deploy naval vessels and aircraft to combat piracy in the area .
France has intervened twice to free French sailors kidnapped by pirates .
Commandos freed two people whose boat was hijacked in the Gulf of Aden earlier this month .
After an earlier raid in April , six arrested pirates were handed over to the French authorities for trial .
International navies have been escorting humanitarian deliveries to Somalia , where a third of the population needs food aid .
Flourishing industry Pirates have seized dozens of ships from the major shipping routes near Somalia 's coast in recent months .
Pirate " mother ships " travel far out to sea and launch smaller boats to attack passing vessels , sometimes using rocket - propelled grenades ( RPGs ) .
International navies have been escorting aid deliveries Authorities in Somalia 's semi-autonomous region of Puntland say they are powerless to confront the pirates , who have been growing in strength .
In Eyl , where ships are held for ransom , a flourishing local industry has developed .
Insurgents in Somalia , not known to have links to the pirates , are currently battling a combination of government troops , their Ethiopian allies and African Union peacekeepers in Mogadishu and other parts of southern Somalia .
The US has an anti-terror task force based in neighbouring Djibouti and has carried out several air strikes against the Islamic insurgents , accusing them of sheltering al - Qaeda operatives .

WREL could mean batteries being recharged within a couple of feet Say goodbye to the tangle of cables and the wall socket and hello to powering up your electronic gizmos wirelessly .
This picture of a world without wires is one long dreamed of and came a step closer following significant progress made by Intel .
It said it has increased the efficiency of a technique for wirelessly powering consumer gadgets and computers .
" The notion of disappearing energy sources is a powerful one , " Justin Rattner , Intel technology boss , told the BBC .
" Would n't it be fantastic if we did n't think about where the power was coming from and the power was everywhere ? " he said .
" No cords , no batteries anymore . "
Mr Rattner envisaged a scenario where a laptop 's battery could be recharged when the machine gets within several feet of a transmit resonator which could be embedded in tables , work surfaces , picture frames and even behind walls .
Intel 's technology relies on an idea called magnetic induction .
It is a principle similar to the way a trained singer can shatter a glass using their voice ; the glass absorbs acoustic energy at its natural frequency .
At the wall socket , power is put into magnetic fields at a transmitting resonator - basically an antenna .
The receiving resonator is tuned to efficiently absorb energy from the magnetic field , whereas nearby objects do not .
Light bulb moment Intel 's demonstration has built on work done originally by Marin Soljacic , a physicist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) .
At the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco , researcher Alanson Sample showed how to make a 60 - watt light bulb glow from an energy source three feet away .
WREL wastes scarcely more electricity than some computer power supplies
This was achieved with relatively high efficiency , only losing a quarter of the energy it started with .
In early experiments the MIT team lit their light bulb from seven feet away with larger charging coils and scoring an efficiency rate of between 40 - 45 % .
This meant most of the energy did not make it to the light bulb .
MIT has since improved its system to 90 % efficiency at the three feet range .
' World changing '
Intel has called the system WREL , a wireless resonant energy link while MIT named it WiTricity - a combination of wireless and electricity .
Professor Soljacic , who does not work with Intel , said he was nonetheless pleased that the world 's biggest computer chip maker is getting behind the technology .
He told the AP news wire " For me it 's like a confirmation that it 's so exciting .
It 's something people would like to have .
Intel hopes its WREL technology will cut the last link to the power cord " Now the question is if it 's feasible or not .
It 's exciting that they 're also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day . "
Intel researcher Mr Sample told the BBC , " The next stage we are thinking about is to wirelessly recharge devices like laptops and cell phones so we are shrinking the size of the coils down to the size of laptops .
" The coils would be embedded in a monitor or a picture frame or desk .
It 's really compelling for the mobile device where you would be able to recharge your device as you enter one of these areas . "
" This is a potentially world changing event , " said analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group .
" This is the closest we 've had to something being commercially available in this class . "
Mr Rattner admitted the technology is at least five years away , if not more , of becoming a reality .

Last week the fourth season of Prison Break aired in the US with over 6 million viewers on TV .
On BitTorrent the season premiere was downloaded more than 2 million times this week .
The majority of the downloads go to Europe though .
Poland alone is responsible for 12 % , compared to only 4 % US downloads .
Last week we reported that the season premiere of Fox ’s Prison Break was downloaded more than a million times just a day after it was aired on TV .
Fox , which offers a free and legit Prison Break stream on Fox.com for US viewers , thinks that most downloads come from overseas , where the episodes have n’t aired yet , let alone that it can be streamed online .
It turns out that Fox ’s assumption is right .
We decided to look into the download locations of one of the most popular Prison Break torrents and found that , based on a sample of more than 250,000 downloads , most downloaders are located in Europe .
In our sample , which represents approximately 10 % of the total downloads this week , the show was most downloaded in Poland ( 12 % ) .
UK and France were in second and third place respectively , followed by Canada and The Netherlands .
The US was sixth in the list with only 4 % of the total downloads , and Greece , Spain , Australia and Brazil complete the top 10 .
As we have said before , availability seems to the key issue why people turn to BitTorrent .
Non-US Prison
Break fans sometimes have to wait for weeks or even months before the show airs on TV in their country , and many of them are not that patient , or willing to torture themselves .
Until this problem is addressed , we ’re not likely to see a decrease in TV - show downloads from BitTorrent .
The 4 % US downloaders that preferred to get the show via BitTorrent instead of streaming it online probably did so because they wanted to watch it on their TV or get a higher quality copy – streaming is n’t all that .
Both Fox and Hulu , the two sites that offer Prison Break streams have not published any numbers , so it ’s hard to compare the number of US downloaders ( ~100.000 ) with the US streamers .
We do have a new TV - torrent download chart , with plenty of newcomers .
So , let ’s take a look at the 10 most downloaded shows this week .
The data for the weekly download chart is collected by TorrentFreak from a representative sample of BitTorrent sites and is for informational and educational reference only .

Will be right back ...
Thank you for your patience .
Our engineers are working quickly to resolve the issue .
Sit for the web , code , startups , and all that jazz
In terms of the average person , $ 1 Billion is an amount that he will not accumulate in his lifetime , or even ten lifetimes .
However , to the government , $ 1 Billion , is a small amount and is only a fraction of some spending bills .
There has been talk recently about a proposed $ 700 Billion bailout of Wall Street ; yet , little to no talk about the $ 630 Billion spending bill passed , in the House , Wednesday night by a margin of 370 - 58 .
This massive bill flew by virtually under the radar of the mainstream .
This bill included 2,322 earmarks totalling $ 6.6 Billion ; with the majority of the earmarks going to the district's of Congressional leaders .
If we add this to other LARGE spending bills , $ 300 Billion to baliout “ home - owners ” with bad mortages , $ 70 Billion to fund troops in Iraq & Afghanistan , plus a proposed $ 700 Billion Wall Street Bailout , we get $ 1.67 Trillion .
Some of this will go towards the nearly $ 10 Trillion debt that the US Government currently has , and according to Downsize DC , there are $ 53.3 Trillion in unfunded liablilities .
So , we may at some date in the future have a $ 100 Trillion debt and 1 billion will be just another number , like 1 , 5 or 20 .
These guidelines are compiled from the successfully married and from experts on psychology , divorce and finance :
TALK AND SHARE GOALS
Before walking down the aisle , couples should have a talk about their financial health and goals .
They should ask each other tough questions :
Do we want children ?
When ?
Who will care for them ?
Will they go to public or private school ?
What kind of life do we want ?
When will we retire ?
“ In my ideal plan for couples , they would have a meeting every week on their finances , ” said Karen Altfest , a financial planner who runs the New York firm L. J. Altfest & Company , with her husband , Lewis .
“ That way , they are in sync with each other ’s goals . ”
Set those goals together .
Jerry Ballard , 58 , a former insurance executive in Houston , said that he and his wife of 36 years , Susan , also 58 , managed to avoid money clashes because they share a savings philosophy .
“ The cardinal rule was that we do n’t interrupt our savings , ” he said , adding that they saved between 10 and 20 percent of their salaries each year .
As long as they did that , they were less likely to disagree about spending .

Eric Gundlach , 53 , of Owings Mills , Md. , who has been married for 29 years , said he and his wife , Ann -Michele , “ made our expectations explicit . ”
These included sending their son to private school and having big experiences , like traveling , in lieu of purchasing things .
RUN A HOME LIKE A BUSINESS
Make a budget and keep track of earnings , expenses and debts .
And structure your business as a partnership ; when it comes to making big financial decisions and setting goals , do it together .
“ When they are making the decisions together , they really have ownership of those decisions and any results of those decisions , ” said Mary Ann Sisco , national wealth adviser at JPMorgan ’s private wealth management division .
“ Even if you have negative results , you tend to weather the storm better . ”
Share responsibilities , too .
Though one partner tends to control the finances , advisers recommend rotating tasks .
One person should handle investments for a certain period , while the other pays the bills ; rotate and repeat .
One Company 's Way of Fighting Global Warming : Transforming CO2 Into Useful Products
August 26th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) is currently the most common solution proposed for reducing CO2 emissions .
But surely there must be an alternative to just burying the greenhouse gas .
California - based Carbon Sciences thinks the answer to our CO2 problem is calcium carbonate — specifically , the company has invented a process to convert CO2 into calcium carbonate that can be used in everything from cosmetics to ceramics .
The transformation process works by using waste mineral products from mining operations — also known as tailings — as a feedstock to transform CO2 into mineral carbonates .
The particles are processed into fine mineral particulates to maximize available surface area for reacting with CO2 .
The process can use CO2 that has already been buried by CCS as a “ seed ” for transformation .
And getting the CO2 out of the ground may actually be the safest thing we can do .
While CCS is a useful way to take greenhouse gases out of the air , it has notable flaws .
According to Carbon Sciences CEO Derek McLeish , an earthquake could release buried CO2 in a matter of seconds .
“ There ’s an infinite timeline when you bury CO2 , ” said McLeish .
“ Transforming CO2 into a high value product is much more like recycling . ”
Additionally , the commercial value of the product offsets the cost of traditional CCS .
Carbon Sciences plans to have a mini pilot plant ready in 24 to 36 months .
And the company wants to move quickly from there .
“ We ’ll be developing relationships and business opportunities the second we get through the mini pilot plant phase , ” said McLeish .
If Carbon Sciences is successful , maybe we ’ll be casually toting around CO2 - derived products in our bags instead of hoping that a major quake does n’t blow the stuff out of the ground .

Introduction and Specifications
We have explained in numerous articles in the past that the bulk of GPU sales are made in the form of ether IGPs ( Integrated Graphics Processors ) or affordable , mainstream graphics cards .
As powerful and exciting as the ATI Radeon HD 4870 X2 or GeForce GTX 280 cards may be , AMD and NVIDIA simply do n't sell as many flagship products as they do mainstream cards .
It is because of this fact that both companies consistently refresh their mainstream offerings every few months or so , and continually push new features and performance down their respective product lines .
As many of you may have expected , since AMD recently released the RV770 GPU , which is the foundation of the Radeon HD 4800 series , a new mainstream offering was obviously in the works .
And today , we can finally show that card to you .
AMD is releasing a new salvo of mainstream graphics cards that should fall in the sub - $ 80 price segment , dubbed the Radeon HD 4670 .
The GPU at the heart of the 4670 is based on the RV770 architecture used on the Radeon HD 4800 series , sans a few stream processors , ROPs , and other assorted elements , but with what is essentially the same feature set as its more expensive counterparts .
We 've got a couple of these new cards on hand and plan to show you what they 're capable of on the pages ahead .
After reading , you may be surprised by what 80 bucks can get you these days ...

Since we 've covered essentially all of the shared features of the Radeon HD 4800 and 4600 series cards before , we wo n't be going into them in depth again here .
However , we would recommend taking a look at a few recent articles to brush up on the tech , if you 're so inclined .
Reading the articles above will lay the groundwork for much of what we 'll be showing you on the pages ahead .
Because the new Radeon HD 4670 shares the same core architecture as the cards in the Radeon HD 4800 series , with some elements pared down to reduce die size , they have basically the same feature set and capabilities but differentiate in terms of performance .
What is Subversion ?
Overview
Subversion is a version control system that makes it easy to get the latest version of files , or go back to previous versions .
It is used by many different pieces of open source software and has been around since 2000 .
Subversion is considered the successor to the Concurrent Versions System .
To put it in layman ’s terms , say you were running a Subversion server and your resume was checked into it when you first created it .
Years later , if you have maintained your Subversion repository , you could go back and look at all of the changes you have ever made to your resume .
This is great for programmers , as we can track changes that we , and other people have made to our code over time , permitting us to revert back to those previous versions .
Or if we are running a Subversion repository , we can push out our changes to all those on the web that use our software .
Where to find Subversion
Subversion is available for every major operating system , allowing you to connect to a Subversion server that is running Linux from a client computer running Windows or Mac OS X , and vice - versa .
If you have a server running Debian or Ubuntu , installing the Subversion server is as simple as running apt - get install subversion from the command line ( you might have to run the command with the sudo prefix like , sudo apt - get install subversion , if you do n’t have root level access ) .
From a Fedora based Linux distro , you should be able to easily add Subversion server using Yum by typing in yum install subversion .
For other operating systems , I suggest checking out the list of packages on the Tigris website .
As for the client side , Tigris also maintains a list of great clients for nearly every operating system .
I have used TortoiseSVN on my Windows computer , and found it very easy to use and understand .
WordPress and Subversion
The folks that manage and distribute WordPress , Automattic Inc. , currently run a Subversion server that we can connect to .
It allows us to easily download the bleeding edge version of WordPress , the latest stable edition of WordPress , or even older releases of the CMS if we so choose .
In order to use Subversion with your web host , they must have Subversion properly installed on the web host ’s server .
Most shared hosting environments do n’t provide access to Subversion , as it can only be utilized through SSH , a remote command line interface .
If you are on a virtual private server ( VPS ) , or your own dedicated server , you should have SSH access , and be able to install Subversion .
Note : Before installing any version of WordPress using Subversion , make sure to create a database for the install and write down the important details to use later in the wp - config .
php file .
Automattic has released a small guide on getting WordPress using Subversion on the WordPress.org download using Subversion page , but unfortunately , like most tutorials , it only mentions how to download and install the Trunk version of WordPress .
Note : Another rarely mentioned caveat in using Subversion is that the files that Subversion downloads to your web hosting space are given the user and group of whatever user you happen to be logged in as .
If you are connected via SSH under the user root , then all files that you are downloading will be associated with the user and group of root .
This is not a good thing , and should be changed to the user and group relevant to the installation you are doing .
Usually , it will be related to the domain name that you are installing WordPress in .
For example , if the domain was subversionrocks.com , the user related to that account might be the first eight characters , or subversi in this case .
If you do n’t know the user and group that your files should be in , please contact your server administrator .
To change the files , use the chown and chgrp commands when connected to your web host via SSH .
If these are confusing , then please make sure you are connected using the correct user account for the domain you are installing WordPress on .
Why Upgrade WordPress with Subversion ?
With all of the interesting ways you can upgrade WordPress , why would anyone choose to use Subversion ?
Well , for me it was a simple choice , as I was managing upwards of fifty blogs at any one time , and so going through the process of upgrading them one at a time through FTP or even Fantastico would have been a long and boring process .
So for me , Subversion made upgrading a quick and simple event rather than a multi-day chore .
Once set up correctly , there is very little you can do that will cause a mistake to be made .
I am forever hearing complaints of FTP software not replacing files or only partially transferring files , something that has never occurred to me while using Subversion .
Also , I like the security of getting the files right from the source , Automattic ’s Subversion repository .
The final thing that drew me to using Subversion when managing my WordPress blogs was that I would get the latest version of Akismet downloaded with it , something that I was n’t getting when I was using FTP to transfer the files , as I never uploaded the wp- content folder included with newer versions of WordPress for fear of having something break .
Downloading Trunk
Trunk is the latest , bleeding edge of WordPress , updated constantly .
Those running the Trunk version of WordPress are mostly testers and code contributors .
I would n’t recommend that most people run this version as it can contain errors , and result in data loss .
If you want to test out the latest version of WordPress , it is fairly easy .
Connect to your web host using SSH .
On Windows , I use a program called Putty .
From my Mac , I use Terminal .
Once connected , go to the directory that you want to install the Trunk version of WordPress in .
To change directories , type cd directoryname .
If you do n’t know what directory you are in , type pwd ( print working directory ) .
When you have moved yourself to the directory you want to have the files downloaded to , type :
svn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/trunk .
The period at the end is important , as it tells Subversion that you want the files to go “ here ” .
Press Enter / Return , and it should begin to download the Trunk version of WordPress to your current folder .
Now you just need to create and edit the wp - config .
php file with the correct database information and WordPress is ready to install .
Using your favorite web browser , go to where you installed WordPress , and it should run you through the normal quick install to name your blog , and provide an e-mail address .
Once that is complete , you have installed the very latest version of WordPress .
Upgrading :
Over the course of days , weeks , months and even years , the WordPress trunk will continue to change .
To upgrade to the latest version , you only need to type svn up from the SSH command line while in the folder where WordPress is installed .
Downloading Latest Stable Version for a New Blog
The Stable version of WordPress is as its name implies : stable .
It is the final packaged release that Automattic and the WordPress development team have released to the world .
It is given a set version number and can be found on the download page in a packaged form .
Usually , they have most of the bugs worked out and new features finalized .
The stable versions are considered ready for mass consumption , and you should n’t experience any major glitches or data loss from the stable releases .
To find out what the latest version is , you only need to look at the download section of WordPress.org , or jump over to WordPress Trac .
Under the tags section , you can easily see which version is the newest by scrolling to the bottom .
Once you have written the version number down and created the database you are going to use , connect to your web host using SSH .
Once connected , go to the directory that you want to install the latest stable version of WordPress .
When you have moved yourself to the directory you want to have the files downloaded to , type :
svn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/xxx . – Replace the xxx at the end with the latest version number .
For example , WordPress 2.6 is currently the latest version , so we would enter :
svn co http://svn.automattic.com/wordpress/tags/2.6 .
And again , the period at the end is important .
From here , it is the same as the instructions for installing Trunk .
You need to edit the wp - config .
php file , and then using your web browser , go to the site , and go through the installation process .
Switching an Established Blog to Subversion
So this is the first time you have heard about Subversion being used to quickly and easily upgrade your blog , but you ’ve been blogging for months .
How can you switch your established blog to use Subversion ?
Well , if you tried to run any of the commands above , you were probably met with errors letting you know there were already files in the way , and so Subversion could n’t do its magic , but there is a way to move your blog to using Subversion .
First , upgrade your current blog using FTP , or whatever other method you choose to the latest stable version of WordPress .
Then , log in using SSH , and browse to your current blog .
Go up one folder using the command cd .. in the terminal window .
Next , create a directory using mkdir .
I usually make a directory called public_html_new .
mkdir public_html_new
Now browse into that directory , and using the instructions above , install the version latest stable version of WordPress using Subversion .
Once that is complete , copy your wp - config .
php file from your old blog in the regular public_html folder to the public_html_new folder .
This will allow your Subversion controlled blog to access your current blog ’s database .
Next copy your wp - content folder from the old public_html folder to the public_html_new folder .
This will give your new Subversion controlled blog all of your plugins , images , and themes .
Lastly , rename your public_html folder to public_html_old and then rename your public_html_new folder to just public_html .
Check to see if your blog is working , and if so , you are most likely seeing your blog , now being version managed by Subversion .
Switching from One Stable Version to the Next
New versions of WordPress will continue to come out , and when running WordPress off the stable versions , it is n’t as easy as typing in the svn up command that you are able to use when running off of Trunk .
You need to tell Subversion to switch from one stable version to another .
You will need to use the Subversion switch command .
Simply log into your web host using SSH , and browse to the blog you want to update .
In the command line interface , enter :
svn sw http://svn.automattic.com/tags/xxx with the xxx being the version you want to switch to .
For example , if you were going to be moving from WordPress 2.6 to WordPress 2.7 , you would type :
svn sw http://svn.automattic.com/tags/2.7
It should then start downloading all files pertaining to WordPress 2.7 .
Once this is complete , browse to the site using your favourite web browser , and you will most likely see an upgrade screen .
Click upgrade , and if there are n’t any problems , you will have successfully upgraded your WordPress blog from one stable version to another .
And if you are worried about what the Subversion commands should look like when they are working right , here is a quick video showing both a SVN check out command , and a SVN switch command , as well as their results .

Just how bad it is Bell Canada 's P2P traffic filtering ?
Not bad at all , so long as you 're happy having your 5 M bps DSL link operate at half the speed of a dial - up modem .
That 's the assertion of a group of small Canadian ISPs that are asking Canada 's telecoms regulator to intervene and force Bell to call off its deep packet inspection dogs .
Half the speed of dial - up
The Canadian Association Internet Providers ( CAIP ) represents smaller firms that generally purchase wholesale capacity from Bell Canada and resell it under their own brand .
When Bell applied its filtering system to this wholesale traffic earlier this year , the operators were outraged , especially as several of them explicitly offered " no throttle " guarantees to customers that they now could not keep .
In documents filed late last week with the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) , CAIP provided evidence showing that the traffic - shaping system used by Bell limits downstream P2P rates to around 30 K bps during peak times .
But those " peak times " are n't just a couple of hours in the evening ; they extend from 4:30 PM until 2 AM every day , or 9.5 hours out of each 24 .
As CAIP dryly notes , the speed limit " represents a tiny fraction of the 5 Mbps downstream data transfer rate " advertised by Bell .
Image courtesy CAIP
Bell 's system appears to be nothing if not effective , though .
A look at the graph above shows what happens to BitTorrent bandwidth at exactly 2 AM .
The image comes courtesy of a TDCNet employee who was downloading a legal copy of Fedora during that time and who saw his bandwidth surge immediately to 450 K bps once Bell Canada let up on the throttle .
CAIP concludes , " It is fair to say that , in general , for up to 10 hours a day , every single day , customers using applications or accessing content that are targeted ( either intentionally or collaterally ) by Bell 's traffic shaping measures are substantially restricted from enjoying the full benefit of the service for which they have contracted . "
The reference to collateral damage is further explained in another filing in which CAIP says that Bell Canada 's DPI system is far too aggressive and often filters non -P2P protocols .
According to CAIP 's research , users that start P2P clients are " flagged " for throttling , and once the flag is set , it actually affects everything from SSH to VoIP .
One unnamed CAIP member did an experiment , showing a 500 Kbps download speed on SSH transfers and 4.5 M bps downstream using VoIP speed test software .
After firing up a P2P client during the peak hours , then shutting it back down , the member found that SSH speed was now reduced to 30 Kbps , as was VoIP .
The member concluded that this fit with what he had heard , namely that " once a connection has been flagged as a P2P user , all traffic that is not white - listed is throttled . "
Bell :
We 're saving hundreds of thousands from congestion
Not surprisingly , Bell Canada insists that its system is highly accurate , only throttles P2P , and that all complaints it has seen can be chalked up to other network problems .
Its comments largely focus on the need for a DPI - based throttling solution , and the company claims that a full 700,000 users would experience congestion problems by next year if Bell did not roll out its solution .
To prove the point , Bell filed a chart showing the history of " network cell loss " on its ATM - based DSL network ( the company is currently building a fiber - to - the - node DSL network , but most of its customers still use the older , more expensive ATM technology ) .
Packets are broken up into cells for routing on an ATM network , and when capacity limits are reached and buffers are exceeded , cells will start to be dropped .
When this happens , the entire packet becomes unusable and has to be retransmitted .
Since 2002 , as usage has soared , these loss events have also increased dramatically .
Image courtesy Bell Canada
In laying out its plans for dealing with congestion problems , Bell described a three - pronged approach that includes capacity building , usage - based pricing , and traffic shaping in combination to keep the network operational .
" The most logical solution to the congestion problem is to invest the money in expanding the capacity of the network , " wrote the company in a CRTC filing .
It pointed out that , since 2001 , it has spent more than CAN$ 3 billion in upgrading its infrastructure , and it plans to spend another CAN$ 500 million in 2008 .
But Bell insists that there is no way to build enough capacity to address the issue .
Just as highway builders have found that increasing the number of lanes does not translate in the long term into less congestion ( because the bigger roads encourage more use ) , Bell argues that " the nature of the growth of Internet traffic is that as network capacity expands , new user applications invariably also grow to utilize that capacity . "
The company certainly could address the problem through buildouts by creating a network that can handle the peak load being advertised to each customer .
No network company builds its systems this way , however , due to the cost and the fact that much of the time , this capacity would simply go unused .
Or , translated into highway analogies once more , Bell 's Mirko Bibic told the CBC , " If you have a two - lane highway and you have congestion at rush hour , you 're not going to build 20 lanes because those 18 other lanes just wo n't be needed during non-rush periods .
So what do you do ?
You build a couple of extra lanes for one , you expand infrastructure .
As well , you do things like a bus lanes that allow buses , taxis , and cars with more than three passengers to travel on them so that they get faster service ban if you choose to drive your Escalade and you 're alone on the highway . "
Bell claims it is doing the best job it can , though it does admit that it should have given more notification to the ISPs before throttling their users .
In bureaucratic speak , this takes the form of saying , " The Company acknowledges the frustration of some of the Applicants ' members and has apologized to its wholesale GAS customers . "
In the future , Bell will give notice of such changes " on the day of implementation , at the latest . "
Much of the good stuff , including many specific numbers , was filed confidentially with the CRTC , but at least the regulator now has far more detailed information with which to make a judgment .
That judgment , about whether the government should get involved in the entire P2P throttling debate , will likely be made by the end of the summer , but Bell certainly could not have helped its assertion that congestion is a huge problem by opening its own ( non - P2P ) video download store last week .

The United States Fiat Money & the Federal Reserve System By Darryl Robert Schoon
Jun 23 2008 11:25 AM www.drschoon.com
Fiat money is an oxymoron .
Traditionally , money has been both a storehouse of value and a medium of exchange .
Fiat money exists by mimicking both ; but when its ability to do so ends , fiat money exposed for what it is , reverts to what it is - government issued coupons with expiration dates printed in invisible ink .
Fiat money distorts the time value of money and in so doing destroys both money and the economies that use it .
Real money like gold and silver has value over time , the greater its value and the longer it endures , the more likely it will be accepted as money .
Throughout history , gold and silver have demonstrated such utility and as a consequence both have been used as money for thousands of years .
Unfortunately , throughout history governments have either debased , sic diluted , the amount of gold and silver in their coins or attempted to circumvent gold and silver entirely by mandating the use of paper money , sic fiat .
This is why : Wealth , e.g. money , is power in a stored state .
Unleashed , wealth is capable of doing its possessors ' bidding for better or worse .
Wealth can exacerbate suffering or alleviate it and its power to do both - usually the former - has been coveted by governments since governments existed .
While productivity is doing more with less , fiat money allows governments to do more with nothing .
Fiat currencies are a way for governments to spend what they do n’t have ; and while counterfeiting by individuals is a crime , passing government coupons off as money is legal because governments make the laws .
WHOSE LAWS WHOSE BENEFIT
The issuance of fiat money by governments is , in truth , a white collar crime ; and , as happens when white collar crimes are discovered , a highly visible paper trail leads directly back to the wrongdoers - in this case , the central banks .
Central banks are the mechanism by which society ’s productivity is drained and indebted .
Credit - based money issued by central banks turns into debt , debt which immediately begins to accrue compounding interest paid by productive members of society , e.g. workers , businessmen , farmers , savers and taxpayers .
The interest , of course , is paid to bankers , non-productive members of society .
The motives for the co-conspirators in this crime are different but equally fulfilling .
Governments get to spend what they do n’t have and bankers get to collect interest on money that is not theirs - a win / win for the governments and bankers and a lose / lose for citizens and savers .
FIAT MONEY IS A CANCER ON THE ECONOMIC BODY
The longer a fiat money system exists , the greater the odds of economic collapse .
Over time fiat credit money destroys economies because time exacerbates the systemic flaws of credit - based , sic capital , markets .
Capital is but the polite word for credit and that is why it is used .
Capitalism sounds so much better ( and more like money ) than creditism .
The word capital implies a " moneyness " that does not exist .
Credit turns into debt and over time in fiat money systems the growth of debt overwhelms the ability of producers and savers to service it .
This is why debt markets , e.g. bond markets , are now so much larger than equity markets and why defaults involve increasingly larger and larger amounts .
In the current fiat money system , time is running out .
COMPOUNDING DEBT + TIME = INCREASING DEFAULTS
Time also contributes to the destruction of the " value " of fiat money .
The continual issuance of fiat credit money expands the amount of fiat " money " in circulation and thereby lowers the value of all previously issued currency .
This is why savers are penalized in fiat credit based economies .
Savings , measured in terms of constantly declining dollars , are worth less over time .
In the 95 years since the creation of credit based money by the Federal Reserve , the US dollar has lost 95 % of its purchasing power .
In fiat credit - based economies , savers are penalized and speculators are rewarded .
And while this is welcomed by Wall Street , it is a death warrant for Main Street .
In the US over the past twenty years , while Wall Street has expanded , Main Street has contracted .
The shift in America from a productive to a speculative economy is evidenced by the recent growth and dominance of financial " services " companies , e.g. Goldman Sachs , JP Morgan Chase , BofA , Morgan Stanley , Lehman Bros , Wachovia , etc. - their only " service " , of course , is a uniquely destructive and deadly form of " self - service " .
Over time , parasites will kill the body on which they live and this can be seen in the current decline of the United States .
The decline of America was not caused by outside forces , e.g. communism , terrorism , illegal immigration , currency manipulation or product dumping as the US corporate controlled media would have Americans believe .
The decline of America was an inside job .
The collapse of the US came from within .
In 1913 , the US replaced its savings based currency with fiat debt - based money issued by the Federal Reserve System , a consortium of European and US private banks whose intent was to profit from the growing productivity of America - and profit they did but to the detriment of America .
Since 1913 , the Federal Reserve System has helped Wall Street bankers leach and indebt the productivity of American businesses and workers until America is now but a shadow of its former self .
As the fortunes of Wall Streets rose , America ’s fortunes declined .
THE FIAT MONEY 3 - STEP CREDIT ( step forward ) DEBT ( stumble ) DEFAULT ( fall )
It ’s been 95 years since the Federal Reserve System and its credit based money took over the US economy .
Now , the United States , once the world ’s only creditor is by far its largest debtor .
A report from the Federal Reserve in 2006 stated the US is technically bankrupt with $ 65.9 trillion in irreconcilable obligations .
Currently , the US can only pay its debts by issuing new debt .
Default comes next .
THE US CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF FIAT MONEY
In 2013 , in only five years the Federal Reserve System will celebrate its 100th birthday in America , the celebration of 100 years of bankers , financiers and corporate CEOs dismantling the productivity of America for personal gain .
It is my belief the next five years will determine America ’s destiny .
Once seen as a beacon , it is now distrusted and feared and rightly so .
Those who bled this nation dry are still in control and the American people , America ’s only hope , are not even aware of what has happened ; and , if America is to be saved , there is not much time left in which to do so .
The odds are n’t good and Americans , heavily indebted and addicted to credit , are still hoping the Federal Reserve can save them , much as a patient hopes doctors will provide the right medicines , not knowing the doctors are getting kickbacks from the pharmaceutical companies and are skimming prescriptions for their own benefit .
In fiat based economies , time is the enemy and 95 years have passed since fiat money was introduced into the US .
In America and elsewhere time is passing and the clock is ticking and recently it ’s been sounding more and more like a time bomb .
It is hoped the election of a new president will save America .
It wo n’t .
Democracy , once the hope of the world , is now its greatest disappointment .
Money - and fiat money at that - has subverted the democratic process everywhere ; and today , in all nations , politicians from both conservative and liberal parties dance to fiat money ’s funereal beat - in a mockery of democracy ’s original intent .
DEMOCRACY - A CONTROLLED DANCE REQUIRING TWO PARTIES TO PERFORM Nations , as well as people , can pass away in their sleep ; and unless the American people wake up and wake up soon , their slumber will be the death rattle of what was recently the greatest nation on earth .
In just two weeks , on July 4th 2008 , the United States will celebrate its 232nd birthday .
But during its last 95 years , fiat money courtesy of the Federal Reserve System has steadily eroded the economic foundations of America .
Once the wealthiest nation in the world , it is no longer .
The cause is clear .
So is the cure .

Be Very Afraid Of Finland
By Christopher Landau
Religious affairs correspondent , BBC News
Google is the world 's most popular search engine
Google is to change its policy on adverts about abortion following a legal challenge from a Christian pressure group .
It had refused a Christian Institute advert , saying it did not allow the advertising of websites with " abortion and religion - related content " .
The institute threatened to use British equality laws to contest the decision .
But after an out - of - court settlement , Google will now allow religious groups to advertise about abortion .
It means when the word " abortion " is typed into the search engine , internet users will no longer just see adverts with details of abortion clinics and support groups , but could also find links to religious groups which may oppose abortion .
' Common sense '
In a statement , a Google spokesperson told BBC News : " The issue of abortion is an emotive subject and Google does not take a particular side .
" Over the last few months we have been reviewing our abortion ads policy in order to make sure it was fair , up - to - date and consistent with local customs and practices .
" Following the review we have decided to amend our policy , creating a level playing field and enabling religious associations to place ads on abortion in a factual way . "
The Christian Institute called the decision a success for common sense and free speech .
Mike Judge from the institute told BBC News that Google had a particular responsibility to treat groups equally given its status as a gateway to the internet .
" They have been very constructive in responding to our legal action .
I think there is a level playing field now for religious groups , and we 're delighted with this settlement , " he said .
Editor ’s Note :
This column has been updated following McCain ’s speech Thursday night .
ST . PAUL , Minn . —
Once upon a time , John McCain promised to be a different kind of politician and a different kind of Republican .
He was about straight talk , reform and nonpartisanship , a resolute foe of the slashing politics of the slaughterhouse .
McCain tried to get voters to remember that man in his acceptance speech Thursday night , the one who “ worked with members of both parties to fix the problems that need to be fixed . ”
But that man has disappeared .
The stage in the middle of the cavernous Xcel Energy Center was rearranged so McCain could conjure the feel of the town hall meetings he loves as he laced into “ partisan rancor ” and “ the Washington crowd . ”
Yet a set change could not disguise the fact that this convention — including the big speech Wednesday by his running mate , Sarah Palin — dripped with divisive ridicule as speaker after speaker worked to aggravate the country ’s cultural schisms and replay worn - out harangues against weak liberals .
The Republican crowd here has gleefully played into the worst stereotypes of their party as a privileged class resistant to change .
When Rudy Giuliani referred to Barack Obama ’s past as a “ community organizer ” Wednesday , the crowd broke into ugly , patronizing laughter .
These , presumably , are people who never needed a neighborhood advocate .
Imagine if Democrats ever reacted that way to someone who worked as an entrepreneur or a church leader .
And it ’s unlikely that even a convention of the American Petroleum Institute would erupt into raucous chants of “ drill , baby , drill ! ”
McCain could not change his party , so he changed himself .
McCain has pandered to a Republican right wing he once disdained on issue after issue , from oil drilling to immigration to tax cuts for the wealthy .
Just as important , he decided that his last chance for the presidency rests on a systematic effort to make the old politics of demonization work one more time .
If McCain ’s convention is a prelude to the fall campaign , he will leave behind a legacy of bitterness that will turn his promise of a new day into ashes .
His single most cynical act was choosing Palin as his running mate , “ cynical ” being the word used by former adviser and friend Mike Murphy , the Republican consultant caught by an open microphone .
McCain knows that the first requirement in a running mate is preparation to succeed to the presidency .
The choices he preferred , by all accounts , included Joe Lieberman and Tom Ridge , both plausible presidents .
But when it became clear that their support for abortion rights rendered both men politically toxic , McCain veered toward the last - minute pick of Palin .
McCain barely knew her , and his campaign misled reporters about the extent to which she had been vetted .
It was a political choice : Palin , McCain hopes , will help him win over women and rally social conservatives .
Palin ’s address here got boffo reviews from many of the very “ reporters and commentators ” whose good opinion the Alaska governor dismissed , but her speech was as cynical as the decision to put her on the ticket .
She joined in the campaign ’s fake populism by deriding legitimate concerns about her record , her knowledge and her governing style as the carping of the “ political establishment ” and the “ Washington elite . ”
She ran as the tribune of “ small - town ” Americans by way of suggesting that worries about her readiness to be president amounted to an assault on all who hail from localities of modest size .
She dared to compare herself to Harry Truman .
She then proceeded to distort Obama ’s views on taxes , mock his eloquence and accuse him of wanting “ to reduce the strength of America in a dangerous world . ”
And she demonstrated how little she respects constitutional rights with this chilling declaration : “ Al - Qaeda terrorists still plot to inflict catastrophic harm on America ; he ’s worried that someone wo n’t read them their rights . ”
But these thoughts , of course , were not really Palin’s .
They were words prepared by the campaign of John McCain , the unifier turned divider .
One night later , the unifier tried to come back , promising to reach out “ to any willing patriot , ” criticizing his own party , urging that we use “ the best ideas from both sides ” and pledging to “ ask Democrats and independents to serve with me . ”
It will be a hard sell because McCain has capitulated to the very Washington he condemned Thursday night and is employing the very tactics that were used ruthlessly and unfairly against him when he first ran for president eight years ago .
Perhaps the new McCain will somehow claw his way to the White House .
But it ’s the old McCain who deserved to be president .
A single speech on a September night is not enough to resurrect the man who might once have brought the country together .

An Open Letter to the U.S. Congress Regarding the Current Financial Crisis
John P. Hussman , Ph.D .
This article may be reprinted and distributed without further permission
Edited 9/26/08 to add Principles section and amend specifics of PAR obligations
Summary Of Principles
1 ) Public funds must function to increase the capital of distressed financial companies , not simply to take bad assets off of the balance sheet at market value ( which may improve the " quality " of the balance sheet , but does nothing to improve the capital cushion and therefore little to avoid future runs on the institution ) .
2 ) In return for these funds , the government should NOT take equity ( which is a subordinate claim and also creates potential conflicts of interest ) , but instead should take a SENIOR claim that precedes not only the stockholders but also the senior bondholders in the event the company defaults anyway .
Congress may need to make some modification to existing bankruptcy law or provide for expedited bondholder approval to do this , but essentially , the government 's claim should be subordinate only to customers in the event of default , and senior to both stockholders and bondholders .
However , it should also be countable as capital for the purposes of satisfying bank capital requirements .
3 ) Ideally , the rate of interest on such funds should be relatively high ( which will encourage these firms to substitute private financing as soon as possible ) , but actual payment should be made once the firms are again profitable so that the payment burden does not weaken them during the present recession .
4 ) The bill should allow for expedited bankruptcy resolution for these institutions , so that in the event of failure , the " good " bank ( all assets and customer liabilities , but excluding debt to bondholders ) can be cut away and liquidated to an acquirer as a " whole bank " sale .
For nearly all of these institutions , the debt to bondholders is far more than sufficient to absorb any losses even in the event of bankruptcy .
The current difficulty is that the bankruptcy process itself draws out the process of taking receivership , cutting away the good bank so that it can be sold to an acquirer , and delivering the proceeds as a residual to bondholders .
Streamlining that process is one of the best ways to ensure that the failure of one institution does not have " systemic " effects .
5 ) To assist homeowners , the bill should allow for a reduction of mortgage principal during foreclosure , but the mortgage lender should also receive a Property Appreciation Right ( PAR ) that gives the original lender a claim on future property appreciation up to that original mortgage amount .
In other words , the homeowner receives a substantially lower mortgage balance and payment burden now , but the lender stands to be made whole over time through property appreciation rather than immediate burdens on the homeowner to make payments .
To the Congress of the United States
In 2006 , the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis noted " Everyone knows that a policy of bailouts will increase their number . "
This week , Congress is being asked to hastily consider a monstrous bailout plan on a scale nearly equivalent to the existing balance sheet of the Federal Reserve .
As an economist and investment manager , I am concerned that the plan advocated by Treasury is essentially a plan to bail out the bondholders of financial institutions that made bad lending decisions , with little help to homeowners that are actually in financial distress .
It is difficult to believe that the U.S. government is contemplating taking on the bad assets of these institutions at probable taxpayer loss and effectively immunizing the bondholders ( and shareholders ) of these companies .
While it is certainly in the public interest to avoid the dislocations that would result from a disorderly failure of highly interconnected financial institutions , there are better ways for public funds to accomplish this , other than by protecting corporate bondholders while homeowners remain in distress .
Consider a simplified balance sheet of a typical investment bank :
Good assets : $ 95
Assets gone bad : $ 5
TOTAL ASSETS : $ 100
Liabilities to customers / counterparties : $ 80
Debt to bondholders of company : $ 17
Shareholder equity : $ 3
TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY : $ 100
Now , as these bad assets get written off , shareholder equity is also reduced .
What has happened in recent months is that this equity has become insufficient , so that the company technically becomes insolvent provided that the bondholders have to be paid off :
Good assets : $ 95
Assets gone bad ( written off ) : $ 0
TOTAL ASSETS : $ 95
Liabilities to customers / counterparties : $ 80
Debt to bondholders of company : $ 17
Shareholder equity : ( - $2 )
TOTAL LIABILITIES AND EQUITY : $ 95
These institutions are not failing because 95 % of the assets have gone bad .
They are failing because 5 % of the assets have gone bad and they over - stretched their capital .
At the heart of the problem is " gross leverage " - the ratio of total assets taken on by the company to its shareholder equity .
The sequence of failures we 've observed in recent months , starting with Bear Stearns , has followed almost exactly in order of their gross leverage multiples .
After Bear Stearns , Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac went into crisis , Lehman and Merrill Lynch followed .
Morgan Stanley , and Hank Paulson 's former employer , Goldman Sachs , remain the most leveraged companies on Wall Street , with gross leverage multiples above 20 .
Look at the insolvent balance sheet again .
The appropriate solution is not for the government to purchase bad assets with public money .
The only way such a transaction would add to the institution 's capital would be for the government to overpay for those assets .
Rather , the government should either a ) provide new capital , taking a claim in front of the company 's bondholders and stockholders , or b ) execute a receivership of the failed institution and immediately conduct a " whole bank " sale - selling the bank 's assets and liabilities as a package , but ex the debt to bondholders , which preserves the ongoing business without loss to customers and counterparties , wipes out shareholder equity , and gives bondholders partial ( perhaps even nearly complete ) recovery with the proceeds .
The key is to recognize that for nearly all of the institutions currently at risk of failure , there exists a cushion of bondholder capital sufficient to absorb all probable losses , without any need for the public to bear the cost .
For example , consider Morgan Stanley 's balance sheet as of 8/31/08 .
Total assets were $ 988.8 billion , with shareholder equity ( including junior subordinated debt ) of $ 42.1 billion , for a gross leverage ratio of 23.5 .
However , the company also has approximately $ 200 billion in long - term debt to its bondholders , primarily consisting of senior debt with an average maturity of about 6 years .
Why on earth would Congress put the U.S. public behind these bondholders ?
The stockholders and bondholders of the company itself should be the first to bear losses , not the public .
That is the essence of what a free and fair market , and a responsible government would enforce .
The investors in the companies that produced the losses should be accountable for them , and the customers and counterparties should be protected .
The case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was special in that government had already provided an implicit guarantee to their bondholders , so that bailout could n't have been done otherwise without harming the good faith and credit of the government , but it 's absurd to tell Wall Street " send us your poor and your tired assets , and we will tend to them . "
The gains in financial stocks we have observed in recent days reflects money that those firms expect to be taken out of the public pocket .
A further difficulty with the Treasury plan is that it does little to actually reliquify banks that are at risk .
To the contrary , the process of reverse - auctioning bad mortgage debt will provide for " price discovery " about what these assets are actually worth , most likely forcing other institutions to write down assets that are still held on the books at unrealistically high values .
As a result , we may observe an increase , rather than a decrease , in the number of financial institutions having insufficient capital .
Replacing the bad assets on the balance sheet with cash , at the market value of those bad assets , may improve the quality of the balance sheet , but does nothing to increase the capital on that balance sheet or the ability of financial institutions to lend .
If the objective is to prevent these institutions from bankruptcy or liquidation , or to increase their ongoing lending capacity , then the government requires a method to provide more capital .
It is essential that in return for providing more capital , the government should receive a special , possibly novel , security interest that places the government in front of even senior bondholders in the event that the institution fails anyway .
Rather than making small changes around the edges of Treasury 's vague and costly proposal , Congress should focus its attention on approaches that will provide capital to viable institutions and expedite the assumption and " whole bank " sale of failing ones .
On the regulatory front , Congress should restrict the speculative use of credit default swap ( CDS ) transactions .
These swaps are essentially insurance policies that pay the holder in the event that an institution 's bonds fail .
Both credit default swaps and short sales should be allowed for bona - fide hedging purposes when an investor has a related asset that is at risk .
However , it is appropriate for regulators to curtail the speculative use of credit default swaps and short sales relating to financial institutions .
With regard to assisting homeowners , purchasing the bad mortgage securities from financial institutions will do nothing to help those homeowners because it does nothing to alter the cash flows expected of them .
Congress will be a far better steward of public funds by offering distressed homeowners what amounts to a refinancing , coupled with a partial surrender of future appreciation .
In practice , when a homeowner defaults on an existing mortgage , the bankruptcy court would be allowed to " push down " the principal value .
Alternatively , government could purchase the foreclosed property at an amount near existing foreclosure recovery rates ( presently about 50 % of mortgage face value ) , and the government would then sell that home back to the owner with a zero-equity mortgage , allowing individuals to keep their homes .
In either case , there would be an additional obligation placed on the property owner in the form of what might be called a " Property Appreciation Right " ( PAR ) , which would be provided to the original mortgage lender .
Though it would accrue no interest , it would provide a claim to the original lender on any appreciation in the value of the original home ( or other property subsequently purchased by the homeowner ) up to the difference between the foreclosure proceeds and the original mortgage amount .
Note that the PAR would only become relevant at the point that the government was fully repaid .
For example , consider a homeowner with a $ 300,000 mortgage balance on a home now worth less than the mortgage balance itself .
The government would buy the foreclosed property at say , $ 200,000 and mortgage it to the existing homeowner .
The original lender would receive $ 200,000 , plus a Property Appreciation Right ( PAR ) , giving it a claim on $ 100,000 of any future appreciation of property .
If the homeowner was to sell the property later for , say , $ 250,000 , the owner of the PAR would receive $ 50,000 , and there would be a remaining lien on future appreciation of property purchased by the homeowner .
At any point the recovery from price appreciation satisfied the $ 100,000 claim , the PAR would be fully repaid .
Some provision would have to be made for the appreciation of an unsold home , but that detail could be accomplished through some form of equity extraction refinancing .
To account for time value , the claim on future appreciation could be increased at a small rate of interest .
Though the credit impact of a mortgage default would likely be sufficient to dissuade solvent homeowners from making inappropriate use of the program , the government could impose additional costs or eligibility requirements to avoid such risks .
In summary , the Treasury proposal to address current financial difficulties places corporate bondholders ahead of the public , rewards irresponsible risk - taking , and sets a precedent for future bailouts .
Moreover , we know from a long history of economic experience across countries that a major expansion of government liabilities is invariably followed by multi- year periods of extremely high inflation , particularly when it is not matched by a similar expansion of economic production .
Such inflation would initially be modest because of the current weakness in the economy , but could pose unusual challenges to the United States in the coming years .
Congress can benefit the American public by maintaining a focus on responsibly assisting homeowners in distress rather than defending the stockholders and bondholders of overleveraged financial companies .
It is essential to recognize that the failure of these companies need not result in " financial meltdown " provided that the " good bank " representing the vast majority of assets and liabilities is cut away , protecting customers and counterparties , so that the losses are properly borne out of the capital base of the companies that incurred them .
Again , everyone knows that a policy of bailouts will increase their number .
By choosing who bears the losses for irresponsible decisions at these companies , Congress will also choose the scope of the bailouts that follow .
Sincerely ,

Further Commentary and Background
Freight Trains and Steep Curves : July 11 , 2003 - " T.S. Eliot once wrote " Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go . "
It seems that the U.S. financial system is bound and determined to find out .
The major force shaping economic dynamics over the coming decade is likely to be an unwinding of the extreme leverage that individuals , businesses , and the U.S. itself ( via its record current account deficit ) have accumulated ... "
Warning , Examine All Risk Exposures : October 15 , 2007 - " There are only a handful of historical periods that fall into this syndrome of conditions : December 1972 , August 1987 , July 1998 , July 1999 , December 1999 , March 2000 , and October 2007 .
All of the prior instances were followed by steep market losses .
When the declines were not abrupt , they were protracted .
There is not a single counter - example . "
Minding the Hinges on Pandora 's Box : January 7 , 2008 - " I am emphatic that investors should evaluate their risk exposures and tolerances now , in order to allow for substantial further market weakness .
Market conditions presently feature a Pandora 's Box of rich valuations , vulnerable profit margins , rising default risk , rapidly deteriorating market internals , failing support levels , and accumulating evidence of oncoming recession .
Given that the heavy resets only started in October , we are still about two or three quarters away from the really serious credit losses , foreclosures and writedowns .
To imagine that financial companies can simply " come clean " and " just put their cards on the table " assumes that lenders actually know which loans are facing default , and how many .
But lenders are still months away from even finding that out . "
What Congress and Investors Should Understand About the Bear Stearns Deal : March 31 , 2008 - " For Bear Stearns to ' fail ' means that it may not fully repay its own bondholders , but it has never meant that Bear Stearns ' customers and counterparties would be hurt - their accounts and contracts are precisely what J.P. Morgan is eager to purchase and can easily transfer .
The misuse of public funds is assisted by blurring the distinction between ' failure ' of Bear 's customer and counterparty obligations ( which nobody wants and is neither likely nor necessary ) , and the ' failure ' of Bear Stearns 's stocks and bonds to be successful investments .
Why should investment losses be bailed out at public expense ? "
Which " Inning " of the Mortgage Crisis Are We In ? : April 14 , 2008 - " Clearly , as we enter April 2008 , we appear to be quite early in the mortgage crisis , with only about a quarter of the cumulative resets having occurred .
That places us near the start of the third inning , where we can expect each of the nine " innings " to be about three months in duration .
Unfortunately , the next three innings ( quarters ) are when the heavy hitters on the opposing team will come up to the plate , as the cumulative amount of resets will surge .
With that surge , loan losses and foreclosures will also predictably spike higher . "
Remarks to Shareholders
A number of shareholders have inquired in regard to the temporary ban on short sales of financials .
It is important to note that the Fund does not sell short individual stocks .
Rather , when the Fund is hedged , we offset the market risk of the stocks held in the Fund using index option combinations ( generally long put option - short call option combinations ) .
By extension , the market makers in these options typically hedge their risk in the futures markets .
If we observe any effect at all , the inability to sell short financial stocks until early October might induce a slight discount ( versus theoretical value ) in spread between index futures prices and the underlying cash indices .
Normally , such discounts are arbitraged away by program traders who buy the cheaper futures and sell short a basket of the actual stocks in the index .
Even here , the arbs can always complete the financial portion of the basket in the swaps market , and index funds would also have an incentive to buy the futures rather than the stock basket if any material futures discount emerges .
Accordingly , I expect that any impact on the futures spread is likely to be quite small , since options and futures still settle based on the cash index at expiration .
The Strategic Growth Fund registered a record high on Wednesday of last week .
As financial stocks soared from extremely oversold to extremely overbought conditions on Thursday and Friday , the Fund ( which continues to carry a near - zero exposure in financials ) declined by an unusual 3.45 % , reducing the Fund 's net asset value by 1.84 % for the week as a whole .
Essentially , highly leveraged financial stocks soared , none of which we own , but many of which contributed to strength in the indices we use to hedge , particularly financials having modest but non-negligible weight in the S&P 500 ( on Thursday and Friday , Bank of America surged by 36.8 % , J.P. Morgan by 31.5 % , and Citigroup by 45.8 % ) .
Clearly , repeated and sustained gains of that magnitude are not likely , but those unusual gains produced a greater advance in the indices we use to hedge than in the stocks held by the Fund .
I anticipate that further fluctuations in financial stocks are likely to account for only minor fluctuations in Fund value .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate for stocks was characterized by unfavorable valuations , and still - unfavorable market action ( despite a " fast , furious , prone to failure " rally late in the week , that had all of the markings of a short - squeeze ) .
On a short - term basis , the market is moderately overbought , but not to the level that typically allows us to form expectations about market direction .
The Strategic Growth Fund remains fully hedged .
Even if the immediate financial crisis has been contained , which is not at all clear , it remains likely that the broad market has not fully conceded a recession .
It is also of some concern that there is only one precedent for the size of the advance observed in the past two days , which was a short - term stopping point in October 1929 , following which the market proceeded to establish fresh lows for two more weeks .
As I have noted in recent weeks , the best prospect for accepting significant market risk would be for the market to move materially below the recent trading range .
Had Thursday 's decline continued for another day or two , I expect that a more durable low might have been established .
But having already cleared last week 's oversold condition with an enormous short - squeeze in financials , the question remains , exactly what sort of economic recovery are investors anticipating within a few months - and if they are not , exactly why should they expect sustained gains in a market having continued economic pressure on a broad range of industries even outside of financials ?
For our part , we remain hedged , but would be willing to establish a moderate speculative exposure to market fluctuations if market internals provide evidence that investors have a more robust tolerance for risk .
Presently , we do not have that evidence .
In bonds , the Market Climate last week was characterized by relatively neutral yield levels and slightly unfavorable yield pressures .
Short - term
Treasury yields spiked down to zero at the height of last week 's crisis , and Treasury yields soared following the announcement of the Treasury 's bailout proposal .
I am quite concerned that if that proposal succeeds , the U.S. economy will be set on a path of double digit inflation along the same lines that we observed after the expansion of government spending in the late 1960's and early 1970's .
While inflationary pressures are not an immediate threat , longer - term Treasury yields ( and thereby mortgage rates ) could surge if this plan gains ground , which would ironically accelerate the trajectory of delinquencies and foreclosures .
The Strategic Total Return Fund continues to carry a relatively short duration of about 2.5 years , mainly in near - term Treasury securities having less price impact from yield fluctuations .
The Fund also has about 6 % of assets in utility shares , just over 10 % in foreign currencies , and having clipped our exposure slightly on price strength early Thursday , about 10 % of assets in precious metals shares .

( CNN ) -- An Alaska judge warned Gov. Sarah Palin 's family against trying to get her then - brother - in - law fired , according to court records .
Investigators want to know if Sarah Palin tried to use her position improperly to get her former brother - in - law fired .
That warning came long before the controversy over her dismissal of the brother - in - law 's boss , the state 's public safety commissioner , records show .
Palin , the Republican nominee for vice president , is battling allegations she and her advisers pressured Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan to fire her sister 's husband , State Trooper Mike Wooten .
Palin 's sister , Molly McCann , and Wooten were in the process of getting a divorce when the judge hearing the couple 's case said McCann 's family appeared to be putting Wooten 's job at risk at a time when he would be required to pay child support .
" It appears for the world that Ms. McCann and her family have decided to take after the guy 's livelihood , that whatever who did what to whom has overridden good judgment , " Superior Court Judge John Suddock said during an October 2005 hearing .
" Aesop told us not to slay the goose that lays the golden egg .
For whatever reason , people are trying to slay the goose here , and it tends to diminish his earning capacity . "
At the time , Palin was a private citizen and would not become governor until 2006 .
In complaints filed with the state police , she and other relatives had accused Wooten of threatening her family during the divorce .
Suddock was in the process of settling the couple 's property and child - support arrangements in the 2005 hearing .
The judge said his decision might have been different had Wooten 's continued employment with the state police been more certain .
" The plaintiff 's table has created a situation where that is a very fragile outcome , " he said .
Wooten 's union representative testified that the trooper was the subject of a " constant stream " of complaints from his ex-wife 's family .
" If things do n't change , Mike 's career is in jeopardy , " the union rep said .
" My advice to Mike was to find another job , " said John Cyr , now executive director of the Public Safety Employees Association .
" I think he needs , career - wise , to look for work elsewhere . "
CNN obtained audio recordings of the hearing from the court clerk 's office in Anchorage , Alaska .
Roberta Erwin , the attorney who represented McCann , declined comment on the case Wednesday , and other representatives of the governor did not immediately return phone calls .
Wooten was suspended for five days in March 2006 , after state police commanders determined he had used a Taser on his 10 - year - old stepson " in a training capacity , " drove his patrol car while drinking beer and illegally shot a moose using his wife 's hunting permit .
In a February 2008 hearing over new custody issues , Wooten briefly complained that " disparagement " by his ex-wife 's family was continuing .
Complaints about Wooten from Palin and her family have been under scrutiny since Gov. Palin's July firing of Monegan , whose duties included management of the state police force .
After his dismissal , Monegan said he was fired because he refused to succumb to pressure from the governor 's office to fire Wooten , and his allegations have led to an investigation by the state Legislature .
Palin has denied any wrongdoing , saying the commissioner was removed because of disagreements over budget issues .
Her attorneys have called Wooten a " rogue trooper " and said no one in the governor 's family knew of his suspension until after Monegan 's dismissal .
Spokesmen for Sen. John McCain 's presidential campaign have said the legislative probe has become a " political circus " since McCain tapped Palin as his running mate in August .
Palin originally pledged to cooperate with the investigation and disclosed that members of her administration had contacted state police officials nearly two dozen times to discuss Wooten .
But last week , she asked the state personnel board to conduct its own probe , and a string of witnesses has failed to show up at scheduled depositions with the investigator hired by the Legislature .
Last week , Cyr 's union filed its own complaint against Palin and top aides , accusing them of improperly attempting to use confidential information from Wooten 's personnel files against him .
The McCain campaign says Wooten agreed to release his files during the divorce proceedings , and the information was in the public domain .

Advertisement Thailand 's Prime Minister Samak Sundaravej has declared a state of emergency in the capital Bangkok , after clashes left at least one person dead .
Dozens more were hurt in the worst violence seen in Bangkok for 16 years .
Mr Samak said he had " no choice " but to impose the measure in order to end the week - old revolt by supporters of the People 's Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) .
But the army commander has promised that his men will not use force to disperse the protesters .
Separately , in a fresh blow to the government , the Thai election commission recommended that Mr Samak 's People Power Party be disbanded over claims of vote - buying in elections last December .
The recommendation will not lead to immediate action against the party , as it must now be considered by the public prosecutor 's office , but correspondents say it piles further pressure on Mr Samak 's government .
Thai voices : State of emergency
In pictures : Bangkok clashes Q&A : Bangkok protests
Send us your comments
If the prosecutor submits the case to the Constitutional Court and the ruling is upheld , Mr Samak and other top party leaders would be banned from politics for five years .
PAD supporters say the government is a front for Thaksin Shinawatra - the former prime minister , now in exile , whom the PAD was instrumental in removing in a coup in 2006 .
The PAD has a passionate following in various parts of the country , especially Bangkok , and some powerful backers among the elite .
But it has little support in most of rural Thailand , which voted strongly for Prime Minister Samak , and Mr Thaksin before him .
Shots fired
The street clashes began shortly after midnight , when a screaming crowd of government supporters - armed with sticks and slingshots - ploughed into a group from the PAD , who have been occupying the prime minister 's office .
See a map of key protest areas in Bangkok Amid the ensuing fighting , some gunshots were fired - both sides are now reported to possess some firearms .
One person died , and TV pictures showed some of the 43 people injured lying bleeding on the ground .
For much of the time , police officers simply stood on the sidelines , our correspondent says .
But by daybreak , the situation was reportedly calmer , with unarmed troops trying to keep the two sides apart .

The prime minister said that emergency rule would not last long .
" No - one has the right to do such a thing as they have done , " said Mr Samak , in a televised news conference .
" I had no other choice but to declare a state of emergency in Bangkok in order to solve the problem for once and for all .
" The military and police will carry out the implementation . "
The army commander , General Anupong Paojinda , now has special powers to : detain and remove people from any location
deploy troops to help police maintain order
ban gatherings of more than five people
impose restrictions on media reports that could " undermine public security "
But the BBC's Jonathan Head , in Bangkok , says Gen Anupong appeared decidedly uncomfortable with his new role when he spoke to reporters .
He repeated his insistence that the conflict between the government supporters and opponents was a political one which the army could not resolve - leaving Prime Minister Samak with his hands tied , our correspondent says .
The PAD insists its supporters will not move from the government building , despite the state of emergency .
BANGKOK PROTESTS 26 Aug : Protesters occupy government buildings , demand the government step down 27 Aug : Authorities issue arrest warrants for nine protest leaders 28 Aug : PM Samak promises no use of force against the protesters 29 Aug : Police try to evict protesters but pull back ; crowds blockade two regional airports 30 Aug : PM Samak rules out resignation , following a meeting with Thailand 's king 31 Aug : Parliament meets for a special session on the protests 1 Sep : A late - night clash between pro- and anti-government groups leaves one person dead 2 Sep : PM Samak declares a state of emergency " There are not enough jails to put us all into , " one of the alliance leaders , Chamlong Srimuang , told thousands of PAD demonstrators .
One anti-government protester , a trained doctor who wishes to remain anonymous , told the BBC he had treated some of the injured after the clashes last night .
" The major injuries were taken to hospital straight away but I looked after the people with wounds and lacerations on the head , " he said .
" They could n't tell me anything about what happened - they were very confused . "
But he added that people had been apprehensive since the state of emergency was declared .
" Our leaders have tried to call on all the people of Thailand to come out and join the protest so that we have enough people to prevent violence .
We believe that the more people know and join , then we remain safe , " he said .
Strikes called
This crisis began exactly a week ago when thousands of PAD supporters took to the streets of Bangkok and forced their way into government buildings .
Protesters went on to shut down airports and rail services .
Public sector unions said they would begin a nationwide strike at 43 state enterprises on Wednesday unless the prime minister stepped down .
The State Enterprise Workers Relations Confederation also threatened to cut off water , electricity and phone service at government offices and disrupt flights .
Our correspondent in Bangkok says there appear to be very few ways out of this crisis , with the country so bitterly divided .

What are these ?
By Adam Easton
BBC News , Warsaw
Szymany airport is said to be where CIA interrogations took place Polish intelligence sources have for the first time confirmed that the US Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) ran a secret prison facility on Polish soil .
The admission comes after a report found the CIA had operated prisons for terror suspects in Poland and Romania .
Polish and Romanian officials denied the claims , but last month Warsaw launched a new inquiry into the matter .
In 2006 , US President George W Bush admitted the CIA had held suspects in secret jails but he did not say where .
Two anonymous intelligence officers made the claims about facilities being located in Poland in the daily Dziennik .
One of them states that between 2002 and 2005 the CIA held terror suspects inside a military intelligence training base in Stare Kiejkuty in north - eastern Poland .
The officer says only the CIA had access to the isolated zone , which was used because it was a secure site far from major towns and was close to a former military airport .
' High - value detainees '
Both the then Prime Minister , Leszek Miller , and President , Aleksander Kwasniewski , knew about the base , the newspaper reports .
However the officer says it was unlikely either man knew if the prisoners were being tortured because the Poles had no control over the Americans ' activities .
Both leaders have always denied the existence of any such base .
Last year a Council of Europe report quoted unnamed CIA sources as saying that " high - value detainees " , including Khalid Sheik Mohammed - the alleged mastermind of the 9/11 attacks on the US in 2001 - had been interrogated in Poland .
The current Polish government says it has no knowledge of the base but it has sanctioned a new investigation into the claims .

CNBC reported on September 11 , 2008 :
The end result of the global economic slowdown may be the U.S. announcing national bankruptcy as the government cannot afford the bailouts that it promised and the market will not bail out the government , Martin Hennecke , senior manager of private clients at Tyche , told CNBC on Thursday .
" We expect a depression in the United States .
We expect a depression , very possibly , also in Europe , " Hennecke said on " Worldwide Exchange . "
The estimated $ 300 billion cost of the Fannie / Freddie bailout will probably be considered as a loss that the government will have to take , therefore passing it on to taxpayers , he explained .
" We already have $ 3 trillion of debt , as far as the U.S. government is concerned .
These debt figures across the U.S. economy are rising very sharply . "
When the government can no longer pass the United States ’ " immense debt " on to taxpayers , it will turn to the holders of U.S. dollars , leading to the eventual downfall of the currency , Hennecke said .
" Definitely , it ( the dollar ) is not a safe place to be invested in , as real inflation is closer to 10 or 11 percent than the actual inflation numbers given by the U.S. government , " Hennecke said on " Worldwide Exchange " .

It was painful to watch , at Apple ’s big media event on Monday , Steve Jobs attempting to pawn off a retread music - recommendation system as some sort of great technological breakthrough .
Yes , iTunes will now be able to suggest songs you might like based on what you and other like - eared users listen to .
Wow .
That ’s so 2002 .
And the company even has the gumption to call the feature Genius .

Today , reports New Scientist , Apple has applied for a patent to – no joke – extend digital rights management to tennis shoes and other articles of clothing .
“ What is desired , ” the patent application says , “ is a method of electronically pairing a sensor and an authorized garment . ”
It continues :
As used herein an authorized garment is a garment sanctioned to be electronically paired with an authenticated ( i.e. , certified ) sensor .
Once the garment and sensor are electronically paired , the sensor can receive ( and in some cases process ) sensing information ( such as garment performance data or user performance data ) received from the garment .
Since only authorized garments are configured to electronically pair with authenticated sensors , a user ( or manufacturer ) can be assured that the sensing data received by the sensor is both accurate and consistent with its intended use ( a sensor designed for use with running shoes can not properly be used with dance shoes , for example ) .
Apple views tennis - shoe DRM as a way to head off what it sees as a potential plague of sneaker hacking .
“ Some people , ” the patent application observes , “ have taken it upon themselves to remove the sensor from the special pocket of the [ iPod - linked ]
Nike + shoe and place it at inappropriate locations ( shoelaces , for example ) or place it on non-Nike + model shoes . ”
Oh my God : Geeks are ripping the sensors out of their sneakers and sticking them on their shoelaces !
Unleash the shoe nazis !
It used to be cool to be an Apple fanboy .
Now it ’s starting to be embarrassing .

Tesla founder Elon Musk has launched tech startup Neuralink to build implants that connect human brains with computer interfaces via artificial intelligence .
The approaching technology would see groups of minuscule , flexible electrode " threads " implanted into the human brain by a neurosurgical robot .
These threads detect and record the electrical signals in the brain , and transmit this information outside the body .
This has the potential to create a scalable high - bandwidth brain - machine interface ( BMI ) system , meaning that it connects the brain to an external device to form a brain - machine interface .

A day after Ted Kennedy addressed the Democratic convention in Denver , the Kennedys gathered at the historic Brown Palace Hotel in Denver to remember another Kennedy , Ted ’s brother , Robert F. Kennedy .
He was assassinated forty years ago , the night he won the Los Angeles Democratic primary .
After the event , I sat down with Robert F. Kennedy ’s son , environmental attorney Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. He spoke about torture , impeachment and the most poignant memories of his father .
[ includes rush transcript ]
Guest :
Jr. Robert F. Kennedy , serves as Chief Prosecuting Attorney for the Hudson Riverkeeper and President of Waterkeeper Alliance .
He is co-host of Ring of Fire on Air America Radio .

Thank you for your generous contribution .
AMY GOODMAN : One of the most moving events at the Democratic National Convention was the speech delivered by Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy in one of his first public appearances since being diagnosed with brain cancer in May .
He flew into Colorado , taken immediately to the University of Denver Hospital .
Though his family and doctors had advised against it , he went to the Pepsi Center , accompanied by paramedics and a doctor .
On the convention floor , he was accompanied by his niece , Caroline Kennedy , daughter of President John Kennedy , and his wife Vicki .
A day after he spoke , the Kennedys gathered at the historic Brown Palace Hotel in Denver to remember another Kennedy , Ted ’s brother , Robert F. Kennedy , slain forty years ago , the night he won the Los Angeles Democratic primary .
After the event , I sat down with his son , Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. , the environmental attorney .
ROBERT F. KENNEDY , JR . :
One of the most poignant memories I have of my father was a trip that we took to Europe when I was about thirteen years old , and we went to Czechoslovokia and Poland and Italy and Greece and France and Germany .
And everywhere we went , we were met by vast crowds of people , hundreds of thousands of people , who came out because they wanted to be near an American politician .
And it was n’t just because my father ’s brother had been martyred three years before .
The same thing happened to Eisenhower when he went to Kabul and Tehran .
A million Muslim people met him on the street waving tiny little American flags .
And what I remember as a boy is these crowds of people that were just hungry for American leadership , and they — not bullying .
They knew the difference .
And they were starved for a moral authority .
And they proudly named their streets after our presidents , Washington and Jefferson and Lincoln and Roosevelt and Kennedy .
And I remember the day after 9/11 , when the headline on the biggest newspaper in France , Le Monde , was “ We ’re All Americans Now . ”
And for three weeks after 9/11 , thousands of Muslim people came out spontaneously onto the streets of Tehran to make candlelight vigils to show their support , their solidarity , their love for the United States of America .
We were the most beloved nation on the face of the earth and in the history of mankind .
And it took 230 years of disciplined visionary leadership by Republican and Democratic presidents to build up those vast reservoirs of public love for our country .
And in seven short years , through monumental arrogance and incompetence , this White House has drained those reservoirs dry .
We are now , according to virtually every poll , the most hated nation and feared nation on earth .
And anybody who says that it ’s good for our national security when European youth , as a recent poll showed , hold Osama bin Laden in the same regard as they hold President Bush , and anybody who believes it ’s good for our national security when Hezbollah is as popular in the Mideast as America has their head in an oil well .
You know , Abraham Lincoln said America — we ’re doing things today that were inconceivable a few years ago .
We ’re torturing people in America .
We ’re eavesdropping on our citizens .
We are having extraordinary renditions .
We ’ve suspend habeas corpus .
We have these black prisons .
And , you know , Abraham Lincoln said that America is a good nation — is a great nation , because we ’re a good nation .
And he warned that if we ever lose our goodness , we ’ll quickly forfeit our greatness as well .
You know , people say in the White House that we have to do these things , because we ’re under such terrible threat .
But that ’s a lie .
When I was a little boy , we had 25,000 nuclear - tipped missiles pointing at our country from the Soviet Union with one guy able to press a button and vaporize most of our population .
And we were n’t torturing people and eavesdropping on our citizens and suspending habeas corpus .
During the Civil War , 659,000 Americans died .
Our cities were burned and occupied by foreign — by hostile armies .
And we did n’t engage in those kind of behaviors .
You know , during the Revolutionary War , George Washington was approached by his generals with the idea of torturing British soldiers to extract strategic information .
At that time , the British were torturing our soldiers in New York Harbor on coffin ships and killing them by the dozens every day .
Washington said to them , “ I would rather lose the war , because this is the first nation in history that is based upon an idea , and the idea is one of essential human dignity and justice . ”
And he said , “ We ’re not — I ’d rather the British continue to rule us than become — than to lose that . ”
And , you know , he established codes of conduct for the treatment of prisoners , fair treatment of prisoners and humane treatment .
And the Hessians that he captured on Christmas Eve were so shocked by the good treatment they received from the American captors that after two weeks in prison , they agreed to walk unguarded all the way to POW camps in western Pennsylvania , and not a single one escaped .
During the Civil War , Lincoln ’s general suggested — made the suggestion of torture , and he was so horrified by the idea , that he created a committee to establish a standards — a report with standards for the fair treatment and humane treatment of prisoners of war .
And eighty years later , that document became the Geneva Convention .
During World War II , Eisenhower was asked about torturing Germans at a time when Nazis were torturing our prisoners and POWs .
And Eisenhower said , “ Americans do n’t do that . ”
And he said — and during World War II , German soldiers surrendered to American soldiers by the thousands , because they had heard from their fathers , who fought in World War I , “ Always surrender to an American , because Americans do n’t torture people . ”
You know , a few weeks ago , I had John Dean on my show on Air America .
And John Dean , as you know , was the counselor to President Nixon during the Watergate scandal .
And Dean said to me — Dean went to prison for his participation in the cover - up .
And he said , “ You know , we eavesdropped illegally on one office , and I went to jail for four months , and my boss was impeached and then forced to resign . ”
And he said , “ These people have illegally eavesdropped on hundreds of thousands of Americans . ”
And he said , “ Where ’s the impeachment ?
Where are the convictions ?
Where ’s the imprisonment ?
Where ’s the jail term ?
Where is the American press ?
Where is the indignation ? ”
And , you know , we need to continually remind ourselves that the Bill of Rights is not a luxury we can no longer afford and that America is not just a place where people come to , you know , increase the size of their pile , and whoever dies with the most stuff wins .
Our nation is an exemplary nation .
And that ’s the way the world regards us , and that ’s what they want from us .
And when we start lowering our standards , we lose our prestige , we lose our capacity to influence world events , and we lose the soul of our country .
And we now need to gain that back .
AMY GOODMAN : So , what do you make of Nancy Pelosi ?
I mean , the fact is , it ’s not the Republicans who control the House and the Senate , it ’s the Democrats who do .
And she says impeachment is off the table .
They say just consider the election a way to get rid of the President .
ROBERT F. KENNEDY , JR. :
Well , I do n’t believe it .
I think , you know , what I ’ve said to Nancy Pelosi publicly and to every Democrat that comes on my show , I say , “ Why are n’t we impeaching these people , just as a civics lesson to the American public ?
You know , we need that .
We need to remind people that you cannot trample the Bill of Rights .
You can not ignore your oath of office to protect the Constitution . ”
You know , there ’s no doubt that they committed a crime .
Everybody admits it .
When it was FISA , when they — you know , when they illegally eavesdropped , there ’s no justification for that .
It is a crime , and it ’s a high crime .
And it ’s a high crime that ’s prescribed , you know , for — as the basis for impeachment .
And they ought to be impeached , just so that nobody does it again .
We ca n’t just keep — you know , if somebody is murdered .
You just do n’t say , “ Well , let it go , and move on .
Nobody really wants to deal with a trial and all that problem . ”
It ’s our responsibility as a generation to impeach these people now as a showcase , to show future presidents of the United States that the Bill of Rights is not something that can be trifled with , that the Bill of Rights is not just a luxury that we can no longer afford .
AMY GOODMAN : Perhaps their calculation is they are courting Republicans to leave the Republican Party and vote for a Democrat and that if they polarize the country , that they wo n’t have that option .
ROBERT F. KENNEDY , JR. :
Well , sometimes you have to do what ’s right .
And I think , in the long run , it ’s the politically smart thing to do , because I think Americans — you know , and I ’ve been prosecuting polluters and suing people for years , and when you sue somebody — when you say bad things about somebody , everybody just dismisses it as criticism .
But when it becomes a court case , everybody begins taking it seriously .
And at this point , you know , it ’s clearly the right thing to do , because you ca n’t let somebody — all of these people , Nancy Pelosi on down , have sworn to protect the Constitution .
How can you protect the Constitution when you ’re letting somebody violate it and then just say , “ Well , we ’re going to let this one go , and then we ’ll move on to the next one ” ?
AMY GOODMAN : Well , we ’ve just come into a Democratic convention here in Denver , where the Democrats joined with the Republicans in granting retroactive immunity to the corporations like AT&T that spied on the American people .
And now , all the delegates carrying around their bag have that logo of AT&T .
They ’re helping to sponsor this convention .
ROBERT F. KENNEDY , JR . : Oh , I know .
Well , I always say that Republicans are 95 percent corrupt , and the Democrats are 75 percent corrupt .
And the level of corruption reflects the amount of money , of corporate money , they ’re taking .
I mean , they ’ve got AT&T all over their bags , and they ’ve got these clean coal signs that are , you know , up and down the streets , that you get mugged by these clean coal people who are apparently paying for half the convention .
So , it ’s very disturbing to me , Amy .
AMY GOODMAN : Now , your family is divided , right ?
Caroline Kennedy and your uncle , Ted Kennedy , for Obama ; your family is for —has been for Clinton .
What are your thoughts right now ?
ROBERT F. KENNEDY , JR . : No , everybody is for Obama .
You know , the primaries are over .
The day the primaries ended , the last primary ended , we all started working for Obama .
And , you know , I said from the beginning , we have two great candidates , and I ’m happy supporting either one of them .
I believed , for my own reasons , that Hillary Clinton had the best chance of winning the election , but I love Barack Obama .
And , you know — and from the beginning , I was defending , you know , him against the Republican attacks , even when I was campaigning for Hillary .
They started attacking him for not wearing his flag lapel pin .
And , you know , this is so ironic and so absurd that that ’s the measure of patriotism .
You put on a flag lapel pin so you can free both hands to tear up the Bill of Rights , you know , and that ’s really what he ’s saying , and he should have stuck with it .
But anyway , we ’re going to work , and we ’re going to try as hard as we can to get him elected , because we need this for America .
AMY GOODMAN : You ’re involved in a piece in Rolling Stone right now around voting , the issue of voting all over the country .
What are your concerns ?
ROBERT F. KENNEDY , JR. : Well , the Republican Party has put in place a system for suppressing the Democratic vote , particularly African American voters , Hispanic voters and American Indian voters .
And there ’s fifty different tricks that are using — of legal mechanisms that now make it very , very difficult for those groups to register , then to vote , and third , to get their votes counted .
And they ’re complex , very sinister , cunning and clever mechanisms that most Americans , almost — most Americans , including most elected officials , do n’t even know about .
But in the end , they ’re going to end up disenfranchising about three million voters , mainly African American , Hispanic , American Indian , senior citizens and elderly , the hard core of the Democratic Party .
And so , we ’ve done — myself and Greg Palast — I ’ve done an analysis , an easy - to - read analysis , which will be published in Rolling Stone , I think in the September 12th issue .
I ’ve got to go .
AMY GOODMAN : Thank you very much .
ROBERT F. KENNEDY , JR . : Thank you .
' There are two Americas - separate , unequal , and no longer even acknowledging each other except on the barest cultural terms .

Baltimore - it 's been an ordinary week in Maryland 's largest city .
The August heat broke and one can nearly sleep with a window open ; the Orioles are again down in the cellar in the American League East ; the city murder rate is a bit behind last year 's blood - letting , and if it holds into the fall , politicians and police commanders will compete to claim credit .
The stories in the Baltimore Sun remain fixed on the surface , each of them premised on the givens : schools will open next week and provide more or less the same inferior education as previous years ; Johns Hopkins is building its biotech park expansion where the East Baltimore ghetto used to be and the ghetto is migrating due east and north - east ; the biotech park will be great for white folk with college degrees , for those with union cards , the factories are still closed and the port is still losing cargo to Norfolk ; a shooting here , a cutting there ...
All in all , an unremarkable summer .
Save for one lonely headline the other day - something that genuinely intrigues .
It 's a curious item - a draft report by a local non-profit foundation , a simple statistical study of the difference between Baltimore criminal juries and those of the surrounding , suburban counties .
It seems that in Baltimore , one of the most violent cities in America , jurors are far more reluctant to convict criminal defendants than in the suburban enclaves that ring the city .
The report upset the city 's chief prosecutor ; she thought its conclusions " politically divisive " and asked the foundation to either amend the draft study or kill it entirely .
The press mocked her for this , of course , and rightly so , while on the radio here , white talk - show hosts had fun speculating about why city jurors - read " black people " - wo n't do their civic duty when it is , in fact , their communities that are so overwhelmed by crime .
Everyone had something to say for a day or two , and of course , after that brief span of time , the entire issue disappeared into the glowing mediafest that was Michael Phelps and his remarkable collection of gold medals .
Phelps is from Baltimore , by the way .
As he is not wrapped in crime - scene tape , hampered by a budget shortfall or unable to raise his standardised test scores to the national average , we claim the great Olympian with considerable pride .
The boy can swim , yes he can .
In any event , the story about the reluctant city juries slipped quickly below the waves in the Beijing pool without anyone ever seriously inquiring into the why of it , much less attempting to do any actual reporting on the matter .
Anomaly noted .
Half - assed speculation offered .
On to new business .
But here 's the thing of which we can all be certain , the thing that fuels all the dramatic arcs of The Wire , in fact : the why is the only thing that actually matters .
The who , the what , the when , the where , even the how - every other building block in which journalists and policy planners and political leaders routinely trade - amount to nothing beyond the filler , interchangeable with the facts flung a year ago , a year from now and decades hence .
The why is it .
The why is what makes journalism an adult game .
The why is what makes policy coherent and useful .
The why is what transforms bureaucrats and foot soldiers and political leaders into viable instruments of rational and affirmative change .
The why is everything and without it , the very suggestion of human progress becomes a cosmic joke .
And in the American city , at the millennium , the why has ceased to exist .
When I read reviews and commentary on The Wire in the British press , I am usually moved to a peculiar and conflicted place .
I 'm gratified by the incredible amount of verbiage accorded our little drama and I 'm delighted to have the fundamental ideas and arguments of the piece discussed seriously .
But at the same time , I 'm acutely aware that our dystopian depiction of Baltimore has more appeal the farther one travels from America .
The Wire is , of course , dissent of a kind and it is true that there are many of my countrymen who are in fundamental disagreement with the manner in which the nation is being governed and managed .
But somehow , it sounds better to my ear when it's my own people talking trash and calling our problems out .
At the same time , it 's not just a question of standing , but of nuance as well .
I get that we 've been the bull in the china shop internationally , that we 've been arrogant and tone - deaf in so many arenas for so many years , and now , with the margins of the American empire being pressed , everyone is ready to embrace the requisite number of I - told - you - so moments .
Fair enough .
We had it coming .
But the emotion in all of that sometimes leads the overseas commentary about Baltimore and The Wire toward something that I do n't recognise as accurate .
Baltimore is not the inner circle of hell .
It is not entirely devoured by a drug economy that serves as its last viable industry .
It is not a place in which gangsters routinely fire clip after clip , spraying the streets in daylight ambushes .
It is not unlivable , or devoid of humanity , or a reservoir of unmitigated human despair .
I live in Baltimore , in a neighbourhood that is none of these things .
I am vested in the city and its future and I can drive you to places in this city that would transform even the most devout Wire fan into a fat , happy tourist .
Baltimore 's charms are no less plentiful than most American cities .
And yet there are places in Baltimore where The Wire is not at all hyperbole , where all of the depicted tragedy and waste and dysfunction are fixed , certain and constant .
And that place is , I might add , about 20 blocks from where I live .
That is the context of The Wire and that is the only context in which Baltimore - and by reasonable extension , urban America - can be fairly regarded .
There are two Americas - separate , unequal , and no longer even acknowledging each other except on the barest cultural terms .
In the one nation , new millionaires are minted every day .
In the other , human beings no longer necessary to our economy , to our society , are being devalued and destroyed .
Both things are true , and one gets a sense , reading the distant reaction to The Wire , that Europeans are far more ready to be convinced by one vision than the other .
I used to quote Churchill as declaring that a first - rate mind was one that could maintain two opposing ideas at the same time .
It certainly sounded Churchillian to me until someone better read pointed out that this notable quote is by F Scott Fitzgerald .
At first this disappoints , because the quote , to me , seems to argue for political nuance , for subtlety and precision in state affairs .
For a long while , the literary origin of the credo made no sense .
But then , The Wire .
As with Fitzgerald , we were selling story only .
And at all points , when filming our drama , we understood that we were arguing the case of one America to the other .
We were not saying everything , showing everything .
We focused on the urban dynamic of drugs , crime and race .
We argued the fraud of the drug war and offered an elegy for the death of union labour and the working class .
We ruminated on the political infrastructure and its inability to reform .
We picked a fight over the decline of public education and the lie behind our national claim to equality of opportunity .
And lastly , we suggested that in the end , no one in our media culture is paying attention or asking hard questions .
We did not contemplate immigration .
We largely ignored sex - based discrimination , feminism and gender issues .
We spoke not a word about the pyramid scheme that is the mortgage crisis , or the diminishing consumer class , or the time bomb that all of our China - bought debt might prove to be .
Nor did we glory in the healthy sectors of the American economy , in the growth industries of the information age .
We did not embrace Brooklyn Heights and West Los Angeles , Silicon Valley and Marin County .
Hell , we did n't even rest for more than a day or two in Roland Park or Mount Washington or Towson - those Baltimore neighbourhoods that define a viable , monied America .
We spoke to the other part of town , the forgotten place , the one they do n't tell many stories about , at least not in the medium of entertainment television .
It was a story rooted in truth , but it was n't the only story or the only truth .
Who , but a second - rate mind , would claim otherwise ?
Yet in my country , they actually argue the point .
While British audiences might believe The Wire to represent more than it does , Americans - many of them , at least - are quick to argue that it does n't represent everything and is therefore , somehow , not representative of anything at all .
Was the Wire myopic ?
Should it have been allowed to dwell for five seasons on that in America which is broken and brutal ?
Was it not obliged , as an act of journalistic equanimity , if not dramatic power , to display portions of the America where human lives are not marginalised and discarded ?
Well , there are about 350 television shows about the affluent America , the comfortable America , the viable and cohesive nation where everyone gets what they want if they either work hard or know someone or have a pretty face or cheat like hell .
That America is available every night , on every channel in the Comcast package .
For a brief time , there was one television drama about the other America .
Are we really going to debate whether it was one too many ?
Which brings us back to this week in Baltimore and that jury report , the one that everyone had something to say about , but no one actually bothered to analyse .
The draft study , which tracked jury trials in Baltimore over a one - year period from July 2005 , found that jurors in surrounding , predominantly white suburban counties were 30 times more likely to convict defendants of the most serious charge .
Overall in the surrounding counties , the acquittal rate was 27 % .
In the city , it was 43 % .
And the disinclination of Baltimore juries to convict drug defendants on serious charges was even more pronounced , according to the Baltimore Sun .
The Sun 's coverage indicated that the report 's author had speculated vaguely as to " population characteristics and socioeconomic factors " being relevant to the statistical variance .
The Sun itself provided no additional analysis , reportage , thought or speculation as to why city juries behave as they do .
Again , the why of the thing .
The only part that really matters .
Because in my city , we have fought the drug war to the very end of the line , with sergeants becoming lieutenants and majors becoming colonels and city mayors becoming state governors .
We have done so for decades , one day into the next , one administration after another , each claiming progress and measuring such in arrest rates , drug seizures , crime stats .
And no one asks : why ?
No one asks why , with all the arrests and seizures , the availability and purity of narcotics and cocaine has actually increased over the past three decades .
No one asks why , with all the law enforcement committed , whole tracts of the city have nonetheless degenerated into free - fire war zones .
No one asks why police commanders are routinely able to reduce the rates of robbery , or rape , or assault significantly in any time period prior to an election , while the murder rate - in which the victim can't be obscured or clerically " unfounded " - stays as high as ever .
And now , this week , no one asks why men and women from Baltimore , upon being given a chance to strike a blow against disorder and mayhem by convicting those charged criminally , would shirk their responsibility .
Well , here it is , plain as day ...
In order to elect Baltimore 's mayor as Maryland 's governor , crime had to go down .
And when that mayor was unable to do so legitimately , through a meaningful deterrent , his police officials did not merely go about cooking their statistics , making robberies and assaults disappear by corrupting the reporting of such incidents , they resorted to something far more disturbing .
For the last years of his administration , Mayor Martin O'Malley ordered the mass arrests of citizens in every struggling Baltimore neighbourhood , from eastside to west .
More than 100,000 bodies were dragged to Central Booking in a single year - record rates of arrest for a city with fewer than 700,000 residents .
Corner boys , touts , drug slingers , petty criminals - yes , they went in the wagons .
But school teachers , city workers , shopkeepers , delivery boys - they too were jacked up , cuffed and hauled down to Eager Street - hundreds of them a night on the weekends .
Some were charged , but few were prosecuted .
And in 25,000 such cases , they were later freed from the detention facility without ever going to court ; no charges were proffered because , well , no crime had been committed .
I was n't arrested .
Nor was Ed Burns or Dominic West or Aidan Gillen .
Nor were my neighbours or the Baltimore Sun 's editors or the members of the Maryland Club .
But then , we 're all white .
Among the black members of my cast and crew , it was often impossible to drive from the film set to home at night without being stopped - and in some cases detained or arrested - on nonexistent probable cause and nonexistent charges .
The crackdown came wholly in black neighbourhoods and it landed wholly on the backs of black citizens .
And now , just a few years later , comes this document that causes the state 's attorney to deny the obvious and leaves everyone else wondering weakly and vaguely as to the why of it .
Is it so hard to understand that the same people who had their civil rights cleanly dispatched , who spent nights in jail because police officers lied on them and dragged them off without charge - that these people might be inclined to disbelieve the word of law enforcement in any future criminal case ?
In places like West Baltimore , the drug war destroyed every last thing that the drugs themselves left standing - including the credibility of the police deterrent .
To elect one man to higher office , an entire city alienated its citizenry and destroyed its juror pool .
Mayor O'Malley is now Governor O'Malley .
The police commanders have all been promoted .
A daily newspaper that had no stomach for addressing the why a decade ago when it had 400 editors and reporters , a newspaper more consumed with prize submissions and gotcha stories than with complex analysis of its city 's problems , now has 220 bodies in its newsroom and is even less capable of the task .
And nothing , of course , changes .
Yes , such a scenario is grist for The Wire .
We could have easily built half a season out of the collapse of the Baltimore jury pool and the inability of city prosecutors to bring cases into court .
Yet there is also something appalling in the suggestion that a television drama - a presumed entertainment - might be a focal point for a discussion of what has gone wrong in urban America , for why we have become a society that no longer even recognises the depth of our problems , much less works to solve any of them .
But where else is the why even being argued any more ?
Not in the stunted political discourse of an American election cycle , not in an eviscerated , self - absorbed press , not in any construct to which the empowered America , the comfortable and comforted America , gives its limited attention .
To know why city juries wo n't participate in the drug war any more , to know why they have opted out of our collective dysfunction , you 'd have to travel to the other America - to West Fayette Street or Park Heights Avenue or East Madison Street or any other of the forgotten places .
And , well , as has already been said , we are separate nations at this point .
Few of us ever cross the frontier to hear voices different from our own .

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) -
The H9N2 bird flu strain , identified as a possible pandemic threat , could be infecting more humans than commonly thought but its mild symptoms mean it often goes undetected , a leading Hong Kong bird flu expert said .

“ It ’s quite possible ... H9N2 is infecting humans quite a lot , much ( more ) than we appreciate merely because it is beyond the radar , ” Malik Peiris , a Hong Kong - based microbiologist , told Reuters .
“ In humans , it is very mild , so most of the time it ’s probably not even recognized or biologically tested , ” said Peiris , who has co-authored several papers on the strain in recent years .
So far , only a handful of human H9N2 cases have been documented worldwide , including four children in Hong Kong in 2003 who suffered from mild fevers and coughs -- as well as a batch in China ’s Guangdong province , where people often live in close proximity to poultry , Peiris said .
The Hong Kong cases were only picked up by chance given the city ’s rigorous influenza testing regime , Peiris said .
“ It ’s quite a silent virus , it ’s not highly pathogenic ... and sometimes it causes some morbidity in poultry but by and large it is just there and it ’s unnoticed , ” Peiris said of the H9N2 strain .
The strain occurs mostly in birds , although it has also affected pigs and other animals in Europe and Asia .
Most influenza experts agree that a pandemic -- a deadly global epidemic -- of some kind of flu is inevitable .
No one can predict what kind but the chief suspect is the H5N1 bird flu virus , which has infected 385 people and killed 243 of them since 2003 .
However , flu experts at the University of Maryland , St. Jude ’s Children ’s Research hospital in Memphis and elsewhere recently wrote in the Public Library of Science journal PLoS ONE that the H9N2 strain posed a “ significant threat for humans ” .
They found that just a few mutations could turn it into a virus that people catch and transmit easily .
Peiris said that while the H9N2 strain might be more transmissible , its effects would be far less devastating than a possible H5N1 pandemic .
“ There are other viruses out there besides H5N1 that could be the next pandemic , ” Peiris said .
“ But I suspect ( H9N2 ) will not be so severe in its outcome . ”
Peiris pointed out that the last three major pandemics vastly differed in their severity , with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic killing an estimated 50 million people worldwide , whereas the “ Hong Kong ” flu in 1968 killed around one million .
There are hundreds of strains of avian influenza virus but only four -- H5N1 , H7N3 , H7N7 , and H9N2 - are known to have caused human infections , according to the World Health Organization .
Pollution can make children fat , startling new research shows .
A groundbreaking Spanish study indicates that exposure to a range of common chemicals before birth sets up a baby to grow up stout , thus helping to drive the worldwide obesity epidemic .
The results of the study , just published – the first to link chemical contamination in the womb with one of the developing world 's greatest and fastest - growing health crises – carry huge potential implications for public policy around the globe .
They undermine recent strictures from the Conservative leader , David Cameron , that blame solely the obese for their own condition .
A quarter of all British adults and a fifth of children are obese – four times as many as 30 years ago .
And so are at least 300 million people worldwide .
The main explanation is that they are consuming more calories than they burn .
But there is growing evidence that diet and lack of exercise , though critical , cannot alone explain the rapid growth of the epidemic .

It has long been known that genetics give people different metabolisms , making some gain weight more easily than others .
But the new study by scientists at Barcelona 's Municipal Institute of Medical Research suggests that pollution may similarly predispose people to get fat .
The research , published in the current issue of the journal Acta Paediatrica , measured levels of hexachlorobenzene ( HCB ) , a pesticide , in the umbilical cords of 403 children born on the Spanish island of Menorca , from before birth .
It found that those with the highest levels were twice as likely to be obese when they reached the age of six and a half .
HCB , which was mainly used to treat seeds , has been banned internationally since the children were born , but its persistence ensures that it remains in the environment and gets into food .
The importance of the study is not so much in identifying one chemical , as in showing what is likely to be happening as a result of contact with many of them .
Its authors call for exposures to similar pesticides to be " minimised " .
Experiments have shown that many chemicals fed to pregnant animals cause their offspring to grow up obese .
These include organotins , long employed in antifouling paints on ships and now widely found in fish ; bisphenol A ( BPA ) , used in baby bottles and to line cans of food , among countless other applications ; and phthalates , found in cosmetics , shampoos , plastics to wrap food , and in a host of other everyday products .
These pollutants – dubbed " obesogens " as a result of these findings – are so ubiquitous that almost everyone now has them in their bodies .
Ninety - five per cent of Americans excrete BPA in their urine ; 90 per cent of babies have been found to be exposed to phthalates in the womb ; and every umbilical cord analysed in the new Spanish study was found to contain organchlorine pesticides such as HCB .
Two American studies have implicated phthalates in obesity in adult men , but the new research is much more conclusive , and is the first to show the effects of exposure in the womb , where humans are most vulnerable .
Dr Pete Myers , one of the world 's leading experts on obesogens , told The Independent on Sunday last night : " This is very important .
It is the first good study of the effects on the foetus .
Its conclusions are not surprising , given what we know from the animal experiments , but it firmly links such chemicals to the biggest challenge facing public health today . "
No one knows how HCB causes obesity .
The Spanish scientists speculate that it may have made the mothers diabetic , which would increase the chances of their children becoming obese ( see graphic , above ) .
Dr Myers , who is chief scientist at the US - based Environmental Health Sciences , which helps to increase public understanding of emerging scientific links , says this is " plausible " , but adds that the animal experiments point elsewhere .
These have shown that obesogens " switch genes on and off " in the womb , causing stem cells to be turned into fat cells .
The children then grow up with a much greater disposition to store and accumulate fat .
Whatever the explanation , the research goes some way to undermining David Cameron 's assertion in a speech this summer that obesity is purely a matter of " personal responsibility " , a view echoed by his health spokesman , Andrew Lansley 10 days ago .
The Tory leader said that the obese are " people who eat too much and take too little exercise " .
Dr Myers calls that " wishful ideological thinking which does not accord with biological reality " , adding : " We need to discover ways to reduce exposures to these chemicals so that changing diet and lifestyle has a chance to work . "
Factors that may pile on the pounds
Why is the world getting so fat ?
Everyone agrees that people gain weight by taking in more calories in their food than they burn off through everyday activities and exercise .
But many scientists are coming to believe that changes in diet and exercise do not sufficiently explain the rapid growth of the epidemic .
As ' The Independent on Sunday ' reported last week , there has been no reduction in physical activity in Britain since 1980 , while obesity rates have quadrupled .
The genetic make - up of a population does not change rapidly enough to provide an explanation .
So the hunt is on for other factors that might show why more people are gaining weight more easily .
Life before birth .
Both overweight and underweight babies are more likely to grow up fat .
So are those born to smokers .
Evidence suggests pollution is also predisposing the unborn to obesity .
The introduction and increase in the use of such chemicals coincides with the epidemic taking off .
Age of mothers .
The chances of becoming obese increase with maternal age .
And the average age of first giving birth has gone up by 2.6 years in Britain since 1970 .
Less sleep .
Both children and adults are more likely to get fat if they get too little sleep , partly because they become hungrier .
Average daily sleep has fallen from nine to seven hours over recent decades .
Temperature .
People burn up more calories when they are cold .
Central heating has ensured that they spend most of their time in comfortable temperatures .
Prescription drugs .
Some drugs – including anti-psychotics , antidepressants and treatments for diabetes – cause people to gain weight .
Stopping smoking .
Though mothers who smoke may make their children fat , they – and all smokers – are themselves less likely to put on weight .
As the habit has decreased , obesity has soared .

John McCain canceled a scheduled appearance on CBS ’s “ Late Show with David Letterman ” just a few hours before he was supposed to go on and tape the show that was scheduled to appear Wednesday night .
However , since McCain has “ suspended ” his campaign , he personally called Letterman to say that he was immediately flying back to Washington D.C. to work on the bill regarding the economic crisis .
During the show though , Letterman learns that McCain was , in fact just down the street being interviewed by Katie Couric .
Dave even cut over to the live video of the interview , and said , “ Hey Senator , can I give you a ride home ? ”
Earlier in the show , Dave kept saying , “ You do n’t suspend your campaign .
This does n’t smell right .
This is n’t the way a tested hero behaves . ”
And he joked : “ I think someone ’s putting something in his metamucil . ”
“ He ca n’t run the campaign because the economy is cratering ?
Fine , put in your second string quarterback , Sarah Palin .
Where is she ? ”
“ What are you going to do if you ’re elected and things get tough ?
Suspend being president ?
We ’ve got a guy like that now ! ”

The report criticises government plans to cut funding for advisory agencies
The government needs to step up efforts to reduce waste from business , according to a parliamentary committee .
The House of Lords Science and Technology Committee recommends using variable VAT rates to cut unsustainable consumption of raw materials .
Its report says pressure has so far concentrated on householders , who account for only 9 % of the UK 's waste .
Environment minister Joan Ruddock said the government does have measures that are inducing businesses to cut waste .
Those measures include the landfill tax escalator under which the tax on landfill will rise by £ 8 per tonne each year until 2011 .

The committee acknowledged that this had been effective in reducing the amount of waste dumped in landfill sites , but said other initiatives were needed .
" We would like to see the VAT regime reformed so that products that have a long life - cycle , or can be easily and cheaply repaired rather than replaced , are made economically more attractive , " said Lord O'Neill , who chaired the sub - committee on waste .
" This would be an important step in turning away from the ' throwaway ' consumer culture we currently have . "
' Disappointing ' cuts
About one - third of the UK's waste is produced by construction and demolition , and a further third by mining and quarrying .
Nevertheless , the committee says , government action and media attention have concentrated on the much smaller contribution from households .
Councils too should change focus , it recommends , to prioritise reducing waste from businesses .
A month without plastic
Some business leaders interviewed by the committee said each company should be made responsible for the waste associated with its own products , a recommendation that the committee endorsed .
Lord O'Neill said this would ensure that " manufacturers who behave irresponsibly face financial consequences and those who are doing the right thing are supported . "
Another recommendation is that the government should ring - fence a proportion of revenue raised from the landfill tax for agencies charged with reducing business waste .
Envirowise and the Waste and the Resources Action Programme ( Wrap ) are among the agencies whose budgets are being cut - a move about which the committee expresses " extreme disappointment " .
The committee also refers to an issue often expressed by environmentalists - that the advice that people receive in the UK focuses too much on recycling , and not enough on reducing consumption .
The argument is that policies should aim first at reducing what people use , then encourage re-use , and only then stimulate recycling .
" If our society was to implement the hierarchy effectively , a far smaller amount of waste would need to be disposed of after all the previous stages had been put into practice , " the committee concludes .

Bush administration scandals , as of January 18 , 2005 , according to Salon 's Peter Dzikes , came to a grand total of 34 for the " first four years of George Bush 's presidency . " [ 1 ]
On January 13 , 2005 , Katrina vanden Heuvel posted her list in The Nation of " the Bush Administration 's Ten Most Outrageous Scandals thus far uncovered by government investigators . " :
Halliburton 's Corruption
Iraq 's Decline
Abu Ghraib Prison Torture
CIA Pre -9/11 Intelligence Failures
HHS Deceptive Ad Campaign
HHS Scully Scandal
Government - wide Accounting Problems
Sex Education Misinformation
CAPPS II Failures
Real Costs of the Iraq War
It was less than one year ago , on April 20 , 2004 , Thomas R. Asher , writing for Tom Paine , headlined with " Losing Control " -- " Echoes of Watergate fill the air : a president is charged with misdeeds .
He is besieged by plans gone awry , betrayed by underlings blowing whistles , harassed by a once - compliant press and barraged by querulous demands for data , documents and testimony . "
Asher added : " George W. Bush , who reveres power , is losing his own as events in Washington and Iraq , and their public portrayal , slip from his grasp .
His predicaments are rooted less in Lord Acton 's adage that ' power corrupts ' than its corollary that power seduces its holders into overestimating their strength and ignoring its limits .
Bush has an inflated sense of several variants of power : bending others to one 's will , be they subjects , messengers , adversaries or enemies ; silencing dissent ; protecting secrets ; and building and preserving credibility .
The latter is especially important in an election year . " [ 2 ]
Additionally , Asher writes , " Bush faces a wider range of potential scandals , which include : [ 3 ]
Iraq : the rationale for , cost of , and occupation plans following America 's conquest ( DOS , DOD , CIA , FBI ) ;
Suppressed Medicare costs ( HHS ) and bioterrorism studies ( DOD ) ;
Insufficient terrorism preparedness and prevention , domestic and international , before and after 9/11 ( CIA , FBI , DOD , etc. ) ;
Mounting fiscal deficits and tax relief only for the wealthy ( Treasury , OMB ) ; and
Skewed or suppressed scientific research and policies ( NIH , HHS , FDA , EPA ) .
" The president and his administration , in Watergate mode , " he says , " already find themselves focusing more on damage control than new initiatives , both in Washington and Baghdad .
They spend time with lawyers and spinmeisters , rather than policy advisors , and are bogged down in old problems , which prevents them from focusing on the cascade of new ones .
Their power to ' embed ' or bully the skeptical media is diminishing .
And Mr. Bush 's re-election campaign is increasingly shrill , scattered , partisan and reactive -- not the image of serene confidence and control he hoped to project . " [ 4 ]
Amazingly , he points out , " Mr. Bush 's multiple misrepresentations and misjudgments put him in position to break a key Watergate speed record .
From the Watergate burglary on June 17 , 1971 to Nixon 's resignation on Aug. 8 , 1974 , it took some 38 months .
In between , Nixon managed to keep the tawdry facts and circumstances under sufficient control to win re-election in 1972 .
In contrast , from the first ' new product ' announcement of the Iraq invasion in early September , 2002 , to election day November 2 , 2004 , is a mere 26 months , which would beat Nixon 's record by 33 percent . " [ 5 ]
Compared to the Vietnam War fallout , he writes , Bush may establish another " world record " :
" Iraq also may eclipse the presidential war blowback record set by Vietnam .
Of course , no civilized exit strategy for American hegemony and troops currently exists and the likelihood of an international takeover is diminished because of ( a ) little support among our NATO allies , ( b ) a timorous United Nations , further weakened by the Bush administration 's lack of respect and support , and ( c ) Bush 's continued refusal to relinquish effective control .
It took six years , from 1962 to 1968 , for Vietnam to undo a president , Lyndon B. Johnson ; five years if you count only his time as president .
In contrast , the Iraq war began in March , 2003 , fewer than 19 months before Election Day 2004 . " [ 6 ]
A month earlier , in fact , on March 19 , 2004 , the administration 's scandals were reaching the point that The Carpetbagger Report - -" Scandal after scandal after scandal " -- claimed to be having flashbacks to scandal fatigue ( " a conservative buzz phrase from the late 90s " ) . [ 7 ]
At the time of that posting , the daily weblog cited no less than twelve " substantive scandals involving the GOP in the last three years " :
" The Most Dangerous Man in the World "
In the March 19 , 2004 , edition of Capitol Hill Blue , Doug Thompson wrote about " The Most Dangerous Man in the World " .
On the anniversary of the launch of shock and awe in Iraq , Thompson says that the " invasion was necessary , we were told by our leaders , because Saddam Hussein was ' the most dangerous man in the world , ' had weapons of mass destruction and had helped Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda kill more than 3,000 civilians in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania on September 11 , 2001 .
" President George W. Bush told the nation and the world he had proof of all this and Congress approved the rush to war , even though doing so meant scaling back our search for bin Laden in Afghanistan .
" That was then .
This is now , " he wrote .
" Now we know that Hussein 's so - called weapons of mass destruction did not exist because his scientists lacked both the resources and the expertise to actually build them .
Now we know that our ' proof ' of a hard link between Hussein and bin Laden came from faulty intelligence and any real link has yet to be proven . "
" We know now that Saddam Hussein did not pose any real imminent threat to the U.S. Hussein was , at best , a sham leader who controlled his country through illusion , deceit and bluster .
Ironically , he was brought down by a military sent into battle by another sham leader who controls his country through illusion , deceit and bluster .
" On the news talk shows this morning and in speeches throughout the day , the Bush administration tries to justify the war with Iraq by calling Saddam Hussein ' the most dangerous man in the world . '
" But the most dangerous man in the world is not sitting in a jail cell somewhere in Iraq .
" He is not hiding out in a cave somewhere in Afghanistan .
" Not really .
The most dangerous man in the world may well be working out of an oval - shaped office at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington , DC . "

The number of women holding senior posts in politics , the law and the media has fallen compared with last year , according to a report .
The Equality and Human Rights Commission ( EHRC ) said that in 12 of 25 job categories it studied , there were fewer women holding top posts .
Women 's representation had increased in eight areas , including company directors and the civil service .
The EHRC said some women faced a " concrete ceiling " , not a glass one .
The commission also wants more flexible working to help women rise to the top .
The EHRC said its annual study of women in top positions of power and influence across public and private sectors showed the biggest number of reversals since the report was started five years ago .
Nicola Brewer , the chief executive of the EHRC , said : " Workplaces forged in an era of stay - at - home mums and breadwinner dads are putting too many barriers in the way , resulting in an avoidable loss of talent at the top .
Sun editor Rebekah
Wade is one of the few women at the top of her career " We always speak of a glass ceiling .
These figures reveal that in some cases it appears to be made of reinforced concrete . "
' Snail 's pace '
According to the report , there are now fewer women MPs , cabinet members , national newspaper editors , senior police officers and judges , NHS executives , trade union leaders and heads of professional bodies , compared with 2007 .
The number of female media bosses , MEPs , directors of major museums and galleries , chairs of national arts companies and holders of senior ranks in the Armed Forces has remained the same .
Women 's representation had increased in the House of Lords and among company directors , council leaders , university vice - chancellors and top civil service managers .
However , in six of these categories the increase was less than 1 % .
The commission said opportunities for ambitious women to reach the top of their career were changing at a " snail 's pace " .
It blamed Britain 's business culture of long working days and inflexible working practices for discouraging women who want to both work and raise a family .
Miss Brewer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme : " There is a bit of discrimination still going on and that still needs to be challenged .
At the commission 's helpline , we still get a high proportion of calls from women at work who are pregnant who are suffering difficulties .
" There are also bigger things going on about how the workplace is organised , how it 's really quite inflexible , how there is a lot of occupational segregation and how the definition of success is still quite old fashioned . "
' Draining combination '
The report , Sex and Power , said : " Often women experience a draining combination of outdated working practices and a long hours culture alongside the absence of appropriate high quality , affordable childcare or social care . "

TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said : " This survey proves that the softly - softly approach towards breaking down the glass ceiling is not working .
" A firmer approach is needed so that women can reach the top on merit , rather than by having to fight every obstacle that society puts in their way . "
Harriet Harman , Minister for Women and Equality , said : " We have made great progress but we still have a long way to go . "

What if you were lost and alone in the wild ?
Imagine that you have no experience hunting and there 's no river to fish .
What if your only food source was crawling underfoot ?
That 's right -- bugs .
It may not be a gourmand 's preference , but now is n't the time to get picky -- it 's a matter of life or death .
Maybe you should pull up that rotten log and chow down on some termites .
That would be an excellent plan -- termites are loaded with protein and the second most eaten insect on Earth .
Or perhaps dig for some worms -- they have plenty of protein , and these squiggly fellows can be downed raw or cooked .
Whatever your pleasure , you have your choice from more than 1,400 edible insects to choose from .
If you 're from the United States , Europe or Canada , you may think that eating a bug is something reserved for bets , dares and reality TV shows .
The rest of the world has a different perspective .
All over Asia , Africa , Australia , Central and South America , people eat insects .
It 's called entomophagy , and it 's been around for centuries .
Insects have great nutritional value , are generally low in carbohydrates and fat and are easily raised and harvested -- for a fraction of the cost of livestock .
You can read more about this in How Entomophagy Works .

By Mark Mitchell , with reporting by the Deep Capture Team
Introduction – by Mark Mitchell
Published May 4 , 2008
I began working on a version of this story in January 2006 , while serving as an editor for the Columbia Journalism Review , a publication tasked with upholding the standards of the American media .
In November 2006 , a hedge fund that was at the center of the scandal I was investigating offered the Columbia Journalism Review a great deal of money .
Shortly before CJR accepted the money , I left my job , so I do not know if my editors , whom I believe to be honest people , would have allowed me to persevere .
But I have no doubt that the hedge fund ’s “ beneficence ” was aimed at preventing the publication of stories like this one .
And it might well have succeeded if Patrick Byrne had not approached me with an idea .
Why not combine forces and spearhead a whole new approach to investigative journalism ?
Most media content is produced by rumpled journalists ( i.e. , people like me ) , working alone under tight constraints .
Deep Capture could be something different – a power team circumventing the traditional media and pushing limits to uncover the truth .
When I entered the picture , this team had already established that a small number of law - breaking hedge funds had put the American financial system at risk of collapse .
Indeed , the hedge funds are employing the same tactics that contributed to the stock market crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed .
If you want to understand the current turmoil in our financial markets , you could do no better than to read the material in Deep Capture : The Analysis .
The lengthy ( 40,000 word ) story that follows should help you to understand how – and why — Patrick came to embark on this project .
I am the author of the story , and attest to its accuracy , but it benefits substantially from the work of the Deep Capture team : freelance researchers , bloggers , gonzo computer hackers , economists , and even a one - time foreign intelligence agent .
Some mainstream journalists will not like this story .
They will perhaps disapprove of our methods or decry the advent of vigilante journalism .
But most of all , they will not like this story because it is largely about them – a tale of reporters who seek to be players , but instead become pawns – a tale of prominent journalists who help cover up a massive financial crime while toadying to some of Wall Street ’s slimiest operators .
* * * * * * * *
And it all starts when Patrick Byrne gets a phone call from the Easter Bunny .
Really , that ’s what the guy calls himself – the Easter Bunny – and he talks like the Bee Gees on fast forward , a nasally frantic falsetto , on and on about some kind of conspiracy involving big time Wall Street operators , the Mafia , and a bunch of famous journalists .
Somebody ’s got to stop these people , the Bunny says , or the American financial system is going to come crashing to its knees .
Also , the bad guys might put a bullet between the Easter Bunny ’s ears .
Now , Patrick Byrne is just a CEO in Utah — he sells toasters .
He does n’t see what this has to do with him , and the Easter Bunny seems pretty weird , so he says , uh - huh , uh - huh , okey - dokey , and thinks maybe he ’ll hang up the phone and go for a pastrami sandwich .
But the Easter Bunny persists .
He says it ’s a conspiracy , the biggest financial heist in history … look , he says , do n’t believe it , but he ’s going to make some predictions –and Patrick can see for himself whether they come true …

August 12 , 2005 … the proudest day of Patrick Byrne ’s life .
Some months have past since the Easter Bunny got in touch , and now Patrick is on a conference call with 500 blue chip investors and a few journalists .
He tells his telephone audience that he ’s been talking to this fellow named Bob ( which is another Easter Bunny alias ) , and Bob seems like he lines his hat with tinfoil , he really does , but he ’s laid out this scheme , he ’s made some predictions … so everybody please download Patrick ’s computer generated slide show and follow along from home .
The first slide reads , “ The Miscreants ’ Ball . ”
Patrick says the miscreants are selling billions of dollars of stock that simply does not exist – phantom stock .
They have destroyed hundreds of public companies for profit .
Some journalists , meanwhile , are “ crooked . ”
They ’re “ lickspittles . ”
They are famous journalists and they cover up the miscreants ’ crimes .
They attack all who oppose them .
One reporter has been terrorizing a little old lady in Vegas , purported to be the Easter Bunny ’s mother .
Another reporter , she ’s French — she ’s been telling people that Patrick is running some kind of criminal cabal out of a gay bathhouse in San Francisco .
And that ’s not all , follow along please with the slides — they show how the miscreants and the journalists have ties to government agencies and private investigators , maybe the Mafia , and also an arms dealer , an undercover mole , a corrupt law firm , and Eliot Spitzer .
There ’s mention , too , of a “ master criminal from the 1980s ” — call him “ the Sith Lord , ” like in Star Wars – he might be orchestrating all this , and Patrick ca n’t just sit on his hands , he ’s not cut out for it , it ’s his black Irish temper , so he ’s going to say to the Sith Lord , to the miscreants , to the journalists : “ Did I stutter ?
Did I stutter , or did I say I was going to take this fight to you ?
“ Well , now you know what I mean . ”
* * * * * * * *
Patrick is the CEO of Overstock.com and , truth be told , his company sells more than just toasters .
It is a discount retail outlet that sells all sorts of stuff – one of the fastest growing companies on the Web and a company that seemed , at least for a while , like it might become a serious competitor to Amazon .
But in the time since the “ Miscreants ’ Ball ” presentation , Patrick has been better known for his fight against Wall Street – and for embracing something called the Market Reform Movement .
The Market Reform Movement is an uprising born of a new era – when you do n’t have to be entirely normal to make a positive difference in the world .
It is a loose coalition of eloquent ranters and the ingeniously unhinged – internet lurkers , lonely muckrakers , and apocalyptic visionaries .
They battled in obscurity for years before Patrick lent a sympathetic ear to the Easter Bunny , who was among the movement ’s chief agitators .
Note : Deep Capture has met the Easter Bunny ( who also uses the alias Bob O’Brien ) on several occasions .
We think he ’s brilliant , and consider him part of our team , but we maintain a pledge never to ask for his real name because he fears for his safety .
Shortly after the Easter Bunny ’s initial call to Patrick , a clique of journalists with close ties to the miscreants begin a two - year campaign to unmask him .
Throughout , they suggest that the Easter Bunny is somehow suspicious – a criminal , maybe .
Then , finally , in September 2005 , The New York Post publishes the sinister , hot - off - the - presses news that the Easter Bunny is , in fact , a used medical equipment salesman named Phil .
Whatever .
The Bunny and his fellow town criers have what is surely the world ’s largest database of Wall Street malfeasance .
Patrick examines their data with an open mind .
He lends some structure to their efforts .
He funds an expanded investigation .
And gradually , he comes to see , clear as day – there is a crime .
It is a financial heist of monstrous proportions , and Patrick believes it threatens the stability of the American financial system .
He decides to fight the criminals .
And then , something amazing happens : the Market Reform Movement goes mainstream .
Members of Congress , brave individuals inside the Securities and Exchange Commission , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , famous trial lawyers , respected economists and recovering stock brokers all reach the same conclusion : hundreds of companies have been victimized by the very crimes that Patrick laid out in his “ Miscreants ’ Ball ” presentation – the ones that the Easter Bunny and his band of blogging oddballs have been describing for years .
* * * * * * * *
The crimes are the work of Wall Street hedge fund managers and brokers who engage in a common trading strategy known as short - selling .
A short sale is a way of making money when the price of a stock goes down .
You borrow shares from someone else and immediately sell them off .
If the price drops , you buy the shares back and return them to the original owner , pocketing the difference .
If a company goes out of business , short - sellers hit the jackpot .
This is perfectly legal and unobjectionable .
But some short - sellers do not play by the rules .
A small group of powerful hedge fund managers stop at nothing to annihilate the companies they sell short .
Their tactics include : blackmail , smear campaigns , espionage , fraud , harassment , extortion , bribery , rumor - mongering , sabotage , off - shore money laundering , political cronyism , frivolous lawsuits , witness tampering , biased financial research , false identities , bogus credit ratings , bribery , libelous blogs , bad science , forgery , wiretapping , counterfeiting , collusion , lying , cheating , threats and theft .
Their most egregious trick is to sell “ phantom stock . ”
By exploiting a glitch in Wall Street ’s computerized trading system , and a loophole in federal regulations , some hedge funds sell virtually unlimited amounts of stock that they have not yet borrowed or purchased .
This is often referred to as “ naked short selling . ”
Hedge funds use this tactic to flood the market with supply and drive down prices – which is blatantly illegal .
Patrick has written a blog explaining how this works in laymen ’s terms .
An economist has written a detailed history of “ failures to deliver ” ( i.e. stock sold and not delivered , because it is phantom stock ) for Regulation magazine , published by the Cato Institute .
A former SEC Chairman has spoken extensively against the problem .
Many other researchers , several professors , a former SEC economist , and a former deputy secretary of commerce have also written papers on the subject .
If you are interested in the mechanics of the crime , read some of those papers here , here , here , here , here , and here .
But it is enough to know that by the time Patrick gives his “ Miscreants ’ Ball ” presentation , the Securities and Exchange Commission has published a list of more than 300 companies whose stock has been sold but never delivered in excessive quantities .
In other words , a significant fraction of the stock sold in more than 300 companies is phantom stock .
If you think you own shares in one of these companies , the chances are that a broker has sold you air to satisfy a crooked hedge fund client .
The computer might say that you own stock , but in reality , you do not .
In addition to the 300 - plus companies on the SEC ’s list , as many as 1,000 companies have already been wiped off the map by illegal short - selling , according to some experts .
Short - sellers ’ collusive behavior and dubious tactics might have contributed to the demise in March , 2008 , of Bear Stearns , America ’s fifth - largest investment bank .
The Chairman of the SEC recently told the U.S. Senate that the SEC is investigating precisely this possibility .
The consensus among economists is that if the Federal Reserve had not intervened , the fall of Bear Stearns would have triggered the collapse of the American financial system .
Similarly collusive “ bear raids ” contributed to the great crash of 1929 .
SEC officials fail to prosecute the criminals even as they suggest that miscreant short - sellers have put the American financial system at morbid risk .
Clearly , this is a scandal of epic proportions .
Which raises the question :
Where the hell is our media ?
* * * * * * * *
February 27 , 2006 … Herb Greenberg is leaning forward on his stool .
His arms are flapping and his eyes are popping .
His face has gone hot - purple , stark against the red - blue television glow .
It is six months since Patrick ’s now - legendary “ Miscreants ’ Ball ” presentation , and , Herb , the famous journalist , is live on CNBC .
He is pretty sure there is a conspiracy .
It is a conspiracy to get Herb .
Yes , “ What ’s really going on is there ’s a conspiracy .
There ’s another conspiracy , there is a conspiracy - the real conspiracy , if there is a conspiracy , is a conspiracy …it ’s aaaall tied to the same thing , this whoooole concept of trying to make sure , make it so this guy [ Herb ] ca n’t do his job anymore . ”
Sitting next to Herb , nodding in agreement , is Jim Cramer , host of “ Mad Money . ”
This program is all that keeps CNBC out of the ratings quicksand , and it is easy to understand its appeal .
Cramer is manifestly chimpanzee - like in both comportment and worldview–a fully arresting specimen of unsated mammalian appetition–a self - styled “ journalist ” who grunts and growls and snorts and says funny things like “ Booyah ! ” while jumping up and down , smashing chairs , and telling people how to make shitloads of money gambling on the markets .
Good TV !
It is impossible to overstate the effect that these characters have had on our public discourse .
It is not just that they have propagated a style of “ journalism ” that sees short - term stock flipping ( rather than long - term investment ) as the holiest of all business endeavors .
It is that close associates of Herb and Cramer have seized control of a vast swath of the American financial media .
Indeed , if you have seen a negative story about a public company in recent years , the odds are greater than even that it was written by a friend - of - Cramer .
Many of Cramer ’s friends are former employees of TheStreet.com , a financial news website substantially owned by Cramer .
They have included the editor and top columnists for The Wall Street Journal “ Money & Investing ” section , top business writers for The New York Times , reporters at Fortune magazine and BusinessWeek , the editor of The New York Post business page , the editor of MSN Money , and others .
Herb , a CNBC commentator and a star columnist for MarketWatch.com , was among the founding editors of TheStreet.com – “ Murderers Row , ” they called themselves .
I have analyzed well over a thousand stories written by this clique of journalists .
The vast majority of them were sourced from a small group of short - sellers who are also friends of Cramer .
Other popular sources for this group of journalists include convicted felons , mobsters , dubious private investigators , crooked lawyers , hired stock bashers , and gun-toting goons – most of whom are tied to the Cramer constellation of short - sellers .
Some of the stories written by these reporters are accurate enough .
But many are not .
The journalists misconstrue data with seemingly purposeful intent .
They exaggerate and obfuscate .
They publish innuendo or merely repeat , Deus Optimus Maximus , the words of their hedge fund and criminal friends .
A single negative story by one of these reporter - thugs can send a company ’s stock tumbling by more than 50 % — pure profit for their hedge fund sources , who of course sell the company short ( often right before the articles are published ) .
Meanwhile , an overwhelming majority of the companies targeted by these journalists will also be the victims of phantom stock selling and other shenanigans .
The journalists do not mention this in their stories , and in fact go out of their way to deny that phantom stock exists .
Anyone who says otherwise is subjected to a vicious media smear .
So it was that Patrick ’s “ Miscreants ’ Ball ” presentation provoked a barrage of media coverage .
Setting the tone was a next - day story in The New York Post business section , written by Roddy Boyd and edited by Dan Colarusso , formerly of TheStreet.com .
The story was accompanied by a large photograph that showed Patrick in a tight t- shirt , arms spread , slightly bug - eyed .
Hovering over his head , there was a big , multicolored flying saucer .
Patrick Byrne “ is not currently under any psychiatric care , ” reported the Post , “ and [ a company spokesman confirmed ] he was sober when he gave the presentation . ”
* * * * * * * *
Patrick is unfazed .
He works tirelessly , criss - crossing the nation , gathering evidence – telling all who will listen that the hobgoblins of finance and their snickering note - takers are destroying companies and putting the American financial system at risk .
But these miscreants –they control the airwaves , they ’ve seized control of the whole gosh darn media machine and the message they keep on delivering , unchallenged , over and over , is that Patrick Byrne is an incontrovertible psychopath .
They say he ’s a wacko .
They say he ’s a liar , too .
And a creep .
A menace .
A crook , even !
They says his company is the next Enron .
Hell , they say , he ’s got a nudie bar dancer running the place !
A nudie bar dancer ?
Yes , that ’s what some journalists say .
The story first appears in November , 2005 , on a blog authored by Jeff Matthews , a former writer for TheStreet.com .
Patrick has to go to great lengths to demonstrate that the story is false – that his vice president of marketing is not and never was a stripper .
This , he says , is not to disparage the profession –he ’s friends with a few “ wigglers ” and they ’re all finer human beings than certain New York hedge fund managers and financial journalists .
Which , by February 2006 , seems to me an awful lot like wisdom – a view supported , anyway , not only by the noble spirit and perspicacity of your average wiggler , but also by the spectacle that is unfolding live on CNBC .
Herb the famous journalist is yammering about a conspiracy – a conspiracy to get Herb .
He is angry .
He is perhaps also scared .
He is downright hysterical because the government is investigating .
This investigation will soon be derailed – the victim of cowardice and strange events – but for now , in February 2006 , the Securities and Exchange Commission would like to know whether a financial research shop called Gradient Analytics conspired with short - selling hedge fund managers , including a man named David Rocker , to disseminate false information about public companies as part of a scheme to manipulate stock prices .
The investigators believe that Jim Cramer and Herb are central to this conspiracy and have issued them both with subpoenas .
The Street.com got a subpoena , too .
Herb thinks this is an outrage - a conspiracy to destroy Herb .
He says he has no special relationship with Rocker or Gradient .
Cramer says he ’s never heard of Gradient and he ’s met Rocker only once – in a grocery store .
So Herb and Cramer have commandeered the CNBC television network .
For several days , the endless lead - ins : Coming Up Next :
We ’ll hear from Herb !
Coming Up Next : Herb and Cramer tell the world that Patrick Byrne and his band of blogging freaks orchestrated the “ whoooole ” thing – the whole government investigation .
Patrick Byrne is rich .
He ’s suspicious .
He ’s a menace .
He orchestrated the “ whoooole ” investigation to silence the free press – the free press as epitomized by Herb and Cramer .
Coming Up Next :
It ’s an outrage !
Coming Up Next :
It ’s a conspiracy !
Coming Up Next : More on this conspiracy .
* * * * * * * *
Cramer , who is a sociopath , owns TheStreet.com with Marty Peretz , who is an aristocrat .
Peretz is also the former editor of the New Republic magazine .
He dabbles in high finance and Harvard professing , which has resulted in his entrusting a large portion of his family fortune to a close - knit group of hedge fund managers , several of whom were his students .
For example , Cramer was his student .
Then Cramer was destitute .
He lived in a car with a loaded gun hidden under the seat .
Eventually , though , Peretz gave Cramer some money to start a hedge fund , which Cramer managed with celebrated ruthlessness until he resolved to seek spiritual enlightenment as a TV news host .
Cramer had originally planned to run his hedge fund out of the offices of Ivan Boesky .
Shortly before he was to move in , however , the feds busted Boesky for insider trading , making him one of the most famous criminals of the 1980s .
( This is not necessarily to suggest that Boesky is the “ Sith Lord ” mentioned in Patrick ’s “ Miscreants Ball ” presentation .
Some people have wagered that Patrick was referring to Michael Milken , a business colleague of Boesky known as the “ junk bond king , ” who also went to prison in the 1980s .
Patrick has since modified the analogy , saying that the crime has multiple masterminds – “ like Al Qaeda ” ) .
When Boesky went to prison , Cramer worked instead with hedge fund manager Michael Steinhardt .
The media portrays Steinhardt as a financial wizard , a deep thinker and an all - around swell guy .
The truth is , he ’s a thug who perfected the concept of trading on privileged information , and pounded it into the heads of his employees .
“ What ’s your edge ! ? ” he ’d shout , pacing his trading room floor .
“ What ’s your fucking edge ! ? ”
After one of Steinhardt ’s tirades , a top employee ( and the godfather to Steinhardt ’s children ) had a heart attack .
It is said that Steinhardt showed no remorse .
Indeed , Steinhardt has one of the most fearsome reputations on Wall Street .
Which is perhaps unsurprising given that Steinhardt ’s father , Sol “ Red ” Steinhardt , was a mobster once described by a Manhattan district attorney as the biggest Mafia fence in America .
Steinhardt Sr. worked for the Genovese organized crime family , with goons like Meyer Lansky and Vinnie “ Blue Eyes ” Alo , before he was sentenced to a number of years in Sing - Sing prison .
By Steinhardt Jr.’s own account , the principal partners in his first hedge fund were the Genovese Mafia , Ivan Boesky , Marty Peretz ( the aristocrat who funded Cramer ) , and a man named Marc Rich .
Rich is closely connected to Ronald Greenwald , described in the authoritative book Red Mafiya as the man who , along with the Genovese family , brought the Russian Mob to America .
In 1983 , Rich was indicted for trading illegally with Iran while Islamic revolutionaries were holding the American embassy hostage in Tehran .
Along with his associate , “ Pinky ” Green , he fled to Switzerland .
In 2001 , Steinhardt , a big - time operator in Democratic circles , convinced Bill Clinton to give Rich a scandalous presidential pardon , but Rich remains in Switzerland to avoid paying his tax bill .
In the early 1990s , Steinhardt shut down his hedge fund after he was implicated in a scheme to corner the U.S. treasuries market – a horrendous infraction with serious implications for the U.S. economy .
So this is a rough crowd .
Says one Wall Street trader : “ It was the day the bad guys came to town — when Steinhardt and his people arrived . ”
One of Steinhardt ’s people is Jim Cramer .
Another is Cramer ’s wife , who was known as the “ Trading Goddess ” when she worked as Steinhardt ’s head trader .
Maria Bartiromo , a CNBC anchor known as the “ Money Honey , ” is married to the top partner in Steinhardt ’s newest hedge fund .
( A former employee of Cramer ’s hedge fund has written that Cramer often fed tips to the Money Honey , trading ahead of her stories , and it is rumored that she recruited him to CNBC . )
And then there is David Rocker , the short - selling hedge fund manager believed to be scheming , along with Cramer and Herb , with Gradient Analytics , the financial research shop under SEC investigation in 2006 .
Cramer says he ’s met Rocker only once – apparently while squeezing the grapefruit at some grocery store .
But the truth is , Cramer knows Rocker well .
Rocker is a former employee of Steinhardt ’s hedge fund .
He worked there at the same time as the Trading Goddess .
And , until recently , Rocker was the largest outside shareholder in Cramer ’s website , TheStreet.com .
Cramer sometimes quotes the hedge fund manager on his television show , and once interviewed him live .
Rocker is also a regular writer for TheStreet.com , where he bashes stocks that Cramer subsequently also bashes in multiple stories on both the website and CNBC .
In February 2006 , the SEC is investigating Gradient Analytics for disseminating false information about public companies .
The agency has affidavits from former employees who say that Gradient ’s “ independent research ” is produced by recent University of Arizona graduates who know little to nothing about finance and essentially take dictation from hedge fund managers , including David Rocker .
One of these employees says that Herb conspired with Rocker to hold his negative stories ( premised on Gradient ’s false information ) until Rocker could establish short positions .
This is called front - running – a jailable offense .
It is reasonable to suspect that Rocker had similar relationships with TheStreet.com ( of which he has owned a substantial portion ) and other media .
Not long before Cramer announced his SEC subpoenas , Rocker sold all of his shares in TheStreet.com .
Cramer sold around $ 2 million of his own shares .
If Cramer knew about the SEC investigation before he sold his shares , which was almost certainly the case , he was trading on insider information – another jailable offense .
But Cramer do n’t know nothin ’ about nothin’ .
And Herb thinks the SEC investigation is an outrage .
So Herb and Cramer have commandeered CNBC .
They are live on CNBC .
Herb has jabbered something about a conspiracy – a conspiracy to get Herb .
And now Cramer is going to show us something .
He ’s pulled out a big , red magic marker .
Veins are popping , rope - like , from his bald cranium .
And he ’s snarling .
Cramer is actually snarling while he uses the big red magic marker to scribble something on a piece of paper .
He holds the paper up to the camera .
It ’s …it ’s his government subpoena … Cramer has vandalized his government subpoena !
On live TV … in big red letters …
It says , “ BULL ! ”
* * * * * * * *
Nobody in the media seems bothered by this .
To the contrary , the Media Mob rises to Cramer and Herb ’s defense .
For example , Joe Nocera of The New York Times , who is an old friend of Herb , writes a column attributing the SEC investigation to Patrick Byrne ’s “ Campaign of Menace . ”
Wall Street Journal columnist Jesse Eisinger , formerly of TheStreet.com , writes that the SEC investigation violates freedom of speech .
He says that Patrick ’s theories about short - seller crimes make “ ” Da Vinci Code ” look like “ Where ’s Waldo ? ”
Other journalists – along with the Society of Professional Journalists ( SPJ ) and the Society of Business Editors and Writers ( SABEW ) — dutifully line up behind the Journal , the Times , and CNBC .
Meanwhile , these journalists continue to use Gradient and Rocker as sources in negative articles .
MSN
Money ’s stock rating feature , which gives “ buy ” and “ sell ” recommendations to the website ’s readers , is based entirely on Gradient ’s analysis .
CNBC ’s stock picking tool also comes from Gradient .
This is pretty appalling given that the journalists have good reason to believe that Gradient produces bogus research .
They know that its supposedly “ independent ” financial researchers are kids who take dictation for Rocker .
And they know that Herb and Gradient have been accused of committing serious crimes .
They know because they have the affidavits from Gradient ’s former employees .
A few other key facts , known to many journalists , but so far unreported :
Cramer claims never to have heard of Gradient , but a former Gradient employee says that Cramer ’s colleague , Becky Quick , has confirmed in emails and on the phone that “ Cramer loves Gradient ’s research , ” and that he has requested their research on specific stocks .
Herb claims to have no special relationship with Gradient , but he had access to its computer system and regularly logged in .
Herb ’s research assistant , Brian Harris , spent a significant amount of time working out of Gradient ’s office .
( Herb claims that Harris was trying out for a job there ) .
A guy named Jon Markman was for some time running a hedge fund out of Gradient ’s back office .
So - called “ independent ” research shops are n’t supposed to run hedge funds .
If Markman was trading in advance of Gradient ’s research and Herb ’s stories , as the firm ’s former employees claim he was , this is yet another jailable offense .
Markman is one of Herb ’s close friends .
He was , along with Herb , a top editor of TheStreet.com .
After that , and prior to starting a dodgy hedge fund in Gradient ’s back office , Markman was the managing editor of MSNMoney.com ( which explains why MSN Money continues to use Gradient ’s research ) .
And maybe Herb , Markman , Eisinger , Nocera , Cramer and all the other journalists who think Gradient is a credible source–and who call Patrick Byrne a wacko , a Waldo and a menace–can tell us why at least one Gradient manager has used multiple aliases and IDs to hide his activities .
* * * * * * * *
There was a time , before Rocker and Gradient came along , that Patrick Byrne was a darling of the financial press .
In 2002 , Fortune magazine called him “ The Renaissance Man of E- commerce “ .
The article noted that Patrick is an admired protégé of celebrity investor Warren Buffett .
It added that Patrick has a black belt in tae kwon do , “ has bicycled across the U.S. three times , studied moral philosophy at Cambridge as a Marshall fellow , and briefly pursued a career in boxing .
Byrne also speaks Mandarin - not to mention four other foreign languages - and translated Lao Tse ’s Way of Virtue … He has a nearly photographic memory [ and can study ] a deck of cards for a couple of minutes [ and ] recite them back , one by one … six months later . ”
Byrne also survived a three - year “ bout with seminoma , a cancer that reduced his 6 - foot - 5 - inch frame from 240 pounds to 164 … [ and left ] his body scarred with the marks of 20 surgeries . ”
There were no short - sellers behind the Fortune story , but short - sellers do often pump stocks up before they trash them .
If they take their short positions at a peak price , they make more money on the way down .
This might explain why , in December 2003 , Cramer could n’t say enough good things about Patrick and Overstock .
“ We really like this guy , ” Cramer said on Kudlow & Cramer , the CNBC show he was then hosting .
Yes , Cramer was very impressed by Overstock ’s growth .
He said it was a really great company .
He said he was gonna go to Overstock.com and buy Mrs. Cramer a Christmas present .
Soon after , David Rocker took his initial short position in Overstock .
The first sign that this might affect the media coverage of the company came in January 2004 , when Patrick was invited to appear again on Kudlow & Cramer .
Only a few weeks had passed since Cramer ’s initial extolments , but now the mood was entirely different .
Now Cramer and his co-host , Larry Kudlow , seemed to be casting aspersions on Patrick ’s character .
In his quarterly earnings statement Patrick had cited Overstock ’s gross profits , which had increased nicely .
There was nothing at all unusual about this – Patrick also cited net profits and many other figures – but Kudlow and Cramer hinted that it was somehow suspicious , that maybe mentioning gross profits was a slippery thing to do , and maybe Patrick was trying to overstate his success .
“ You talk about something called gross profits , ” said Kudlow , “ Why are you – is this a confusion thing , an ambiguity thing , or what point were you trying to make ? ”
Yeah , said Cramer , “ You do n’t need to … .
You do n’t need to – I know that you do n’t regard that as spin .
But … ”
Patrick was visibly baffled .
“ Gross profit is an accounting term , ” he said .
“ It ’s an accounting term…on an income statement … I described each line on the income statement … ”
* * * * * * * *
“ You saw what just happened , did n’t you ?
It was a set - up .
This is what these guys do – they try to make CEOs look like they ’re cooking the books .
It ’s pure smear .
They take their cues from short - sellers .
Watch out , these people do n’t mess around .
They ’re dirty players . ”
It ’s a Wall Street broker on the phone , and Patrick has just left the studio where he was blindsided by Kudlow and Cramer .
He still does n’t know anything about the Wall Street cabal , but it was a strange interview , and he ’s had some other warnings .
Like just recently , he got two calls , from two different hedge fund managers .
The hedge fund managers told Patrick that one of their brokers , a guy who handles short - sellers ’ orders for Bear Stearns , a major investment bank , had sold 300,000 shares in Overstock that he did n’t have – phantom shares .
The broker registered the sale on his computer – which created a sort of I.O.U. – but he had no intention of finding real shares to buy or borrow and then deliver to the purchaser .
To justify this action – and perhaps to put some additional downward pressure on the stock – the broker circulated a rumor that Patrick was using some kind of offshore synthetic instrument to sell his stock while hiding this from the public .
This was completely false .
In January 2004 , Patrick does n’t know it yet , but short - sellers are preparing to take down Overstock .
Soon , the company will come under attack from multiple directions .
Millions of phantom Overstock shares will be sold into the market .
And the media – led by Cramer , Herb and affiliated journalists , will orchestrate an unprecedented smear , all the while insisting that phantom stock is not a problem .
* * * * * * * *
On January 23 , 2004 , just a few days after Patrick hears about the sale of 300,000 non-existent Overstock shares , Carol Remond , a reporter for Dow Jones Newswires , publishes a story about a recent decision of the National Association of Securities Dealers ( NASD ) .
Members of the self - regulating body ( later renamed the Financial Industry Regulatory Association ) have long had to abide by the requirement that they deliver the stock they have sold within three days .
It is not just a NASD rule – it ’s U.S. law .
But some brokers have bypassed this rule by selling , and never delivering , phantom stock through foreign brokerages that do not belong to the NASD .
Now the NASD has announced that it will try to close this loophole .
Preventing traders from breaking the law seems hardly controversial , but Remond , the French - Canadian reporter who will later try to establish that Patrick is running a criminal enterprise out of a gay bathhouse ( she will also later get a government subpoena along with Herb and Cramer ) apparently thinks the NASD should keep out of the way .
“ Taking most market participants by surprise , ” she writes , “ the National Association of Securities Dealers has drastically tightened its rules governing short - selling ” by closing the loophole allowing sales of phantom stock .
The “ market participants ” think – and Remond agrees – that this is no good because “ it ’s impossible to borrow the shares of …overvalued development stage companies . ”
So Remond – siding with her sources – thinks that if it is impossible to borrow shares of a company , hedge funds should nonetheless be able to sell , sell , sell .
Create unlimited amounts of illegal phantom stock to drive down prices and never deliver it .
This is Remond ’s standard position : if a company is deemed “ overvalued ” by short - sellers , then the short - sellers should be allowed to destroy it .
This position is shared by every journalist affiliated with Cramer , David Rocker , and a crew of dirty players .
How dirty ?
Well , the only “ market participant ” named in Carol ’s story is Pacific International , a brokerage in Canada .
As Remond surely knows , more than 15 American criminal indictments have targeted Pacific International clients .
It is widely suspected as a favored broker for sellers of phantom shares .
Five of the indictments mention Pacific International as a conduit for money laundering and stock fraud .
In one court case , Sasha Angus , the director of enforcement for the British Columbia Securities Commission , describes this scene : “ Jean Claude Hauchecorne , one of the top revenue producers at Pacific International , was summoned to New York … Phil Abramo and Phil Gurian , entered the room with two other men .
These men were armed … …. Abramo and Gurian were apparently high - ranking members of the Mafia . ”
On that day , Abramo and Gurian , of the Gambino crime family , threatened to kill Hauchecorne because he had funneled money to a stock promoter linked to the rival Bonanno and Genovese Mafia clans .
According to Carol , Pacific International is a credible source – just your average “ market participant . ”
Most of the Cramer crowd of journalists would agree .

Fortunately , there is a wild - eyed guy in Massachusetts named Dave Patch .
Dave is an engineer .
He spends his days building parts for jet airplanes .
At night , though , he is a revolutionary firebrand , churning out searing entries on his blog , which is called InvestigateTheSec.com , and firing off cantankerous letters to government officials and mainstream journalists about the problem of phantom stock .
In September 2006 , SEC Director of Trading and Markets James Brigagliano referred to Dave Patch and his fellow crusaders as “ bozos . ”
For years prior , the SEC said that there was very little phantom stock in the system .
Then , one day , it said there was so much phantom stock in the system that it could n’t force the sellers to deliver real stock because it would cause “ excessive volatility ” – a euphemism for “ total market chaos . ”
A couple of years ago , Dave began invoking the Freedom of Information Act to compile reams of trading data .
This data , combined with research published by the securities industry itself , suggests that there is now around $ 12 billion of phantom stock in just one corner of the system .
There is an unknown amount – perhaps $ 100 – $ 150 billion – in a part of the system that is not monitored by any regulatory body .
Just as a spill of $ 1,000 of radioactive waste costs much more than $ 1,000 to clean up , a certain dynamic of the stock market ( named , “ short squeezes ” ) means that to clean up $ 100 billion of phantom shares would cost much more than $ 100 billion : it could easily cost over $ 1 trillion .
Dave puts this information on his blog .
He receives back - up from a crew of anti-phantom stock fanatics who live on the internet .
Meanwhile , the Easter Bunny takes on the role of chief PR man , publishing his own fiery – and often hilarious – blog , which he calls TheSanityCheck.com .
One day , the Easter Bunny calls Patrick Byrne , who launches an unprecedented public campaign against phantom stock sellers and the journalists who support them .
Then , on March 26 , 2008 , as the markets are melting down , the SEC invites Dave Patch to brief the agency on the phantom stock problem .
The Counsel to the Inspector General of the SEC writes a letter to investors who have complained about naked short - selling .
It says that the SEC Inspector General has “ met with Mr. David Patch …at which time he gave us an extensive briefing on this topic .
We understand the seriousness of the concerns about naked short selling and have begun looking into potential audit issues related to this matter . ”
Says a former SEC attorney : “ It was n’t until Dave Patch started firing off FOIA requests that anyone started taking this seriously . ”
* * * * * * * *
In mid-April , 2004 , millions of shares of Overstock.com have been sold and never delivered – phantom stock .
FOIA data later proves this .
But in April 2004 , Patrick does n’t yet know Dave Patch or the Easter Bunny .
He does n’t know anything about phantom stock .
Nor does he know that a clique of journalists protect the hedge funds that sell phantom stock – and that these same journalists will stop at nothing to smear the targets of their short - selling friends .
So Patrick makes the mistake of appearing again on Kudlow & Cramer .
“ But once again , once again , you are confusing the heck out of me and everybody else with your arguments about gross , ” says Kudlow .
“ I ’m not really sure why you continue to do this and what it is you ’re trying to hide . ”
Gross profits again ?
Patrick can’t believe it .
“ No good deed goes unpunished , ” he says .
“ I ’ve tried to explain the economics of our business .
I wrote a three - page letter this time .
Last quarter , I wrote a 12 - page letter .
Maybe it is confusing .
I thought I ’m trying to do a good thing . ”
“ But what is it that you ’re hiding on this ?
… Are you trying to say to us you ’re not making as much in sales revenue or that you will have a better future ?
I mean , it ’s utterly confusing to me . ”
“ Well , ” says Patrick , “ first of all , I ’m all about GAAP . ” [ GAAP stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles –the accounting system that is …” generally accepted . ” ]
“ So , ” says Kudlow , “ if you say GAAP profit–GAAP gross profit is up 83 percent , is n’t that misleading , this idea of GAAP gross profit ? ”
“ Larry , that ’s … ”
“ Quick answer . ”
“ … That ’s … ”
“ Quick answer . ”
“ Quick answer is that ’s a silly question .
GAAP has a concept called revenue , a concept called gross profit , a concept called net profit .
Those are GAAP –a basic accounting course teaches that . ”
“ I do n’t understand it .
I do n’t understand it .
Anyway , thank you for coming back . ”

While CNBC ’s top television personalities are suggesting that it is some kind of crime for Patrick to cite a standard accounting term , a man named Amr Ibrahim Elgindy is attempting to board an airplane in Islip , New York , using a fake ID with the name Manny Velasco .
In his possession are four cell phones , a suitcase full of cash , and $ 40,000 worth of jewelry .
Elgindy would normally be carrying his .380 colt handgun , but he ’s left that at home .
Too risky carrying it in airports – especially when you ’re fleeing the country .
Elgindy is hoping to get to Lebanon , where his remaining assets are stashed , but today he is n’t going anywhere .
The woman at the counter has looked at him askance .
She has looked at his ID , and looked again , and now she ’s disappeared behind a curtain .
She calls the cops , and before long they are hauling Elgindy away as he cries and pleads and says , “ No really , I ’m Manny Velasco – Elgindy is just some guy I met in New York ! ”
Amr Elgindy got his start working for Blinder , Robinson , nicknamed “ blind ‘em , rob ‘em , ” a Mafia - linked brokerage whose founder , a gold - chain and diamond - crusted - pinky - ring wearing goon named Meyer Blinder , eventually went to prison for securities fraud .
Amr , who also goes by the names Anthony Elgindy and Anthony Pacific , later set up his own operation , establishing himself as one of Wall Street ’s most flamboyant short - sellers – and a favored source to one segment of the financial media .
The FBI began investigating Elgindy after receiving a tip from a Solomon Smith Barney broker who said that on September 10 , 2001 ( that is , the day before the terror attacks on the World Trade Center ) , Elgindy had placed a call to Smith Barney instructing them to liquidate his kids ’ trust funds .
He also said , “ Tomorrow the Dow is going to drop to 3,000 points . ”
( It was at 9,600 at the time . )
The government spends months investigating whether Elgindy has connections to terrorists and advance knowledge of 9 - 11 .
Ultimately , prosecutors indict him for the more demonstrable crimes of racketeering , conspiracy and securities fraud .
( He gets 9 years for those crimes , and another 2 years for trying to flee the country . )
Elgindy ’s many offenses include bribing an FBI agent to provide him with information on agency investigations of public companies ( the agent also gave Elgindy information on an on - going 9 - 11 investigation : Elgindy ’s own ) , manipulative short - selling , and extortion .
If the companies paid Elgindy off , he ’d agree to stop disseminating false information about them .
A lot of people lost money on stocks that Elgindy attacked , and many of those people began investigating him long before the FBI did , often posting their findings on the internet .
Gary Dobry , for example , is a Chicago boxer , artist and street busker who spent the better part of a year writing long screeds about Elgindy ’s crimes .
He also created pretty good acrylic paintings of Elgindy , and sold them at art shows .
Dobry ’s obsession with Elgindy ended when he received death threats , and somebody threw a pair of garden shears through the window of his boxing gym ( this , we will see , is a standard threat from mobsters in the securities business ) .
But Deep Capture has recruited other Elgindy foes to its team .
One of them is a former businessman whose company was destroyed by Elgindy , and who has made it his life ’s mission to expose short - sellers ’ crimes .
The businessman prefers to remain anonymous because he fears a Mafia hit , but he ’s accomplished a great deal .
For example , he traveled , undercover , to Costa Rica to meet Jonathan Curshen , a former trader for the Mafia - infested Pacific International and current proprietor of Red Sea Management , an offshore money laundering outfit .
On multiple occasions , Curshen admitted to our undercover vigilante that he sells phantom stock — and threatened to kill anyone who revealed this .
Curshen also described a special debit card that can not be traced to its user .
This , he suggested , could be used to pay off government officials and journalists .
But the undercover businessman ’s biggest coup was in gaining membership to an online short - selling discussion board that Elgindy ran before he went to prison .
Seeing that Elgindy was openly discussing crimes on the site , the businessman began taking screenshots of every page , so that his garage is now piled high with boxes of transcripts ( which Deep Capture has scanned and stored somewhere safe ) .
In these transcripts , Elgindy and other short sellers make hundreds of references to certain journalists – most of them friends - of - Cramer .
The reporters frequently mentioned include Herb Greenberg and David Kansas , both then editors of TheStreet.com ( Kansas later becomes editor of The Wall Street Journal “ Money & Investing ” section ) , Carol Remond , and Dave Evans , a reporter for Bloomberg News .
( When Federal agents raided Elgindy ’s office , they found 2,000 hours worth of recorded phone conversations .
According to a source knowledgeable about the investigation , “ Herb Greenberg and Jim Cramer are all over those tapes . ” )
Here ’s one fairly typical comment , from a hedge fund manager on Elgindy ’s online discussion board : “ maybe when thestreet.com folds , we can hire Herb to work exclusively for us . ”
At another point , a hedge fund manager calling himself “ Peter ” says : “ Dave Evans gave us SPBR for free - been very profitable . ”
A key member of this online community is Dan Loeb , a hedge fund manager who uses the screen name “ Mr. Pink ” ( a reference to a criminal character in the Quentin Tarantino film Reservoir Dogs ) .
Mr. Pink says , “ Dave Evans is a Made Man . ”
* * * * * * * *
The short - sellers on Elgindy ’s website talk a lot of nonsense ( at one point they debate whether Elgindy and Dave Evans “ swapped spit , ” or merely engaged in a “ loogie spitting ” contest ) , so it ’s possible that they are merely boasting about paying off journalists .
But the comments on Elgindy ’s website were so numerous that one can’t help but suspect that the relationships between these journalists and the short - sellers was beyond normal .
At a minimum , the reporters must have known that hedge funds were trading ahead of their stories .
The reporters should also have known that Elgindy ’s information was suspect – and that his target companies were often victims of short - seller crimes .
Data obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act shows that massive amounts of phantom stock were sold in the companies that Elgindy and his cohort shorted .
As Carol Remond and others surely knew , Elgindy was also among the dubious clients of Pacific International , the Canadian brokerage that has catered to Wall Street operators connected to the Genovese crime family .
“ Let ’s remember , ” says one member of Elgindy ’s website , “ because of CANADA we can NAKED SHORT ! ”
Elgindy also brags on his website of having supplied the SEC and other government agencies with negative information .
The SEC , especially , would helpfully open investigations into the companies targeted by Elgindy , precipitating huge declines in their stocks .
One former SEC official interviewed by Deep Capture admits to having worked often with Elgindy .
“ I ’d send his information up my up - line , ” he says .
“ My superiors would tell me to open an investigation . ”
In most cases , the SEC never filed charges against the targeted companies .
But the investigations left the companies ’ stock and reputations in tatters .
Contributing to this , Herb and the rest of the Media Mob would write multiple negative stories about the companies Elgindy shorted .
“ These were good companies .
A lot of them were pharmaceutical companies that had made important medical advances , ” says the former SEC investigator .
“ Elgindy hurt them badly .
He stopped new cures .
And the SEC helped .
The media helped . ”
Elgindy is in jail , but the short - sellers who were members of his website , and who joined him in his “ bear raids ” on innocent companies , are still in business .
One of them is John Fiero , who went by the screen name of “ Bond , ” and whom the NASD fined $ 1 million for selling phantom stock in companies that had the misfortune of being underwritten by Hanover Sterling , a brokerage that has been linked to the Genovese Mafia clan .
Fiero has yet to pay that fine .
Quite to the contrary , a member of Elgindy ’s website wrote at one point that the NASD had given Fiero an office and a set of trading computers — inside the NASD ’s headquarters .
If this was true , the NASD was either deeply corrupted , or it was using Fiero as an informant in ongoing investigations of phantom stock trading .
And then there is Dan Loeb , a .k.a. Mr. Pink .
Loeb is a short - seller best known for hurling vitriol at his “ enemies , ” and for maintaining a high profile relationship with Fab 5 Freddy , the gangsta rapper .
He is also very much a part of the Cramer constellation of hedge funds .
And give him this : he stands by his boys .
Once , a respected hedge fund manager named Kenneth Griffin hired someone away from a hedge fund run by Loeb ’s crony David Einhorn , who is also a friend of Cramer .
In an email , Mr. Pink accused Griffin of running a “ gulag , ” and wrote : “ Let me be clear that …should you attempt to hire people from [ my friends ] , I will consider it an…act of war . ”
Now , with Elgindy in prison , Mr. Pink ’s friends are at “ war ” with Patrick Byrne and Overstock.com .
The generals in this war are David Einhorn , David Rocker , and the Media Mob led by Herb and Jim Cramer ( who met Rocker once , in a grocery store ) .
* * * * * * * *
Cramer has a shtick whereby he brags about the crimes he has committed , perhaps so that he can later claim that his openness suggests a certain innocence .
That might be why , in a semi- private discussion on his website , Cramer advocates breaking the law to drive down stock prices .
“ Maybe you need $ 10 million capital to knock [ a stock ] down , ” he says .
“ It ’s a fun game and it ’s a lucrative game …
By the way , no one else in the world would ever admit that , but I do n’t care …
That ’s right , and you can say that here , and I ’m not gonna say it on TV … it ’s really important to use a lot of your firepower to knock that [ stock ] down …
Now , you ca n’t foment .
That ’s a violation of …
You ca n’t create yourself an impression that a stock ’s down .
But you do it anyway cause the SEC does n’t understand it …
This is just actually blatantly illegal ….
But I think it ’s really important to foment …
You get [ the CNBC reporter ] … talking about it as if there ’s something wrong [ with the stock ] .
Then you would call the [ Wall Street ] Journal and you get the bozo reporter …if you ’re not doing it , maybe you should n’t be in the game . ”
* * * * * * * *
Nobody understands “ the game ” and “ bozo reporters ” better than David Rocker .
He is one of the most popular sources ever to use the business media to his advantage .
His information has appeared with near - constant regularity on CNBC and TheStreet.com , and he has been a favored source for Cramer ’s friends at The Wall Street Journal , Fortune magazine , and MSN Money .
Herb Greenberg has written negatively about nearly every company that Rocker has sold short , usually repeating Rocker ’s analysis verbatim .
The information in these stories is often bogus .
Much of it has come from Gradient Analytics , the financial research shop that the SEC has subpoenaed , along with Herb , Cramer and Carol Remond , in 2006 .
In addition to the three affidavits that the SEC received , several other former Gradient employees are willing to testify that the place is staffed by kids who take dictation from Rocker or other hedge fund managers , and then produce phony negative research designed to cause stock prices to collapse .
Rocker routinely takes this “ independent research ” to the SEC , suggesting that his target companies are committing accounting fraud – that they ’re the next Enrons .
The Rocker constellation of hedge funds is pretty tight with the SEC – much as Elgindy was .
The government agency will investigate just about any company named by these people .
In return , Rocker has employed at least one high - level SEC employee who investigated his target companies .
No doubt , others wonder whether they , too , might get lucrative jobs .
Some of the companies that the SEC investigates at the behest of these hedge funds have actually done something wrong .
But often , the SEC eventually has to announce that the companies are beyond reproach .
That , however , can take several years , by which time , news of the investigations – dutifully circulated by the Media Mob – will have inflicted mortal damage on these companies ’ stock prices and business operations .
Around the same time that these SEC investigations begin , and usually right after a friend - of - Cramer publishes a negative article , a slippery law firm will file a class action lawsuit alleging that the target company has defrauded its investors .
The law firm that has been most often responsible for these suits – the firm that has sued almost every company shorted by the Rocker constellation of hedge funds – is Milberg Weiss .
This same law firm was on close terms with Amr Elgindy and his government cronies .
“ FBI and SEC will be here soon , ” Elgindy said to a hedge fund manager on his website , “ as will class [ action ] Milberg Weiss guy . ”
Patrick Byrne warned people about this firm in his “ Miscreants ’ Ball ” presentation .
The Media Mob ridiculed him .
Less than a year later , Milberg Weiss was indicted and its founding partner was sentenced to prison for racketeering , mail fraud and bribery .
The firm paid off its plaintiffs to induce them to sue companies targeted by affiliated hedge funds .
According to court documents , Milberg Weiss instructed people to buy stock in target companies , “ anticipating that the securities would decline in value , in order to position themselves to be named plaintiffs in securities fraud class actions and to obtain kickback payments . ”
Anticipating that the securities would decline .
How in the world could they have known that the securities would lose value ?
Well , soon after the phony plaintiffs bought shares in a company , somebody would flood the market with massive amounts of phantom stock .
And while Milberg was preparing its law suits , Gradient and similar outfits would release bogus financial research .
Indeed , a Gradient employee time sheet obtained by Deep Capture has a line - item tagged “ Milberg Weiss ” – suggesting that Gradient ’s employees were concomitantly working for the crooked law firm .
With phantom stock flooding the system , and the SEC preparing to investigate , and dubious financial research shops releasing bogus information , the Media Mob would attack with biased , negative stories .
As the stock plummeted , Milberg filed its pre-fabricated lawsuits ( inserting the media stories as evidence ) alleging that the target company had ripped off its investors by causing its own stock prices to plummet .
The lawsuits , of course , caused the stock prices to plummet even more , at which point the Media Mob would write more stories blaming the companies for their falling stock price .
The Media Mob avoids questions about Milberg ’s dubious practices – and certainly never reports on them .
And , in February 2006 , when Gradient comes under investigation , the journalists go berserk .
The investigation is a violation of free speech , they say – and the “ whoooole ” thing was orchestrated by Patrick Byrne and the Easter Bunny .
* * * * * * * *
Back in April 2004 , while Elgindy was posing as Manny Velasco , and Cramer ’s television partner was grilling Patrick on gross profits , and phantom stock was flooding the market , and a pack of journalists affiliated with Cramer and Gradient Analytics were attacking every company that Rocker shorted – when all of this was happening , the Easter Bunny thought , gee , there might be a pattern .
He first gained notoriety among the Media Mob by starting a blog that chronicled the travails of a little mortgage lender in Kansas City , MO called NovaStar Financial .
There is no particular reason why anyone would be interested in this obscure company , but it had been given national exposure by a certain segment of the financial press .
On April 12 , 2004 , The Wall Street Journal “ Money & Investing ” section ( edited by David Kansas , formerly of TheStreet.com ) published a negative article by Jonathan Weil ( who later went to work for a financial research shop that caters to short - sellers and law firms that file class action lawsuits ) .
The Journal , depending on information from hedge funds linked to Cramer , suggested that NovaStar had licensing problems in multiple states , when it did not .
During that month , Herb also attacked NovaStar in more than a dozen separate stories – many of them containing false information .
His analysis appeared on MarketWatch.com , CNBC and MSN Money .
The Street.com followed suit .
NovaStar ’s stock plunged by more than 30 % , and on April 15 , crooked law firm Milberg Weiss , with amazing alacrity and foresight , filed a class action lawsuit ( using the Journal article as its principal evidence ) alleging that NovaStar ’s “ investors ” had been grievously harmed by the falling share price .
The next day , the SEC , no doubt at the behest of short - sellers , opened an investigation of NovaStar , inflicting yet more damage .
In the midst of all this , the Easter Bunny sent Herb a detailed analysis that showed that Herb had completely misread an important line on NFI ’s financial statement .
Herb blithely responded with , “ You ’re free to interpret the data any way you want ” – which is his standard answer .
Now , it is fair to say that in 2008 subprime mortgages have become a risky business .
But that is different from saying , in 2004 , that a specific mortgage company has done something wrong .
Even as NovaStar continued to post strong profits well into 2006 , short - seller games – including the sale of phantom shares — kept the stock price in the mud .
SEC data obtained under the Freedom of Information
Act shows that millions of shares of NovaStar had been sold but not delivered on April 11 , 2004 – the day before the Journal article .
The number of phantom NovaStar shares in the system increased steadily over the next three years .
Today , the stock price is too low even to trade on NASDAQ .
It has been reduced to the pink sheets – reserved for penny stocks .
The SEC ’s investigation of NovaStar remains open , but as of early 2008 , it had yet to announce an investigation into hedge funds that trade phantom stock .
As of April 2008 , Herb was still covering NovaStar .
Lately , he ’d been dancing on its grave .
* * * * * * * *
Not long before NovaStar came under attack , Michael Milken , the “ junk bond king , ” appeared in the offices of Allied Capital , a DC - based financial company that shares certain financial characteristics with NovaStar .
There , he told an Allied executive , “ You know , I already am quite a large shareholder of your stock – but my name will never show up on any list you ’ll see . ”
This may have been a reference to a practice called “ parking stock ” ( owning stock but “ parking ” it in the accounts of friends with whom one has made under - the - table arrangements ) , a practice that figured in the high - count indictment that sent Milken , along with Boesky , to prison in the 1980s .
Milken returned on several occasions and seemed intent on ferreting out every detail of Allied ’s business .
Then , the interrogations came to an abrupt end .
A couple of months later , Cramer ’s friend David Einhorn was at a hedge fund luncheon .
Sitting next to him was corporate raider Carl Icahn .
Halfway through the meal , Einhorn stood up and told the hedge funds assembled in the room , “ Allied Capital is going to zero ! ”
On April 26 , 2004 , Dan Loeb ( a.k.a. Mr. Pink , the guy who once promised to go to “ war ” for Einhorn ) posted a comment on a Yahoo message board , saying : “ ALD [ Allied ] turd getting flushed , swirling down the toilet . ”
At the same time , reports on Allied ’s supposed misdeeds , created by the Kroll Investigative Agency and a politically connected Texas businessman named Jim Brickman , were delivered to the SEC and the Department of Justice , which began investigations .
These inquisitions became so onerous that Allied had to create what one employee calls the “ Department of Investigations ” just to satisfy the government requests that poured in , year - after - year .
The Kroll Investigative Agency seems to have developed a unit tasked specifically with manufacturing dirt on companies shorted by the Cramer constellation of hedge funds .
Einhorn and his cronies commissioned the report that was submitted to the DOJ , and it should be unsurprising that most of its allegations were groundless .
After four years of ongoing investigations , and countless media stories alleging wrongdoing , charges have been brought against one person – an ex-employee of a company that represents less than 5 % of Allied ’s portfolio of investments .
Meanwhile , the SEC and DOJ have yet to investigate claims that Allied is the victim of illegal phantom stock selling .
So Deep Capture has done it ’s own investigation .
This took all of five minutes – the time we needed to write and send a Freedom of Information Act request to the SEC .
The SEC wrote us back , providing data showing that there have at times been 3.5 million phantom Allied shares .
That is , somebody had sold at least 3.5 million shares that were never delivered because the shares did not exist .
And again , that number represents phantom shares in just one corner of the system .
The number of phantom shares in the rest of the system is thought by most observers to be many times greater .
However , the SEC refuses to release data about the number of phantom shares in other layers of the system .
In fact , Patrick , Dave Patch and others have suggested that the SEC might not even know .
In any case , the SEC has the power to prosecute the sellers of phantom stock , but it has so far refused to do so .
* * * * * * * *
And what if Overstock , Allied Capital , and NovaStar were not the only victims .
Suppose there were a clique of hedge funds and reporters who descended upon hundreds of public companies , mocking and harassing them , driving their CEOs to conniptions or barricaded silence .
Suppose further that billions of dollars worth of phantom stock in these companies had been sold into the market .
Suppose we know this because people like the Easter Bunny and Dave Patch have devoted large chunks of their lives to exposing the crime .
But we also know it because Leslie Boni , a resident economist at the SEC has published a seminal report , “ Strategic Failures to Deliver , ” which identifies phantom stock as a major problem .
We know it because former Undersecretary of Commerce Robert Shapiro has done his own study , concluding that naked short sellers have vaporized as many as 1,000 companies .
And we know it because in January 2005 , the SEC begins publishing a list of more than 300 companies whose stock has been sold , but never delivered , in excessive quantities .
There is some initial muttering about the phantom stock being the result of “ clerical errors , ” – maybe the real stock is sitting under a mattress somewhere , or the dog ate it – but this is so much gobbledygook , as evidenced by the huge amount of undelivered stock and the SEC ’s later admissions that phantom stock is a “ serious problem . ”
We also know from Leslie Boni ’s statistical analysis that high volumes of phantom stock are concentrated in very specific companies .
We know from our own analysis that there is a wildly high probability that those same stocks have been targeted by Milberg Weiss lawsuits and in hatchet jobs by the Media Mob .
The stock - eating dog must have friendly relations with Herb , Carol Remond , Jim Cramer and their friends .
Peter Chepucavage , the SEC attorney who drafted the so - called Reg SHO rule requiring the SEC to begin listing victimized companies , has told us that its enactment was preceded by an unprecedented lobbying effort spearheaded by Wall Street .
The result , he says , is watered down enforcement .
While the SEC listed the victim companies , for example , it stipulated no way of helping them – which is like publishing the names of rape victims while refusing to prosecute rapists .
( Indeed , the stock prices of many of the companies on the list dropped significantly in the days after the list first appeared . )
But , anyway , there it is : a list , supplied by the SEC — unequivocal evidence that hundreds of companies are victimized by a stark financial crime .
Now , suppose that one CEO fights back .
He fights back because of what short - sellers ’ illegal tactics are doing to the shareholders of his and other companies , and also , because he is worried that the creation of phantom stock will have systemic implications .
Maybe this CEO gives a presentation titled “ The Miscreants ’ Ball , ” identifying a group of journalists who are the eager stooges of rule - bending hedge funds .
Maybe , for a while , government investigators begin to take an interest in some of the CEO ’s allegations – and maybe important politicians , economists and even a few objective journalists began shaking their heads and saying things like , Holy bejeezers , Byrne and that Easter Bunny character are right .
Not in every respect , maybe , but clear as day : this is one of history ’s great financial heists .
Well , in this case , the journalist - stooges might become somewhat agitated .
Suppose they set out to defend themselves and their Wall Street friends - to disparage the CEO and others who question the tactics of some short - sellers and their value as media sources .
This , one can imagine , is a battle that the journalists are keen to win .
Maybe some , like Herb , go more or less bonkers .
And for others , perhaps , there are few limits inviolable –no filth unbearable .
Imagine that .
What would happen then ?
* * * * * * * *
What ?…
“ Ehhhhhhhh . ”
Roddy Boyd , The New York Post , has just had an idea .
It ’s a hunch .
Yeah , he ’s Roddy - Boyd - The - Post , and now he’s , “ ehhhhh , ” sticking his head in a garbage can .
Yeah , his head is in the garbage can , and he ’s just hypothesizing here , but he ’s pretty sure , pretty sure , “ ehhhhh ” those are used – “ yeah , they ’re used condoms . ”
And twenty of them !
It is January 2006 , five months after Patrick Byrne filed a lawsuit against David Rocker and Gradient Analytics and then held a famous conference call putting Rocker at the center of a massive financial crime dubbed “ The Miscreants ’ Ball . ”
Heaps of evidence implicating these people – affidavits , testimony from victim companies , the SEC ’s data – has been given to the media , but now Roddy - Boyd - The - Post is , “ ehhhhh , ” doing a favor for Gradient Analytics .
A couple of days ago , Donn Vickery , Gradient ’s managing partner , called Roddy , who takes his marching orders from Post business editor Dan Colarusso , formerly of TheStreet.com .
What Vickery needed was this :
There had been a couple of private investigators parked outside of Gradient .
They ’d been eyeballing the place , talking to employees .
Maybe Roddy could snoop around , see what he could find out .
So Roddy begins working the phones .
He is , “ Ehhhhh … Roddy - Boyd - the - Post , here , investigating the aggressive tactics used by Patrick Byrne and Overstock ’s private investigators . ”
Patrick has not sent any PIs to talk to Gradient ’s employees .
The investigators ( eminently polite , according to some Gradient employees ) are working for another company , a Canadian pharmaceutical manufacturer called Biovail .
Biovail is later sued by the SEC for inflating its numbers , and perhaps it did something wrong , but there is no question that Gradient has published research about the company that is blatantly false .
There is , indeed , enough of this misinformation to fill an encyclopedia , but as a very typical example , consider that Gradient claimed in a report that Biovail ’s growth “ slowed dramatically ” at a time when it had increased by more than 35 % .
( Really , this is a standard Gradient “ mistake . ” )
Gradient is working on the Biovail case with a group of hedge fund managers , including David Rocker .
Among other tricks , people working for these hedge funds have paid doctors to get them to say that Biovail bribed them to prescribe one of its drugs .
These questionable bribery charges have instigated a federal investigation into Biovail and quotes from the doctors ( who admit that they were paid by hedge funds to say they were bribed by Biovail ) have appeared in a Wall Street Journal “ Money & Investing ” section story titled , “ Biovail is Paying Doctors Prescribing New Heart Drug , ” and in a story in Barron ’s magazine , written by Bill Alpert , a close friend of Herb .
( While Roddy is doing a favor for Gradient , the SEC has just subpoenaed Herb as part of its investigation into Gradient , and Alpert has just written , bizarrely , that he wishes he could get a subpoena , too , because he quoted those paid - off doctors and getting a subpoena is “ terrific publicity . ” )
Roddy knows about the bribed doctors and he knows about Gradient ’s phony research .
He knows about short - seller tactics , including the use of phantom stock .
But Roddy is n’t interested in all of that .
Instead , he ’s doing a favor for Gradient .
And now he ’s got his head in a garbage can .
The garbage can is outside the home of Jerry Treppel , a Banc of America analyst whom Biovail accuses of helping disseminate Gradient ’s false research with the hedge funds that are accused of driving down Biovail ’s stock price .
Roddy - Boyd - The - Post has figured out that , “ ehhhhh , ” Treppel is more than fifty years old .
Treppel is also a financial analyst who has been married for a long time .
He is more than fifty years old .
A financial analyst .
Married .
“ Ehhhhhhhh . ”
“ Twenty condoms ! ? ”
“ This ai n’t Jerry Treppel ’s garbage . ”
That ’s when I knew I was on to something , ” Roddy - Boyd - The - Post later tells me , “ A fifty year old married financial analyst could n’t , ehhhhhh – you know , he could n’t be getting that much action .
That ’s how I knew that Biovail ’s investigators must ’ve stole the garbage and replaced it with someone else ’s garbage .
They were looking for stuff about Gradient .
I figured it out – you know , ehhhhh , I did some real enterprise [ investigative ] work here .
I busted them , man .
Nobody helped me . ”
Yes , as a favor to Gradient and its hedge fund clients , Roddy figured it all out .
Then he filed the big news .
“ TRASH STALKERS , ” read the headline .
“ Biovail ’s investigators … repeatedly took the trash of former Banc of America Securities analyst Jerry Treppel … ”

So now we have Roddy with his head in a garbage can , and Herb on CNBC saying there ’s a conspiracy to get Herb , and Cramer vandalizing his government subpoena , and Herb ’s friend Joe Nocera writing about “ Overstock ’s Campaign of Menace ” in The New York Times , and Cramer ’s former employee Jesse Eisinger comparing Patrick to “ Where ’s Waldo ” in The Wall Street Journal , and Herb ’s friend Bill Alpert saying he ’d like to get a subpoena , too – for publicity .
But that ’s not all — we also have a very peculiar former BusinessWeek reporter named Gary Weiss firing off friendly emails to a crooked mortgage broker and financial flimflammer who is so unambiguously bad that he sent his father to an early grave .
Deep Capture has come to possess a great number of emails between various journalists and miscreants .
In one , the former BusinessWeek reporter brags to the crooked mortgage broker of influencing the contents of Nocera ’s “ Campaign of Menace ” article in The New York Times .
“ This is totally my doing , ” Gary writes .
“ Yuk. Yuk. Yuk . ”
In another email , Gary recounts his successful campaign to keep a reporter named Liz Moyer from getting a job at BusinessWeek because she has written favorably of companies victimized by short - sellers .
Moyer , who is now with Forbes , is one of the few journalists who have accurately described the phantom share problem .
Gary left BusinessWeek in 2004 under circumstances that remain a closely guarded secret .
From January 2006 until today , his primary occupation has been to author a blog devoted entirely to badmouthing Patrick Byrne and pooh - poohing the notion that phantom stock is a problem .
His arguments are not so much arguments as personal attacks .
Anybody who utters the words “ phantom stock ” is a “ crackpot ” or a member of the “ Baloney Brigade . ”
Gary regularly suggests , meanwhile , that Overstock is some kind of fraud .
He provides not a single scrap of evidence for this , but instead makes vague accusations and then instructs anyone wanting details to visit another blog – this one authored by Sam Antar , former chief financial officer of a family - owned electronics firm called Crazy Eddie .
In the 1980s , Crazy Eddie ( “ Our prices are ….. INSAAAAANE ” ) perpetrated a $ 145 million swindle involving receipt skimming , bogus inventory and international money laundering .
When Sam was busted , he ratted out his two cousins in return for a reduced sentence of six months house arrest .
According to a recent court case , Sam has funneled at least $ 250,000 to Barry Minkow , who is also a criminal .
Minkow served seven years in prison for his role in ZZZZ Best , a fraudulent carpet cleaning company that cost investors $ 100 million .
Minkow now runs an outfit called the Fraud Discovery Institute out of the Community Bible Church in San Diego , where he is a preacher .
In one of the financial world ’s great ironies , The Fraud Discovery Institute specializes in identifying companies that have supposedly cooked their books – though no reputable investigator has ever concurred with any of its analysis .
Both Sam and Minkow hold themselves out as reformed criminals who can shed light on corporate crime .
But it is clear they have merely found a new scam : publishing false information for short - sellers .
Utah Attorney General Mark Shurtleff , who has had dealings with Sam , has written a public letter warning investors that , “ in light of Mr. Antar ’s background as a convicted white collar criminal , we believe that the public should carefully scrutinize and objectively examine any public statements that Mr. Antar makes . ”
Invariably , Sam and Minkow attack the same companies as the Cramer constellation of hedge funds , and , unsurprisingly , that is where they derive at least part of their income .
Court documents show that Minkow has received at least $ 10,000 from Whitney Tilson , a friend of Cramer who has shorted companies along with David Einhorn , for whom Dan Loeb , a .k.a.
Mr. Pink , vowed to go “ to war . ”
Mr. Pink , meanwhile , contracts with an outfit called Magic Consulting – owned by convicted stock manipulator Michelle McDonough ( formerly Michelle Sarian ) .
McDonough ’s job is to coordinate a stable of internet stock message board posters and complicit journalists who bash stocks shorted by Loeb and his friends .
McDonough was herself a fairly prolific message board basher , prior to going to prison in 2000 .
One message board poster in McDonough ’s stable is the crooked mortgage broker and financial flimflammer who is frantically emailing back and forth with former BusinessWeek reporter Gary Weiss in the winter of 2006 , soon after Gary established his blog devoted to bashing Patrick Byrne and denying that phantom stock is a problem .
The flimflammer is named Floyd Schneider — a former employee of Amr Elgindy , the gun-toting goon , a.k.a.
Manny Velasco , who plotted short strategies with Mr. Pink before instructing his Smith Barney broker to liquidate his kids ’ trust funds on the day before 9/11 , causing him to get caught in a giant stock manipulation scheme .
Floyd has a long history of credit card fraud and stealing money from customers , and once he even filched $ 20,000 from his own uncle .
On his death bed , Floyd ’s father said to several associates : “ My son – he is a liar and crook .
Floyd is the reason that I am dying . ”
Floyd has posted tens of thousands of messages smearing Patrick Byrne , Overstock , and many other companies–all , coincidentally , swimming in phantom stock .
Meanwhile Sam Antar of Crazy Eddie , who is delivering large sums of money to convicted fraudster Barry Minkow ( paid , in part , by Whitney Tilson , colleague of Mr. Pink and Cramer ) has posted thousands of his own false and defamatory statements about Overstock , both on message boards and on his blog .
A number of journalists are on strangely good terms with these crooks .
Fortune magazine , for example , has written a positive profile of Sam Antar .
Roddy - Boyd - The - Post has written an email to a known conman in which he refers to Michelle McDonough as “ our mutual best friend . ”
But few journalists are closer to this cast of swindlers than Gary Weiss , the former BusinessWeek reporter .
And who , exactly , is this Gary Weiss character ?
Well , this is where the story gets really weird .
* * * * * * * *
Gary Weiss is a journalist best known for penning the 1996 BusinessWeek cover story , “ The Mob on Wall Street , ” which documented Mafia involvement in stock brokerages , including Hanover Sterling , run by the Genovese clan .
In 2003 , he published a book , “ Born to Steal , ” which tells the story of Louis Pasciuto , a Genovese - linked criminal who worked for Hanover .
Pasciuto cooperated extensively with Gary , so it is fair to say that the two are friendly .
When Pasciuto was later sentenced to prison , Gary wrote an article in his defense .
Now , remember , Hanover Sterling , Pasciuto ’s employer , was at the center of one the biggest phantom - stock selling scandals of all time .
The NASD eventually fined John Fiero ( a.k.a.
Bond — a member , along with Mr. Pink , of Amr Elgindy ’s online short - selling discussion group ) for naked shorting Hanover stocks in cahoots with several mobsters from the Gambino crime family .
Their phantom stock selling destroyed a number of companies , and put Hanover out of business , probably with the acquiescence of Hanover ’s Genovese handlers .
The naked shorting also destroyed Adler Coleman , then one of Wall Street ’s largest clearing firms .
That was in 1995 — one year before publication of “ The Mob on Wall Street ” — but Gary ’s story makes no mention of phantom stock or illegal naked short selling .
Indeed , Gary paints Fiero as the victim of Mafia harassment .
Since 1995 , one of Gary ’s most important sources has been Manuel Asensio , a short - seller who for many years was a hero to a certain clan of journalists .
Several reporters , including Gary , have written worshipful profiles of Asensio , heralding his supposed expertise at identifying overvalued public companies .
None of these stories allude to Asensio ’s mysterious past , which seems to have included stints at a number of dubious brokerages .
In 2000 , the NASD fined Asensio for failing to make an “ affirmative determination ” that stock could be borrowed before he sold it .
( In other words , he sold phantom stock ) .
In 2006 , Asensio was barred from associating with any NASD member ( think of the securities industry ’s equivalent of Hannibal Lecter in straitjacket and mask ) after he failed to respond to charges that he published false information in financial research reports .
Before that , he worked extensively with Mike Wilkins , a short - seller and part - time screenwriter of Hollywood B-movies .
A fellow named Ed Manfredonia , who was the primary source for a story Gary wrote about corruption on the American Stock Exchange – the longest investigative report ever published by BusinessWeek–says he was sitting in Gary ’s office when the BusinessWeek reporter received a fax from Wilkins ’ hedge fund containing negative information about a company called Hemispherx BioPharma .
Manfredonia says he told Gary that he had information from Asensio ’s clearing firm , Spear Leads & Kellogg , that Asensio had sold 300,000 phantom shares in Hemispherx .
But Gary ignored this information and wrote a negative story about the company , helping its stock to plunge by more than 50 % — pure profit for Wilkins and Asensio .
Now , Ed is quite the character .
A former stock broker who has been living on welfare for years , he says he ’s been unable to get a job ever since making allegations that major players on the American Stock Exchange were committing all sorts of heinous acts – like smuggling cocaine from Columbia , and laundering money for Imelda Marcos .
Ed is a compact man and his eyes bulge behind Coke - bottle eyeglasses .
He once came to my office at the Columbia Journalism Review and spent three straight hours delineating the “ crimes ” of Gary Weiss .
During these three hours , I uttered maybe a couple dozen words .
When I left the room to get a glass of water or use the restroom , Ed just kept right on talking .
He has filed countless lawsuits ( which he writes himself ) against Gary and others , and spent a considerable amount of time following Gary around , asking why Gary lied in his stories .
In January 2005 , BusinessWeek filed a restraining order against Ed .
But Ed is , in certain respects , credible .
A New York district attorney ’s office once wired him as part of a large - scale investigation into some of the very allegations that he leveled against the American Stock Exchange .
In a story titled , “ Offering Credence to the Crank , ” Gary wrote that , “ In talking to his friends , current and former Amex officials and traders , I kept hearing the same thing :
Ed gets too excited , but he is telling the truth . ”
I think Gary was right to use Ed as a source ( he ’s certainly an improvement over the cast of crooks with whom Gary is currently collaborating ) and it was n’t very nice of him to call Ed a “ crank . ”
Ed is different , a bit stressed - out perhaps , but he ’s obviously had an inside look at corruption on Wall Street .
Some of his information is solid .
For example , his claims that Asensio sold phantom stock in Hemispherx BioPharma were later repeated in a report by expert court witness Robert Lowry , who spent 23 years in the SEC ’s division of market regulation .
There is also this :
In 1999 , somebody entered the New Jersey mansion of Albert Alain Chalem , told him to kneel on his marble floor , and shot him in the head .
The killers fired several more bullets into Chalem ’s face , and then , in a manner less gruesome , killed his companion , Maier Lehmann .
Chalem and Lehmann were involved in various pump and dump schemes , but they were also short - sellers and to a certain group of journalists , popular sources of negative information about public companies .
( One gets a sense of the sorts of people to whom some journalists turn for information ) .
Chalem and Lehmann were also heavily involved in the production of phantom stock .
At the time of the murders , Ed offered to introduce Gary to Chalem ’s bodyguard , who had good information that the killings were the work of the Russian Mob .
Chalem had lost a bundle of money through a brokerage that was controlled by the Russians , and on the night before his murder , he and his bodyguard had met and argued with some Russian thugs .
Threats were exchanged .
Deep Capture has looked into Ed ’s story – and it checks out .
There is every reason to suspect that the Russians ( and , by extension , the Genovese crime family ) were involved in the murders of Al Chalem and Meier Lehmann .
But Gary would not meet with the bodyguard .
Indeed , the BusinessWeek reporter was adamant – he would not talk to anyone who intended to accuse the Russians of committing this , or any other crime .
Nor would he mention Chalem and Lehmann ’s involvement in selling phantom stock .
Instead , he wrote a story suggesting that Chalem and Lehmann died because they were pumping stocks with members of the Gambino crime family .
As Gary knew , the Gambinos were at the time in a bitter feud with the Genovese and their Russian allies .
( Gambino mobsters , remember , had threatened to murder the top revenue earner at Carol Remond ’s source , Pacific International , because he had funneled a large amount of money to a Genovese - linked stock promoter ) .
So it was no small decision to ignore information that the Russians had ordered the murders .
Ed suggests that Gary pinned the murders on the Gambinos because he was trying to get movie producers interested in his book , and movie producers find the Italian Mob more compelling than the Russians .
Either that , or Gary ’s favorite sources had a beef with the Gambinos .
In an email to me , Gary ’s source Manuel Asensio wrote , “ I do n’t know anything at all about Al Chalem and Meier Lehmann .
I do n’t know who they are and have never read or heard anything about them , or spoke to anyone , including Gary , about it . ”
In another email , he said he has never talked to Gary about the Mafia , he has never read Gary ’s articles about the Mob on Wall Street , and he has no interest in the subject .
I called Asensio to ask about a lawsuit that had claimed that he had previously worked for First Hanover , a Mob - linked brokerage run by a guy who later became a crack addict and a homeless person .
I also wanted to know about Asensio ’s experience in selling phantom stock .
He said he never worked for First Hanover .
He said there is nothing wrong with selling phantom stock – it should be legal .
He listened as I described some of the information I had gathered for this story .
And then he offered to put me on his payroll .
* * * * * * * *
So , in November 2006 , I was working on this story at the Columbia Journalism Review , and I had two large diagrams on the wall above my desk .
One of these diagrams showed the multiple links between hedge fund manager William Ackman , a friend of Cramer who was funded by the aristocrat Marty Peretz , and Gene Philips , a real estate magnate who was arrested in 2000 along with around 150 stock brokers from the five New York Mafia families – the largest securities fraud bust in history .
( Philips was later acquitted ) .
The other diagram had , written on the top , inside a box , the name of a hedge fund : Kingsford Capital .
This hedge fund , I had learned , specialized in short - selling and was managed by Mike Wilkins , the Hollywood screenwriter who had extensively collaborated with Manuel Asensio .
So “ Asensio ” and “ Wilkins ” were written on the diagram .
I had also learned that another manager of Kingsford Capital was Cory Johnson , who , along with Herb and Jim Cramer , was one of TheStreet.com ’s founding editors – a member of “ Murderers ’ Row . ”
( Johnson had previously earned his financial creds as the editor of a hip - hop basketball magazine . )
At the time , Kingsford was also paying consulting fees to Justin Hibbard , who had just left his job at BusinessWeek .
Since Kingsford and Asensio were favored sources of that other former BusinessWeek reporter , Gary Weiss ( whose only employment at the time was writing a blog smearing Patrick Byrne and denying the existence of phantom stock ) , I had put his name on the diagram , too .
And finally , I had noted on the diagram that several companies shorted by Kingsford Capital and Asensio happened to have been victimized by phantom stock .
So there they were – these diagrams .
And then , one day in November 2006 , there was a man .
He walked into the offices of the Columbia Journalism Review , strolled up to my desk , glanced at the diagrams , and smiled .
Then he went into our conference room with an editor of the Columbia Journalism Review .
After a short time , the editor invited me into the conference room to meet this man .
The man was very cordial .
He smiled and presented me with his business card .
The card said , “ Mike Wilkins , Kingsford Capital . ”
Mr. Wilkins had a proposal for the Columbia Journalism Review .
And this proposal involved a large sum of money .

Meet Judd Bagley , crack technologist and Deep Capture investigator .
He ’s at his desk , which is half - covered with a tangled mess of wires and hard drives –his hands are up in the air , fingers fluttering like the wings of a hummingbird , and he’s in the midst of a gorgeously long sentence that begins with something about Spartan war tactics , then segues into thoughts on Tennessee Williams and the origins of the marble in the Parthenon , and now seems finally to be ending with a lengthy explication of his “ methods ” for exposing the obsessions and transgressions of a former BusinessWeek reporter named Gary Weiss .
“ … and using my methods , ” he concludes with an adjustment of his spectacles , “ I ’ve been able to deduce that Gary Weiss is … ”
.. that Gary Weiss is , in essence , a charlatan and a scoundrel .
It is owing to Judd ’s work that we know , without a shadow of doubt , that the hedge fund manager who calls himself Mr. Pink pays Gary ’s friend , the flimflammer Floyd Schneider , through his intermediary Michelle McDonough , a convicted stock manipulator formerly known as Michelle Sarian .
Hedge funds affiliated with Mr. Pink , meanwhile , are paying convicted fraudster Barry Minkow , who is receiving large wads of money from the crook Sam Antar , who spends most of his time working with Gary to smear Patrick Byrne and Overstock .
In appreciation of Judd ’s efforts in delineating these connections , Sam Antar the Crook has issued some nasty threats , at one point posting the names of Judd ’s two young daughters on the internet .
So , right –these ( along with Manuel Asensio and Kingsford Capital ) are Gary Weiss ’s friends .
He ’s probably been working with at least some of them since 1995 , when he published “ The Mob on Wall Street ” and another story , “ The Secret World of Short - Sellers . ”
In the latter story , Gary provided a sympathetic account of a short - seller who was n’t named , but whom we know to be Asensio .
The short - seller is painted as something of a hero for attacking a small oil company called Solv - Ex .
As Gary knew ( because he mentioned it in passing in “ The Mob on Wall Street ” ) , Solv-ex had alleged at the time that a group of Mafia - linked investors were playing games with its stock .
This was never proven .
But a federal grand jury later looked into suspicious short - selling of Solv-ex , and the company sued Asensio , along with Michelle Sarian ( a.k.a. Michelle McDonough ) and Deutsche Bank ’s Morgen Grenfell Asset Management .
( Separately , Peter Young , a Morgen Grenfell fund manager who had set up secret accounts to invest in the oil company , was prosecuted in England .
Peter showed up in court wearing a floral dress , bright red lipstick , and high heels – and then plead insanity ) .
In any case , we know that Michelle Sarian ( a.k.a. Michelle McDonough ) is now helping Mr. Pink pay Gary ’s friend , Floyd the Flimflammer , to smear public companies on the internet .
And thanks to Judd ’s methods ( pure genius , these methods ) we have concrete proof that Gary has himself used a variety of fake names to post thousands of messages on internet stock discussion boards , such as Yahoo !
The messages either defame people who believe that phantom stock is a problem , or contain negative information about companies shorted by Mr. Pink and other hedge funds affiliated with the Cramer constellation .
And , really , Gary ’s efforts go way beyond the call of duty .
By tracking the IP footprints left by Gary ’s computer , Judd has been able to observe the former BusinessWeek reporter posting , non-stop , for stretches of 24 hours and longer , his writing becoming more and more garbled as time goes by .
Gary also spends time on Amazon.com , writing anonymous reviews of his own books .
As soon as this habit was exposed on Judd ’s blog , Antisocialmedia.net , Gary scrambled to erase the reviews , but we preserved a few nice examples .
Here is Gary ’s review of Gary ’s book about the Mob on Wall Street :
“ Why ?
BECAUSE YOU CAN’T PUT IT DOWN !!!!!
I took this book to the beach during the July 4th weekend and made the mistake of starting to read it in the afternoon .
There I was as the sun was setting at 8 , and I was still reading it .
Everyone was gone and I was squinting as the sun went down .
That ’s how electrifying this book is . ”
Man , that ’s a good book .
* * * * * * * *
For further insight into the character and tactics of Gary Weiss , consider the story of how Gary plotted to destroy a fellow journalist named Ian Williams , a reporter for The Nation who was president of the United Nations Correspondents Association ( UNCA ) .
Apparently , Gary ’s wife wanted a position in the UNCA that was held by Williams ’ wife , a BBC World Service journalist and a native of Uzbekistan .
So Gary tried to drive Mrs. Williams out of the country by accusing her of lying in order to get a U.S. visa .
Gary ’s allegations proved absolutely false .
Instead , it emerged that Gary ’s wife , a citizen of India , had herself forged a bunch of documents to secure UN press credentials .
For example , as part of her application , Mrs. Weiss submitted multiple stories that she had purportedly written for The Pioneer , an Indian newspaper , and a letter confirming her appointment to that newspaper , signed by the Pioneer ’s editor .
The stories were fakes –later proven to have been photo - shopped on a computer — and the Pioneer ’s editor , Chandan Mitra , stated that Gary ’s wife had “ never been engaged by The Pioneer for any purpose . ”
He added that the signature on the letter was “ an outright forgery ” .
The UN revoked Mrs. Weiss ’s credentials and escorted her from UN premises under armed guard .
Days later , Gary was on Amazon , anonymously trashing Ian Williams ’ books .
Then he founded “ Mediacrity , ” a blog supposedly devoted to media criticism , but actually focused , at least initially , on heckling Ian Williams and circulating unfounded rumors about Williams ’ wife .
* * * * * * * *
It would be possible to dismiss Gary as a marginal creep .
But his strange views on phantom stock are widely cited .
Herb Greenberg and other journalists regularly promote his blog .
Meanwhile , Gary and his crook friends do more than post lies on blogs and internet message boards .
They have also seized control of Wikipedia – one of the most important ( though certainly not accurate ) sources of information on the internet .
That ’s right , Gary Weiss was until recently the sole ( anonymous ) author of multiple Wikipedia pages , including the blatantly distorted entries on naked short selling ( phantom stock ) , Overstock , and Patrick Byrne .
( Gary Weiss is , of course , also the author of the glowing Wikipedia page on Gary Weiss . )
And though Wikipedia claims that it can be edited by anyone , the truth is that until this scandal broke , the pages authored by Gary Weiss were given special protection .
Nobody other than Gary Weiss could touch them .
Judd put together proof of what Gary was doing , and submitted it for review to a high - ranking Wikipedia administrator known only by the screen name , “ SlimVirgin . ”
Rather than examine this evidence , SlimVirgin immediately forwarded it to Gary Weiss .
One of Judd ’s “ methods ” allowed him to determine this immediately .
Judd also quickly learned that Gary ’s privileged status on Wikipedia was , in fact , the result of SlimVirgin ’s interventions .
For months , anytime a user attempted to edit a page controlled by Gary , SlimVirgin would step in and restore Gary ’s preferred version .
Wikipedia allows its administrators to remain anonymous , and they would if it were n’t for clever internet sleuth Daniel Brandt .
Brandt unmasked the man who edited the Wikipedia entry of one - time government official John Seigenthaler to suggest that Seigenthaler had a role in the assassinations of both JFK and RFK .
Brandt also revealed that a Wikipedia administrator who had claimed to be a professor of theology with two doctorates was , in fact , a 24 - year - old college drop - out .
These two incidents became the basis for critiques of Wikipedia in the New Yorker and other mainstream media .
For his third act , Brandt discovered that SlimVirgin ’s true identity is one Linda Mack , a woman who was suspected of working as a British intelligence agent .
It turns out that Linda Mack also studied philosophy with Patrick Byrne at Cambridge University , where , for a time , they had a close if somewhat odd relationship .
Patrick wrote a public letter describing this relationship .
The letter has literary merit .
Check it out here .
Meanwhile , John Cooley , a former correspondent for ABC News , wrote a public letter describing how Mack had once worked as a research assistant for ABC .
His former boss , Pierre Salinger , fired SlimVirgin when he began to suspect that she was spying on ABC for MI5 , the British intelligence agency .
Soon after Cooley sent this letter , I interviewed a man named Edwin Bollier , who was once accused of supplying the suitcase bomb that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie , Scotland , in 1988 .
SlimVirgin ’s boyfriend was on that plane , so that could explain her interest .
But Boiller says that SlimVirgin once showed up in his office and identified herself as an agent for MI5 .
When Judd reveals that Gary Weiss is the anonymous editor who has conspired with the supposed one - time MI5 agent called SlimVirgin to hijack the Wikipedia pages on phantom stock , Wikipedia founder Jimbo Wales and SlimVirgin dismiss it all as “ conspiracy theory . ”
Wales announces that Gary Weiss has nothing to do with those pages .
Gary himself flat out denies that he has ever edited a Wikipedia page .
When Judd continues to present his evidence , and persists in making this an issue , Wikipedia administrators begin to debate an Orwellian “ Bad Sites ” policy which would prohibit a certain website from being mentioned on Wikipedia .
This online debate generates more words than are contained in the New Testament ( literally , Judd has done a comparison ) and is focused entirely on Judd ’s blog , Antisocialmedia.net , as the one “ Bad Site . ”
Things get really strange when Wikipedia ’s administrators decide that their discussion about this “ Bad Site ” must continue without mention of the site itself .
So now , websites advertising child pornography and other evils are regularly mentioned on Wikipedia , but a single utterance of “ Antisocialmedia.net ” , a blog devoted largely to describing the strange attempts of Gary Weiss and SlimVirgin to whitewash the problem of phantom stock , is enough to have an administrator removed from his position and banned forever from Wikipedia .
Then Wikipedia takes the unprecedented step of blocking the IP addresses of Overstock and 1,000 homes in Judd ’s neighborhood in Traverse Mountain , Utah .
One should not underestimate the significance of this : Judd and his neighbors , and the employees of Patrick Byrne ’s Overstock.com , become the only people on the planet who cannot access the Wikipedia edit function .
The Register , an internet publication ( something like a British version of Wired Magazine ) , does a story about this , titled , “ Wikipedia Black Helicopters Circle Utah ’s Traverse Mountain . ”
Meanwhile , Jimbo Wales and SlimVirgin continue to vehemently deny that Gary Weiss has anything to do with the “ Naked short selling ” Wikipedia entry .
But then several of Wales ’s contributions to a very small and private email list are leaked to Judd .
One of these – a September , 2007 email from Wales — alluding to Mantanmoreland , the on- line alias of the author of the Wikipedia “ Naked short selling ” entry – reads as follows :
From : jwales@wikia.com ( Jimbo Wales )
I just want to go on record as saying that I believe the reason for this is that Mantanmoreland is in fact Gary Weiss .
When Wikipedia administrators see this , they rise up against Wales .
For months , Wales and SlimVirgin have been assuring them that Gary is not the editor of the entries on naked short selling – that Judd is n’t cre

' Who the f*** are you to lecture me ? ' : Russian minister 's extraordinary rant at David Miliband
David Miliband was subjected to an astonishing four - letter tirade from his Russian counterpart at the height of the Georgia crisis .
The Foreign Secretary received the undiplomatic tongue - lashing over the telephone after expressing the EU 's anger with the Kremlin , it was revealed yesterday .
At one point Sergei Lavrov , the colourful Russian foreign minister , became so incensed that he reportedly barked : ' Who the f*** are you to lecture me ? '
Dressing down : David Miliband , left , has reportedly been given a tongue - lashing by his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov
Mr Lavrov , who is seen as the fearsome face of Russia 's new aggressive foreign policy , objected to what he believed was Mr Miliband 's condescending tone .
He used full - strength industrial language to suggest to the Foreign Secretary that he knew little , if anything , of Russia 's history - perhaps unaware that Mr Miliband 's grandfather Samuel served in the Red Army and his father Ralph was a leading Marxist theoretician .
Such was the repeated use of the F - word that it was difficult to draft a readable note of the exchange , according to one insider who has seen the transcript .
A Whitehall source said : ' It was effing this and effing that .
' It was not what you would call diplomatic language .
It was rather shocking . '
Mr Miliband was ' surprised ' by the ferocity of the verbal attack and the nature of the language , an insider close to the Foreign Secretary added .
It came as he put forward objections to the Russian invasion of Georgia following a meeting with EU foreign ministers in Brussels last month .
Sources at the Foreign Office said the exchange came before Mr Miliband 's controversial visit to Russia 's neighbour Ukraine , where he flew the flag for Western democracy - otherwise the onslaught might have been even more severe .

Bill Clinton : I understand exactly why American voters think that Sarah Palin is hot
Republican vice presidential candidate is ' hot ' , former president Bill Clinton has admitted .
' I come from Arkansas , I get why she 's hot out there , ' Clinton said .
' People look at her , and they say , " All those kids .
Something that happens in everybody 's family .
I 'm glad she loves her daughter and she 's not ashamed of her .
Glad that girl 's going around with her boyfriend .
Glad they 're going to get married " .'
Clinton also claimed that voters liked the fact Palin could cope with her child suffering from Down 's syndrome .
Hot stuff : U.S. Republican vice - presidential candidate Governor Sarah Palin and her family members .
Clockwise , starting with Governor Palin at centre , husband Todd , daughter Bristol , daughter Piper , daughter Willow and son Track
He said voters would think : ' I like that little Down 's syndrome kid .
One of them lives down the street .
They 're wonderful children .
They 're wonderful people .
' And I like the idea that this guy does those long - distance races .
Stayed in the race for 500 miles with a broken arm .
My kind of guy . "
Palin , the governor of Alaska , became an overnight star when Republican presidential candidate John McCain tapped her for his running mate .
Her family , including her Down 's syndrome baby , Trig , her pregnant 17 - year - old daughter , Bristol , and her husband , Todd , four - time winner of the 2,000 - mile Iron Dog snowmobile race , have garnered intense media interest .
' I get this , ' Clinton said .
' My view is ... why say , ever , anything bad about a person ?
Why do n't we like them and celebrate them and be happy for her elevation to the ticket ?
Rival : Democratic presidential candidate Senator Barack Obama and former U.S. president Bill Clinton appear together in New York earlier this month
' And just say that she was a good choice for him and we disagree with them ? '
Meanwhile , Mrs Palin yesterday met her first world leaders .
It was a tightly controlled crash course on foreign policy for the first - term Alaska governor , who has been outside North America just once .
Palin sat down with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe .
The private conversation and public pictures were meant to pad her resume for voters concerned about her lack of experience in world affairs .
' I found her quite a capable woman , ' Karzai said later .
' She asked the right questions on Afghanistan . '
The self - described ' hockey mom ' also asked former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for insights on Georgia , Russia , China and Iran , and she 'll see more leaders Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly meetings .
Sit - down chat : Mrs Palin meets former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , three hours behind Palin in seeing Karzai , found herself overshadowed for a day as she made her own rounds .
Senator John McCain 's presidential campaign has shielded Palin for weeks from spontaneous questions from voters and reporters , and went to striking lengths Tuesday to maintain that distance as Palin made her diplomatic debut .
The Republican campaign , applying more restrictive rules on access than even President George W. Bush uses in the White House , banned reporters from the start of the meetings , so as not to risk a question being asked of Palin .
McCain aides relented after news organizations objected and CNN , which was supplying TV footage to a variety of networks , decided to pull its TV crew from Palin 's meeting with Karzai .
Easy tiger : Sarah Palin shakes hands with Kissinger after a meeting at his Park Avenue offices in New York
Palin is studying foreign policy ahead of her one debate with Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Biden , a senator with deep credentials on that front .
More broadly , the Republican ticket is trying to counter questions exploited by Democrats about her qualifications to serve as vice president and step into the presidency at a moment 's notice if necessary .
There was no chance of putting such questions to rest with photo opportunities Tuesday .
But Palin , who got a passport only last year , no longer has to own up to a blank slate when asked about heads of state she has met .
She also got her first intelligence briefing Tuesday , over two hours long .
Karzai generated light laughter when he told an audience at the Asia Society that , in addition to Rice and Norway 's prime minister , he had seen Palin on Tuesday .
Thomas Freston , a member of the society 's board , drew loud applause and laughter when he responded : ' You 're probably the only person in the room who 's met Gov. Palin . '
Randy Scheunemann , a longtime McCain aide on foreign policy , was close at hand during her meetings .
Another adviser , Stephen Biegun , also accompanied her at each meeting and briefed reporters later .
High - powered : Mrs Palin moved on to a meeting with Afghanistan 's President Hamid Karzai at a hotel in Midtown Manhattan
Karzai and Palin discussed security problems in Afghanistan , including cross - border insurgencies .
They also talked about the need for more U.S. troops there , which both McCain and Democrat Barack Obama say is necessary , Biegun said .
With both Karzai and Uribe , Palin discussed the importance of energy security .
With Uribe , the conversation also touched on the proposed U.S. - Colombian Free Trade
Agreement that McCain and Palin support but Obama opposes .
Her meeting with Kissinger , which lasted more than an hour , covered a range of national security and foreign policy issues , specifically Russia , Iran and China , Biegun said .
' Rather than make specific policy prescriptions , she was largely listening , having an exchange of views and also very interested in forming a relationship with people she met with today , ' he said .
As for the foreign leaders , Colombia 's foreign minister , Jaime Bermudez , said that Palin and Uribe discussed the Bush administration 's free trade agreement with Colombia , which McCain supports but Democrats in Congress have refused to bring to a vote .
' The crisis on Wall Street was also discussed , ' Bermudez said .
' She knows the topic well . '
Uribe 's press secretary , Cesar Mauricio Velasquez , revealed the meeting lasted for 25 minutes and also touched on Colombian security and the global campaign against terrorists .
' The conversation was interesting , opportune and relaxed , ' he said .
Before that , Palin met Karzai for a half hour .
The two chatted about his son Mirwais in remarks overheard by a CNN producer before leaving the room .
Karzai told her the name means Light of the House , as she nodded .
Who are you again ?

At the next two meetings , first with Uribe and then with Kissinger , reporters were let in for a few seconds as each session began .
With Kissinger , Palin could be heard discussing the situation in Georgia .
' You 're going to give me more insight on that also , ' Palin told Kissinger .
They met for more than an hour .
' It was great , ' she said later before turning to get into her sport utility vehicle .
Before Palin 's first meeting of the day , with Karzai , campaign aides told reporters in the press pool that followed her that they could not go into meetings where photographers and a video camera crew would be let in for pictures .
Bush and members of Congress routinely allow reporters to attend photo opportunities along with photographers , and the reporters sometimes are able to ask questions at the beginning of private meetings before they are ushered out .
At least two news organisations , including AP , objected to the exclusion of reporters and were told that the decision to have a ' photo spray ' only was not subject to discussion .
After aides backed away from that , campaign spokeswoman Tracey Schmitt said the reporter ban was a ' miscommunication ' .
On Wednesday , McCain and Palin are expected to meet jointly with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and Ukrainian President Viktor Yuschenko .
Palin is then to meet separately with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh .
Palin , 44 , has been to neighbouring Canada and to Mexico , and made a brief trip to Kuwait and Germany to see Alaska National Guard troops .
How you can stay flexible by stretching your mind ... and body
Back trouble can be eased and cured by regular stretching
The minute we got out of bed this morning , millions of us will have stretched and yawned .
Stretching in its most basic form is natural , enjoyable and instinctive .
Even before getting out of bed , I would recommend doing some simple stretches before putting any weight on to your joints .
Try stretching after a hot bath or shower in the morning when your muscles have warmed up or , if you prefer , at the end of the day when your muscles have been naturally warmed .
Why is stretching so important ?
When we are young we are blessed with natural mobility and balance , and injuries recover quickly and easily .
As we grow older we lose flexibility in our muscles , tendons and ligaments which directly correlates to aching and an increased risk of injury .
Women tend to be significantly more flexible than men , but as we age we all tend to lose flexibility , although it is often down to inactivity rather than the ageing process .
As little as ten minutes a day , three days a week , can improve circulation and posture , and help you manage stress - well - stretched muscles hold less tension .
Stretching can decrease pain and soreness after exercise , also known as DOMS ( Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness ) .
One area where stretching is useful is in the prevention of back pain .
Our back is the core of our skeletal and muscular system so it is important we maintain it .
The back moves in only six directions - it flexes forward , extends back , side bends right and left and rotates right and left .
Therefore to stretch the back thoroughly we must stretch it every day in all six directions .
The difference between a stretch and a warm - up
Warming up raises muscle temperature - a vital factor for muscle elasticity .
Stretching is most effective after a brief warmup such as walking , a light jog or cycling .
This increases circulation , making the muscles more ' elastic ' and less prone to injury .
Static stretching is the gradual movement through a muscle 's full range of movement until a resistance is felt and then the position is held .
When holding a stretch for up to half a minute a warm pulling sensation can be felt through the muscles being stretched .
For example , bend forward , touch your toes , hold that position and feel a pulling in the lower back muscles and hamstrings that subsides once the stretch is released .
Should I cool down too ?
Absolutely .
Cooling down maximises the benefits of stretching and exercise , allowing the body gradually to adjust from an exertional state to a resting state .
Cooling down should involve a lower - intensity slow jog or walk for a minimum of five to ten minutes , followed by stretching .
Stretch your muscles and let your heart rate slow down gradually .
You can use the same warm - up stretches .
Cooling down helps remove lactic acid from the muscles and allows the heart to return to its resting rate .
As you build up your muscular and aerobic capacity , your body will be able to handle higher levels of lactic acid and thus reduce any pain you might feel .
Take in fluids during and after exercise to keep your body hydrated .
During exercise you sweat and breathe off huge amounts of fluid , which reduces blood volume and makes you tired .
Anyone who exercises vigorously can increase their endurance by taking in fluids .
Heat and ice work wonders
Heat is used to boost circulation as a rich blood supply helps keep tissues nourished .
Ice is the perfect anti-inflammatory .
Inflamed tissue produces a substance much like glue that binds the fibres together .
Known as adhesions , they cause pain and restricted movement through the injured tissue .
Inflammation complicates and extends the time it takes for recovery .
In modern sport treatment , ice is strapped to the affected area even before an athlete has been taken from the field of play .
Ice is best employed the instant the injury happens , and heat once it begins to improve .

A routine to beat the ravages of time
• Take time to introduce stretching into your daily regime .
It will help to prevent injuries in the future and resist ravages that time inflicts on the body .
If you have back , neck , bone or joint problems , consult your doctor before beginning a programme .
No stretching routine should be painful .
Pain indicates either incorrect technique or an underlying physical problem .
• At some point , back pain affects an estimated eight out of ten of us and is responsible for more time off work than any other condition .
If you suffer , investigate a stretching routine that improves the extension of muscles and other soft tissues of the back .
This can reduce back stiffness , improve range of motion and add strength .
• Always avoid bouncing while stretching .
Maintain a smooth and controlled movement to obtain the optimum stretch .
• Stretching should be done gradually over a long period of time and then maintained to prevent slipping back towards inflexibility .
Some people will enthusiastically embark on a stretching programme but give up two weeks later .
• Be patient and consistent .
It 's also important to relax during your stretching routine .
It should not be a rushed event .
The ' I 've got to hurry up and do this so I can go ' attitude is counter - productive .
• Breathing effectively assists your stretches and makes them more productive .
To maximise the benefits , exhale as you go into your stretch .
