This article reminds me of a similar successful effort carried out in the 1970s by Sherri Tepper of Rocky Mountain Planned Parenthood .

A pregnancy prevention program based at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro that pays 12 to 18 year old girls one dollar for every day they are not pregnant has spurred conversation and raised eyebrows as it has made its way through the blogosphere .
College Bound Sisters was founded in its most infant stages almost 20 years ago by Hazel Brown , professor of nursing , and Rebecca Saunders , associate dean of the graduate school .
But the program made headlines after a Fox News story brought to light its incentive - based system .
Brown emphasized that College Bound Sisters is more than just a monetary transaction .
The money — which gets deposited into a college savings account — is given to the participants only after they achieve all three goals of the program : not getting pregnant , graduating from high school and enrolling in college .
The girls also receive $ 5 per week for transportation to the program ’s classes in sexual health and preparation for college .
Some students who have stuck with it have received over $ 2,000 toward a college degree .

Case Study
The powerful dossier by the aid agency reveals how women and children in Afghanistan are bearing the brunt of the ongoing conflict , undermining the international community 's claims that they are the very people being helped by the West 's activities .
Its contents will add to mounting concerns among the public , and in some quarters of the military and the House of Commons , that the US and the UK are fighting an ill - conceived and ill - judged war that has left as many as 32,000 Afghans dead and 235,000 displaced .
While Americans read in Time about the light at the end of the tunnel , in Saigon women secreted guns , ammunitions , land mines , and grenades in flower baskets and laundry bundles , and spies set up as taxi drivers and noodle sellers prepared to breach the U.S. embassy .
They succeeded -- as 85,000 troops of the National Liberation Front and the North Vietnamese army overran thirty - nine of forty - four South Vietnamese provincial capitals .
The Tet Offensive : the tidal wave dousing the light at the end of the tunnel .
The White House Budget Office estimates that it will cost about $ 1 million for each additional soldier sent to Afghanistan .
So , a surge of 30,000 to 40,000 troops -- which is what Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal is recommending -- would add $ 30 billion to $ 40 billion a year to the deficit .
At the Pentagon , the comptroller disagrees , estimating the cost of deploying and maintaining one soldier in Afghanistan for a full year at $ 500,000 .
So , bottom line would be $ 15 billion to $ 20 billion ...
An escalation in military spending could put Obama in the awkward position of winning Republican votes for the budget while losing Democratic ones for the policy .
And a drain on the nation 's bottom line also could imperil domestic programs favored by the White House .
A new surge , said Wisconsin Democrat David Obey , would " drain the spirit of the country ... as well as drain the U.S.
Treasury , it would devour virtually any other priorities that the president or anyone in Congress had . "
Last month 25 % of Brits polled wanted their troops out of Afghanistan asap .
Last week it was 63 % who had figured out this war was useless .
And now the figure is 71 % .
This weekend the U.S. media was trumpeting the decision by Germany to send another 100 troops to give a hand to the 30 - 40,000 Obama is about to announce he 's sending to that hellhole .
A report from Oxfam has soured the British public on the whole mess .
As if by clockwork , the increasingly less popular British prime minister , Gordon Brown , may have found a way to turn the opinion polls around for himself .
Today 's he 's calling for a summit of NATO leaders to discuss an end to the occupation of Afghanistan ... eventually .
Still , as Steve Hynd pointed out , Brown certainly would n't have made that call without first consulting with Obama , possibly an indication that Obama is realizing he has to end this mess -- and soon .
Reading about Obama 's horrible dilemma in Afghanistan keeps making me think about how the Vietnam War destroyed LBJ 's presidency -- if not his life .
I recall a description I read in Rick Perlstein 's brilliant and startling predictive Nixonland I 've spent time in Afghanistan and Vietnam .
If I had to pick between the two to fight , I 'd pick the Vietnamese ... hands down .
I think Rudyard Kipling would agree : Sounds worse than the grenades in the flower basket .
Kipling also said : " Asia is not going to be civilized after the methods of the West .
There is too much Asia and she is too old . "
And yesterday ' sreiterated what this unwinnable war is costing , something the Republicans and Blue Dogs never seem to mind quite as much as they do when one discusses passing healthcare reform .
Obey , the powerful chair of the House Appropriations Committee , has promised that June 's supplemental war budget was the last one .
I can't imagine Obama allowing himself to be in the position of having to use pay - as - you - go for spending $ 30 - 40 billion .
And theway a substantial number of Democrats are going to agree tomoney for Afghanistan is if it comes with a well - conceieved strategy and timeline for exiting .
Now restive conservative Republicans are starting to desert Obama on Afghanistan , something that was inevitable :

State Finance Directors Warn of More Trouble Ahead
By SARA MURRAY Michigan and California are likely to face a fresh round of budget woes when federal stimulus funds used as a fiscal crutch dry up , finance directors for the states said Friday .
Short - term budget gaps have battered states as revenues plummeted during the recession .
Aided by about $ 250 billion in funds from the stimulus package expected through the end of next year , states managed to close the gaps this year .
But both finance directors , speaking at a Pew Center on the States event in Washington , were pessimistic about their states ' futures beyond fiscal 2011 .
" We 're facing a cliff in 2011 when stimulus dollars run out , " said Mitchell Bean , director of the Michigan House Fiscal Agency .
" There is not an end in sight , even in recovery . "
As of July 2009 , California 's budget shortfall was 49.3 % of its general funds .
States have considered drastic options to fill such gaps .
" I looked as hard as I could at how states could declare bankruptcy , " said Michael Genest , director of the California Department of Finance who is stepping down at the end of the year .
" I literally looked at the federal constitution to see if there was a way for states to return to territory status . "
There were no bankruptcy options , and the legislature chose to cut back sharply on education and health care to fill the gap .
Mr. Genest already predicts the 2011 shortfall will outpace the projected $ 7 billion gap .
It is a smaller deficit than this year 's gap , but the choices will be more difficult because so many cuts have already been made .
Mr. Genest estimated that , eventually , 40 % of the state 's budget would go to the state Medicaid program , 40 % to education , 10 % to debt service and 6 % to retiree medical services and pension — leaving little left for anything else , such as the state 's corrections system .
Mr. Bean described a similarly depressing scenario for Michigan , which could end the recession with 25 % fewer jobs than in June 2000 and a total of one million job losses .
Michigan 's unemployment rate in September was 15.3 % .
He suggested that strict term limits often lead to political gridlock that prevents large - scale changes , such as overhauling the tax code so it is broad - based with lower tax rates .
Mr. Bean said lawmakers will likely have to trim the budget at least 12.5 % this year after closing a $ 2.8 billion gap last year .
" Citizens do n't quite understand yet the implications of some of the cuts that we 've made , " Mr. Bean said .
" A lot of it has fallen on local governments .
I am very concerned that we 're going to have a lot of insolvencies in local governments . "
Derivatives Reform Bill Written By Someone ' Inside The Banks '
Michael Greenberger , a University of Maryland law professor and veteran federal regulator , studied the House committee 's 187 - page bill and detected the fine needlework of Wall Street lawyers .
" It had to be written by someone inside the banks , " Greenberger said , " because buried every few pages is a tricky and devilish ' exception . '
It would greatly surprise me if these poison pills originated from anyone on Capitol Hill or the Treasury . "
A well - informed Congressional source confirmed that the original language in the draft legislation was written by financial - industry experts .
It " was probably written by JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs , " he told me , " and possibly the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . "
It would seem that we ’re headed into an area that the rule of law does not cover … namely that of individual states going bankrupt .
It ’s not happened before , the Constitution does not address it , nor does any other set of laws .
So , will the Fed step in and bail the states out ?
Of course they will , they already are , just not enough to save them yet .
The real question , of course , is who bails out our nation ?
Any way you slice it , ultimately it ’s going to be you and I , and I ’m going to have a lot to say on that subject , because my preferred way of doing so will not look anything like the central bankers have planned , that ’s for sure .
Scary article really , we are going to face a tough road ahead :
As usual , tons of real problems with no real answers to be found .
That ’s because real answers do n’t exist in the boxes presented to you .
Watch “ The Secret of Oz ” and get ready for some real answers to flow your way .
Oh , and here 's a snipet from a terrific example of business as usual ...
There you have it , how laws are really written in America .
Any law written in a competent manner , such as Ron Paul 's Audit the Fed bill wind up so gutted that they become completely meaningless , or worse , even more dangerous , like the bank " stress tests " that are designed to enhance perception only and leave the sheep with a false sense of security .
There is obviously a better path forward for America , we need to get to work .

Something Is Wrong When 81 % Of Fox Newsers Are Voting ' Yes ' To This Question
Obama ’s Copenhagen Speech
Good morning .
It is an honor for me to join this distinguished group of leaders from nations around the world .
We come here in Copenhagen because climate change poses a grave and growing danger to our people .
All of you would not be here unless you — like me — were convinced that this danger is real .
This is not fiction , it is science .
Unchecked , climate change will pose unacceptable risks to our security , our economies , and our planet .
This much we know .
The question , then , before us is no longer the nature of the challenge — the question is our capacity to meet it .
For while the reality of climate change is not in doubt , I have to be honest , as the world watches us today , I think our ability to take collective action is in doubt right now , and it hangs in the balance .
I believe we can act boldly , and decisively , in the face of a common threat .
That ’s why I come here today — not to talk , but to act .
Now , as the world ’s largest economy and as the world ’s second largest emitter , America bears our responsibility to address climate change , and we intend to meet that responsibility .
That ’s why we ’ve renewed our leadership within international climate change negotiations .
That ’s why we ’ve worked with other nations to phase out fossil fuel subsidies .
That ’s why we ’ve taken bold action at home — by making historic investments in renewable energy ; by putting our people to work increasing efficiency in our homes and buildings ; and by pursuing comprehensive legislation to transform to a clean energy economy .
These mitigation actions are ambitious , and we are taking them not simply to meet global responsibilities .
We are convinced , as some of you may be convinced , that changing the way we produce and use energy is essential to America ’s economic future — that it will create millions of new jobs , power new industries , keep us competitive , and spark new innovation .
We ’re convinced , for our own self - interest , that the way we use energy , changing it to a more efficient fashion , is essential to our national security , because it helps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil , and helps us deal with some of the dangers posed by climate change .
So I want this plenary session to understand , America is going to continue on this course of action to mitigate our emissions and to move towards a clean energy economy , no matter what happens here in Copenhagen .
We think it is good for us , as well as good for the world .
But we also believe that we will all be stronger , all be safer , all be more secure if we act together .
That ’s why it is in our mutual interest to achieve a global accord in which we agree to certain steps , and to hold each other accountable to certain commitments .
After months of talk , after two weeks of negotiations , after innumerable side meetings , bilateral meetings , endless hours of discussion among negotiators , I believe that the pieces of that accord should now be clear .
First , all major economies must put forward decisive national actions that will reduce their emissions , and begin to turn the corner on climate change .
I ’m pleased that many of us have already done so .
Almost all the major economies have put forward legitimate targets , significant targets , ambitious targets .
And I ’m confident that America will fulfill the commitments that we have made : cutting our emissions in the range of 17 percent by 2020 , and by more than 80 percent by 2050 in line with final legislation .
Second , we must have a mechanism to review whether we are keeping our commitments , and exchange this information in a transparent manner .
These measures need not be intrusive , or infringe upon sovereignty .
They must , however , ensure that an accord is credible , and that we ’re living up to our obligations .
Without such accountability , any agreement would be empty words on a page .
I do n’t know how you have an international agreement where we all are not sharing information and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments .
That does n’t make sense .
It would be a hollow victory .
Number three , we must have financing that helps developing countries adapt , particularly the least developed and most vulnerable countries to climate change .
America will be a part of fast - start funding that will ramp up to $ 10 billion by 2012 .
And yesterday , Secretary Hillary Clinton , my Secretary of State , made it clear that we will engage in a global effort to mobilize $ 100 billion in financing by 2020 , if — and only if — it is part of a broader accord that I have just described .
Mitigation .
Transparency .
Financing .
It ’s a clear formula — one that embraces the principle of common but differentiated responses and respective capabilities .
And it adds up to a significant accord — one that takes us farther than we have ever gone before as an international community .
I just want to say to this plenary session that we are running short on time .
And at this point , the question is whether we will move forward together or split apart , whether we prefer posturing to action .
I ’m sure that many consider this an imperfect framework that I just described .
No country will get everything that it wants .
There are those developing countries that want aid with no strings attached , and no obligations with respect to transparency .
They think that the most advanced nations should pay a higher price ; I understand that .
There are those advanced nations who think that developing countries either cannot absorb this assistance , or that will not be held accountable effectively , and that the world ’s fastest - growing emitters should bear a greater share of the burden .
We know the fault lines because we ’ve been imprisoned by them for years .
These international discussions have essentially taken place now for almost two decades , and we have very little to show for it other than an increased acceleration of the climate change phenomenon .
The time for talk is over .
This is the bottom line :
We can embrace this accord , take a substantial step forward , continue to refine it and build upon its foundation .
We can do that , and everyone who is in this room will be part of a historic endeavor — one that makes life better for our children and our grandchildren .
Or we can choose delay , falling back into the same divisions that have stood in the way of action for years .
And we will be back having the same stale arguments month after month , year after year , perhaps decade after decade , all while the danger of climate change grows until it is irreversible .
Ladies and gentlemen , there is no time to waste .
America has made our choice .
We have charted our course .
We have made our commitments .
We will do what we say .
Now I believe it ’s the time for the nations and the people of the world to come together behind a common purpose .
We are ready to get this done today — but there has to be movement on all sides to recognize that it is better for us to act than to talk ; it ’s better for us to choose action over inaction ; the future over the past — and with courage and faith , I believe that we can meet our responsibility to our people , and the future of our planet .
Thank you very much .

Blow to gay rights campaigners as north - eastern US state , seen as liberal towards same - gender unions , says no at ballot box
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
Maine voters today repealed a state law that would have allowed gay couples to marry .
With 87 % % of the precincts reporting , those against same - sex marriage had 53 % of the vote .
The outcome represents a significant defeat for the gay rights movement , particularly because it happened in a north - eastern New England state – the corner of the country most supportive of gay marriage .
A " people 's veto " of a law passed this spring , which made Maine the sixth state to extend marriage to same - sex couples , was on the ballot .
The law was put on hold after conservatives launched a petition calling for it to be repealed in a referendum .
" The institution of marriage has been preserved in Maine and across the nation , " Frank Schubert , the chief organiser , said .
Supporters of gay marriage supporters had held out hope that the tide would shift but eventually conceded defeat .
" We 're in this for the long haul , " Jesse Connolly , the manager of the pro-gay marriage campaign , said .
" For next week , and next month , and next year – until all Maine families are treated equally .
" Because in the end , this has always been about love and family , and that will always be something worth fighting for . "
The Maine vote against same - sex marriage will encourage opponents who say American voters do not want to allow it .
A vote in favour would have been the first time same - sex marriage had been approved at the ballot .
Of the five others to have allowed same - sex marriage , four are in New England .
Connecticut , Iowa , Massachusetts , Vermont and New Hampshire allow same - sex couples to marry .
In those states , same - sex marriage was either enacted by the legislature or through judicial action .
In contrast , voters have approved gay marriage bans in every state – 31 –in which they have reached the ballot , a statistic same - sex marriage opponents say shows that Americans want to keep the institution of marriage between a man and a woman .
In a similar vote in California last year , voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment to restrict marriage to a man and a woman , overturning a judicial decision .
The Maine governor , John Baldacci , a Democrat , signed the same - sex marriage law in May , and opposed the repeal .
Money and volunteers streamed into the state on both sides of the fight .
Same - sex marriage backers led by a group called Protect Maine Equality raised $ 4 m ( £ 2.4 m ) , while $ 2.5 m was raised by Stand for Marriage Maine , a major backer of the repeal vote , according to the Associated Press .
Darwin ’s bulldog — Thomas H. Huxley

This is the pre-publication version which was subsequently abbreviated to appear in Creation 31( 3):39 –41 .
wikipedia.org Charles Darwin
Charles Darwin had little time for the scientific , theological and moral controversies engendered by the publication of his Origin of Species in 1859 .
Not so Thomas Henry Huxley ( 1825 –1895 ) , who leapt to the fray , even dubbing himself ‘ Darwin ’s bulldog ’ .
1
Darwin called him , ‘ My good and kind agent for the propagation of the Gospel — i.e. the devil ’s Gospel . ’2
It was Huxley , not Darwin , who enraptured and outraged audiences in the 1860s with talk of our ape ancestors and cave men .
London turned out — from cardinals to Karl Marx — to be tantalized and tormented by his scintillating lectures .
‘ Bushy - bearded labourers with blistered hands flocked to his talks on our ancestry .
He drew the sort of crowds that are reserved for evangelists or rock stars today . ’3
‘ Out of his provocations came … the West ’s new faith — agnosticism ( he coined the word ) . ’3
Youth and self - education
wikipedia.org Thomas H. Huxley
Thomas was born in Ealing village , near London , in 1825 , the seventh of eight Huxley children .
Neglected by his father , he grew up in poverty , with only two years of formal schooling .
Living in the industrial squalor of the 1840s , where the Church was a rich man ’s luxury , he sought redemption through self - education .
At the age of 12 he read James Hutton ’s Theory of the Earth and had his first encounter with anti-biblical geology .
An avid reader of history , science and philosophy , he taught himself almost everything he knew until he entered Charing Cross Hospital medical school .
4
He put himself through Part 1 of the Bachelor of Medicine exam at London University , winning the gold medal for anatomy and physiology , but did not present to sit Part 2.5
He then became Assistant Surgeon ( ‘ surgeon ’s mate ’ ) on HMS Rattlesnake for a southern oceans surveying voyage ( 1846–1850 ) .
Although Huxley had no formal university degree , 6 the publishing of his researches on the structure of various marine invertebrates from this trip secured his future acceptance by the British scientific community . 7
In 1851 , at age 25 , he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society ( F.R.S. ) , which also awarded him its Royal Medal in 1852 , a year before Charles Darwin received the same honour .
Huxley and Darwin
In November 1859 , Darwin published his Origin of Species .
He had been putting it off for some twenty years , ‘ fearing execration as an atheist ’ , but had been galvanised into action by a letter he had received the previous year from Alfred Russel Wallace in which Wallace had broached the same idea as Darwin’s of ‘ survival of the fittest ’.
8
Though Darwin was careful not to say it , the Origin ultimately meant that man was not created , but was merely a developed ape .
‘ But without the promise of Heaven or the fear of Hell , why should we live a good life ?
’9 Darwin had hoped to avoid all such controversy .
Not so Huxley , who earlier had written to a colleague , ‘ After all , it is as respectable to be modified monkey as modified dirt ’ .10 Thus , Darwin needed a champion as much as Huxley needed a cause , and soon Darwin was claiming Huxley as his ‘ warmest & most important supporter ’, 11 and ‘ my good and admirable agent for the promulgation of damnable heresies ’.12
Concerning the attempts of theologians to say the Flood was only a local event , Huxley wrote , ‘ A child may see the folly of it . ’
Huxley exuberantly endorsed the naturalism of evolution although , surprisingly , not the mechanism for it .
He disagreed with Darwin on the tempo of evolution .
For example , Darwin excluded all saltation or ‘ jumps ’ , causing Huxley to write to him : ‘[ Y ] ou have loaded yourself with an unnecessary difficulty in adopting Natura non facit saltum [ Nature makes no leap ] so unreservedly .
’13 Huxley also disagreed ‘ on the analogy between artificial selection and natural selection , on hybridism , and on Darwin ’s hypothesis of Pangenesis , that development of features in a parent would be passed on to its offspring .
’14
Nevertheless , all this ambivalence by Huxley did not deter his fanatical and aggressive promotion of Darwin ’s theory .
As law professor Phillip Johnson comments , ‘ Faith in evolutionary naturalism is what unites the different factions of evolutionists , not agreement on any concrete scientific propositions .
15
What motivated Huxley ?
Historian Prof. Gertrude Himmelfarb writes , ‘ Huxley was the great avenger .
Raging against the inferior status of scientists compared with clergymen , he looked forward to the time when he could get his heel “ into their mouths and scr- r - unch it round ” .
The Origin gave him the opportunity .
’16
Huxley and the gospel
Huxley , although an unbeliever , was thoroughly familiar with the Gospel , and had little time for Christians who compromised their position by supporting the anti-biblical belief of evolutionary naturalism .
He wrote :
‘ I am fairly at a loss to comprehend how any one , for a moment , can doubt that Christian theology must stand or fall with the historical trustworthiness of the Jewish Scriptures .
The very conception of the Messiah , or Christ , is inextricably interwoven with Jewish history ; the identification of Jesus of Nazareth with that Messiah rests upon the interpretation of passages of the Hebrew Scriptures which have no evidential value unless they possess the historical character assigned to them .
If the covenant with Abraham was not made ; if circumcision and sacrifices were not ordained by Jahveh ; if the “ ten words ” were not written by God ’s hand on the stone tables ; if Abraham is more or less a mythical hero , such as Theseus ; the story of the Deluge a fiction ; that of the Fall a legend ; and that of the creation the dream of a seer ; if all these definite and detailed narratives of apparently real events have no more value as history than have the stories of the regal period of Rome — what is to be said about the Messianic doctrine , which is so much less clearly enunciated ?
And what about the authority of the writers of the books of the New Testament , who , on this theory , have not merely accepted flimsy fictions for solid truths , but have built the very foundations of Christian dogma upon legendary quicksands ?
’17
Huxley added that ‘ the Universality of the Deluge is recognised , not merely as a part of the story , but as a necessary consequence of some of its details .
’18 And then , concerning the attempts of theologians to say the Flood was only a local event , he wrote , ‘ A child may see the folly of it .
’19
‘ I venture to ask what sort of value , as an illustration of God ’s methods of dealing with sin , has an account of an event that never happened ?
He continued :
‘ When Jesus spoke , as of a matter of fact , that " the Flood came and destroyed them all , " did he believe that the Deluge really took place , or not ?
It seems to me that , as the narrative mentions Noah ’s wife , and his sons ’ wives , there is good scriptural warranty for the statement that the antediluvians married and were given in marriage ; and I should have thought that their eating and drinking might be assumed by the firmest believer in the literal truth of the story .
Moreover , I venture to ask what sort of value , as an illustration of God ’s methods of dealing with sin , has an account of an event that never happened ?
If no Flood swept the careless people away , how is the warning of more worth than the cry of “ Wolf ” when there is no wolf ?
If Jonah ’s three days ’ residence in the whale is not an “ admitted reality , ” how could it “ warrant belief ” in the “ coming resurrection ? ” …
Suppose that a Conservative orator warns his hearers to beware of great political and social changes , lest they end , as in France , in the domination of a Robespierre ; what becomes , not only of his argument , but of his veracity , if he , personally , does not believe that Robespierre existed and did the deeds attributed to him ?
’20
Concerning Matthew 19:5
[ ‘ Have ye not read , that he which made them from the beginning made them male and female , and said , For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother , and cleave to his wife ; and the twain shall become one flesh ? ’ ] ,
Huxley wrote ,
‘ If divine authority is not here claimed for the twenty - fourth verse of the second chapter of Genesis , what is the value of language ?
And again , I ask , if one may play fast and loose with the story of the Fall as a “ type ” or “ allegory , ” what becomes of the foundation of Pauline theology ?
’21
And concerning 1 Corinthians 15:21 – 22
[ ‘ For since by man came death , by man came also the resurrection of the dead .
For as in Adam all die , so also in Christ shall all be made alive . ’ ] ,
Huxley wrote ,
‘ If Adam may be held to be no more real a personage than Prometheus , and if the story of the Fall is merely an instructive “ type , ” comparable to the profound Promethean mythus , what value has Paul ’s dialectic ? ’
Summing up the position of theologians who compromised the words of the Bible , Huxley observed that ‘ the position they have taken up is hopelessly untenable ’ .
Darwin ’s death and the Abbey
When Darwin died , it was due mainly to the efforts of Huxley that he was buried , not in his home town of Downe , but in Westminster Abbey .
Huxley and his godless friends coerced Canon Farrar of Westminster Abbey , while others whipped up support in the House of Commons .
Thus , the liberal clergy , so despised by Huxley for their readiness to compromise , gave the remains of the agnostic Darwin spiritual recognition in the Abbey .
Huxley died 13 years later .
Some suggested a state funeral in the Abbey , but to his credit ‘ Huxley had anticipated and scotched that idea ’ .
22 Instead he had a simple funeral in his country town , attended by some of his scientific and atheist friends .
One of these gave his wishful opinion that ‘ “ he that believeth not shall be damned ” — is reserved for common people ; it does not apply to Fellows of the Royal Society ’.23
What is the relevance of Huxley ’s life to us today ?
In 1981 , the National Academy of Sciences [ USA ] resolved that ‘ Religion and science are separate and mutually exclusive realms of human thought whose presentation in the same context leads to misunderstanding of both scientific theory and religious belief .
’15 Law professor Phillip Johnson comments : ‘ The life of Thomas Huxley is the best answer to such nonsense .
In reality scientists ( like other people ) are obsessed with the God question and the whole point of evolutionary naturalism is to keep the Divine Foot , and the people gathered behind it , from getting inside the door .
’15
The statement from Rep. Price 's spokesman is positively dripping with weak surrender :
" ... at this point the people of his district are probably in the best position to register their approval or disapproval of Mr. Grayson 's consistently embarrassing behavior , " said Price spokesman Brendan Buck .
Shorter spokesman : " Uncle " .
Chris Bowers at Open Left makes a very good point :
It is almost unprecedented for Republicans to back down from their demands for an apology from a Democrat .
And yet , that is exactly what happened here .
And Talking Points Memo is reporting that Grayson is not showing any inclination to tone down his rhetoric .
Appearing on a radio show this morning , he had this to say :
" Honestly , the people I deal with , the people I actually am across the aisle with every day , I do n't think they care about ordinary people .
I do n't think that the Republicans in Congress actually have a heart .
I 'll be honest with you . "
So let 's summarize : in the past few days , Grayson has bluntly stated that the only Republican health care plan is for people to die quickly ( which is technically true , since they do n't have a plan ) , and that Republicans in Congress have no heart .
And not only is he not apologizing for any of it , the GOP has actually backed down on introducing a resolution of disapproval .
And did I mention that it's also raising him a lot of money ?

I think the evidence is in : Alan Grayson has a winning strategy .
Think his colleagues are noticing ?

McHale , formerly of the boy band Not Like
Them , said it did n’t take him long to adjust acting ( and singing and dancing ) in a wheelchair – “ I do have to concentrate on keeping my legs still and laid to one side , ” he said -- but that the role has made him more aware of the challenges other people face .
“ ’ Dancing With Myself ’ is where Artie gets to break away from being misunderstood by everyone , ” McHale said .
“ It ’s where he gets to express himself .
He 's actually a very secure guy – you know , he does rap !
– and he does n’t usually care what anyone else thinks .
But here ’s an instance where his friends have taken for granted the fact that he ’s in a wheelchair .
So this performance is all about him saying , ‘ Look , this is who I am , and this is who I want to be . ’ ”
Things kick off with Artie ’s first solo , a confident , wheelchair - bound bop to the Nouvelle Vague version of Billy Idol ’s “ Dancing With Myself . ”
The number is a response to a prior scene in which his fellow glee clubbers dismiss the idea of paying extra for a special wheel - chair accessible bus so that Artie can ride with them to sectionals .
They assume he wo n’t mind riding with his dad – only he does .
“ This episode is the turning point for the show , ” he said during a recent telephone interview .
“ Certainly , after this , it remains a comedy , and it ’s fun .
But writing this made me feel the responsibility of showing the truth of the pain that outcasts go through .
It ’s not all razzle - dazzle show business .
It ’s tough , and it ’s painful , and it was for me growing up , and it is for most people .
So I think this made me realize that amid the fun and the glamour , it ’s really great now and again to show the underbelly of what people who are different feel . ”
Overcoming emotional and physical disabilities is the central theme of tonight ’s episode , titled “ Wheels , ” which showcases McHale , who plays the wheelchair - bound Artie , and reveals in a fresh way the daunting challenges some people face in their everyday lives .
Filmed last spring and directed by Emmy winner Paris Barclay , the emotional episode kept the actors and crew in tears throughout its entire production and , according to creator Ryan Murphy , had long - term effects on its three writers .
In previous episodes , “ Glee ” has hinted at its big heart : Remember Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) coming out to his father and Finn ( Cory Monteith ) learning that his girlfriend is pregnant and crying on his teacher ’s shoulders ?
Weepy stuff .
But tonight ’s episode is a game - changer for the off - beat series about an underdog glee club , guaranteed to make you laugh , cry and probably dance a little , all the while answering burning questions about Artie ( Kevin McHale ) Sue ( Jane Lynch ) and Tina ( Jenna Ushkowitz ) and showing off the vocal talents of Rachel ( Lea Michele ) and Kurt in a Diva - Off .
If you are one of those TV viewers who think “ Glee ” is just about funny lines and amazing music — and there ’s nothing wrong with that — you ’re in for a surprising ride tonight when the hit Fox show returns after its three - week hiatus .
“ More than ever , I realize how grateful I am to be able to get up between each take and walk around .
I ’m glad that I can represent that kind of life on television so millions of people see it every week .
And the whole point of it is to show that Artie can still do everything everyone else can that matters . ”
McHale ’s co-stars also got a taste of not being able to use their legs .
To make them appreciate what Artie goes through daily , Mr. Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) subjects all the glee clubbers to wheelchairs for a week .
Murphy ordered a range of different - style wheelchairs – from the hospital kind to racing varieties – to give them the full effect .
And the episode ends in a romping rendition of Tina Turner ’s version of “ Proud Mary , ” set on a stage with skateboard - style ramps that took some getting used to for everyone except McHale .
Murphy told choreographer Zach Woodlee that he did n’t want to make it easy for the cast members by letting them stand up and leave their wheelchairs during the number .
“ Artie does n’t get to get up ever , so I did n’t want anyone to get up , ” said Murphy , who wanted viewers to see the effort that comes with performing in a wheelchair .
“ If it looked too fun and easy , it would n’t read right , ” Woodlee said .
“ Ryan really wanted people to understand what Artie deals with . ”
That means those sweaty faces are the real deal .
“ Yeah , that was n’t acting , ” McHale said with a laugh .
“ Lea had the wheelchair from hell .
I do n’t know if she was missing safety locks or what , but every time she leaned back , she would fall .
She fell more than the rest of us . ”
Not that they did n’t have fun making up moves for their new wheels .
At one point in the number , the kids nearly bring the house down when they start rocking their chairs from side to side , hard .
“ We did it as a joke at first , and we were all laughing hysterically because it was as close to the real Tina Turner moves as we could get , ” McHale said .
“ But then we all thought it looked awesome and everyone loved it , so it stayed in . ”
Speaking of rocking out , “ Wheels ” also features the show choir ’s first diva off , a battle royale between Rachel and Kurt .
The idea was born when Colfer shared with Murphy how he had begged his high school drama department to let him perform his favorite song , “ Defying Gravity , ” and he was denied every year because he ’s male .
“ I told him , ‘ Well , you came to the right show runner , mister , ’ ” Murphy said .
“ And I found a way to write it into the show because that ’s in a nutshell what this show is about : someone being told that they ca n’t do something because of what the perception of them is as opposed to what their real ability is . ”
Because the episode was so time - consuming and emotional for the actors , the producers held a special screening for them .
Having the chance to finally sing the showstopper from “ Wicked ” “ really meant the world to me , ” Colfer wrote in an e-mail to The Times this month .
“ It 's absolutely terrifying to watch yourself do something you 've dreamed about for such a long time , ” he wrote .
“ I know I 'm definitely not the best singer , but I think the message , the story behind the song about defying limits and borders placed by others , hopefully all that gets across with the performance .
Although I do some very ‘ Kurtsy ’ things in the song , it 's probably one of the most honest and close - to - heart scenes I 've ever filmed or performed for that matter . ”
“ Wheels ” launched a discussion among the show ’s cast that Murphy hopes will continue with the audience .
“ If anything else , I hope kids who are that age can see that episode and maybe realize how hard it is for some people that they make fun of or tease , ” Murphy said .
“ As we go forward , this episode has reverberations for the whole season . ”
That does n’t mean the series will lose its edge and grow into an after - school special .
In the coming weeks , Jonathan Groff ( “ Spring Awakening ” ) will join the cast as the lead singer of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline , and “ Dollhouse ” creator Joss Whedon will direct one episode .
Because of the way fans have responded to the show ’s music — 2.6 million downloads on iTunes since the series premiered —
Murphy said future episodes will contain even more song and dance numbers .
The laughs will still prevail , even if in three weeks viewers find themselves moved by a deaf choir ’s rendition of John Lennon ’s “ Imagine ” and the two actresses with Down 's Syndrome introduced tonight stay for recurring roles .
“ This is a comedy first and foremost , ” Murphy said .
“ But we see the obligation to go deeper .
This is n’t just a genre show to me .
It ’s about the desperate need for a place in the world and how we all fit in and how hard it is for some people to get by . ”

( CNN ) --
Is the Large Hadron Collider being sabotaged from the future ?
Or merely by birds ?
The LHC , the world 's largest particle accelerator , has been under repair for more than a year because of an electrical failure in September 2008 .
Now , excitement and mysticism are building again around the $ 10 billion machine as the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) gears up to circulate a high - energy proton beam around the collider 's 17 - mile tunnel .
The event should take place this month , said Steve Myers , CERN 's Director for Accelerators and Technology .
The collider made headlines last week when a bird apparently dropped a " bit of baguette " into the accelerator , making the machine shut down .
The incident was similar in effect to a standard power cut , said spokeswoman Katie Yurkewicz .
Had the machine been going , there would have been no damage , but beams would have been stopped until the machine could be cooled back down to operating temperatures , she said .
As it begins to run at full energy , greater than any machine of its kind , the LHC will help scientists explore important questions about the universe .
The ambitious project also has attracted its share of doubters .
Some alarmists expressed fear last year that the accelerator could produce a black hole that might swallow the universe -- a theory that LHC physicists , including Myers , dismiss as science fiction .
Another fringe theory holds that the LHC will never function properly because it is under " influence from the future , " according to physicists Holger Bech Nielsen and Masao Ninomiya .
They suggest in recent papers that no supercolliders that could produce the Higgs boson , an as - yet - unseen particle that would help answer fundamental questions about matter in the universe , will work because something in the future stops them .
This also explains the " negative miracle " of Congress canceling the Superconducting Supercollider project in Texas in 1993 , Nielsen wrote in a paper on arXiv.org , a site where math and science scholars post academic papers .
" One could even almost say that we have a model for God , " one who " hates the Higgs particles , " Nielsen wrote .
But bizarre ideas about the LHC -- and in particular the debunked black hole theory -- have gotten more people interested in the whole project , said Joseph Incandela , professor at the University of California , Santa Barbara .
He will be in the position of deputy spokesperson for the CMS experiment , one of the two general - purpose experiments at the LHC , as of January .
Although physicists such as Incandela have been working on the same questions and building accelerator experiments for decades , no one has paid much attention before now , he said .
There were people who followed the topic , but not the broad audience that emerged in the past year or two , he said .
" Maybe it 's just captured people 's imaginations , " he said .
" It 's really a wonder of science and technology to build such a large accelerator , a 27 km - long machine that works at the precision of a fraction of the diameter of your hair , " he said .
The results of the LHC experiments may help resolve fundamental problems such as the disconnect between Albert Einstein 's theory of relativity , which describes the world on a large scale , and quantum mechanics , the laws of matter on a scale too small to see .
The LHC , located underground on the border of Switzerland and France , passed a proton beam halfway around the circular tunnel Saturday , undeterred by the bird incident earlier in the week .
The full - circle beam event scheduled to happen this month also took place last year on September 10 amid much celebration .
But just nine days later , the operation was set back when one of the 25,000 joints that connect magnets in the LHC came loose , and the resulting current melted or burned some important components of the machine , Myers said .
The faulty joint has a cross-section of a mere two - thirds of an inch by two - thirds of an inch .
" There was certainly frustration and almost sorrow when we had the accident , " he said .
Now , " people are feeling a lot better because we know we 've done so much work in the last year . "
Even physicists who are not on the ground at CERN , awaiting for news from the LHC abroad , have n't given up .
Mark Wise , professor of physics at the California Institute of Technology , said he 's just as excited about the results that will come out of the LHC as he was last year , and views the September 2008 accident as a delay rather than a devastating event .
Wise noted that Tevatron , the collider at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Illinois , has also had its share of failures , but is generally considered to work just fine .
" It 's a horribly complicated piece of equipment , it 's not like there 's not going to be problems along the way , " he said .
" They will surmount those problems . "
LHC personnel have done a lot of testing of electrical connections to make sure the incident is not repeated under the same conditions , and it developed a new magnet protection system , Myers said .
They have also put 900 pressure relief valves all around the machine so that if a similar problem does occur , the same kind of pressure build - up will not take place .
Myers hopes to have particle beam collisions before Christmas , and then prepare the machine for higher - energy particle - smashing .
The full scientific program for the LHC will probably last more than 20 years , he said .
But it wo n't be that long before scientists could potentially discover new properties of nature .
The Higgs boson , also called " the God particle " in popular parlance , could emerge within two or three years , Myers said .
Evidence of supersymmetry -- the idea that every particle has a " super partner " with similar properties in a quantum dimension ( according to some physics theories , there are hidden dimensions in the universe ) -- could crop up as early as 2010 .
For some theoretical physicists such as Wise , finding the Higgs boson and verifying every prediction of the Standard Model of physics would be the worst outcome .
He wants the LHC to deliver surprises , even if that means no Higgs .
" When push comes to shove , the name of the game is ' what is nature , ' and we 're not going to know until our experimental colleagues tell us , " Wise said .
ATLAS and CMS are the general - purpose experiments designed to find the Higgs boson and other rare particles that have never been detected before .
ALICE , another experiment , will explore the matter that existed some 10 microseconds after the Big Bang , said John Harris , professor of physics at Yale University and national coordinator of ALICE - USA .
At that time , there was a " hot soup " of particles called quarks and gluons at a temperature of around 2 trillion degrees above absolute zero , he said .
Although they have never been directly seen , these particles are theoretically the building blocks of the bigger particles -- protons , neutrons and electrons -- that form the universe as we know it .
The " soup " is actually liquid that flows extremely fast , but will only be around for about 10 - 21 microseconds before it cools down and is itself miniscule , he said .
Not everyone who works on LHC physics intended on becoming a scientist .
Incandela thought he was going to be an artist , and studied chemistry because he was interested in glass sculpture .
It happened that he was also good at math and physics and ended up going into that .
Despite obvious differences , art and science -- even LHC - related physics -- do have some commonalities , Incandela said .
" Both of them enrich the human existence beyond just the maintaining of health , wealth and welfare , " he said .
" They both have an idealism also associated with them , a timelessness . "
SANTA CRUZ , California —
Four hundred years after Galileo ’s telescope revolutionized humanity ’s view of the universe , a gigantic telescope is in the works that could take us to a new , deeper level of understanding .
The enormous Thirty Meter Telescope , with a primary mirror the size of a blue whale , is part of a new generation of super powerful ground - based telescopes .
Scheduled for completion in 2018 , it will have nine times the collecting power of the Keck telescopes and 12 times the resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope .
From its recently selected location atop the volcanic dome of Mauna Kea in Hawaii , the pioneering telescope will provide an extremely detailed look at the universe .
“ As we learn more , the cosmos becomes more mysterious and requires more human ingenuity to get to the next step , ” Jerry Nelson , UC Santa Cruz physicist and TMT project scientist , said at a public talk Thursday .
Once finished , the new telescope will allow astronomers to see faint objects clearer than ever before .
It will be able to focus on and identify extremely distant structures that currently appear as blurry smudges in the Hubble Deep Field .
As yet , no one knows what these objects are .
This new resolution will provide insights into the both dark matter and dark energy .
And it will widen the search for planets orbiting stars outside our solar system .
For the first time , we will be able to routinely image direct light from these exoplanets , garnering information on their atmospheric chemistry and dynamics .
The new TMT will also be able to see further back in time than any previous telescope , all the way back to the formation of the first stars and galaxies that followed the universe ’s “ Dark Ages . ”
An adaptive optics system will aid the telescope ’s ability to see into deep space .
Atmospheric turbulence usually distorts light coming from distant stars .
So the adaptive optics system uses a sodium laser to probe current conditions , and information about the turbulence is fed into a small deformable mirror , which makes real - time corrections to the atmosphere ’s quivering .
The effect is sort of like putting glasses on to correct for blurred vision — the end result is a much crisper image .
Without adaptive optics , ground - based astronomy could n’t compete with space - based projects such as Hubble .
The system is considered so vital that Nelson refers to it as the “ heart and soul of the mirror and telescope . ”
Nelson has been called the father of the modern telescope , because it was his innovative design in the 1970s that allowed for the creation of big telescopes like the 10 - meter Keck .
His segmented mirrors have completely transformed the field of astronomy , leading UC Santa Cruz astronomer Sandy Faber to call him a modern day Galileo .
Previously , telescope mirrors larger than 5 meters were considered unfeasible because of many problems :
They were hard to cast , their supports were delicate and breakable , and they would warp under their own weight .
Nelson realized that segmenting the main mirror into separate hexagonal pieces could solve all these problems .
His design positioned the individual mirrors in a honeycomb - like arrangement and used an intricate computer guidance system to make them act as one , larger unit .
The first telescope to take advantage of this new plan was Keck , which has main mirrors composed of 36 individual pieces .
The reflector on the Thirty Meter Telescope will be an order of magnitude leap above this with 492 small mirrors .
Telescopes have doubled in size every 30 years over the last century , and in the not - too - distant future , Nelson predicts we will see 50 - and even 100 - meter telescopes .
This is not to say that such undertakings will be easy .
At an estimated cost of $ 970 million , the TMT will require an international consortium that includes the University of California system , Caltech , Canada , and Japan .
Further funding will come from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation , which committed $ 200 million to the project .
“ The discoveries we ’re going to make from TMT will simply increase our thirst for even bigger telescopes with even greater capabilities , ” says Nelson .
“ So as long as we retain our curiosity and have the wealth to build these kinds of things , I think we ’re going to see bigger things . ”

Buried deep in our subconscious , there still lays the belief that our political leaders are collective Daddies and Mummies who will – in the last instance – guarantee our safety .
Sure , they might screw us over when it comes to hospital waiting lists , or public transport , or taxing the rich , but when it comes to resisting a raw existential threat , they will keep us from harm .
Last week in Copenhagen , the conviction was disproved .
Every leader there had been told by their scientists – plainly , bluntly , and for years – that there is a bare minimum we must all do now if we are going to prevent a catastrophe .
And they all refused to do it .
To understand the gravity of what just happened , you need to know a few facts about global warming that , at first , sound odd .
The world 's climate scientists have shown that man-made global warming must not exceed 2C .
When you hear this , a natural reaction is – that 's not much ; how bad can it be if we overshoot ?
If I go out for a picnic and the temperature rises or falls by 2C , I do n't much notice .
But this is the wrong analogy .
If your body temperature rises by 2C , you become feverish and feeble .
If it does n't go back down again , you die .
The climate is n't like a picnic ; it 's more like your body .
Two degrees is bad : 2C means we lose much of the world 's low - lying land , from the island - states of the South Pacific to much of Bangladesh to swathes of Florida .
But at every step up to and including 2C , if we reduce our emissions , we can stabilise the climate at this new higher level .
If we go beyond 2C , though , the situation changes .
The earth 's natural processes begin to break down – and cause more warming .
There are massive amounts of warming gases stored in the Siberian permafrost ; at 2C , they melt and are released into the atmosphere .
The world 's humid rainforests store huge amounts of warming gases in their trees .
Beyond C , they lose their humidity and begin to burn down – releasing them too into the atmosphere .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
These are called " tipping points " .
Because of them , the world gets warmer and warmer beyond 2C .
They stand at the climate 's Point of No Return , beyond which there lies only warming .
We are only 6C away from the last ice age ; we are setting ourselves on course to go that far in the opposite direction .
So what do we need to do to stay this side of 2C ?
There is a very broad , rock - solid scientific consensus that we need a cut of 40 per cent in the most polluting countries ' emissions by 2020 if we are going to have even a 50 - 50 chance of doing so .
Then , by 2050 we need an 80 per cent cut from everyone .
The fact we are only aiming for a 50 per cent goal of avoiding calamity is a sign of how far we have already made a terrible compromise with fossil fuels – but our leaders are refusing to aim even for those odds .
There was plenty of disgrace to go around in Copenhagen .
The world 's worst per capita warmer is the US , yet its President turned up offering a pathetic 4 per cent cut by 2020 – and once you factor in all the loopholes his negotiators demanded , he was actually demanding the right to a significant increase in US emissions .
He caved to the oil and gas lobbies who virtually own the Senate .
It was – apart from anything else – a terrible betrayal of his own country 's national security .
In 2004 , a leaked Pentagon report warned that unchecked global warming would ensure " disruption and conflict will be endemic ... [ and ] once again , warfare would define human life . "
Similarly , the Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao behaved appallingly .
His country is the single largest overall emitter of gases , albeit with a far larger population , and much more need for development .
Yet he vetoed the 80 per cent target by 2050 , and refused to allow other countries to carry out basic checks to ensure China was carrying out the smaller cuts they were committed to .
Again , he is betraying his own people : most of China 's population depend on rivers that flow down from the Himalayan glaciers , yet they are rapidly disappearing .
His name will be cursed in the Chinese history books .
The European Union was hardly better .
They sat inert , refusing to make any larger offer to get the ball rolling .
Only President Lula da Silva of Brazil came out boldly with an ahead - of - the - curve offer – but his heroism was met with awkward silence and avoided glances from the other leaders .
So here 's the situation .
There is no deal .
The world 's leaders refused to agree to limit our emissions of warming gases .
The most they could agree was to officially " note " the scientific evidence about 2C – with no roadmap to keep us this side of it .
You get a sense of how valuable this " noting " is when you look at the things the conference also " noted " : the hard work of the airport security staff , and the quality of the catering in the Bella Centre .
It seems impossible , but our leaders really did give the stability of our climate the same status as their praise for Danish sandwiches .
I am normally somebody who supports incremental change .
Most progress happens by inches .
But with this problem , we can't wait patiently knowing we 'll prevail in the next generation .
The tipping points will make that too late .
You can't defuse a ticking bomb slowly year after year .
You either defuse it fast , or it blows up in your face .
Our leaders were given the scientific facts , and they have responded by trying to haggle with the facts about the atmosphere .
Imagine a 50 - a - day smoker who goes to his doctor and is told he must stop immediately or he will develop lung cancer .
He says : " I 'll tell you what , doc – I 'll cut down to 40 - a - day , I 'll eat a salad every lunchtime , and I 'll slap on a few nicotine patches .
How does that sound ? "
That 's the official response to global warming .
Where does this leave us all ?
At least we know now : scientific evidence and rationality are not going to be enough to persuade our leaders .
The Good Daddy is n't in charge .
Nobody is going to sort this out – unless we , the populations of the warming - gas countries , make them .
Politicians respond to the pressure put on them , and every single politician at Copenhagen knew they would get more flak at home – from their corporate paymasters and their petrol - hungry populations – for signing a deal than for walking away .
There is only one way to change that dynamic : a mass movement of ordinary democratic citizens .
They have made the impossible happen before .
Our economies used to be built on slave labour , just as surely as they are built on fossil fuels today .
It seemed permanent and unchangeable , and its critics were regarded as deranged – until ordinary citizens refused to tolerate it any more , and they organised to demand its abolition .
The time for changing your light - bulbs and hoping for the best is over .
It is time to take collective action .
For some people , that will mean joining Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth or the Campaign Against Climate Change and helping them pile on the pressure .
But those who can go further – by taking non-violent direct action – should do so .
Every coal train should be ringed with people refusing to let it pass .
Every new runway should be blockaded .
The cost of trashing the climate needs to be raised .
It works .
Look at Britain .
Three years ago , eight new coal power stations were being planned , and the third runway at Heathrow was all but inevitable .
A few thousand heroic young people took direct action against them .
Now all the new coal power stations have been cancelled , and the third runway is dead in the water .
Here in the fifth largest economy in the world , they have stopped coal and airport expansion .
Politicians felt the heat .
That was done by a few thousand people .
Imagine what tens or hundreds of thousands could do .
There need to be parallel movements to this in every country on earth ( and a much bigger one in Britain ) .
Copenhagen had one value , and one value alone .
It has shown us that if we do n't act in our own self - defence now , nobody else will .

Crazy as it sounds , alcohol may one day be given to people with brain injuries to help them recover .
The idea has arisen from a study of 38,000 people with head injuries , which found that those with alcohol in their blood were more likely to survive .
For every 100 people who died when stone - cold sober , only 88 died with ethanol – the kind of alcohol in drinks – in their veins .
“ The finding raises the intriguing possibility that administering ethanol to patients with brain injuries may improve outcome , ” conclude the investigators .
Lead researcher Ali Salim of the Cedars - Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles said he hoped a trial could be mounted , but more information is needed first .
“ We need a better understanding of the exact mechanism , the appropriate dose and specific timing of treatment before we can embark on clinical trials , ” he told New Scientist .

Brain teaser
Salim said that several previous studies have found similar beneficial effects – although others do not .
Animal experiments , meanwhile , suggest that relatively low doses of alcohol protect the brain from injury , but high doses increase the risk of death .
More research is also needed to establish how alcohol protects the brain , but Salim says it may work by blunting the amount of adrenalin reaching the brain , which reduces inflammation .
Despite alcohol ’s potential for helping patients survive brain injury , Salim stressed that it is to blame for half of all injury cases .
“ Alcohol is and will always continue to be bad , since it contributes to over 40 per cent of traffic - related fatalities , ” he says .
The study also found that drinkers suffered more complications and more severe injuries than non-drinkers , even though the overall survival rate was higher .
Therapeutic time window
David Hovda , director of the Brain Injury Research Center at the University of California at Los Angeles , agreed that more research is needed before a clinical trial could take place .
“ One would have to know the therapeutic time window and , of course , the dose , ” he says .
“ But the mechanisms of action involving the neurobiology of traumatic brain injury have different timeframes and regional profiles which would make ethanol therapy difficult to manage correctly . ”
Hovda also points out that brain injuries can be very diverse , so ethanol might work for some but not others .
“ Severity and type really make a difference when deciding on therapeutic options , ” he says .

RE : Desecration of " A Charlie Brown Christmas "
12/8/09
Dear ABC ,
How could you ?
For years and years I have awaited the network broadcast of " A Charlie Brown Christmas " as the true herald of the holiday season .
I brought my kids up with the same tradition -- one which has been made no less special for us by the fact that they happen to be Jewish .
Tonight we sat in horror and watched what you have done to the single greatest cartoon ever made .
How many minutes did you cut out of " A Charlie Brown Christmas " so you could run more commercials ?
Gone was Sally 's materialistic letter to Santa , which finally sends Charlie screaming from the room when she says she will settle for 10s and 20s .
Gone was Schroeder 's miraculous multiple renditions of " Jingle Bells " from a toy piano , including the one that sounds distinctly like a church organ .
Gone was Linus using his blanket as an improvised slingshot to knock a can off the fence no one else can hit , complete with ricochet sound effect .
Gone were the kids catching snowflakes on their tongues and commenting on their flavor .
Gone even was poor Shermy 's only line .
He thought he had it bad because he was always tasked to play a shepherd .
He had no idea .
And why were all these classic scenes cut ?
To plug more ads into the show , of course .
To sell burgers and greeting cards -- and to relentlessly plug the insipid - looking new Disney " soon to be a classic " show immediately following .
( I did n't watch the new show , by the way .
I was laid far too low by what had just happened . )
Cramming all of these ads into the 30 - minute broadcast of " A Charlie Brown Christmas " required major edits to a cartoon that has spent 44 years now trying to remind us that Christmas is supposed to transcend crass commercialism .
Do you have no sense of irony ?
A couple of weeks ago I noted that you can now buy a plastic replica of the pathetic little real - wood Christmas tree Charlie Brown brings home from the tree lot otherwise monopolized by shiny fake trees .
I thought we had sunk as low as we could .
Obviously I was wrong .
Oh , and by the way :
The sound was half a second behind the picture :
They were not synched properly .
I thought this was pretty sloppy for a major TV network , but I was willing to look past it .
What I cannot look past is the chopping to bits of a genuine classic , not just to pump more ads at us , but in direct conflict with the message that has made it a classic .
When I was a kid , the annual broadcast of " A Charlie Brown Christmas " was a holiday unto itself .
It was the only time we ever saw ads for Dolly Madison snack cakes , for one thing .
But more importantly , it actually framed the coming holiday for me in a meaningful way .
The shepherds in their fields had no corporate sponsors .
Nobody had bought the naming rights for the manger .
The infant Jesus did not have an endorsement deal lined up with a particular line of swaddling clothes .
Instead he came , the story goes , to preach universal love , and the abandonment of false ideals like the acquisition of gross material wealth in favor of something far more valuable .
You have not just lost sight of this , or turned your backs on it .
You have stomped it into the mud .
You should be ashamed of yourselves .
But I bet you are n't .
I bet you 're way past that .
Count my family out for next year .

Friday ’s “ lap bombing ” did only superficial damage to the Detroit - bound plane , though it badly burned would - be bomber Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab ’s lap .
Still , the real fireworks may be yet to come , as some top US officials are looking to use it as an excuse to attack Yemen .
Rep. Hoekstra
Senator Joseph Lieberman ( I - CT ) , the head of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , was the first to declare Yemen “ tomorrow ’s war , ” urging a preemptive attack on the nation now .
Senator Arlen Specter ( D - PA ) concurred , saying an attack should be considered .
Rep. Pete Hoekstra ( R - MI ) said President Obama should be held responsible for the attack , and also declared Yemen a “ hot spot ” that needed to be dealt with .
He also alleged that the attack was probably somehow tied with US cleric Awlaki , though this link appears to be purely speculative .
Yet so far the only evidence linking the lap bomber to Yemen are his own claims that he is a member of al - Qaeda and got the bomb ( essentially a condom with some explosive inside ) from al - Qaeda bomb makers in Yemen .
Law enforcement officials concede that ca n’t corroborate any of this .
The link would be extremely convenient for the Obama Administration , which has already been attacking sites in Yemen over the past few weeks .
They even helped try to assassinate Awlaki , even though the US citizen is n’t charged with any crimes in the US .

Which is fastest - the Ducati Desmosedici RR or the Ferrari 430 Scuderia ?
Car fans will argue a supercar can out - brake and out - corner a bike , but we 'll point out that a bike 's power - to - weight ratio is much better , so in a straight race the car will never even get close enough to the bike to use its ' magic ' powers .
To prove two wheels are better than four forever , we ’re pitching arguably the best road bike in the world against one of the best road cars , in perfect conditions at the Almeria circuit in Spain .

hacking , November 13th 2009
Update 2009 - 11 - 14 : since the snapshot linked below turned out to be broken on x86 , you may be better off with the git repos instead .
My first ever Common Lisp project was a raytracer .
Unsurprisingly , it was n't too great .
Over time I started thinking about how I would make one that was more lispy , and during last couple of years I 've been hacking on one every once and a while .
It 's called Raylisp , and while I 'm not planning on ever properly releasing it — this is purely a personal toy project — I figured I might still make a snapshop available : it may prove useful to someone wanting to do something like this in earnest .
The tarball contains :
Snapshop of another work - in - progress : SB - CGA , a computer graphics algebra library for SBCL — most suited for x86 - 64 , since there it implements things like matrix multiplication using SIMD instructions .
Raylisp uses it , but unlike Raylisp this one may even see a release some day ...
Raylisp itself , including : reasonably efficient KD - tree construction and traversal code very very hacky code for reading subsets of .ply and .obj files basic raytracing stuff a simple CLIM frontend on top of the raytracing library
In addition to the KD - tree code , which may be worth stealing and polishing off , I 'm putting this up to demonstrate some techniques which may be non-obvious to new - but - performance - conscious Lisp hackers : stack allocation ( all over the place ) , using CLOS objects for the parts that need flexibility and closures for the parts that need to be fast ( rendering protocol ) , and packing data into specialized vectors to avoid GC overhead ( KD tree construction . )
( Last time I touched this code was in August , so all the details are not too fresh on my mind — hence the vague tone in this post .
I had inteded to do this then , but did n't get around to it until now . )
All the code is under MIT - style license , as usual .

Paul Harvey , 46 , threw a TV remote at his wife 's head
A man has been jailed for three years for killing his wife by throwing a television remote control at her head .
Paul Harvey , 46 , killed Gloria Laguna , 48 , by a " fluke " chance after the remote struck her on a weak artery near her neck , the Old Bailey heard .
His wife died from a massive brain haemorrhage as Harvey tried to give her the kiss of life .
Harvey , an electrical engineer from Euston , central London , pleaded guilty to manslaughter in March .
The couple had been arguing before Harvey lost his temper and threw the remote at his wife , a former American diplomat in India .
The argument was over the maintenance which Harvey was paying to a stepdaughter from a previous marriage , the court heard .
' Temper problem '
" All he did was throw the remote control in her direction , " Jonathan Goldberg QC , defending , told the court .
" By a fluke chance , maybe the same as , in a different context , winning the lottery , it landed on the exact spot where she had a weakness , " he said .
" He loved this woman very much , " he added .
" He is deeply ashamed and remorseful at the death of his wife at his hand . "
Ms Laguna had a very rare condition which neither she or her husband knew about , the court heard .
" It would only have required a trivial incident to cause her death , " said Richard Whittam QC , prosecuting .
Judge Giles Forrester told Harvey : " To throw a hard object such as a remote control device so as to strike your wife in this way was irresponsible and dangerous .
You have a problem with your temper . "
Harvey had to take responsibility for the " dreadful and tragic " consequences of his actions , he said .
Neil Patrick Harris and Partner David Burtka MOCA Gala PHOTOS
How I Met Your Mother actor Neil Patrick Harris and his long - time partner David Burtka were on hand for the MOCA 30th Anniversary Gala on November 14 in Los Angeles .
They have been in a relationship since April 2004 .
Harris , 36 , ' came out ' publicly in People magazine in November 2006 amid rumors that he was in a gay relationship with actor Burtka .
Media reports claimed Harris had pulled strings to land his boyfriend David a guest spot on How I Met Your Mother during season two , as Lily 's old high school boyfriend .
The couple attended the Emmy awards together in September 2007 and openly acknowledged their relationship , which received a great deal of media attention at the time .
Harris and Burtka , 34 , appeared on stage together for the first time in February 2008 , singing a duet from Rent at a New York benefit .
Harris refers to Burtka as " my better half " and " an amazing chef . "

Stalking Bill Gates
EXE Magazine , November 1997
If you read Need to Know , the UK 's self - proclaimed most sarcastic weekly technology news e-zine ( http://www.ntk.net), you might have been wondering what the following ( NTK 10/10/97 ) is all about :
‘ So it was with great reluctance and irritation that we award ten pounds and a bunch of CDs to NTK reader David Mery for winning last week 's Stalking Bill Gates challenge .
David , who works at NTK 's favourite hardcore top - shelf development mag , EXE [ thanks for this , erm , rather unusual description – Ed ] , not only met the man himself on his visit to Cambridge ( requirement # 1 ) , but also incomprehensibly harangued him in front of the world 's press about releasing the source to the original Gates - and - Allen coded 4 KB Basic ( as Gates promised to do almost a decade ago ) – winning him an extra bonus fiver . ’
Here 's the full story .
Nearly ten years ago , a French mathematician and freelance journalist , Andre Warusfel , asked Bill Gates for the source code of the Basic he co-wrote with Paul Allen in 4 KB for the Altair .
Bill Gates promised to send him the code as soon as he was back in Redmond .
Andre never received the source code .
I then took over this quest and every time I met Bill Gates , probably five or six times in the past ten years , I asked him for the very same code .
Bill Gates regularly said he had forgotten and would send it as soon as he was back in his office .
Since I never received the code I took the opportunity of meeting him in Cambridge last month ( see Out of touch ) to remind him of his promise .
He asked me to provide him with the name of the two persons to whom he made this promise .
It has now been two weeks and I 've not even had an acknowledgement of my email to Microsoft 's PR agency .
This Basic 4 K , as it is nicknamed , is a historic artefact .
It 's of no commercial use today so there is n't any business need to keep it confidential .
It is this very program which started the micro-computing commercial software industry .
The Gates and Allen Basic was licensed for the Altair by MITS in 1975 and was the genesis of Microsoft .
The PC software industry has a short history and we should have access to the milestones of its evolution .
I 'll keep you posted on any new development .

Erie Otters forward Michael Liambas had his junior hockey career ended on Wednesday by OHL commissioner Dave Branch .
The Woodbridge native was suspended by the league for the rest of the OHL season and the playoffs .
As an overage player , this was Liambas ' last year of junior eligibility .
It was Liambas ' hit during a game in Kitchener on Oct. 30 that sent Rangers rookie defenceman Ben Fanelli to the hospital with facial and skull fractures .
" This sends a message to our league that the OHL is going to hold players accountable for their actions , " said Kitchener Rangers coach and GM Steve Spott .
" We have to have a greater respect for our opponents when we are on the ice . "
Fanelli is in serious but stable condition in the intensive care unit of Hamilton General Hospital , after his status was upgraded on Tuesday from critical but stable .
Spott , who has been at the hospital regularly , was able to visit with the 16 - year - old for the first time on Wednesday .
" He was able to say ' Hi ' to me , which was outstanding , " Spott told the Star .
" I was really , really pleased about that , but still , you 're dealing with a young man who is in serious condition . "
Branch met with Liambas at the OHL's offices on Tuesday for a disciplinary hearing .
" Michael is a bright and articulate man and he certainly represented himself very well , " said Branch of Liambas .
" But any issues that Michael is facing pale in comparison to what , unfortunately , Ben and his family are going through . "
Otters general manager Sherry Bassin broke the news of the suspension to Liambas on Wednesday .
" He 's completely devastated , " said Bassin .
" We have two good people that bad things have happened to , one physically where we hope for the best , and the other now beat up emotionally and mentally . "
" I do n't want this ( incident ) to create a lasting image that Mike Liambas is some kind of a goofball , he 's far from it , " added Bassin , noting that the remorseful 20 - year - old is an honour roll student who is known for his charitable work in the community .
Liambas was assessed a match penalty for boarding on the play that knocked the Oakville native 's helmet off , sending him face - first into a metal stanchion separating the end zone glass before his head smacked the ice .
" In our minds the most concerning thing about the hit was the distance travelled and the speed , " said Branch of his decision .
" It then resulted in injury ... and the injury was the most concerning , no question . "

THOMAS MALTHUS first published his “ Essay on the Principle of Population ” , in which he forecast that population growth would outstrip the world 's food supply , in 1798 .
His timing was unfortunate , for something started happening around then which made nonsense of his ideas .
As industrialisation swept through what is now the developed world , fertility fell sharply , first in France , then in Britain , then throughout Europe and America .
When people got richer , families got smaller ; and as families got smaller , people got richer .
Now , something similar is happening in developing countries .
Fertility is falling and families are shrinking in places — such as Brazil , Indonesia , and even parts of India — that people think of as teeming with children .
As our briefing shows , the fertility rate of half the world is now 2.1 or less — the magic number that is consistent with a stable population and is usually called “ the replacement rate of fertility ” .
Sometime between 2020 and 2050 the world 's fertility rate will fall below the global replacement rate .
At a time when Malthusian worries are resurgent and people fear the consequences for an overcrowded planet , the decline in fertility is surprising and somewhat reassuring .
It means that worries about a population explosion are themselves being exploded — and it carries a lesson about how to solve the problems of climate change .
Worth a bundle
Today 's fall in fertility is both very large and very fast .
Poor countries are racing through the same demographic transition as rich ones , starting at an earlier stage of development and moving more quickly .
The transition from a rate of five to that of two , which took 130 years to happen in Britain — from 1800 to 1930 — took just 20 years — from 1965 to 1985 — in South Korea .
Mothers in developing countries today can expect to have three children .
Their mothers had six .
In some countries the speed of decline in the fertility rate has been astonishing .
In Iran , it dropped from seven in 1984 to 1.9 in 2006 — and to just 1.5 in Tehran .
That is about as fast as social change can happen .
Falling fertility in poor and middle - income societies is a boon in and of itself .
It means that , for the first time , the majority of mothers are having the number of children they want , which seems to be — as best one can judge — two .
( China is an exception : its fall in fertility has been coerced . )
It is also a boon in what it represents , which is greater security for billions of vulnerable people .
Subsistence farmers , who live off their harvest and risk falling victim to rapine or drought , can depend only on themselves and their children .
For them , a family of eight may be the only insurance against disaster .
But for the new middle classes of China , India or Brazil , with factory jobs , cars and bank accounts , the problems of extreme insecurity lie in the past .
For them , a child may be a joy , a liability or an accident — but not an insurance policy .
And falling fertility is a boon for what it makes possible , which is economic growth .
Demography used to be thought of as neutral for growth .
But that was because , until the 1990s , there were few developing countries with records of declining fertility and rising incomes .
Now there are dozens and they show that as countries move from large families and poverty into wealth and ageing they pass through a Goldilocks period : a generation or two in which fertility is neither too high nor too low and in which there are few dependent children , few dependent grandparents — and a bulge of adults in the middle who , if conditions are right , make the factories hum .
For countries in demographic transition , the fall to replacement fertility is a unique and precious opportunity .
Another inconvenient truth
Nonsense , say Malthus 's heirs .
All this misses the point : there are too many people for the Earth 's fragile ecosystems .
It is time to stop — and ideally reverse — the population increase .
To celebrate falling fertility is like congratulating the captain of the Titanic on heading towards the iceberg more slowly .
The Malthusians are right that the world 's population is still increasing and can do a lot more environmental damage before it peaks at just over 9 billion in 2050 .
That will certainly be the case if poor , fast - growing countries follow the economic trajectories of those in the rich world .
The poorest Africans and Asians produce 0.1 tonnes of CO 2 each a year , compared with 20 tonnes for each American .
Growth is helping hundreds of millions to escape grinding poverty .
But if the poor copy the pattern of wealth creation that made Europe and America rich , they will eat up as many resources as the Americans do , with grim consequences for the planet .
What 's more , the parts of the world where populations are growing fastest are also those most vulnerable to climate change , and a rising population will exacerbate the consequences of global warming — water shortages , mass migration , declining food yields .
In principle , there are three ways of limiting human environmental impacts : through population policy , technology and governance .
The first of those does not offer much scope .
Population growth is already slowing almost as fast as it naturally could .
Easier access to family planning , especially in Africa , could probably lower its expected peak from around 9 billion to perhaps 8.5 billion .
Only Chinese - style coercion would bring it down much below that ; and forcing poor people to have fewer children than they want because the rich consume too many of the world 's resources would be immoral .
If population policy can do little more to alleviate environmental damage , then the human race will have to rely on technology and governance to shift the world 's economy towards cleaner growth .
Mankind needs to develop more and cheaper technologies that can enable people to enjoy the fruits of economic growth without destroying the planet 's natural capital .
That 's not going to happen unless governments both use carbon pricing and other policies to encourage investment in those technologies and constrain the damage that economic development does to biodiversity .
Falling fertility may be making poor people 's lives better , but it cannot save the Earth .
That lies in our own hands .
Google , which has an estimated 90 % market share of UK internet searches , last year used a cross - border network of subsidiary companies to ensure it did not pay a penny in corporation tax on its £ 1.6 bn advertising revenues in Britain .
The international corporate structure enables Google to avoid paying what could otherwise have been a corporation tax bill in the UK of as much as £ 450 m .
Recently filed accounts for subsidiary company Google UK Limited show none of the search engine 's advertising revenues from British customers were accounted for in the business , despite operations in London and Manchester incurring " administrative expenses " of £ 177 m last year , including a wage bill of £ 70 m .
While much of the costs linked to the running of Google 's British operations are recognised for tax purposes in the UK ; revenues from customers in Britain , however , are diverted to another Google company in Ireland , where the corporation tax rate is between 10 % and 25 % .
British corporation tax is levied at between 28 % and 30 % .
The accounts for Google UK describe its principal activity as " the provision of marketing services to Google Ireland Limited and the provision of research and development services to [ US parent company ] Google Inc " .
As a result Google UK reports turnover of £ 150 m and a pretax loss of £ 26 m .
By contrast , Google Inc 's annual report showed 14 % of the company 's $ 21.8 bn ( £ 13.5 bn ) revenues came from the UK , making it the largest market outside of the US .
Multinational companies engaged in so - called " transfer pricing " – where expenses are booked in high tax jurisdictions and earnings in low tax areas — are seen by many anti-avoidance campaigners as presenting one of the biggest challenges to the already strained exchequer .
Such transfer pricing arrangements must have the agreement of tax authorities in the UK and are entirely legal .
They are commonplace in many industries other than advertising , from pharmaceuticals to bananas .
Multinationals with significant intellectual property – such as Google and Microsoft – are particular well placed to transfer revenues to the most advantageous tax regimes because they are able to charge inter - group companies significant royalty payments .
Tax expert and anti-avoidance campaigner Richard Murphy said : " This indicates a pattern of tax avoidance by Google suggesting they are dedicated to minimising corporation tax on profits arising outside of the US . "
Over the weekend , Vince Cable , deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats , urged Google to pay " its fair share " and warned that it risked damage to its reputation .
" Avoidance like this is hard to stomach at the best of times , but when the country is in recession and everyone is feeling the pain , it really sticks in the throat – it means higher taxes for the rest of us " .
Google , which was built on a motto " do n't be evil " , said : " It would be wrong to think of Google 's revenues from UK advertisers as solely the result of operations carried out locally .
We invest in R&D , data centres and other infrastructure on a global basis , and that then helps generate revenue in different countries . "
A spokesman pointed out that Google employs more than 800 staff in the UK , making a " substantial contribution " through payroll and other taxes .
He added that Dublin was Google 's European headquarters , pooling revenues from across the continent , not just the UK .
He said the competitive tax environment was just one reason why Google , like many other multinationals , had chosen Dublin for its European base .
The smallprint of the 2008 annual report for Google Inc , which is registered in Delaware , reveals that despite the search engine 's international reach , its two major tax jurisdictions are the US and Ireland .
" We and our subsidiaries are routinely examined by various taxing authorities , " it states , confirming Irish officials are examining tax years 2002 to 2008 .
NYT " Prescriptions " blog :
On Monday , as full debate of the health care bill began , Mr. Reid said he was acting on Ms. Lincoln ’s behalf in requesting the unanimous agreement of all senators that amendments be required to be posted on the Internet in order to qualify for debate on the Senate floor .
Senator Michael B. Enzi , Republican of Wyoming , sensing a Democratic ambush of some sort , objected to the request .
Mr. Enzi later accused Mr. Reid of engaging in a " stunt " aimed specifically at drawing a Republican objection on a goal they might otherwise support .
It 's beyond disingenuous for Republicans to object to this , but no one 's really surprised by it .
While latching on to the politically potent " Read the Bill ! " rallying cry of the non-partisan transparency movement , the truth is that when it comes to transparency for their own legislative language , the idea 's suddenly not all that exciting .
Again , this comes as no surprise .
Republicans have been grousing about transparency all along , even while hiding the ball on their amendments and motions to recommit .
Meanwhile , Sen. Lincoln for some reason thinks she 's got a political winner on her hands with this :
Senator Blanche Lincoln , Democrat of Arkansas and a strong proponent of transparency in the legislative process , said Tuesday that she would post all amendments to the bill on her own official Web site — even if sponsors of the amendments decline to do so on their own .
Well , maybe not so much .
There 's nothing she can do about amendments that proponents do n't share with her or have printed in the Congressional Record .
And if they 're printed in the Congressional Record ( as most amendments offered early on in the process are ) , well , then it 's not really all that much of a service to reprint them on her web site -- though it should be noted that the Record 's online delivery system is pretty damned crappy .
So maybe there 's that .
But the bottom line is that all the benefit of her idea was in its ability , if adopted , to mandate that an interested public be given the chance to review proposed amendments , and rule non-compliant amendments out of order .
That she 's decided in the wake of its rejection to reprint the text of amendments that the sponsors have already elected to share is n't of all that much interest .
What would be of more interest , both politically as well as for non-partisan transparency advocates , is for Democratic Senators to continue to make such unanimous consent requests , and in the absence of an agreement , to pledge as a caucus that as matter of policy during this debate , they 'll vote to table amendments not offered for public review .
I wrote the most beautiful code of my life last week .
I would like to explain it to you all , but I have to tell a little bit of backstory first .
the distant future , the year 2000
Until earlier this year , Guile has been an interpreted Scheme .
Guile ran your code by parsing it into tree - like data structures , then doing a depth - first evaluation of that tree .
The evaluation itself was performed with a C function , ceval , which would recursively call itself when evaluating sub-expressions .
ceval was OK , but not so great .
Instead of recursively traversing a tree , it 's better to pre-examine the expressions you 're going to evaluate , and then emit linear sequences of code to handle those steps .
That 's to say that it 's better to have a compiler than an interpreter .
So I dug up Keisuke Nishida 's old bytecode compiler that he wrote back in 2001 , and eventually hacked it into a shape that we merged it into Guile itself .
That was a pretty sweet hack , to retrofit a compiler into Guile .
But it was n't as beautiful as the code I wrote last week .
the present
See , the problem was that now we had two stacks : the C stack that ceval used , and the virtual machine stack used by byte - compiled code .
This was a debugging headache , as to get backtraces you had to ping - pong back and forth between the two stacks , interleaving their frames together in the right order .
Also with two stacks it 's practically impossible to write a real debugger that does single - stepping , inspection and modification of stack frames , etc .
The two - stack solution ( ahem ) had another problem : you could n't tail - call between interpreted and compiled code , because the procedures used different stacks .
Normally this was n't a big deal because all code was compiled , but it would occasionally bite you .
( The usual case would be when you had a compiled Guile , but just pulled new code from the git repository , then tried to compile it again -- so some of your compiled code was out - of - date and therefore not loaded , you had a mix of compiled and interpreted code in some important places , and your loop starts consuming stack . )
Finally , interpreted code behaved differently than compiled code in some cases .
For example , consider the following code :
;; Returns two values : the value , if found , ; ; and a flag indicating success .
( define ( table - lookup table key ) ( let ( ( handle ( assq key table ) ) ) ( if handle ( values ( cdr handle ) # t ) ( values #f # f ) ) ) ) ( define ( trace - call f . args ) ( let ( ( result ( apply f args ) ) ) ( format #t "
function returned ~a
" result ) result ) ) ( trace - call table - lookup '( (x . y ) ) 'x )
So if I try this at my Guile 1.8 prompt , I get this :
guile > ( trace - call table - lookup '( (x . y ) ) 'x ) function returned #< values ( y # t ) > $ 1 = y $ 2 = #t
We see that trace - call returns two values , and the tracing printout shows a " multiple values object " -- a Scheme object like any other , but that the primitive call - with - values knows how to destructure .
The toplevel repl is wrapped in a call - with - values , so t and #t print separately .
Now if I fire up Guile 1.9 , let 's see what we get :
> ( trace - call table - lookup '( (x . y ) ) 'x ) function returned y $ 1 = y
Guile 1.9's repl compiles its expressions , by default , and indeed we see different behavior -- the trace printout has a naked value , y , and only one value is returned .
Both of these behaviors are compatible with standard Scheme from R5RS on .
The origin of the difference is that the behavior of values within a continuation that was not created with call - with - values is unspecified .
Relatedly , it is not specified what will happen when you return N values to a continuation accepting M values , where N != M .
What 's happening is that the compiler actually has two return addresses in each stack frame -- one for the normal singly - valued case , and one for multiple values .
values will return to the multiple - value return address ( MVRA ) , and anything else will go to the normal return address .
So actually , compiled code can choose what to do when it gets multiple values .
Instead of raising an error when two values are returned to the ( let ( ( result ... ) ) ... ) continuation , Guile chooses to do what you ( probably ) expect and just drop the second value .
In contrast , with a C evaluator , even noticing that two values were returned to a singly - valued continuation is a pain -- because you have to check and branch every time you recursively call ceval to see if you 're getting a multiple - values object .
But I digress .
I promised something nice , and here I am noodling about something else .
exit strategy
The solution to all these problems , of course , is to use just one stack , and have that stack be the same as the one that compiled code uses .
Practically what this means is that eval should not be a C function , because Guile does not compile to C ; it should be something that ends up as compiled code .
( For now , compiled code is bytecode , run on the VM .
I 'm being a little vague here because Guile does n't do native compilation yet , but it will , within a year or two , and the same considerations apply . )
I actually toyed with the idea of writing a hand - coded eval in VM bytecode , but I came to my senses soon enough , and the answer was delightful .
eval in scheme
Of course !
Scheme 's eval should be written in Scheme itself .
Then we just compile it to bytecode , like any other Scheme procedure .
At this point , anyone who 's actually had to do Scheme at university ( not me ) will recognize this as the meta - circular evaluator pattern .
To be honest I had never written one before -- and I think the reason was that they always seemed so peripheral .
When you write a meta - circular evaluator , the language you really work in is the one that implements the meta - circular evaluator , not the one implemented by the evaluator -- or at least , that 's the case if you 're trying to get something done , rather than learn about language .
But this is different .
This time the meta - circular evaluator actually sits at the heart of Guile -- in fact , we use eval , as implemented in Scheme , and compiled to bytecode , to compile the compiler -- which itself is written in Scheme of course .
In the end , though , you have to have a Scheme compiler to compile eval.scm itself , so we do end up keeping around an evaluator in C .
Its only purpose is to interpret the compiler , so we can compile eval.scm : then the compiled version of eval.scm compiles the rest of Guile , including the compiler .
Another option would have been to require a new - enough version of Guile itself to compile the compiler .
But I want to be able to sanely bootstrap Guile 's compiler , so that 's out of the question .
We could implement the compiler in portable Scheme , but that would forbid the compiler from making use of any of Guile 's niceties .
the code
So here it is ( and below ) .
I do n't claim that it is actually the most elegant code I have written , though I can think of none better at the moment ; nor is it the fastest code , nor the most concise .
But it sits in such a powerful place , and in so few lines , that I can not help but to be pleased with it .
( define primitive - eval ( let ( ) ;;

Advertisement A suicide car bomb attack on Pakistan 's main intelligence agency in the city of Peshawar has killed at least 12 people and injured 40 , officials say .
Another five people died in a separate suicide car bomb attack at a police station in the Baka Khel area in the North West Frontier Province .
The Peshawar blast destroyed the three - storey building of the Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency .
The city has been frequently targeted by militants in recent weeks .
More than 100 people were killed in a blast at a market in Peshawar two weeks ago .
Attacks across Pakistan have dramatically increased as the army continues its offensive against the Taliban in the South Waziristan region .
Powerful explosion " The bomber was asked to stop at a checkpoint next to the ISI offices here at 6.45 am , " a military official told the BBC on the condition of anonymity .
The ISI building was severely damaged " As he tried to use the car to force his way through , the guards outside opened fire on him .
" He then detonated the explosives . "
Military authorities told the BBC say that over 60 people were injured in the attack .
The said that the dead included seven military officials and three civilians .
The BBC's Abdul Hai Kakar in Peshawar says the explosion was so powerful it was heard by people within a 1 km radius .
Some thought it was an earthquake .
Our correspondent says that the ISI building was severely damaged and part of its structure has collapsed .
ANALYSIS Syed Shoaib Hasan in Islamabad Friday 's attack makes it three weeks in a row that militants have struck the North West Frontier Province 's capital on the Islamic week 's holiest day .
The targets are increasingly civilian .
It comes a day after the head of Pakistan 's army said militants were striking back in civilian areas after failing to stand up to the military in battle .
Since the insurgency started in earnest in 2007 , militants have primarily targeted security installations .
The police and the ISI have been the target of particular ire - both organisations have been used as the main force to detain , interrogate and torture militant suspects since 9/11 .
Many militants feel betrayed as the ISI was responsible for creating and nurturing the jihadis .
While the attacks on public places suggest the militants are getting desperate , Friday 's bombings show they are still able to hit security targets .
Officials says some people are still trapped under the debris .
Army rescue teams are engaged in efforts to get them out .
Within minutes of the attack , the entire area was cordoned off by the military personnel who arrived on the scene .
The ISI offices are located off Khyber road in Peshawar city suburbs .
The entire area is part of the military cantonment within city limits .
The checkpoint was located the entrance of the military cantonment area and it is not clear whether the bomber wanted to target the ISI or other sensitive military and civilian offices inside the cantonment .
These include the offices of North West Frontier Province 's ( NWFP ) chief minister , governor and the head of Pakistan 's military in the region .
At the time the blast took place , there was light traffic on the roads because it was early morning .
Correspondents say that if the attacker struck half an hour later , the death toll would have been much higher because the area would have been far busier .
As a result of the blast , however , schools have now been closed for the day in Peshawar .
" I was busy at work then suddenly I heard gunfire .
I saw a vehicle moving towards the ISI building and then there was a huge blast .
I was thrown to the ground , " news agency AFP quoted Azmat Ali , a 30 - year - old mechanic as saying .
" I do n't remember anything else , but there was dust everywhere , " he said .
Pakistani Prime Minister Yusuf Raza Gilani condemned the attack , saying his country 's resolve to deal with militancy would not be weakened .
The last time an ISI building was targeted was in May , when 24 people were killed in a suicide attack in the eastern city of Lahore .
Taliban stronghold
The blast at the Baka Khel police station in NWFP - less than 30 minutes later - killed three and wounded at least 15 people , police said .
Baka Khel is near Bannu town , close to the tribal region of North Waziristan , a Taliban stronghold .
" The bomber rammed his car into the police station , " a Bannu police official told the BBC .
" Five people were killed and 16 injured in the attack . "
The dead and injured were brought to hospitals in the town of Bannu , which is 20 km from the site of the attack .
The latest attacks come one day after 17 Pakistani soldiers were killed in fighting in South Waziristan - the military 's deadliest day since launching a major offensive there in mid October , security officials said .
The violence coincides with an attack by suspected Taliban militants on five Nato trucks transporting near Pakistan 's south - western border with Afghanistan , police said .

Oh my :
Just hours after federal agents charged banker Allen Stanford with fleecing investors of $ 7 billion , the disgraced financier received a message from one of Congress ' most powerful members , Pete Sessions .
` `I love you and believe in you , '' said the e-mail sent on Feb. 17 . `` If you want my ear / voice -- e-mail , '' it said , signed ``Pete . ''
The message from the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee represents one of the many ties between members of Congress and the indicted banker that have caught the attention of federal agents .
According to the Miami Herald 's report , Stanford used his ties to Congress to establish himself as a respectable businessman and also to avoid the unwanted gaze of federal regulators .
In 2001 , he pressed successfully to kill a bill that would have exposed the flow of millions into his secretive offshore bank in Antigua .
The next year , he helped block legislation that would have drawn more government scrutiny to his bank .
While he was fighting reforms to financial secrecy and offshore banking laws , Stanford was hobnobbing with dozens of lawmakers .
Stanford hosted New York Congressman John Sweeney 's wedding dinner at his five - star restaurant in Antigua in 2004 -- toasting the couple for photographers -- and staged a cocktail fundraiser for now - disgraced Ohio congressman Bob Ney at his bayfront Miami office .
`` He legitimized himself by having himself vetted by powerful members of Congress , '' said Steven Riger , a former vice president at Stanford 's Miami brokerage .
`` It was all about the public 's perception . ''
How come even though Republicans are always talking about freedom , the one and only freedom they seem to be fighting for is the freedom for thieves like Allen Stanford to steal your money ?
ROME ( Reuters ) - A Roman Catholic Cardinal told homosexuals and transsexuals on Wednesday they would never get into heaven , prompting a rebuke from the Vatican itself .
“ Transsexuals and homosexuals will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven , it ’s not me who says it but St. Paul , ” said Mexican Cardinal Javier Barragan , a former Vatican official who recently retired , referring to one of St. Paul ’s epistles .
Asked if people were born homosexual Barragan , whose comments were posted on a conservative Catholic website called www.pontifex.roma, was quoted as saying :
“ One is not born homosexual but they become that way .
This is for various reasons : education , for not having developed their identity during their adolescence , maybe they are not guilty but by going against the dignity of the body they certainly will not enter the Kingdom of Heaven . ”
“ Everything that goes against nature and against the dignity of the body offends God , ” he added .
Aurelio Mancuso , president of Italy ’s main gay rights group , Arcigay , said Barragan ’s remarks were part of the Church ’s “ ridiculous theories about sexuality and the dignity of the person . ”
The Vatican distanced itself from the comments in a statement that was highly unusual because it indirectly criticized a top Church official .
Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said the website should not be considered an authority on Catholic thinking “ on complex and delicate issues such as homosexuality . ”
Lombardi quoted from the official Catechism of the Roman Catholic Church , which says homosexual acts are a “ disorder ” but acknowledges that many people have “ innate homosexual tendencies ” and should be treated with respect and not be subject to discrimination .
The Catholic Church teaches that homosexual acts are sinful but homosexuality in itself is not .
It takes some confidence to extend the Broadway run of your one - man show before opening night , especially a few months after undergoing heart surgery .
But then Robin Williams has never been short of nerve .
His lengthy career is due in equal measure to the fearless nature of his comedy and to the frenetic energy of his performance : he has a reputation as an entertainer that is built as much on his nerve as it is on his nerves .
Now , after six years away from the stage , a relapse into alcoholism , a divorce and an emergency operation to replace a faulty valve in his chest , Williams is resuming live stand - up .
His comeback show , which reopens on Monday , is already one of New York 's hottest tickets , and then later in the week a Disney film , Old Dogs , in which Williams co-stars with John Travolta , opens in cinemas across America .
What will follow is a series of wiser , more sensitive choices .
Rather like the legendary Fisher King , the character he once played on screen for Terry Gilliam , our dishevelled hero has returned , ruined by life but still searching for that grail .
" It 's the idea of going , ' Relax , you got the gig , what do you want to do now ? ' "
Williams has explained to his fans .
Williams , who studied drama at the renowned Juilliard School of Music and Drama with fellow student and close friend Christopher Reeve , first made his name on the comedy circuit in the late 1970s alongside such emerging beacons of the alternative scene as John Belushi , Bill Murray and Richard Pryor .
Once he made it to Hollywood his fortunes rose steadily , riding on the success of his Oscar - nominated portrayal of the DJ in Good Morning , Vietnam , until the point came in 1993 , with the release of the hit family comedy Mrs Doubtfire , that Williams could justly claim to be one of the biggest box office draws in the world .
In the late 1990s a dangerous relationship with drink served to rub some of the shine off Williams ' star , but he kept on working .
He was set to return to Broadway for a short live engagement and the appetite of his audience was clear .
Tickets reportedly sold out in less than 10 minutes .
But then fate struck .
Williams , who had been feeling a little out of breath and could not shift a persistent cough , was given an angiogram that uncovered a serious problem with a heart valve , a valve that was , in the comic 's words , " just blown " .
The tour was put on hold while he underwent surgery .
It seems the realisation of just how close to death Williams had unknowingly been , more than the impact of major surgery itself , has jolted the performer into a new appraisal of his life and values .
" I think , literally , because you have cracked the chest , you are vulnerable , totally , for the first time since birth , " he has said .
It is not that he has not had mortal shocks before .
In 1982 he was with his old friend Belushi the evening before he died of a drugs overdose in the Chateau Marmont hotel , and in 1995 the serious horseriding accident and subsequent early death of his close friend Reeve had a profound impact on his life .
Yet since his recent surgery Williams has spoken of a fresh thirst for life .
A close brush with death has given the 58 - year - old a new perspective .
He met his friend Susan Schneider , a 45 - year - old graphic designer , shortly before his operation and she nursed him through convalescence at his California home .
( Last year Williams separated from his second wife , Marsha , after 19 years of marriage ) .
A warm wave of nostalgia is washing through America this month in anticipation of seeing Williams perform again .
It has prompted shared memories of some of the staging posts in his career : there was the early playful television appearance on the Richard Pryor Show , and then Williams in the guise of the alien Mork from Ork encountering Henry Winkler 's Fonz on Happy Days .
( This was the part that spawned the spin - off sitcom Mork and Mindy which ran from 1978 to 1982 and made him a household name ) .
Far from looking back though , the actor says he is searching for work that will mean more to him .
He cites a dark comedy released in America this summer , called World 's Greatest Dad and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait .
It is the kind of work he hopes to make more of now .
The highlights of Williams 's film career so far are the roles that have suited his extraordinary energy level or caught the mood of the times , films such as The World According to Garp and Good Will Hunting .
Latterly , Williams has also enjoyed critical success in a number of spooky parts , which mysteriously also seem to fit him like a glove , for example as an obsessive in One Hour Photo or the sociopath in the thriller Insomnia .
But as the camera has rolled on through the years , Williams 's more unfortunate choices have stacked up too .
Flops have included Bicentennial Man , RV , Patch Adams , Jack and Robert Altman 's Popeye , of which Williams has said : " If you watch it backwards , it has a plot . "
Though Williams may be born again , his new show will not be evangelical .
While the star has learnt his own lesson in relation to booze and still attends AA meetings , he says he does not want to preach .
All he can tell people , he has said , is simply not to do it .
" There 's nothing romantic about it .
This idea that as an artist you have to push yourself and explore the dark side ?
I went there .
You can do a lot more interesting stuff when you 're not messed up , " he explains .
All the same , Williams 's friend and fellow comedian Billy Crystal believes the stand - up show will offer some kind of therapy for the performer .
" Over the last couple of years and the pain that he 's gone through , his brain is the one thing that 's kept him buoyant , " Crystal has said .
" I think he needs the stand - up in a different way than he did before .
It 's still a safe place for him to be , but he can talk about things and make himself feel better , not just everybody else . "
Eric
Idle suspects that all the Williams voices are an elaborate piece of misdirection : " I 've always felt that Robin 's blinding speed and flash of wit was an effort at concealment , rather than revealing , " said Idle .
" He would be talking about something personal or sexual , but it was always in general , not about him . "
Whether or not Williams 's attention - seeking behaviour is designed to communicate more openly or to hold his audience at arms ' length , the entertainer is clearly more determined than ever to shake people into noticing more about their lives , just as he has been forced to take account of his own .
Even before his illness , Williams spoke strikingly about his drive to go out in front of an audience and talk .
" There 's anger there , and a fear , too , " he said .
" I want to shout , ' Wake up !
Snap out of it !'
The hypnosis is over ! "

Israel says the tunnels are used to smuggle weapons
Several Palestinians have been injured after Israeli aircraft carried out airstrikes against targets in the Gaza Strip , officials say .
Israel 's military said the attacks targeted two weapons - making factories and a smuggling tunnel .
The strikes were in retaliation for a rocket fired into southern Israel from the Hamas - controlled enclave , it added .
The attacks came a day after Hamas and other Gaza - based militants said they were going to stop firing rockets .
Fathi Hammad , who acts as Hamas interior minister , said the ceasefire aimed to prevent retaliatory attacks by Israel and build stability .
But he said rockets would continue to be fired from the Gaza Strip in the event of any Israeli incursions .
Sporadic attacks
Israel 's military said Sunday 's air strikes were in response to a rocket fired from the Gaza Strip on Saturday which caused no damage when it landed near the southern Israeli city of Sderot .
Hamas has observed a ceasefire for months , but other groups have carried out sporadic cross - border attacks .
Israel says rocket - building materials are still being smuggled into Gaza through tunnels dug from the Egyptian border .
Rocket attacks have decreased since Israeli forces launched an offensive against Hamas in the Gaza strip last December and January .
About 1,300 Palestinians and 10 Israeli soldiers were killed in the three weeks of fighting .
Three Israeli citizens also died in rocket attacks during the operation .
The SEO plan is the document that you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll use to stay on track as you try to implement SEO strategies on your site .
For many people , the thought of implementing SEO on a web site that includes dozens or even hundreds of pages is overwhelming .
It does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have to be , though .
Prioritizing pages
Look at SEO in small , bite - size pieces .
For example , instead of looking at your site as a whole , look at each page on the site .
Prioritize those pages , and then plan your SEO around each pageÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s priority .
Taking a single page into consideration helps to eliminate the Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ everything has to happen right nowÃ¢â ‚
¬
Â issue and makes it possible for you to create an SEO plan that will maximize your web siteÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s potential in the minimum amount of time .
Top priority pages should be the ones that your visitors will most naturally gravitate to , such as your home page , or pages that will generate the most in terms of traffic or revenue .
When prioritizing pages , you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢re also creating a road map for your marketing efforts .
If three of the pages on your site are your top priority , those three will have the lionÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s share of time , capital , and effort when it comes to SEO and marketing .
Site assessment
After you have prioritized your site , you should assess where you stand and where you need to be with your current SEO efforts .
Again , assess each page individually , rather than the site as a whole .
In SEO , individual pages are equally important ( if not more so ) than the entire site .
All of your efforts are designed to rank one page above all others in search results .
Which page is the most important should be determined by your business needs .
Your SEO assessment should be a document that outlines the current standing of the main SEO elements of each page .
It should contain columns for the element of the site youÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢re assessing , the current status of that element , what needs to be improved in that element , and the deadline for improvement .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s also helpful if you have a check box next to each item that can be marked when improvements are completed and a column for follow - up , because SEO is a never - ending process .
The elements that should be considered during an assessment include :
Site / page tagging :
The meta tags that are included in the coding of your web site are essential to having that site listed properly in a search engine .
Tags to which you should pay specific attention are the title tags and description tags , because these are the most
important to a search engine .
The meta tags that are included in the coding of your web site are essential to having that site listed properly in a search engine .
Tags to which you should pay specific attention are the title tags and description tags , because these are the most important to a search engine .
Page content :
How fresh is your content ?
How relevant is it ?
How often is it updated ?
And how much content is there ?
Content is still important when it comes to search results .
After all , most people are looking for a specific piece of content , whether itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢sÃ‚Â information or a product .
If your content is stale , search engines could eventually begin to ignore your site in favor of a site that has fresher content .
There are exceptions to this generalization , however .
And one exception is if your content is , by nature , very rich but not very dynamic .
Because of the usefulness of the content , your site will probably continue to rank well .
But itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a difficult case to determine .
In most cases , fresh content is better .

But itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s a difficult case to determine .
In most cases , fresh content is better .
Site links :
Site links are essential in SEO .
Crawlers and spiders look for the links into and out of your site in order to traverse your site and collect data on each URL .
However , they also look for those links to be in - context , meaning the link must come from or lead
to a site that is relevant to the page that is being indexed .
Broken links tend to be a large problem when it comes to search engine ranking , so be sure to check that links are still working during the assessment process .

Broken links tend to be a large problem when it comes to search engine ranking , so be sure to check that links are still working during the assessment process .
Site map : Believe it or not , a site map will help your web site be more accurately linked .
But this is not the ordinary site map that you include to help users quickly navigate through your site .
This site map is an XML - based document , at the root of your HTML , that contains information ( URL , last updated , relevance to surrounding pages , and so on ) about each of the pages within a site .
Using this XML site map will help to ensure that even the deep pages within your site are indexed by search engines .
If you do nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t have a site map , you should create one .
If you do have one , make sure itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s accurate and up to date .
Finishing the plan
With the site assessment out of the way , you should have a good idea of what areas need work and what areas are in good shape .
DonÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t assume the areas that donÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t currently need work will always be perfect , however .
ThatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not how it works .
At the least , changes to the pages will require changes to the SEO efforts that you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢re putting forth ; at most they may require that you begin SEO efforts for that page all over again .
You can now take the time to put together all of the information that youÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ve gathered into a cohe - sive picture of the SEO efforts you should be making .
Your SEO plan is more than just a picture of whatÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s there and what Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not , however .
This is the document that you use to tie everything together : current standing , marketing efforts , capital expenditures , time frames Ã¢â‚¬â€ all of it .
The document should look much like any other plan that you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll create , for instance your business plan .
In this plan , you should have an area for background information , marketing information , plans for growing the business , and plans for managing problems that may arise .
An SEO plan is very similar .
YouÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll have your current standings , the goals that you plan to hit , and the marketing efforts that you plan to make for each page ( or for the site as a whole ) .
YouÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll even have the capital expenditures that you plan to encounter as you implement your SEO plan .
YouÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll also want to include the strategies you plan to use .
Those strategies can be efforts such as submitting your site or pages from your site to directories manually and planning the content you Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢ll use to draw search crawlers , or they can be keyword marketing plans or pay - per - click programs you plan to use .
Also be sure to include a time line for the testing and implementation of those efforts as well as for regular follow - ups .
Follow - up
Follow - up is also an essential part of your SEO plan .
Many people believe they can develop and implement an SEO plan and then just walk away from it .
The truth is , however , that SEO is not just a one - time event .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s an ongoing process that requires testing , monitoring , and often re-building .
A good plan for conducting follow - ups is to plan for them quarterly .
Some companies will choose to follow up and reassess their SEO bi-annually , but to be truly effective quarterly is much better .
One thing to keep in mind , however , is that following up on your SEO efforts too soon is non-productive .
In many cases , it takes at least three months to get a clear picture of how successful your efforts are .
Conducting an evaluation before that three - month mark could have you chasing after an elusive SEO goal that does nÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢t really exist .
Or worse , it could lead you away from a successful strategy .
Give your plan at least three months but no more than six between checkups .
Once you create the habit of re-evaluating your SEO efforts on that time schedule , it will be much less time consuming than you assume .
Times are tough , and people are sat at home chewing bellybutton fluff instead of eating out or ordering in .

For news of flooding , deaths in Philippines and Mirinae track to Vietnam CLICK HERE
The Typhoon Mirinae Forecast Track remains generally unchanged as does the intensity .
It continues to move west at a pretty good clip and that may end up being a good thing for the Philippines .
The JTWC forecast track has been nudged a tad farther south than previous runs which would send the typhoon across the island closer to Manila .
While Luzon really can’t handle a lot of rain , it ’s going to get it as well as winds along the coast perhaps as high as 105 to 110 mph or 95 kts with higher gusts .
With the forward momentum of Mirinae , I suspect that whatever the maximum storm surge in that area with this type of storm will be likely .
The biggest difference between the NOGAPS and GFS models is the timing .
Over 117,000 Filipinos remain in shelters as a result of Typhoon Parma and Tropical Storm Ketsana .
So , the government of the Philippines is warning the potential for landslides and flooding .
The government is particularly concerned because All Saints Day , November 1 , is traditionally a day when Filipinos visit cemeteries to remember ancestors .
The NOGAPS advertises a typhoon moving at a pretty good pace with a landfall outlined just prior to 12 Z on Friday October 30 .
It also favors a landfalling tropical cyclone with a central pressure a shade less than 996 mb .
The GFS on the other hand does n’t come up with as robust a system as the NOGAPS .
The central pressure at landfall is something between 996 mb and 100 mb .
If that is verified , I find it hard to determine how a storm with that level of pressure could support the JTWC contention that a 95 kt typhoon will strike the Philippines .
My experience tells me that pressures that high generally does not support winds of 95 kts unless it was a major tropical cyclone that was winding down and even that is not evidence of support .
Falling winds mean that the pressure cannot support that wind level .
Other than that , the GFS is much slower than the NOGAPS with a landfall with a landfall not coming until just after 00 Z on Saturday Oct 31 .
That is a big difference because if Mirinae moves that slowly then it would be dropping heavy rain on the Philippines for many hours longer than the NOGAPS solution .
The typhoon has been moving at a steady speed and so unless something shows up to slow its forward speed then it seems reasonable that the JTWC forecast of having the core of the storm over Luzon for less than 24 hours is very plausible .
On the other hand , that also means that the fine folks of Manila and other parts of the Philippines will probably experience pretty decent winds …. maybe even typhoon force … for the duration of the storm because Mirinae just would n’t have time to fall apart … but it will weaken .
This storm got stronger than anticipated due to a trof to the north that was enhancing the outflow to the north .
Interestingly , that trof was actually created from the remnant of Typhoon Lupit which moved northeast offshore of Japan , turned extratropical and created a front trailing off from it .
With that feature moving out , there is n’t any real mechanism that would help enhance the intensity substantially .
The only thing that will help it get stronger is an increasing outflow aloft , but that will be offset somewhat by a little bit of vertical shear .
The JTWC notes that the shear has already messed up the visibility of the eye .
If one assumes a rapid movement across the Philippines , then one might assume that the storm will not deteriorate that much over land and will emerge in the South China Sea in good shape .
So good that it may redevelop .
But , sea surface temperatures in the central South China Sea have dropped off a bit due to a recent shot of unseasonably cold air in the area .
So , the JTWC forecast reflects that situation by reducing the intensity of the storm as it approaches Vietnam .
Mirinae may fall to tropical storm status before landfall .
However , Vietnam also suffered from Typhoon Ketsana and Typhoon Parma , though Parma was closer to Hanoi .
In any event , the ground in Vietnam is pretty saturated so if they get a tropical storm instead of a typhoon , it is really immaterial as the forward motion will be the key for Vietnam .
Vietnam suffered over 3 /4 of a billion US dollars just from Ketsana .
If the storm slows down once it ’s inland over SE Asia , then excessive rainfall can be anticipated .
The thing that everyone wants is for the storm to keep moving .

‘ Israel is the light onto the nations ’ says the Torah .
Indeed it is , and not just because the Torah says so .
Israel is ahead of everyone else in many fronts .
Take for instance , terrorizing civilian populations and practicing some of the most devastating murderous tactics upon elders , women and young .
The Jerusalem post reported yesterday that the Chairman of NATO 's Military Committee , Admiral Giampaolo Di Paola , visited Israel earlier this week to study “ IDF tactics and methods that the military alliance can utilise for its war in Afghanistan . ”
A senior Israeli defence official added " The one thing on NATO 's mind today is how to win in Afghanistan … Di Paola was very impressed by the IDF , which is a major source of information due to our operational experience . "
I would advise both the Israeli official and Admiral Di Paola to slightly curb their enthusiasm .
The IDF did n’t win a single war since 1967 .
Yes , it murdered many civilians , it flattened many cities , it starved millions , it has been committing war crimes on a daily basis for decades and yet , it did n’t win a war .
Thus , the IDF cannot really teach NATO how to win in Afghanistan .
If NATO generals are stupid enough to follow IDF tactics , like the Israeli generals , they will start to see the charges of war crimes pile up against them .
They may even be lucky enough to share their cells with some Israelis in due course , once justice is performed .
Admiral Di Paola spent two days with the infamous IDF Chief of Staff Lt. - Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi , the man who led the IDF into Gaza last December .
In the Jewish state they were very enthusiastic with Admiral Di Paola ’s visit .
They regarded it as just another reassurance of ‘ business as usual .
The visit of a NATO high supreme official was there to convince them that no one takes note of the Goldstone report .
“ Di Paola 's visit is significant “ says the Jerusalem Post , “ since it comes at a time when the IDF is under increasing criticism in the wake of the Goldstone Report on Operation Cast Lead as well as a decision by Turkey - a NATO member - to ban Israel from joint aerial exercises . ”
However , it would be crucial to elaborate on the emerging mutual interests between the two parties , Israel and NATO .
“ During their meeting on Wednesday , Ashkenazi and Di Paola discussed ways to upgrade Israeli- NATO military ties as well as the plan to include an Israeli Navy vessel in Active Endeavor , a NATO mission established after the 9/11 attacks under which NATO vessels patrol the Mediterranean to prevent illegal terror trafficking ” .
This is indeed a necessary move for the Israelis .
At the moment the Israeli Navy is operating in the Mediterranean as a bunch of Yiddish Pirates ( Yidisshe Piraten ) , assaulting , hijacking and robbing vessels in international waters .
Once operating under the NATO flag , the Israelis would be able to terrorise every vessel in the high seas in the name of the ‘ West ’ .
For the Jewish state this would be a major step forward .
Until now the Israelis have been committing atrocities in the name of the Jewish people .
Once operating under the NATO flag , the Israelis will be able to perform their piracy in the name of ‘ Europe ’ .
Such a move is further evidence of the spiritual and ideological transition within Zionism from ‘ promised land ’ into ‘ promised planet ’ .
While the Israelis desperately need NATO ’s legitimacy , NATO is far more modest .
All it needs is knowledge and tactics .
For some reason it insists on learning from the Israelis how to inflict pain on a civilian population .
More pain , that is , than it is already making .
“ NATO 's Defence officials said that Di Paola used his meetings with the IDF to learn about new technology that can be applied to the war in Afghanistan ” .
The Jerusalem Post reports that Israel is a “ known world leader in the development of specialized armor to protect against improvised explosive devices ( IEDs ) , otherwise known as roadside bombs . ”
This is indeed the case .
Israeli generals realised a long time ago that their precious young soldiers prefer to hide in their tanks rather than engage with the ‘ enemy ’ i.e. the civilian population , kids , elders and women .
But it does n’t stop there , Di Paola was also interested in “ Israeli intelligence - gathering capabilities and methods that the IDF uses when operating in civilian population centers . ”
Di Paola noted that “ NATO and the IDF were facing similar threats - NATO in Afghanistan and Israel in its war against Hamas and Hizbullah . ”
I would suggest to Admiral Di Paola to immediately read the Goldstone report thoroughly , so he grasps his own personal legal consequences once he starts to implement ‘ Israeli tactics ’ .
If Admiral Di Paola wants to serve his army , he should indeed visit Israel , he should also meet every war criminal both in the military and politics so he knows exactly what NOT to do .
NATO ’s chances of winning in Afghanistan are not limited , they are actually exhausted .
It can only lose .
Some military analysts and veteran generals argue that it is lost already .
NATO has brought enough carnage on the Afghani people without achieving any of its military or political goals .
Given that Israel was severely humiliated in Lebanon in 2006 by a tiny paramilitary Hizbullah and failed to achieve its military goals in Operation Cast Lead in its genocidal war against Hamas , there is nothing for NATO to learn from the Israelis .
Should NATO proceed in implementing added IDF tactics , all it will achieve is a dramatic reduction of security across Europe and America .
If we are concerned with peace and we want it to prevail , what we have to do is to move away as far as we can from any spiritual , ideological , political and military affiliation with Zionism , Israel and its lobbies .
If ‘ Israel ’ is indeed a ‘ light onto the nations ’ , someone better explain to us all , why its prospect of peace is becoming slimmer and darker .
My answer is actually simple .
Israel can be easily seen as the ‘ light of nations ’ as long as you learn from Israel what not to do .
In fact this is the message passed to us by the great humanist prophets Jesus and Marx .
Love your neighbour , be among others , transcend yourself beyond the tribal into the realm of the universal .
In fact this is exactly what the Israelis fail to grasp .
For some reason , they love themselves almost as much as they hate their neighbours .
If Admiral Di Paola wants to win the hearts and the minds of the Afghani people ( rather than ‘ winning a war ’ ) , he should first learn to love .
This is something he wo n’t learn in Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.
Gaza , Ramallha and Nablus are more likely .
The Hmoud family once prospered in this arid Palestinian farm village by cultivating banana and eggplant crops , earning enough to send a son abroad for medical school and to build a house with a showy staircase and a two - story window .
But drought has decimated the spring that is Auja 's only agricultural water source , and fields once filled with palm trees are now empty .
Village residents have been forced to find work in the greenhouses near Jewish settlements that are hooked up to Israeli water mains .
" This before you is barren land , " says Mahmoud Hmoud , standing in parched field littered with plastic sheeting .
" Ten years go it was blooming . "
Long a hot - button in the parched Middle East , the need for a water - rights compromise here has become more acute after years of dry winters , as Palestinians struggle with what they say are insufficient quotas and Israel mulls steep tax hikes on home and garden usage .
Both sides blame each other for failing to honor the 1995 interim agreement still in effect .
Though potential solutions exist , little progress can be made until the peace process – stalled for nearly a year – is restarted .
Two straws , one glass of water
The dispute partly focuses on rights to a " mountain aquifer " underneath the hilltops of the Israeli - occupied West Bank .
It collects rainwater , most of which then flows through subterranean rock formations across the Green Line into Israel proper .
" It 's actually as if two people are drinking from the same glass of water with two straws , ' " says Prof.
Hillel Shuval , an environmental resource expert who helped negotiate a water compromise as part of the Geneva Initiative peace agreement , a hypothetical model put forth in 2003 .
" The ground water under the West Bank and Israel is a shared resource . "
Palestinians and human rights groups contend that Israel takes the water for its population .
Israelis consume four times as much per person as Palestinians , according to the World Bank .
Meanwhile , Palestinians say they need Israeli permission to access even the water that remains within the West Bank .
" It 's a systematic policy , " says Nader Khateeb , who heads the Bethlehem office of environmental group Friends of the Earth Middle East .
" Controlling the water means controlling the economy and development . "
Amnesty report criticizes Israel
An October report by Amnesty International last month accused Israel of denying Palestinians access to local water resources while allowing neighboring settlements " virtually unlimited supplies . "
Amnesty accused Israel of neglecting Palestinian infrastructure development and leaving as many as 200,000 without running water .
Hundreds of thousands of settlers use the same amount as 2.3 million Palestinians living in the West Bank , the report alleged .
Professor Shuval rejected Amnesty 's claims of neglect by Israel of Palestinian infrastructure .
He noted that when Israel captured the West Bank and Gaza in 1967 , practically no Palestinian villages had a central water supply .
He did say , however , that Israelis had developed their own water access in the area of the Jordan Valley , a practice Mr. Shuval acknowledged is illegal under international law .
David Elhiini , the head of the council of Israeli settlements in the region of Auja , said that the lack of infrastructure is in fact the fault of Palestinians – not Israel .
Auja 's farmers have no access to water , he said , because the Palestinians have n't invested enough in water transmission and pumping infrastructure .
In other areas of the Jordan Valley , including the neighboring Jericho , farmers have enough water for their crops .
" It 's not our problem , " he says .
" It 's very easy to blame it on us . "
Israel counters criticism of its practices by pointing out that it supplies Palestinians with double the amount that it committed to provide under the 1995 interim peace agreement .
Meanwhile , Israeli water experts accuse Palestinians of digging hundreds of illegal wells in breach of the accord , which said a final quota would be settled in permanent peace talks .
Auja once Palestine 's ' fruit basket '
Auja village council member Salah Freijad said that Auja was nicknamed the " fruit basket " of Palestine because a spring flowing year - round provided more than enough irrigation for produce .
Only a few dozen of about 8,150 acres are now being used for agriculture in the village .
In addition to the drought , Freijad accused Israel of drying up the stream by drilling its own wells to divert water to local settlements .
He added that the Palestinian Authority has diverted some of the water as well .
The dried - up stream has devastated the town .
Children are being taken out of school and sent to nearby settlements to earn money .
Some farmers have been forced to sell off land to survive .
" This village can be declared dead , " says Mr. Freijad .
Israel is grappling with a water crisis of its own , though not as acute .
With the country 's main freshwater water reservoir , the Sea of Galilee , 4.2 feet below its lowest " red line " ( which indicates water is being consumed faster than it is replenished ) public service announcements remind radio and television audiences that " we have n't got any water to waste . "
Over the summer , the government levied a tax multiplying water bills for private users , stirring public outrage .
Spokespersons from the Israeli public water utility , Mekorot , and the government 's water authority did n't return calls for comment .
Shuval :
Not a zero-sum game
Though many have said that cross - border water disputes are a potential causus belli in the Middle East , Shuval says that the water dispute between Israelis and the Palestinians is n't necessarily a zero-sum game .
With new desalination plants purifying sea water for residential and industrial usage , Israel has enough water to double or triple the Palestinian water quota – though it would require an investment of $ 50 million to $ 100 million a year .
But in order for that to happen , the sides would have to overcome a nearly year - long freeze in peace talks and reach an elusive final settlement , he said .
" The tragic situation is that the Palestinians are short of water , " Shuval says , " and the only way for them to get more water is to reach a peace agreement in which Israel will increase the Palestinian water resources . "

WASHINGTON --
The Obama administration , under pressure to show it is serious about tackling the budget deficit , is seizing on an unusual target to showcase fiscal responsibility : the $ 700 billion financial rescue .
The administration wants to keep some of the unspent funds available for emergencies , but is considering setting aside a chunk for debt reduction , according to people familiar with the matter .
It is also expected to lower the projected long - term cost of the program -- the amount it expects to lose -- to as little as $ 200 billion from $ 341 billion estimated in August .
The idea is still a matter of debate within the administration and it is unclear how much impact it would have on the nation 's mounting deficit levels .
Still , the potential move illustrates how the Obama administration is trying to find any way it can to bring down the deficit , which is turning into a political as well as an economic liability .
The White House is in the early stages of considering what bigger moves it might make for next year 's budget .
The Office of Management and Budget has asked all cabinet agencies , except defense and veterans affairs , to prepare two budget proposals for fiscal 2011 , which begins Oct 1 , 2010 .
One would freeze spending at current levels .
The other would cut spending by 5 % .
OMB is also reviewing a host of tax changes .
The President 's Economic Recovery Advisory Board will submit tax - policy options by Dec. 5 , including simplifying the tax code and revamping the corporate tax code .
Senior US officials are pushing to expand CIA drone strikes beyond Pakistan ’s tribal region and into a major city in an attempt to pressure the Pakistani government to pursue Taliban leaders based in the city of Quetta — a city with some 850,000 people , according to a report Monday .
The Obama Administration is eyeing Predator aircraft strikes in Quetta in an effort to decapitate the Taliban , according to the LA Times .
But the prospect of launching a major attack in a highly populous city has struck some officials as unwise , officials who apparently leaked news of the program to a major US newspaper .
ADVERTISEMENT
Pakistani officials have also warned that the fallout would be severe .
“ We are not a banana republic , ” the Times quoted a senior Pakistani official as saying .
If the United States follows through , the official said , “ this might be the end of the road . ”
Obama officials disagree .
One senior US official was quoted as saying , “ If we do n’t do this — at least have a real discussion of it — Pakistan might not think we are serious .
What the Pakistanis have to do is tell the Taliban that there is too much pressure from the US ; we ca n’t allow you to have sanctuary inside Pakistan anymore . ”
Proponents , including some military leaders , argue that attacking the Taliban in Quetta — or at least threatening to do so — is critical to the success of the revised war strategy President Obama unveiled last week .
But others , including high - ranking US intelligence officials , have been skeptical of employing drone attacks in a place that Pakistanis see as part of their country ’s core .
The US has increased CIA - initiated Predator drone attacks since President Obama took office .
In October , The New Yorker ’s Jane Mayer noted a New America Foundation study , which posited that Obama ’s team had increased such strikes “ dramatically . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
According to a just completed study by the New America Foundation , the number of drone strikes has risen dramatically since Obama became President .
During his first nine and a half months in office , he has authorized as many C.I.A. aerial attacks in Pakistan as George W. Bush did in his final three years in office .
The study ’s authors , Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann , report that the Obama Administration has sanctioned at least forty - one C.I.A. missile strikes in Pakistan since taking office — a rate of approximately one bombing a week .
So far this year , various estimates suggest , the C.I.A. attacks have killed between three hundred and twenty - six and five hundred and thirty - eight people .
Critics say that many of the victims have been innocent bystanders , including children .
In the last week of September alone , there were reportedly four such attacks — three of them in one twenty - four - hour period .
At any given moment , a former White House counterterrorism official says , the C.I.A. has multiple drones flying over Pakistan , scouting for targets .
According to the official , “ there are so many drones ” in the air that arguments have erupted over which remote operators can claim which targets , provoking “ command - and - control issues . ”
Mayer ’s October piece took issue with the frequency of Predator strikes , which involve targeted assassinations of purported terrorists .
While seemingly effective — and certainly effective at driving terrorists underground – there is little oversight .
“ It ’s easy to understand the appeal of a ‘ push - button ” ’ approach to fighting Al Qaeda , but the embrace of the Predator program has occurred with remarkably little public discussion , given that it represents a radically new and geographically unbounded use of state - sanctioned lethal force , ” Mayer wrote .
“ And , because of the C.I.A. program ’s secrecy , there is no visible system of accountability in place , despite the fact that the agency has killed many civilians inside a politically fragile , nuclear - armed country with which the U.S. is not at war . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Predator drones are flown by civilians .
In the past , they ’ve also involved security contractors such as Blackwater .
“ According to a former counterterrorism official , the contractors are “ seasoned professionals — often retired military and intelligence officials , ' ” Mayer writes .
“ Once the drones are aloft , the former counterterrorism official said , the controls are electronically ‘ slewed over ’ to a set of ‘ reachback operators , ’ in Langley .
Using joysticks that resemble video - game controls , the reachback operators — who do n’t need conventional flight training — sit next to intelligence officers and watch , on large flat - screen monitors , a live video feed from the drone ’s camera . ”

Quetta is a target because it is seen as a base for Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar .
“ Pakistan is not expected to hand over Mullah Mohammed Omar , the Taliban leader and longtime ally of Osama bin Laden who fled Afghanistan when U.S. forces invaded after the Sept. 11 attacks , ” the Times reporters write .
“ Omar is believed to have used Quetta as a base from which to orchestrate insurgent attacks in Afghanistan .
“ But U.S. officials said they have presented Pakistan with a list of Taliban lieutenants and argued that , with a U.S. pullout scheduled to begin in 18 months , the urgency of dismantling the so - called Quetta shura is greater than at any time in the 8 - year - old war , ” they add .

With AFP .
RADLEY BALKO is an award - winning investigative reporter who focuses on civil liberties and criminal justice .
He is a senior editor at Reason magazine , where he writes a monthly column .
He also writes a weekly column for Reason 's website and blogs at Hit & Run and The Agitator , his personal blog , which is a must - read for anyone with a healthy scepticism of the government 's activities .
Mr Balko's writings have been cited by the US Supreme Court and the Mississippi State Supreme Court , and his reporting has helped illuminate the path to justice in a number of criminal cases — his reporting has even helped get a man off of death row .
This week we asked him some questions about the flaws in America 's criminal - justice system and the frustrations of being a libertarian .
DIA : You 've written about the creeping militarisation of law enforcement in America .
How has this trend manifested itself and what are the consequences for the quality of policing ?
Mr Balko :
The most obvious way it has manifested itself is in the explosion in the use of SWAT teams and similar paramilitary police units over the last 25 years .
The criminologist Peter Kraska has surveyed their use over that time .
He 's found that the total number of SWAT - team deployments in the 1970s was a few hundred times per year , over the entire country .
By the 1980s , it was a few thousand times per year .
And by around 2005 , Mr Kraska estimates around 50,000 times per year .
The surge has been driven entirely by the drug war , with the vast majority of SWAT deployments being used to serve drug - related search warrants .
This has led to a militaristic mindset among America 's police departments , beyond just SWAT teams .
Driven by " war on crime " and " war on drugs " rhetoric set by political leaders , police officers have increasingly taken on the psyche of soldiers .
There 's a pervasive and troubling " us versus them " attitude in policing today .
Policing has become more reactionary , more aggressive , and it's poisoning the relationship between the police and the communities they serve .
I should add that I do n't think police officers themselves are to blame for this , nor , obviously , are all police officers guilty of it .
These are problems spawned by 35 years or so of bad policies set by politicians .
That 's really where any reform would need to start .
DIA : Another criminal justice issue you often deal with is the use of forensic evidence .
How is forensic evidence being abused in the courtroom , and what can be done to improve the way we use science in criminal proceedings ?
Mr Balko :
The main problem with forensic evidence is that it is n't science but it 's usually presented to juries as if it were .
Forensic evidence — think fingerprint matching , hair and fiber analysis , ballistics , etc — has been largely invented by and developed by police and police organisations .
But when its presented in court , it 's often presented with the gloss of science .
It 's telling that the one type of forensic evidence that actually was developed in the scientific community — DNA testing — is really the only type that 's relatively certain ( provided the evidence is handled properly ) .
And it 's showing us just how flawed and overstated other areas of forensics really are .
The other problem is that science is a process .
It 's sort of a journey toward truth .
The criminal - justice system is n't shy about embracing new theories during criminal trials , but once the trial is over , the system puts a premium on finality .
The courts set the bar very high when it comes to overturning convictions won in part or in whole based on science we now know is junk .
Bite - mark analysis is a great example .
Lots of people were sent to prison in the 1990s thanks to a small cadre of self - proclaimed bite - mark specialists .
We now know there 's simply no scientific support for the idea that you can match bite marks in skin to one person 's teeth , especially to the exclusion of everyone else .
Another good example is recovered memory psychoanalysis , which was responsible for dozens of wrongful convictions in the 1980s .
As for reform , I think we need to subject forensic evidence to the scientific method , at least to the extent that it 's possible .
The work of crime lab technicians and medical examiners should be tested from time to time by private labs , but without letting them know when they 're being tested .
Expert witnesses should be subject to statistical analysis , blind tests , and competency tests .
If a medical examiner is diagnosing a disproportionately high percentage of infant deaths as homicides , for example , that would be a red flag for further investigation .
Judges need to familiarise themselves with the appropriate accrediting organisations in the various forensic fields so they do n't allow frauds and charlatans rubber - stamped by disreputable certification mills to testify in their courtrooms .
Roger Koppl of Fairleigh - Dickinson University wrote a terrific paper for the Reason Foundation ( which publishes the magazine I work for ) with some other good ideas for reforming the forensics system .
DIA : Beyond the two discussed above , what are the most critical flaws in America 's criminal justice system ?
Mr Balko : Incentives .
At every step in the process , the incentive is toward putting people in jail .
And there 's almost no penalty at all for state actors who overstep their authority .
Police departments , for example , get federal anti-drug grants based in large part on how many people they arrest on drug charges .
After the botched drug raid in Atlanta a few years ago in which a raiding police team shot and killed an innocent 92 - year - old woman , we learned in subsequent investigations that officers had monthly quotas for drug arrests and drug seizures .
Ed Burns , the former Baltimore cop and co-creator of the magnificent HBO show " The Wire " , talks about this quite a bit .
It 's also true of forensics .
If a crime - lab technician reports to the local DA , there 's always going to be some pressure — subtle or overt — to tell the prosecutor what he wants to hear .
But the incentive problems are most apparent with prosecutors .
Prosecutors get no credit for cases they decide not to bring , either because of a lack of evidence or because pressing charges would n't be in the interest of justice .
They 're only rewarded for winning convictions .
That 's what gets them promoted , or re-elected , or gives them the elevated profile to run for higher office .
Every incentive points toward winning convictions .
And particularly with prosecutors , there 's really no penalty at all for going too far to get a guilty verdict .
One real disservice the Duke lacrosse case did for the criminal - justice system is it put in the public consciousness the idea that bad actors like Mike Nifong are regularly disciplined for misconduct .
In truth , that case was really exceptional .
There have been a few prosecutorial misconduct cases before the Supreme Court over the last few years , and what 's really striking when you read through the briefs is just how rarely prosecutors are sanctioned in any way , even for egregious misconduct .
Not by courts , not by bar associations , not by state attorneys general .
The Innocence Project estimates that prosecutorial misconduct factored into about a fourth of the wrongful convictions that organisation has helped expose .
None of the prosecutors in those cases faced any serious sanction .
It 's impossible to sue a prosecutor , even if he intentionally withholds exculpatory evidence that sends an innocent person to prison .
The Supreme Court will rule this spring if prosecutors who manufacture evidence that sends an innocent person to prison can be sued .
I think a lot of people would be rather shocked to hear that such a notion would even be open to debate .
Most prosecutors are well - intentioned , honest public servants .
But it 's deeply troubling that those who are n't are almost never held accountable , and in fact are often re-elected , appointed as judges , or go on to get elected to political office .
DIA : Your blog does a great job of curating infuriating stories about injustices in today 's system .
What is the worst case that you 've come across ?
Mr Balko :
I 'd say it would have to be the legacy of Steven Hayne , the Mississippi medical examiner I 've been reporting on for a few years now [ see here ] .
Hayne has testified in 80 - 90 % of the homicide cases in Mississippi for the last 20 years .
He has also testified in Louisiana .
The guy admits under oath that he does some 1,500 - 1,800 autopsies per year , several times more than the maximum recommended by professional organisations ( 250 -300 per year ) .
We already know of two men who served close to two decades each in prison because of his testimony who were later exonerated by DNA .
His workload , testimony , and general practices are condemned by just about everyone in his profession .
The guy has done incalculable damage to Mississippi 's criminal - justice system .
And its civil - justice system , for that matter .
He also testifies in medical malpractice and wrongful death cases .
But no one in Mississippi seems concerned .
Mr Hayne was effectively barred from doing autopsies last year , but he continues to testify in Mississippi 's courts .
He just testified last week .
And state officials refuse to go back and look at old cases that may have been corrupted by his testimony .
In fact , the state 's Supreme Court once again vouched for his credibility as an expert last April , even after all of this had come out about him .
When you think about 20 years and thousands of cases , between the innocent people he may have sent to prison , the guilty people his findings may have allowed to remain free , and the millions of dollars his testimony may have permitted to change hands in civil cases , it 's hard to think of another person who could have done more damage to the criminal - justice system — particularly someone who does n't ( and never has ) held any sort of public position .
DIA : A lot of politicians pay lip service to the principles of smaller government , lower taxes , and more freedom .
Yet the result is often the opposite .
As a libertarian , do you ever get frustrated with the lack of representation for your views in the halls of government ?
Is there anything that can be done to improve the standing of libertarians ?
Mr Balko :
In theory , libertarians share about half of our positions with the right , and about half with the left .
Broadly speaking , we 're social liberals and fiscal conservatives .
The problem is that once in power , neither side pays much heed to the issues they have in common with libertarians , because that would require them to voluntarily put limits on their own power .
And politicians do n't generally seek higher office for the purpose of limiting what they can do when they get there .
So the libertarian stuff is where they 're most willing to compromise .
And it's what they 're least willing to spend political capital defending .
So we saw George W. Bush hold the line on social issues , but completely sell out on federal spending , regulation , and general growth of government .
We 're seeing the same thing with Barack Obama , only in reverse .
I put up a blog post at Reason about this a few months ago .
Obama 's holding fast to his campaign promises that expand the size , scope , and power of government .
The few promises he made that involve limiting government in some way — generally on social and civil liberties issues — are the promises he 's been less interested in keeping .
This is n't really surprising .
But it speaks to the difficulty libertarians have in getting their ideas taken seriously .
It 's made worse by the fact that libertarians by definition generally are n't interested in seeking political power .
That leaves public office and the reins of power open to those who crave it .
That said , I think there 's reason for some optimism for libertarians .
The generations raised on the internet will be more educated , aware , and informed than any before them , and I think that has instilled in them some naturally libertarian instincts , particularly when it comes to issues like government transparency , accountability , censorship , and police power .
Perhaps I 'm a bit pollyanna - ish , but it's at least possible that once the Obama administration proves just as inept , corrupt , and hopeless as the Bush administration , the younger people who flocked to Obama will start to understand that the problem is n't who 's running government , it 's that government power itself corrupts -- and that we 're better off keeping as much of our lives as possible off limits to the whims of politicians instead of this repeating cycle of putting all of our hope into the idea that someday , the right politicians will finally get elected .
Public sentiment on the drug war and the criminal - justice system in general I think is shifting .
Gradually , but it 's shifting .
Technology also always seems to be several paces ahead of government when it comes to battling censorship and expanding choice , commerce , and opportunity .
Most importantly , I think technology is adding a level of transparency to government we 've never seen before , from crowd - source analysis of those 1,000 - page bills Congress is so fond of sneaking through , to Google 's recent move to make case law available and searchable to the public , to the proliferation of cell - phone cameras and the resulting documentation of police and government abuses for the world to see -- be it the Iranian government 's crackdown on democracy protesters or a Bay Area cop 's killing of a BART passenger .
George Orwell wrote of government power , " If you want a vision of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever . "
He may still be right , but there 's now a decent chance someone will be there with a cell - phone camera to post it on YouTube .
And exposing abuse of power is half the battle .

PvP Creator Scott Kurtz Blasts Wizard World 2010 Cons
A Wizard Entertainment sales manager managed to royally tee off PvP creator Scott Kurtz just two words into a letter inquiring about the Toronto and Anaheim 2010 Wizard World * Cons .
What exactly were those first two words ?
“ Dear Kurt , ” ( Mind you , not “ Dear Kurtz ” or “ Dear Scott ” but “ Kurt ” ) .
It does n’t take a rocket scientist to know that screwing up a person ’s name in a formal address to them is liable to not only make you look stupid , but immediately try the patience of whoever you ’ve just sent the letter to .
It also gives the appearance that you ’ve sent the same letter multiple times to multiple people .
Kurtz posted the embarrassing letter from Wizard on the PvPonline Blog along with a colorful response that blasted the organization and its recent scheduling practices …
Your conventions are total horseshit , so itâ€™s wise to stop branding them with the name Wizard .
But no amount of polishing is going to make me want to attended any of the 5 turds your company is going to crap out in 2010 , especially when you schedule them against other shows in some bullshit dick measuring contests that serves no other purpose but to fracture an already dying industry that I have nostalgic ties to . [ … ]
Maybe if you cared enough to actually get my name right , or maybe if you cared about creators like the late , great Mike Wieringo beyond what they can do for you THIS FIVE MINUTES , the entire industry wouldnâ€™t all be anticipating your inevitable bankruptcy .
Wizard Entertainment ’s head honcho Gareb Shamus has a well documented history of playing hardball when it comes to convention dates , which in the face of economic competition — comes off as heartless .
* Officially these conventions are dropping the “ Wizard World ” branding from their name .
The great contest of the cuts has begun .
Whose axe is biggest ?
Fastest slasher takes all .
If that is the electoral battleground , then all is lost .
Only by shifting the argument altogether and changing the language of debate can sanity prevail .
No sign of it so far , as Ed Balls swings his mallet first with an incredible – yes , I mean literally unbelievable – promise to cut £ 2bn from schools by axing heads and deputy heads , often the best school talent around .
It 's to be done by that magician , " natural wastage " , a wish - think we will hear much of .
That 's a bad start , but all too typical of what will happen in this disastrous anything – you - can - cut - I - can - cut - better gladiator fight .
For the truth is that cutting well is even harder than spending well .
Those of us who have lived through savage cuts before know how it 's done : there is rarely time for a rethink , let alone a re-organisation or rationalisation .
Assuming a near - certain
Tory win , straight after Osborne 's emergency June budget , local managers will be told to cut a set sum by a set date – fast .
( Devolution is very handy in hard times . )
So what goes ?
First , cut the more junior staff , usually on the frontline , because sacking senior people is too expensive with their pricey redundo .
That means sacking more people , as each junior makes less saving .
Then cut any outside contracts ASAP because it 's easier , even if the contracted - out service is essential and efficient .
Stop any building repairs : we are returning to a long age of public squalor .
Stop anything preventive : chiropody services are cut quicker than you can say bunion , though it makes old people immobile and soon in need of much more expensive care services .
Cut other home care that keeps them independent : no one can see those .
But beware of axing highly visible , if less useful , hospital treatments , because patient groups and hospital consultants make most fuss .
Noise counts most .
Drug treatments for addicts can be cut as they have no voice : if crime rises , it 's not my budget , guv .
A&E gets clogged again – forget the four - hour rule – as other preventive community services shut .
Bed blockers fill acute wards again for lack of services to take them back into the community .
One service 's cut is another 's added pressure : forget " partnership working " as everyone clutches the shrinking budget in their silo .
There is no time for health , social care , local authority , police and all the rest to work out how best to pool dwindling resources .
School welfare and school nursing work will vanish , more kids in trouble , more antisocial behaviour – but that 's not on the school 's budget .
Sharing is for lush times – in the panic of cuts it 's every service for itself .
So what would good rationalisation look like ?
Take education .
First , reduce its objectives to a basic three : educate everyone to the highest level ; educate the top brains – the scientists , engineers and ideas generators of the future ; use every resource to redress the damage done by destructive social backgrounds .
Then ask , where is the best bang for every education buck ?
Ask why it is we spend most where it 's least use , and least where lives can still be transformed ?
Early years matter most , the younger the better for children at risk of failing .
Primary schooling is already remedial , but can still change lives .
Secondary schooling is mostly already too late , while university adds least to life chances .
So why do we spend 50 % more a head on undergraduates than on primary schoolers , and even less on under - 5s ?
Good reordering would radically reduce the inexplicable cost of university degrees ; make most courses two intensive years somewhere close to home , wasting no more on hotel costs for two - bedroom students .
( Research money and MAs for top brains come from a different budget already ) .
Channel university savings into intensive one - to - one help for the youngest : once every seven - year - old can read , write and add up , the rest of education is easy .
Everything else becomes cheaper too , since prisons and social services are peopled with the illiterate and helpless .
That 's what clever cuts might look like – creative , productive , purposeful .
But do n't hold your breath .
Great headline - grabbing axes do n't do wise and thoughtful .

Report : One - Third of People Killed in Pakistan Drone Strikes Are Civilians
Created : October 19 , 2009 15:44 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
The New America Foundation ’s Peter Bergen and Katherine Tiedemann have a new report out tallying how many civilians have died in the Pakistani tribal areas thanks to the CIA ’s drone strikes .
Their conclusion : the strikes have killed , since 2006 , between 750 and 1000 people ; 20 of them have been “ leaders of al Qaeda , the Taliban , and allied groups ” ; and “ the real total of civilian deaths since 2006 appears to be in the range of 250 to 320 , or between 31 and 33 percent . ”
That low ?
Bergen and Tiedemann got their report by tallying up media reports on the drone strikes .
They explain :
Our analysis of the drone campaign is based only on accounts from reliable media organizations with substantial reporting capabilities in Pakistan .
We restricted our analysis to reports in the New York Times , Washington Post , and Wall Street Journal , accounts by major news services and networks –the Associated Press , Reuters , Agence France - Presse , CNN , and the BBC–and reports in the leading English - language newspapers in Pakistan– The Daily Times , Dawn , and The News–as well as those from Geo TV , the largest independent Pakistani television network .
( Links to all those individual reports can be found in Appendix 1 of this paper . )
They do n’t pretend their material is “ accurate down to the last civilian death in every drone strike . ”
And they ’re probably right that this is the best that can be compiled through open - source material .
( I would go so far as to suggest that the CIA probably does n’t have much better methodology , either . )
But how to account for the variance in what a “ militant ” is ?
A lot of times , the way these press reports generate their descriptions of “ militants ” are through phone calls made from stringers to people in the vicinity of a strike .
“ [ O ] f those killed in drone attacks from 2006 through mid-October 2009 , between 500 and 700 were described in reliable press reports as militants , or some 66 to 68 percent , ” the authors write .
Not the most precise measurement .
After all , who ’s a “ militant ” ?
A cook in a village known to be swarming with Taliban ?
Someone who pays taxes to a shadow government ?
How do we judge the complicity of a given population ?
There ’s a spectrum here , running from insurgent to civilian effectively held hostage .
As a result , it ’s probably fair and sensible to read Bergen and Tiedemann ’s report as a * low * estimate for civilian deaths from the drones .
I asked the CIA about the report , even though it typically does n’t comment on anything Pakistan - drone - related .
To my surprise , agency spokesman George Little responded , “ The CIA employs lawful , highly precise , battle - tested tactics and tools against al - Qaeda and its violent allies .
Al - Qaeda and its sympathizers , though still very dangerous and determined , have seen both their leadership and their fighting capabilities eroded . ”
So nothing specifically on the New America report one way or the other — I ca n’t tell if that quote supports it or undermines it , truth be told .
Update : I mistakenly called Katherine Tiedemann “ Kathleen ” in an earlier draft of this post and for that I beg forgiveness .

Dilbert says , " When you mention a person 's ears , he wo n't listen to the rest of your argument . "
For the last several months , Mike and I have been working on a new project , which is nearing closed beta .
That means we need to start battening down the hatches , and today was the day to start tackling client - side JavaScript performance .
I ’ve actually done quite a bit of performance work in my life , but not with JavaScript , so I though I ’d take some notes along the way .
Firebug is your friend
In my mind , there are really three ways to a significant dent in performance :
Find bad algorithms and replace them with fast ones
Find code that does n’t actually have to be called and skip it .
Optimize the code that gets called most often
And you really can’t do any of the three without a profiler .
You might think you know what the problem is , but you wo n’t know until you profile it .
In my case , I started out thinking that I had event listeners hanging around that were n’t letting go of their events , but the profiler ( in this case , Firebug ) told me I was completely wrong .
To get started profiling in Firebug , go to the console tab , press the ‘ profile ’ button , do some stuff , and hit the ‘ profile ’ button again .
That ’s it .
You ’ll then be presented with data that looks like this :
For my money , the two most important columns are ‘ own time ’ and ‘ time ’.
‘ time ’ is the total time spent in a function including any functions that are called by that function , and ‘ own time ’ is the same thing minus the time taken up by other functions .
Problem : $ $ (‘.class ’ ) can be SLOW !
I created a test where I did the same UI gesture 8 times , and this is what I discovered .
Looking at ‘ own time ’ told me that most of my time was going to DOM traversal via the $ $ function .
Looking at ‘ time ’ told me that the methods responsible for calling $ $ were all central functions that were called in many places throughout my code , so it was worth making them as efficient as possible before figuring out whether there was a way to avoid calling some of them altogether .
Phase 1 — replacing traversals of the entire DOM tree ( via $ $ ) with smaller traversals
Roughly speaking , this corresponds to strategy ( 3 ) .
What total time % delta
from prev %delta
from base Baseline 2812ms — — Replace $ $(‘.class ’ ) by $ ( ‘ section ’) .getElements (‘.class ’) in critical sections 2345ms 20 % 20 % Chage getElements (‘.class ’ ) to getElements ( ‘ div.class ’ ) in critical sections 2094ms 12 % 34 % Found more places to do the above optimizations 1723ms 22 % 63 % Replaced getElements ( ) with getChildren ( ) where possible 1641ms 5 % 71 %
Along the way , I tried all sorts of other optimizations , but none of them yielded much benefit .
Now that I was reaching the point of diminishing returns , it was time to see if there were chunks of code I could safely skip .
Phase 2 — skipping handler functions when possible
I knew that there was almost certainly code I was running that could be skipped ( strategy 2 ) .
Why ?
I find that when writing UI code , it is often easier to use brute force to make sure that everything is working consistently .
For example , if an AJAX call updates a certain part of the screen , it is often easier to blow away all event handlers from everything and re-add them where needed , rather than just patching up event handlers for the portion of the screen that was updating .
My rationale is that you can always fix this at the end .
And well , it was now time to pay the piper .
My test case involved doing the same UI gesture 8 times .
And most of the time was going to the following functions :
add_panel_handlers_if_needed ( ) : 8 times
add_content_handlers ( ) : 16 times
add_panel_handlers ( ) : 8 times
actually_do_drag_cleanup( ) : 8 times
remove_content_handlers ( ) : 24 times
fix_detail_handlers ( ) : 8 times
handle_click ( ) : 8 times
fix_toggle_rte_handlers ( ) : 8 times
add_drag_handlers_and_start( ) : 8 times
add_insert_handlers ( ) : 8 times
You can see that some functions are being called 8 times and some were being called 24 times .
As it turns out , this was just due to programmer laziness .
By adding a few checks , some of those redundant calls could be safely avoided .
The other thing that was causing extra work is that only certain interactions caused screen updates that needed event handlers to be reattached .
By writing some code to check for that , I was able to avoid many of these calls altogether .
What total time % delta
from prev %delta
from base Baseline 2812ms — —
End of phase 1 1641ms 71 % 71 % Remove redundant calls to remove_content_handlers and add_content_handlers 1389ms 18 % 102 % Skip certain fixup calls when content is determined not to have changed 1073ms 29 % 162 %
( P.S. there is some small part of my brain that tells me that instead of manually worrying about these event handlers , I should just bite the bullet and switch to JQuery .
But I ’m not there yet . )
Summary
So , what ’s the moral ?
First off , doing $ $ (‘.class ’ ) is slow .
Second , large performance boosts usually come from a combination of skipping code that does n’t have to run and optimizing the code that does .
This was no exception .
One more thing .
I just have to say that Firebug is amazing .
I expected it to have trouble giving useful timings in the face of inconsistent UI gestures and garbage collection , but it did the “ right thing ” , which many desktop profilers do n’t manage to do .
If I had one wish , I wish I could get it to bundle up calls from specified library files and allocate the time spent in them to the calling function .
Ok .
Back to more optimizing .

No one knows more about the many and varied ski areas in this region than Jeremy Davis .
He 's skied all 85 of them .
A decade ago he set up the New England Lost Ski Areas Project and so far he 's recorded the histories of 625 community ski areas that are now closed .
But Davis is convinced that the pendulum is swinging away from the big , homogenous resorts , back to the raw skiing experience of the remaining smaller areas , not least because they are so affordable .
The hope – and signs – are there .
This may well be the year of the Nobel for two Toronto scientists , whose work began on a Sunday afternoon in 1960 when Ernest McCulloch peered down in surprise at a newly dissected mouse .
There were lumps on its spleen , clumps of cells that had formed in the 10 days since the mouse had been injected with blood - forming bone marrow .
McCulloch – and his partner James
Till – saw promise in these strange nodules embedded in the slick , tiny organ .
And so the pair embarked on a set of remarkable and rigorous experiments that proved the existence of stem cells – a feat that now , almost half a century later , may finally garner them the coveted Nobel Prize in Medicine on Monday .
No one outside the Nobel committee knows who will get the early morning phone call from Sweden .
But there 's a buzz in the medical community that Till and McCulloch will be the first Canadians to win the Nobel for medicine since Frederick Banting and J.R.R. Macleod .
They took home the prize in 1923 for their discovery of insulin .
Top scientists have lobbied on their behalf .
The prize can't be awarded posthumously , and for the pair – McCulloch is 83 and Till is 78 – time is running out .
They have taken home every other major medical prize , including the 2005 Lasker Award , which is said to predict who will capture a Nobel .
And there is the almost universal agreement that Till and McCulloch , known as the fathers of stem cell science , are long overdue to win the world 's top scientific prize .
" Without question , they are very deserving of a Nobel Prize , " says Alan Bernstein , an internationally renowned scientist who heads the Global HIV Vaccine Initiative in New York .
" What 's unequivocal is that it was Till and McCulloch who discovered stem cells . "
The impact of Till and McCulloch 's groundbreaking discovery continues to permeate the field .
Scientists around the world still use the terminology and principles they defined while toiling in their labs at the old Ontario Cancer Institute ( now the research arm of Princess Margaret Hospital ) .
" They laid out the path for stem cell research for the next 50 years , " says Michael Rudnicki , scientific director of the Stem Cell Network .
" There is no question , to use an old cliché , that we stand on the heads and shoulders of those who went before us .
And all of what we do today in stem cell research can be traced back to these two scientists . "
Ironically , says Robert Phillips , deputy director of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research , the pair 's long wait for Nobel recognition is likely due to the fact their work was so far ahead of the field .
Until the technological advances of the 1980s illuminated the critical importance of stem cells , there was no yardstick by which to judge Till and McCulloch 's seminal research , he says .
And yet , he adds , the pair had laid down , right from the beginning , the properties that stem cells must possess .
Stem cells have the potential to develop into all cell types , including skin cells , heart cells and blood cells , and are capable of renewing themselves .
With their regenerative capabilities , they offer new ways to treat diseases , from diabetes to heart disease .
Till and McCulloch 's work in the 1960s also laid the foundation for bone marrow transplantation for cancer patients .
The pair provided a stem cell mechanism for the success of marrow transplants in replenishing the blood .
They also devised precise measurement and quantification criteria for the entire research area .
" Without their work , we would never have had bone marrow transplants , " says Rudnicki .
" We might have muddled our way through it ... but their work provided the theoretical underpinnings for bone marrow transplant as a therapy , which has been in the clinic now for 40 years and has saved countless lives . "
Born on a prairie farm in Saskatchewan and trained as a biophysicist at Yale , Till was recruited to the Ontario Cancer Institute ( OCI ) when it launched in 1957 .
McCulloch , whom friends still refer to by his childhood nickname of ` Bun , ' received his medical degree from the University of Toronto .
He , too , joined OCI in 1957 , and set out to find the function of bone marrow .

At the time , the marriage of biology and physics seemed a strange mix .
But under the inspired leadership of physicist Harold Johns and biologist Arthur Ham , the cross-pollination of the two disciplines became the signature research strategy of the newly formed OCI .
Bernstein , who trained as a post - doctoral fellow under Till , and who knows McCulloch well , says the two are considered a scientific odd couple .
" As a student watching this , it was fascinating because you could n't imagine two human beings who were so different as Jim and Bun , " says Bernstein .
Till , he says , projected his prairie outlook on life – that you work hard and do n't try to grab attention .
McCulloch , who grew up in a sophisticated , intellectual environment , was a clinician at heart who wanted to cure disease , and was unafraid of bold claims .
" The two of them were very different in personality and background , and I think that was a perfect marriage , " Bernstein says .
" They had huge admiration for each other 's strengths . "
" I think Jim and Bun knew , from the beginning , that the other guy was absolutely key to what the other was doing , " he says .
" It was a mutually respectful relationship .
It was a model for us students to watch . "
Till and McCulloch left a living legacy in the students they mentored and in the scientists they recruited to the city .
Dr. Gordon Keller , head of Toronto 's McEwen Centre for Regenerative Medicine , says Till and McCulloch quickly became ruling planets in the rapidly expanding universe of stem cell research , drawing a constellation of young and talented researchers into their orbit and this city .
" When you have such influential and powerful science going on in a centre it typically draws in some of the best trainees , " says Keller .
Even today , almost 50 years since their partnership , most of the city 's top stem cell scientists can trace their academic lineages directly back to Till and McCulloch , he says .
Indeed , Keller 's post - doctoral studies at the University of Toronto were conducted under Phillips , who came from the U.S. to train under Till .
Like Bernstein , Rudnicki says Till and McCulloch are undoubtedly deserving of a Nobel Prize .
" Because of them , today , stem cell research is an area of true strategic strength in Canada , as measured by many metrics , including publications and patents , " he says .
" This is an area where Canada has a deep and broad strength .
We 're among the best in the world in this area – if not the best .
Without question . "
GHC status October 2009
We are just about to make our annual major release , of GHC 6.12.1 ( in the following we will say " GHC 6.12 " to refer to GHC 6.12.1 and future patch - level releases along the 6.12 branch ) .
GHC continues to be very active , with many opportunities for others to get involved .
We are particularly eager to find partners who are willing to take responsibility for a particular platform ( e.g. Sparc / Solaris , currently maintained by Ben Lippmeier ) ; see Platforms .
The GHC 6.12 release
We usually try to make a major release of GHC immediately after ICFP .
It has been somewhat delayed this year , but we expect to release GHC 6.12 during November or December 2009 .
Apart from the myriad of new bug fixes and minor enhancements , the big new things in 6.12 are :
Considerably improved support for parallel execution .
GHC 6.10 would execute parallel Haskell programs , but performance was often not very good .
Simon Marlow has done lots of performance tuning in 6.12 , removing many of the accidental ( and largely invisible ) gotchas that made parallel programs run slowly .
As part of this parallel - performance tuning , Satnam Singh and Simon Marlow have developed ThreadScope , a GUI that lets you see what is going on inside your parallel program .
It 's a huge step forward from " It takes 4 seconds with 1 processor , and 3 seconds with 8 processors ; now what ? " .
ThreadScope will be released separately from GHC , but at more or less the same time as GHC 6.12 .
Dynamic linking is now supported on Linux , and support for other platforms will follow .
Thanks for this most recently go to the Industrial Haskell Group ( thank you [ IHG ] ! ) who pushed it into a fully - working state ; dynamic linking is the culmination of the work of several people over recent years .
One effect of dynamic linking is that binaries shrink dramatically , because the run-time system and libraries are shared .
Perhaps more importantly , it is possible to make dynamic plugins from Haskell code that can be used from other applications .
The I/O libraries are now Unicode - aware , so your Haskell programs should now handle text files containing non-ascii characters , without special effort .
The package system has been made more robust , by associating each installed package with a unique identifier based on its exposed ABI .
Now , cases where the user re-installs a package without recompiling packages that depend on it will be detected , and the packages with broken dependencies will be disabled .
Previously , this would lead to obscure compilation errors , or worse , segfaulting programs .
This change involved a lot of internal restructuring , but it paves the way for future improvements to the way packages are handled .
For instance , in the future we expect to track profiled packages independently of non-profiled ones , and we hope to make it possible to upgrade a package in an ABI - compatible way , without recompiling the packages that depend on it .
This latter facility will be especially important as we move towards using more shared libraries .
There are a variety of small language changes , including Some improvements to data types : record punning , declaring constructors with class constraints , GADT syntax for type families etc .
You can omit the " $ " in a top - level Template Haskell splice , which makes the TH call look more like an ordinary top - level declaration with a new keyword .
We 're are deprecating mdo for recursive do - notation , in favour of the more expressive rec statement .
We 've concluded that the implementation of impredicative polymorphism is unsustainably complicated , so we are re-trenching .
It 'll be deprecated in 6.12 ( but will still work ) , and will be either removed or replaced with something simpler in 6.14 .
For more detail , see the release notes in the 6.12 User manual [ UserManual ] , which mention many things skipped over here .
Internally , GHC 6.12 has a totally re-engineered build system , with much - improved dependency tracking Building .
While there have been lots of teething problems , things are settling down and the new system is a huge improvement over the old one .
The main improvement is that you can usually just say make , and everything will be brought up to date ( before it was often necessary to make clean first ) .
Another improvement is that the new system exposes much more parallelism in the build , so GHC builds faster on multicores .
GHC and the Haskell platform
Another big change with GHC 6.12 is that Hackage and the Haskell Platform is allowing GHC HQ to get out of the libraries business .
So the plan is
We release GHC 6.12 with very few libraries
Bill Library Author downloads GHC 6.12 and tests his libraries
The next Haskell Platform release packages GHC 6.12 with these tested libraries
Joe User downloads the Haskell Platform .
Four months later there 's a new HP release , still with GHC 6.12 , but with more or better libraries .
The HP release cycle is decoupled from GHC
So if you are Joe User , you want to wait for the HP release .
Do n't grab the GHC 6.12 release .
It 'll be perfectly usable , but only if you use ( an up to date ) cabal - install to download libraries , and accept that they may not be tested with GHC 6.12 .
What 's hot for the next year
GHC continues to be a great substrate for research .
Here are the main things we are working on at the moment .
Type systems
Type families have proved a great success .
From the outside it might seem that they are done -- after all , they are in GHC 6.10 -- but the internals are quite fragile and it's amazing that it all works as well as it does .
( Thanks to Manuel 's work . )
Tom Schrijver , Dimitrios Vytiniotis , Martin Sulzmann , and Manuel Chakravarty have been working with Simon PJ to understand the fundamentals and , in the light of that insight , to re-engineer the implementation into something more robust .
We have developed the " OutsideIn " algorithm , which gives a much nicer account of type inference than our previous story of type inference .
The new approach is described in Complete and Decidable Type Inference for GADTs [ ICFP09a ] .
More controversially , we now believe that local let / where bindings should not be generalised -- see Let should not be generalised [ LetGen ] .
Dimitrios is building a prototype that embodies these ideas , which we 'll then transfer into GHC .
Meanwhile , Dimitrios , Simon , and Stephanie Weirich are also working on fixing one of GHC 's more embarrassing bugs ( Trac # 1496 ( closed ) ) , whereby an interaction of type families and the newtype - deriving can persuade GHC to generate type - unsound code .
It 's remained un - fixed because the obvious approaches seem to be hacks , so the cure was as bad as the disease .
We think we are on to something ; stay tuned .
Intermediate language and optimisation
Although it is , by design , invisible to users , GHC 's intermediate language and optimisation passes have been receiving quite a bit of attention .
Some highlights
Read Max Bolingbroke 's paper on Strict Core [ MaxB ] , a possible new intermediate language for GHC .
Adopting Strict Core would be a Big Change , however , and we have not decided to do so ( yet ) .
Simon PJ totally re-engineered the way that INLINE pragmas are implemented , with the goal of making them more robust and predictable [ http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/cvs-ghc/2009-October/050881.html !InlinePatch ] ( http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/cvs-ghc/2009-October/050881.html ! InlinePatch ) .
There 's a new CONLIKE pragma which affects rule matching .
Peter Jonsson did an internship in which he made a start on turning GHC into a supercompiler .
Neil Mitchell 's terrific PhD thesis suggested that supercompliation works well for Haskell [! NeilM ] , and Peter has been working on supercompilation for Timber as part of his own PhD [! PeterJ ] .
The GHC version is n't ready for prime time yet , but Simon PJ ( now educated by Peter and Neil ) is keen to pursue it .
An internal change in GHC 6.12 is the addition of " annotations " , a general - purpose way for a programmer to add annotations to top - level definitions that can be consulted by a core - to - core pass , and for a core - to - core pass to pass information to its successors Annotations .
We expect to use these annotations increasingly in GHC itself .
Parallelism
Most of the changes in this area in GHC 6.12.1 were described in our ICFP '09 paper Runtime Support for Multicore Haskell [ ICFP09b ] .
The highlights :
Load - balancing of sparks is now based on lock - free work - stealing queues .
The overhead for running a spark is significantly less , so GHC can take advantage of finer - grained parallelism
The parallel GC is now much more locality - aware .
We now do parallel GC in young - generation collections by default , mainly to avoid destroying locality by moving data out of the CPU cache on which it is needed .
Young - generation collections are parallel but not load - balanced .
There are new RTS flags to control parallel GC behaviour .
Various other minor performance tweaks .
In the future we plan to focus on the GC , with the main goal being to implement independent per-CPU collection .
The other area we plan to look at is changing the GC policy for sparks , as described in our ICFP '09 paper ; this will need a corresponding change to the Strategies library to avoid relying on the current " sparks are roots " GC policy , which causes difficulties for writing parallel code that exploits speculation .
Data Parallelism
Data Parallel
Haskell has seen few user - visible changes since the last report .
Nevertheless , Roman Leshchinskiy has been busy improving many of the fundamental building blocks behind the scenes .
These changes were necessary as DPH was able to generate very fast parallel code for simple examples , but the optimisation infrastructure was too fragile — i.e. , small changes to other parts of GHC ( most notably , the Simplifier ) or to the DPH libraries could lead to dramatic performance regressions .
Over the last few months , Roman has been working on making the system more robust , while Simon PJ improved and extended parts of GHC 's existing optimisation infrastructure ( such as the Inliner and other aspects of the Simplifier ) to support Roman 's efforts .
As a first consequence of this recent work , the divide - and - conquer quickhull benchmark ( computing a convex hull ) is now significantly faster than the corresponding list - based implementation [ http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/quickhull/QuickHullVect.hs QuickHull ] ( http://darcs.haskell.org/packages/dph/examples/quickhull/QuickHullVect.hs QuickHull ) .
This is an important milestone as quickhull uses dynamically nested parallelism whose depth is not statically bound .
Gabriele Keller implemented a first prototype of a new library API for regular multi-dimensional arrays to complement the existing irregular , nested arrays .
For regular computations on dense matrices , relaxation methods and similar , regular arrays ( as opposed to nested arrays ) are more convenient and expose additional opportunities for optimisation .
Gabriele obtained very encouraging first results with a sequential version that uses a new fusion technique , which we are calling delayed arrays [ http://www.scribd.com/doc/22091707/Delayed-Regular-Arrays-Sep09 RegLibBench ] ( http://www.scribd.com/doc/22091707/Delayed-Regular-Arrays-Sep09 RegLibBench ) .
In parallel with the implementation of regular , multi-dimensional arrays as part of DPH , Sean Lee and Manuel Chakravarty are implementing almost the same regular - array API as an EDSL in Data .
Array .
Accelerate .
The EDSL implementation restricts the expressiveness of the array language , but at the same time enables us to experiment with more ambitious backends — especially with GPU code generation via CUDA and related technologies .
More details are in the video of Manuel 's talk from the Haskell Implementors Workshop in Edinburgh [ http://justtesting.posterous.com/running-haskell-array-computations-on-a-gpu AccelerateTalk ] ( http://justtesting.posterous.com/running-haskell-array-computations-on-a-gpu AccelerateTalk ) .
Code generation
For the last two years we have been advertising a major upheaval in GHC 's back end .
Currently a monolithic " code generator " converts lambda code ( the STG language ) into flat C-- ; " flat " in the sense that the stack is manifested , and there are no function calls .
The upheaval splits this in to a pipeline of passes , with a relatively - simple conversion of lambda code into C-- ( with function calls ) , followed by a succession of passes that optimise this code , and flatten it ( by manifesting the stack and removing calls ) .
John Dias is the principal architect of this new path , and it is in GHC already ; you can switch it on by saying - fnew - codegen .
What remains is ( a ) to make it work 100 % ( currently 99 % , which is not good enough ) ; ( b ) commit to it , which will allow us to remove gargantuan quantities of cruft ; ( c ) exploit it , by implementing cool new optimisations at the C -- level ; ( d ) take it further by integrating the native code generators into the same pipeline .
You can read more on the wiki CodeGen .
Several passes of the new code generation pipeline are supported by Hoopl , a Haskell library that makes it easy to write dataflow analyses and optimisations over C -- code [ http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/c--
Hoopl ] ( http://research.microsoft.com/~simonpj/papers/c--
Hoopl ) .
We think Hoopl is pretty cool , and have well - advanced ideas for how to improve it a lot more .
All of this has taken longer than we hoped .
Once the new pipeline is in place we hope that others will join in .
For example , David Terei did an interesting undergraduate project on using LLVM as a back end for GHC [ Terei ] , and Krzysztof Wos is just beginning an undergraduate project on optimisation in the new pipeline .
We are particularly grateful to Ben Lippmeier for his work on the SPARC native code generator .

H ow will history regard Stephen Harper ?
My guess is that he 'll be seen as a prime minister who transformed Canada 's view of itself .
Not necessarily through concrete reforms .
While Harper 's Conservative minority government has made important legislative changes , such as slashing corporate taxes , many of these were continuations of schemes started by previous Liberal regimes .
Rather , Harper 's major accomplishment has been to redefine the terms of political debate .
This unlikely figure ( among Canadian prime ministers , only Mackenzie King had less charisma ) has made conservatism and conservative causes respectable .
Ten years ago , Canada was a country that prided itself on pacifism , deference to law and its status in the world as a middle power .
It did not matter that these characteristics were often more mythic than real .
That 's how we saw ourselves .
We were the peaceable kingdom , the honest broker .
Today , Canada is a nation proudly at war , headed by a government that not only disregards laws ( its persistent refusal to enforce gun registration being the most obvious example ) but actively takes on the courts – most recently in its decision to limit the discretion of judges in sentencing .
In international affairs , we no longer even pretend to speak with an independent voice but instead openly and fully ally ourselves with the U.S. on virtually every front – from unequivocal support for Israel to unequivocal opposition to Iran .
Indeed , at times , Harper seems more in tune with the elemental thrust of American foreign policy than U.S. President Barack Obama .
Obama went through a brief period of attempted even - handedness in the Middle East , before returning to the pro-Israeli position of his predecessor George W. Bush .
The current president 's initial and markedly un-Bushian overtures to Iran promise to follow the same route .
Harper , by contrast , has n't bothered with the detours .
Perhaps nothing exemplifies the death of the middle power period more than Harper 's recent trip to India .
Ten years ago , Canada was an ardent advocate of nuclear disarmament and an equally ardent supporter of international rules aimed at isolating nations , like India , that did n't play along .
Ottawa also had to live down the embarrassing fact that in 1974 India used Canadian technology to secretly and illegally construct its first nuclear bomb .
Then , last year , Canada joined the U.S. to quietly change the rules governing nuclear exports to India .
In his trip to New Delhi this week , Harper spent much time trying to sell the Indians both Canadian uranium and Canadian nuclear technology .
" We are not living in the 1970s , " he said there by way of explanation .
" We are living in 2009 . "
It 's perhaps telling that this about - face on what had been a key Canadian foreign policy plank earned the prime minister virtually no criticism from the public , opposition parties or media .
But Harper 's key success in the ideological remoulding of Canada has been his ability to change the country 's perception of soldiering .
While it was former prime minister Paul Martin who first authorized Canada 's deadly military involvement in Kandahar , his then Liberal government tended to downplay the conflict .
Not so Harper .
Aided by former top general Rick Hillier , as well as the agreeably acquiescent media , he has pounded the drums of military nationalism , reminding Canadians of their proud traditions in war .
At the same time , he has drawn on one of the country 's most enduring mythic beliefs – that of Canada as northern giant – to win support for military spending technically aimed at defending Canada 's Arctic sovereignty .
It matters little that Ottawa is eagerly co-operating with the U.S. , the one Arctic country that actually threatens Canada 's sovereignty claims ( the two nations dispute both ownership of the Northwest Passage and key undersea oil reserves ) .
Nor does it matter that Harper 's real interest in the Arctic appears to lie in its gas and mineral reserves .
What matters is that he has been able to successfully tap Canada 's romantic view of itself .
To credit Harper with single - handedly inventing a new Canadian sensibility would be to exaggerate .
This is a country of contradictory and often internally inconsistent views .
We are both warlike and peaceable , deferential to authority but also suspicious .
We both love and hate the U.S. , marrying resentment with envy and genuine affection with anger at being ignored .
For years , small l liberals – in both the Liberal and Conservative parties – played to one half of this complex mood .
Liberal Canada was a country that , theoretically at least , prided itself on sharing and caring , tolerance and diversity .
Its patriotism was muted but real .
Jingos were frowned upon .
Given the realities of the post - war period , this self - image fit .
For a while , Canada was truly a middle power , explaining the U.S. to the rest of the world and the rest of the world to America .
At times of stress – such as the Korean War – it was always clear whose side we'd be on .
But in most years , push rarely came to shove .
Canada could and did avoid both the Vietnam War and the Washington - dominated Organization of American States .
We were less obsessed by Communism than the U.S. and thus more nuanced in our approach to Cuba , China and the old Soviet Union .
We relished our image as a peacemaker and , in the ongoing disputes between Israel and the Palestinians , cleaved to middle - of - the - road positions staked out by the United Nations .
Even before the end of the Cold War , that middle power role was beginning to erode ( former prime minister Pierre Trudeau 's fruitless 1984 peace mission across eastern Europe marked the end of the honest broker period ) .
By the early '90s , North American free trade arrangements had made Canada 's economic dependence on the U.S. more visible and direct – which is why Ottawa , even under Liberal governments , began to hew more closely to Washington 's line .
Under Brian Mulroney 's Conservatives , we joined the OAS .
Under Martin's Liberals , we aligned ourselves more closely with the U.S. position on Israel .
Similarly , it was a Liberal government that implemented the new conservative domestic agenda – lowering taxes on the wealthy , privatizing crown corporations , cutting social services to the poor , eliminating health and safety rules .
But as the Liberals moved farther to the right , they always exuded a slight sense of embarrassment .
Rhetorically , the party insisted it had n't changed even when the evidence showed otherwise
With Harper , there is less confusion .
While he is not uniquely responsible for all the changes in Canadian political life , he articulates them better than his political opponents .
He is mining the Canadian psyche to create a new language of politics .
The old language emphasized fairness in foreign affairs ( do n't take sides in the Middle East ) , independence ( do n't always agree with the U.S. ) and tolerance ( make adjustments for immigrants ) .
The new language emphasizes morality in foreign affairs ( side with Israel ) ; loyalty ( always agree with the U.S. ) and responsibility ( immigrants should adjust to us ) .
Earlier this week , my colleague Chantal Hebert noted in passing that Canadians should n't doubt Harper 's capacity to bring about transformative change .
Given that language is important , she was quite right .
Thomas Walkom 's column appears Wednesday and Saturday .
An article by Chelsea Shilling on October 21 , 2009 outlines legislation in Tennessee and the reasons all 49 other States should assert State sovereignty .
State launches boycott of ‘ unconstitutional ’ federal laws
Tennessee is urging 49 other states to come together and create a “ joint working group between the states ” to combat unconstitutional federal legislation and assert state rights .
Tennessee Gov. Phil Bredesen signed HJR 108 , the State Sovereignty Resolution on June 23 .
According to the Tenth Amendment Center , the resolution created a committee to form a joint working group between the states to enumerate the abuses of authority by the federal government and seek repeal of imposed mandates .
State Rep. Susan Lynn recently wrote a letter to the other 49 state legislatures , inviting them to join the group and warning that the role of the federal government has been “ blurred , bent and breached . ”
“ The national government has become a complex system of programs whose purposes lie outside of the responsibilities of the enumerated powers and of securing our natural rights ; programs that benefit some while others must pay , ” Lynn wrote .
“ Today , the federal government seeks to control the salaries of those employed by private business , to change the provisions of private of contracts , to nationalize banks , insurers and auto manufacturers , and to dictate to every person in the land what his or her medical choices will be . ”
She continued , “ Forcing property from employers to provide healthcare , legislating what individuals are and are not entitled to , and using the labor of some so that others can receive money that they did not earn goes far beyond securing natural rights , and the enumerated powers in the Constitution . ”
Lynn said that the people created the federal government to be their agent only for certain enumerated purposes .
“ The Tenth Amendment defines the total scope of federal power as being that which has been delegated by the people to the federal government , and also that which is absolutely necessary to advancing those powers specifically enumerated in the Constitution of the United States , ” she wrote .
“ The rest is to be handled by the state governments , or locally , by the people themselves . ”
She noted that the Constitution does not include a congressional power to override state laws , nor does it give the judicial branch unlimited jurisdiction over all matters .
Attempts to include such provisions in the Constitution were rejected by the Founding Fathers .
“ With this in mind , ” she wrote , “ any federal attempt to legislate beyond the Constitutional limits of Congress ’ authority is a usurpation of state sovereignty – and unconstitutional .
Governments and political leaders are best held accountable to the will of the people when government is local .
The people of a state know what is best for them ; authorities , potentially thousands of miles away , governing their lives is opposed to the very notion of freedom . ”
In one example of Tennessee ’s battle against federal government policies , federal gun regulators wrote to gun dealers around Tennessee in July , dropping the hammer on a state law that exempts weapons made , sold and used inside the state from interstate regulations .
The letter was distributed to holders of Federal Firearms Licenses .
In it , Carson W. Carroll , the assistant director of the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives , told dealers the Tennessee Firearms Freedom Act , adopted this year , “ purports to exempt personal firearms , firearms accessories , and ammunition manufactured in the state , and which remain in the state , from most federal firearms laws and regulations . ”
The exemption is not right , the federal agency letter contends .
More recently , the state of Montana filed a lawsuit against U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder seeking a court order that the federal government stay out of the way of Montana ’s management of its own firearms .
As WND reported , the action was filed by the Second Amendment Foundation and the Montana Shooting Sports Association in U.S. District Court in Missoula , Mont. , to validate the principles and terms of the Montana Firearms Freedom Act , which took effect Oct. 3 .
The law provides guns and ammo made , sold and used in Montana would not require any federal forms ; silencers made and sold in Montana would be fully legal and not registered ; and there would be no firearm registration , serial numbers , criminal records check , waiting periods or paperwork required .
The idea is spreading quickly .
Similar plans have been introduced in many other states .
( Story continues here )
End note :
If federal abuses continue , will there be another “ line in the sand ” drawn in the fashion of the Mason - Dixon line separating the states claiming sovereignty against the federal government ?
It 's hard to believe there are this many people in America this ignorant , and so proud to be so .
Exhibit A is their utterly predictable reaction when someone tells them , straight up , " You voted for George W. Bush twice , you fucked up our country , you can't have it back . "
There are no two single acts in the average American 's engagement in politics more responsible for the current state of our country than the act of voting for George W. Bush , twice .
Try naming two bigger things the average American could have done to create the mess that Barack Obama has to clean up .
Try it .
You can't .
Here 's how that conversation went whenever we began it yesterday with the Palin morons .
After the initial shock that someone might actually call Republicans on this , the litany begins .
All totally predictable , the same every single time , WITHOUT VARIATION , delivered with increasing agitation to the point of twitching rage .
First Utterly Predictable Spew of Horseshit - DID YOU EVER SERVE IN VIETNAM ?
Hey , stupid .
I was in elementary school when we pulled out of Vietnam , you dumbfuck .
In fact , half the electorate doesn ' teven remember Vietnam , which is a major reason Barack Obama got elected .
So shove it up your ass , go wipe your tears with your American flag , ca n't you even count ?
Second Utterly Predictable Spew of Horseshit - IT 'S THE DEMOCRATS ' FAULT !
George W. Bush took a $ 6 trillion surplus and turned it into debt as far as the eye can see with a Republican Congress .
Then , George W. Bush gave us two unfunded wars , one of his choosing , the other of necessity , both of which he fucked up so bad not even Barack Obama may be able to fix the necessary one .
Then , he drove the entire economic system to total collapse , like Herbert Hoover on crack , right before he handed it off .
You voted twice for that , you stupid mother fucking dumbass fucktard .
Twice .
Third Utterly Predictable Spew of Horseshit - BILL CLINTON GOT HIS DICK SUCKED !
As always , it inevitably turns to a discussion of genitalia , because Republicans are the most sex - obsessed dipshits in all of political discourse .
This is also about the time the twitching begins , largely because of the mention of Bill Clinton 's name .
Fourth Utterly Predictable Spew of Horseshit - LOOK IN THE MIRROR , YOU FUCKED UP THE COUNTRY , NOT ME !
This is what a child sounds like when you catch them spraying their own urine all over the kitchen floor because it 's funny .
Like children , Republicans who voted for George W. Bush , TWICE , still think it 's funny that they did this .
Ha fucking ha .
It 's not funny .
You fucked up our country , you god damned fucking idiots .
And you can not have it back .
And until you accept responsibility for your actions , you wo n't get it back .
So pick up a mop , start cleaning up the mess you created , or eat me .
“ The Kraft Group fully supports the state ’s long - term economic growth initiatives and is proud to have already created thousands of jobs while privately investing nearly a billion dollars in the development of Gillette Stadium and Patriot Place in Foxborough , ’’ Kraft Group spokesman Stacey James said in a prepared statement .
The use of the money in Foxborough follows a massive private investment by the Krafts , who privately financed a state - of - the - art , $ 325 million football stadium that opened in 2002 , then built a sprawling commercial development next door several years later .
Patrick officials announced earlier this year that they will use some stimulus money to help jump - start private projects .
They say the bridge , which includes elevators on either side of the street , is key to spurring economic development and jobs along Route 1 in Foxborough .
The Kraft Group will be responsible for maintaining it .
In the meantime , Draisen said the administration has not adequately addressed several basic public policy questions about the project , including why the Kraft Group , owners of the Patriots and the Patriot Place mega - development that abuts the stadium , are not paying for it themselves .
Draisen , who also has a seat on the regional planning board , voted against the latest round of stimulus projects on Oct. 29 because of his concerns about the process .
The bridge is now under a public review period before it comes back to the planning board for final approval , most likely on Nov. 18 .
“ Is this the best use of very , very limited stimulus money for transportation , a pedestrian bridge that basically goes between two parking lots ? ’’ said Marc Draisen , director of the Metropolitan Area Planning Council , one of the planning agencies that would normally review such a project .
“ At this point , I do n’t feel we have enough information about this project . ’’
The bridge was included on a slate of projects , prepared by the administration , that was approved late last month by a regional planning board that determines how to spend federal transportation money in the Boston area .
Most transportation projects reviewed for federal funding are evaluated by two sets of professional planners before such votes , but the bridge and some other stimulus projects on the recently approved slate received no such review .
State officials decided to bypass a host of projects across the state - including road rebuilding projects in Canton , Danvers , Braintree , and Bellingham - to build the footbridge .
The Patrick administration is pushing through a plan to spend $ 9 million in federal stimulus money to build a walking bridge connecting parking lots on either side of Route 1 near Gillette Stadium .
The lots belong to Robert Kraft , owner of the New England Patriots , who is tied for number 468 on Forbes Magazine ’s list of the world ’s billionaires .
The Kraft Group , which referred questions to the state , has long - range plans to develop property across the street from the stadium into an office park that could house close to 1 million square feet .
They have no tenant lined up , but the location is one of a handful of spots in Massachusetts large enough to lure a headquarters or research campus for a major corporation , said Greg Bialecki , the state ’s secretary of housing and economic development .
He also pointed out that the bridge will provide access between two public sidewalks .
State officials said it will provide a public safety and traffic benefits on game days , when fans stream across the wide road to get to the stadium , slowing the flow of vehicles .
Bialecki said he worked with former state transportation secretary James A. Aloisi Jr. to have the bridge placed on the slate of stimulus projects .
The state ’s regional planning boards are responsible for reviewing the state ’s use of $ 800 million in federal stimulus money for transportation .
The Kraft Group ’s role , if any , in seeking the federal money is not clear .
But as recently as March , the Kraft Group was working with Foxborough ’s town manager on trying to get state funds for the bridge , according to minutes from a selectmen ’s meeting posted on the town ’s website .
Bialecki said Massachusetts is losing out to states like North Carolina and Texas in the competition for companies because of a historic reluctance to use public money to improve infrastructure around private development .
“ That is a habit that the Patrick administration is trying very hard to break , ’’ Bialecki said .
He said the state has previously spent $ 70 million on public improvements in the area around the stadium and the shopping complex , yielding private investments of $ 800 million from the Kraft Group .
The town of Foxborough , though supportive of the bridge project , has not been willing to spend its own money on it .
President Obama introduced the stimulus spending plan last year as a means of jump - starting the economy with shovel - ready projects that will create jobs quickly .
But the state has no timeline for attracting jobs to the proposed office park across from Patriot Place .
In response to written questions , state transportation spokesman Colin Durrant said a 1.5 million square - foot office park could create 4,000 construction jobs and 4,500 office jobs .
Construction on the bridge itself , which was once estimated to cost just $ 6 million , is expected to begin in the spring .
Bialecki said he urged officials to go through the state permitting process for the office park in April so they would be ready to go immediately if they had corporate interest , he said .
The Kraft Group included the bridge in its application for the office park to meet requirements for pedestrian access .
Bialecki said he also believes the bridge would be an important factor in attracting a perspective tenant , because it would link the barren west side of the highway with the stores and other amenities at Patriot Place .
Bialecki said the Kraft family ’s wealth was not a factor in deciding whether they should pay for the bridge .
The relevant question , Bialecki said , “ Is the public investment we ’re making likely to increase private job creation ?
And if it is , then it ’s a good thing to do . ’’

Soft delete is a commonly - used pattern amongst database - driven business applications .
In my experience , however , it usually ends up causing more harm than good .
Here ’s a few reasons why it can fail in bigger applications , and some less - painful alternatives to consider .
Tomato , Tomato
I ’ve seen a few different implementations of this pattern in action .
First is the standard deleted flag to indicate an item should be ignored :
SELECT * FROM Product WHERE IsDeleted = 0
Another style uses meaningful status codes :
SELECT * FROM Task WHERE Status = ' Pending '
You can even give an item a fixed lifetime that starts and ends at a specific time ( it might not have started yet ) :
SELECT * FROM Policy WHERE GETDATE ( ) BETWEEN StartDate AND EndDate
All of these styles are all flavors of the same concept : instead of pulling dead or infrequently - used items out of active set , you simply mark them and change queries to step over the corpses at runtime .
This is a trade - off : soft delete columns are easy to implement , but incur a cost to query complexity and database performance later down the track .
Complexity
To prevent mixing active and inactive data in results , all queries must be made aware of the soft delete columns so they can explicitly exclude them .
It ’s like a tax ; a mandatory WHERE clause to ensure you do n’t return any deleted rows .
This extra WHERE clause is similar to checking return codes in programming languages that do n’t throw exceptions ( like C ) .
It ’s very simple to do , but if you forget to do it in even one place , bugs can creep in very fast .
And it is background noise that detracts away from the real intention of the query .
Performance
At first glance you might think evaluating soft delete columns in every query would have a noticeable impact on performance .
However , I ’ve found that most RDBMSs are actually pretty good at recognizing soft delete columns ( probably because they are so commonly used ) and does a good job at optimizing queries that use them .
In practice , filtering inactive rows does n’t cost too much in itself .
Instead , the performance hit comes simply from the volume of data that builds up when you do n’t bother clearing old rows .
For example , we have a table in a system at work that records an organisations day - to - day tasks : pending , planned , and completed .
It has around five million rows in total , but of that , only a very small percentage ( 2 % ) are still active and interesting to the application .
The rest are all historical ; rarely used and kept only to maintain foreign key integrity and for reporting purposes .
Interestingly , the biggest problem we have with this table is not slow read performance but writes .
Due to its high use , we index the table heavily to improve query performance .
But with the number of rows in the table , it takes so long to update these indexes that the application frequently times out waiting for DML commands to finish .
This table is becoming an increasing concern for us — it represents a major portion of the application , and with around a million new rows being added each year , the performance issues are only going to get worse .
Back to the original problem
The trouble with implementing soft delete via a column is that it simply does n’t scale well for queries targeting multiple tables — we need a different strategy for larger data models .
Let ’s take a step back and examine the reasons why you might want to implement soft deletes in a database .
If you think about it , there really are only four categories :
To provide an ‘ undelete ’ feature .
Auditing .
For soft create .
To keep historical items .
Let ’s look at each of these and explore what other options are available .
Soft delete to enable undo
Human error is inevitable , so it ’s common practice to give users the ability to bring something back if they delete it by accident .
But this functionality can be tricky to implement in a RDBMS , so first you need to ask an important question — do you really need it ?
There are two styles I have encountered that are achieved via soft delete :
There is an undelete feature available somewhere in the UI , or Undelete requires running commands directly against the database .
If there is an undo delete button available somewhere for users , then it is an important use case that needs to be factored into your code .
But if you ’re just putting soft delete columns on out of habit , and undelete still requires a developer or DBA to run a command against the database to toggle the flags back , then this is a maintenance scenario , not a use case .
Implementing it will take time and add significant complexity to your data model , and add very little benefit for end users , so why bother ?
It ’s a pretty clear YAGNI violation — in the rare case you really do need to restore deleted rows , you can just get them from the previous night ’s backup .
Otherwise , if there really is a requirement in your application for users to be able to undo deletes , there is already a well - known pattern specifically designed to take care of all your undo-related scenarios .
The memento pattern
Soft delete only supports undoing deletes , but the memento pattern provides a standard means of handling all undo scenarios your application might require .
It works by taking a snapshot of an item just before a change is made , and putting it aside in a separate store , in case a user wants to restore or rollback later .
For example , in a job board application , you might have two tables : one transactional for live jobs , and an undo log that stores snapshots of jobs at previous points in time :
If you want to restore one , you simply deserialize it and insert it back in .
This is much cleaner than messing up your transactional tables with ghost items , and lets you handle all undo operations together using the same pattern .
Soft delete for auditing
Another common practice I have seen is using soft delete as a means of auditing : to keep a record of when an item was deleted , and who deleted it .
Usually additional columns are added to store this information :
As with undo , you should ask a couple of questions before you implement soft delete for auditing reasons :
Is there a requirement to log when an item is deleted ?
Is there a requirement to log any other significant application events ?
In the past I have seen developers ( myself included ) automatically adding delete auditing columns like this as a convention , without questioning why it ’s needed ( aka cargo cult programming ) .
Deleting an object is only one event we might be interested in logging .
If a rogue user performs some malicious acts in your application , updates could be just as destructive so we should know about those too .
One possible conclusion from this thought is that you simply log all DML operations on the table .
You can do this pretty easily with triggers :
CREATE TRIGGER tg_Product_Delete ON Product AFTER DELETE AS INSERT INTO [ Log ] ( [ Timestamp ] , [ Table ] , Command , ID ) SELECT GETDATE ( ) , ' Product ' , ' DELETE ' , ProductID FROM Deleted CREATE TRIGGER tg_Product_Update ON Product AFTER UPDATE AS
Contextual logging
If something goes wrong in the application and we want to retrace the series of steps that led to it , CREATES , UPDATES and DELETES by themselves do n’t really explain much of what the user was trying to achieve .
Getting useful audit logs from DML statements alone is like trying to figure out what you did last night from just your credit card bill .
It would be more useful if the logs were expressed in the context of the use case , not just the database commands that resulted from it .
For example , if you were tracking down a bug , would you rather read this :
[ 09:30:24 ] DELETE ProductCategory 142 13 dingwallr
… or this ?
[ 09:30:24 ] Product 'i Phone 3GS ' ( # 142 ) was removed from the catalog by user dingwallr .
Categories : ' Smart Phones ' ( #13 ) , ' Apple ' ( #15 ) .
Logging at the row level simply cannot provide enough context to give a true picture of what the user is doing .
Instead it should be done at a higher level where you know the full use - case ( e.g. application services ) , and the logs should be kept out of the transactional database so they can be managed separately ( e.g. rolling files for each month ) .
Soft create
The soft delete pattern can also be extended for item activation — instead of simply creating an item as part of the active set , you create it in an inactive state and flick a switch or set a date for when it should become active .
For example :
SELECT * FROM Employee WHERE GETDATE ( ) < StartDate
This pattern is most commonly seen in publishing systems like blogs and CMSs , but I ’ve also seen it used as an important part of an ERP system for scheduling changes to policy before it comes into effect .
Soft delete to retain historical items
Many database - backed business applications are required to keep track of old items for historical purposes — so users can go back and see what the state of the business was six months ago , for example .
( Alternatively , historical data is kept because the developer can’t figure out how to delete something without breaking foreign key constraints , but this really amounts to the same thing . )
We need to keep this data somewhere , but it ’s no longer immediately interesting to the application because either :
The item explicitly entered a dormant state – e.g. an expired eBay listing or deactivated Windows account , or
The item was implicitly dropped from the active set – e.g. my Google Calendar appointments from last week that I will probably never look at again
I have n’t included deleted items here because there are very few cases I can think of in business applications where data is simply deleted ( unless it was entered in error ) — usually it is just transformed from one state to another .
Udi Dahan explains this well in his article Do n’t Delete — Just ’ Do n’t :
Orders are n’t deleted – they ’re cancelled .
There may also be fees incurred if the order is canceled too late .
Employees are n’t deleted – they ’re fired ( or possibly retired ) .
A compensation package often needs to be handled .
Jobs are n’t deleted – they ’re filled ( or their requisition is revoked ) .
Unless your application is pure CRUD ( e.g. data grids ) , these states most likely represent totally different use cases .
For example , in a timesheet application , complete tasks may be used for invoicing purposes , while incomplete tasks comprise your todo list .
Different use cases , different query needs
Each use case has different query requirements , as the information the application is interested in depends on the context .
To achieve optimal performance , the database should reflect this — instead of lumping differently - used sets of items together in one huge table with a flag or status code as a discriminator , consider splitting them up into separate tables .
For example , in our job board application , we might store open , expired and filled listings using a table - per- class strategy :
Physically separating job listings by state allows us to optimize them for different use cases — focusing on write performance for active items , and read performance for past ones , with different columns , indexes and levels of ( de ) normalization for each .
Is n’t this all overkill ?
Probably .
If you ’re already using soft delete and have n’t had any problems then you do n’t need to worry — soft delete was a sensible trade - off for your application that has n’t caused any serious issues so far .
But if you ’re anticipating growth , or already encountering scalability problems as dead bodies pile up in your database , you might like to look at alternatives that better satisfy your application ’s requirements .
The truth is soft delete is a poor solution for most of the problems it promises to solve .
Instead , focus on what you ’re actually trying to achieve .
Keep everything simple and follow these guidelines :
Primary transactional tables should only contain data that is valid and active right now .
Do you really need to be able to undo deletes ?
If so , there are dedicated patterns to handle this .
Audit logging at the row level sucks .
Do it higher up where you know the full story .
If a row does n’t apply yet , put it in a queue until it does .
Physically separate items in different states based on their query usage .
Above all , make sure you ’re not gold plating tables with soft delete simply out of habit !
GPS Traces Using World Wind
I have a lot of GPX files lying around from various biking trips .
I do n't have much use for them other than loading them in to Google Earth and brag about being there and done that , so I thought I would parse the file myself and paint the route on the World Wind .
GPX files are XML files , containing the coordinates you have been to , if you draw a line through these points you can rebuild the route you have taken .
( ns gpx ( : require [ clojure.zip : as zip ] [ clojure.xml : as xml ] ) ( :use clojure.contrib.zip-filter.xml ) ( :import ( java.util ArrayList ) ( java.awt Dimension ) ( gov.nasa.worldwind.layers RenderableLayer ) ( gov.nasa.worldwind.geom LatLon Position ) ( gov.nasa.worldwind.render Polyline SurfacePolyline ) ( gov.nasa.worldwind.avlist AVKey ) ( gov.nasa.worldwind.awt WorldWindowGLCanvas ) ( gov.nasa.worldwind Configuration WorldWind ) ) ) ( defn points [ f ] ( let [ data ( zip / xml - zip ( xml / parse f ) ) trkpt ( xml - > data : trk : trkseg : trkpt ) ] ( map #( vector ( attr % : lat ) ( attr % : lon ) ( first ( xml - > % : ele text ) ) ) trkpt ) ) )
gpx= > ( take 2 ( points " data.gpx " ) ) ( [ " 41.011934 " " 29.196977 " " 154.909546 " ] [ " 41.010155 " " 29.195925 " " 150.583618 " ] )
This will return a sequence of vectors , each containing three items , latitude , longitude and elevation of the point .
To draw a path on to the map World Wind provides two classes SurfacePolyline and Polyline .
SurfacePolyline will draw a flat line on to the surface between coordinates where as Polyline draws a GL line between positions , which includes elevation data .
( defn world [ ]
( Configuration / setValue AVKey /INITIAL_LATITUDE 39.3113 ) ( Configuration / setValue AVKey /INITIAL_LONGITUDE 32.8038 ) ( Configuration / setValue AVKey /INITIAL_ALTITUDE 1000000 ) ( doto ( WorldWindowGLCanvas . ) ( .setModel ( WorldWind /createConfigurationComponent AVKey / MODEL_CLASS_NAME ) ) ) ) ( defn surface - polyline [ points ] ( let [ list ( ArrayList . ) ] ( doseq [ p points ] ( . add list ( LatLon / fromDegrees ( Double . ( p 0 ) ) ( Double . ( p 1 ) ) ) ) ) ( doto ( RenderableLayer . ) ( .addRenderable ( SurfacePolyline . list ) ) ) ) )
To create a SurfacePolyline , we need to create a list of LatLon objects and pass that to the SurfacePolyline constructor at this point you can also set a color for the line then we create a RenderableLayer and add our SurfacePolyline to it , this final layer is what will be added to the World Wind canvas .
( defn polyline [ points ] ( let [ list ( ArrayList . ) ] ( doseq [ p points ] ( . add list ( Position .
( LatLon / fromDegrees ( Double . ( p 0 ) ) ( Double . ( p 1 ) ) ) ( Double . ( p 2 ) ) ) ) ) ( doto ( RenderableLayer . ) ( .addRenderable ( Polyline . list ) ) ) ) ) ( defn frame [ ] ( let [ world ( world ) layers ( .getLayers ( .getModel world ) ) ] ( . add layers ( surface - polyline ( points " data.gpx " ) ) ) ;; ( . add layers ( polyline ( points " data.gpx " ) ) ) ( doto ( javax.swing.JFrame . ) ( . add world ) ( .setSize ( Dimension . 300 300 ) ) ( .setAlwaysOnTop true ) ( .setVisible true ) ) ) )
Process of creating a Polyline is the same , the only difference is instead of building a list of LatLon objects , we build a list of Position objects which includes the elevation data , again we get a layer that is ready to be added to the world .
Can we go 100 % renewable ?
By Damian Kahya
Business reporter , BBC News
The North Sea could offer a solution to much of Europe 's energy needs
The power of the wind and waves is ever - present in the Danish winter .
The Copenhagen climate change talks will discuss how to capture the energy from such " renewable " sources .
The UK plans to get 15 % of all its energy that way within just 10 years .
Some experts believe it could provide for all our needs .
But the government 's adviser is sceptical of just how far we can go .
More than just our homes Professor David MacKay is the author of a book on sustainable energy .
Optimists say the powers of nature alone could provide enough energy
He calculates that even if we covered every available plot , offshore location and tidal estuary with wind , wave and tidal power we may not meet all our current energy needs .
Total UK energy output is equivalent to 2.7 million GWhours of electricity or 310 GW of capacity .
The market value of all energy consumed in the UK is £ 130 bn ( $ 216bn ) a year with the amount spent on energy by final users at about £ 75 bn .
Only about a third of the energy we use comes in the form of electricity .
Transport and heating are also key .
The wind does n't always blow Renewable energy is often unreliable .
Wind turbines are being built across vast areas across the world
They include wind , hydro- electric , tidal , solar and wave and geothermal power along with energy from plant and waste material - so - called biomass and bio-fuels .
The wind does not always blow so most wind - farms average 20 - 30 % of their capacity .
The governments suggested 33 GW of offshore wind will generate just a third of that .
Tidal and hydroelectric power are more reliable , but hard to locate .
Professor MacKay estimates there are enough good spots for hydro-electric to provide 0.8 % of our current energy needs .
Tidal power has just one commercial turbine in the Strangford Lough , Northern Ireland .
Carbon
Trust research suggests the technology could provide 0.6 % of current energy use .
But the numbers are rough .
" We 're roughly where aviation was in 1920s , " says Peter Fraenkel , technical director for the company behind the Strangford project , Marine Currents Turbines .
Finding the space Space is also an issue for wind , solar and biofuels .
The government says coal will remain in the energy mix Installing just 33GW of offshore wind would need 10,000 square kilometres of coastal waters generating only 3 % of our current energy supply , Professor MacKay estimates .
It means that we would struggle to exceed 50 % of our current needs from renewable energy , he insists .
Social rejection " People love renewable energy , " according to Professor MacKay , " unless it is bigger than a fig - leaf " .
Problems getting planning permission for wind power contributed to the decision by Danish wind turbine manufacturer Vestas to leave the UK .
Taking this into account Professor MacKay thinks the amount we could source goes down by half .
Others say renewable energy could generate far more power , per meter , in future .
A big investment The economics are also debated .
We are running with what Ed Miliband called the Trinity of low carbon energy ; nuclear , renewables and clean coal
Energy Minister Lord Hunt
The total costs of coal and gas power is estimated to be under 5 p / kwh .
But the cost of buying electricity varies dramatically , partly because of the costs of fossil fuels .
The UK's Climate Change Committee estimates wind power would cost a more steady 7 - 9 p / kwh .
Because it is unreliable , wind energy may need backup power costing an extra 1 - 2p / kwh .
Hydroelectric and some biomass energy cost about the same .
Wave , tidal and solar power , though , are currently far more expensive .
Each extra pence per kw/h would be about £ 33 a year on current home electricity bill .
In total , the consultancy Ernst and Young calculates the investment needed to meet the governments targets at over £ 100 bn .
Partner Ben Warren says raising the capital has become far harder recently .
Government plan
The government accepts consumers are likely to pay more .
Heating bills are set to rise in the years ahead
It expects electricity bills to go up by 15 % and gas bills by 23 % within 10 years to fund its renewable strategy .
However , if oil prices rise to their 2008 levels again the additional cost of the measures is almost nothing .
Oil might push bills up anyway .
The government plan aims to tackle some of the problems raised by its advisor .
It hopes a raft of measures will speed up planning procedures .
Home energy efficiency measures may decrease demand and therefore cost to consumers .
Smart grids would help match energy demand to changeable supply , from wind for example .
Energy minister Lord Hunt says the government is also pursuing non-renewable energy .
" We are running with what Ed Miliband called the Trinity of low carbon energy ; nuclear , renewables and clean coal " .
Increasing scale
In California , engineer Mark Jacobson and scientist Mark Delucchi say they have found a way to deliver 100 % renewable energy .
They say it is cheaper than the alternatives , clean coal and nuclear power .
The plan calls for 3.8 million large wind turbines and 90,000 solar plants worldwide and envisage that production on such a scale would drive the cost down .
The key is sharing renewables across continents , using space where available .
" You want to connect resources , " says Mr Jacobson .
" Solar from the south .
Wind from the north .
You can solve multiple problems and provide a reliable supply of energy . "
The plan raises concerns about energy security , but avoids the need to import or pay for oil .
They estimate transporting energy would add 20 % to the cost .
Hydro-electric plants and millions of electric car batteries connected through a smart grid would be used to store and release electricity and increase reliability .
Transformation Energy efficiency is also emphasised .
Professor Mackay calculates that switching to an electrified economy and major efficiency savings in heating and transport could reduce energy demand by around half .
Mr Delucchi and Mr Jacobson say their scheme costs $ 100 trillion ( £ 60 trillion ) worldwide , spread over the life of the new equipment .
They admit it would need strong government and public support .
" You 're just not going to luck into this kind of system , " says Mr Delucchi .
It will not be an easy decision for the UK to take .

A House subcommittee endorsed Tuesday a bill to ban importing foreign , low - level radioactive waste — which would block an EnergySolutions proposal to import 20,000 tons of it from Italy , process it in Tennessee and dump it in Utah 's western desert .
EnergySolutions conceded after the vote that the bill pushed by Rep. Jim Matheson , D - Utah , and Bart Gordon , D - Tenn. , likely will soon pass the full House , but said the Senate may block it .
Rep. Edward Markey , D - Mass. , chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Environment , said before his panel passed the bill on a voice vote , " We on the committee will not allow the United States to be the world 's dumping ground . "
Afterward , Jill Sigal , executive vice president of strategic planning for EnergySolutions , said , " No one can term 4.3 acres in Utah as a ( world ) dumping ground for anything . "
Her company has proposed to use no more than 4.3 acres at its Clive , Tooele County , facility for disposing foreign low - level radioactive waste , such as lab coats , shoe coverings , cleaning cloths and similar materials used by workers at nuclear power plants .
She added that while she expects that the House will pass the bill , " When the bill gets over to the Senate , I think there are many senators who will take a close look at this issue and share our view . "
EnergySolutions has said the importation is not dangerous and would create U.S. jobs .
It added that blocking importation of waste would hurt its competitive ability to compete to create similar disposal sites abroad , and to compete for services to foreign nuclear facilities .
Matheson told the committee that the United States has limited space currently approved to dispose of its own low - level radioactive waste , and should protect it for its own use — especially as nuclear power is becoming more important amid concerns about climate change .
However , Sigal said the U.S. General Accountability Office and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission both have said that they see no capacity problem for low - level waste far into the future .
Matheson also told the committee , " This is an effort to put the United States in the same position as all the other countries in the world because no other country accepts this waste , and we should not as well . "
Matheson added after the vote , " Utahns have spoken loudly and clearly in their opposition to being a dumping ground for the world 's nuclear garbage .
In addition , with increasing domestic demand for radioactive waste storage and finite storage capacity , I see no good reason , as public policy , that Italy , Great Britain , Brazil , Mexico and other countries should n't handle their own nuclear waste . "
The House Energy and Commerce Committee is slated to vote on the bill Thursday .
While the legislative battle proceeds , a court battle on the same issue also is pending .
EnergySolutions successfully argued in federal court that it is a private facility and not part of a national compact system set up to let regions control what nuclear - plant wastes they may import , so Utah and a Northwest compact could not stop it from importing foreign waste .
That case is now on appeal .

The Federal Reserve in coming years will probably become highly politicized and thus lose its quasi - independent status .
This is because of past shortcomings in its policies and , more importantly , of difficult decisions that face it in the year just ahead .
To be sure , the Fed has never been fully independent of the political process , and it should n't be .
The president appoints the chairman and the governors of the Federal Reserve Board , and Congress must approve these appointments .

Underwater Kite Harnesses Ocean Energy
October 23rd , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
A completely new concept of underwater wave energy using a simple 7 ton kite turbine design has been developed by Minesto ; which is a spinoff from the Swedish military and aircraft design firm Saab .
The Deep Green underwater turbine captures the power of the ocean just like a kite in wind .
The system could generate 18 terawatthours of energy annually , enough to provide nearly 4 million British households with reliably green electricity every year .
UK households now use about a third of what average US households use in energy .
Originally Saab was working on a kite design for a wind turbine , but found that the concept would actually work better in water , which is 832 times more dense than air .
The kite twirls in a repeating figure eight pattern ( video ) that increases the ocean velocity ten - fold .
The first stage increases the relative flow speed entering a turbine .
When the tide hits the wing it turns down , which creates a lift force .
The kite is mounted to the ocean bed with a tether and is controlled by a rudder to gently nudge it in the desired trajectory .
According to Minesto’s website , each megawatt - worth of kite (s ) would weigh 14 tons , so it would seem that each 7 ton kite is a 500 KW unit .
According to CEO Anders Jansson ’s estimate , these could probably produce power for somewhere between $ 0.09 cents and $ 0.20 cents per kwh .
Certainly because these are such extremely simple - tech structures they would be cost effective – costing less in materials per power produced , and costing less in transporting them to the site , in installing them and even in ongoing maintenance costs .
Almost half the potential in Europe is in British waters , with the ocean moving an average of 1 to 2 metres per second between 60 and 120 metres below the surface .
The Carbon Trust based in the UK gave early development support .
Minesto ’s Deep Green is now funded in part by the UK and Swedish governments , and has nearly $ 3 million in additional capital from parent company Saab Group , Midroc New Technology , Verdane Capital and Encubator .
With these kinds of serious investors , and such a simple and cost effective design , this could be what gets wave power to the world .

The spread of illegal violence around the drug trade in Mexico has provided an opening for the rich to engage in their own , says Stuart Easterling .
THERE WERE two recent events in Mexico that few news organizations , if any , bothered to connect .
The first was the massacre of 15 people in the northern state of Sonora on October 30 .
It was , sadly , not even the largest massacre this year , thanks to the " drug war " raging along the border with the United States .
This massacre was different in one key way , however : Its principal target was Margarito Montes , leader of the General Worker , Peasant and Popular Union ( UGOCP ) , a peasant organization based largely in the states of Oaxaca and Veracruz .
Montes was killed , along with his wife , his children ( of 4 , 7 and 9 years of age ) and a number of people in his entourage , as they drove along a rural highway .
Many in the press quickly blamed the affair on " the narcos , " members of Mexico 's powerful drug organizations .
The peasant leader Montes must have somehow been tied up in the drug trade , it was implied .
The second event , seemingly unrelated to the first , was the public announcement by a mayor in the northern state of Nuevo León , Mauricio Fernández , that he was forming a private paramilitary organization .
It would be composed of " rudos " -- tough guys -- recruited from the military and police .
They would operate outside the law in collecting intelligence and fighting crime .
They would be given tasks of " limpieza especial " -- special cleansing .
The problem , Mayor Fernández says , is the narcos .
Margarito Montes , the murdered leader of the General Worker , Peasant and Popular Union
Certainly no one can underestimate the power of the narcos in Mexico , and of organized crime more generally .
They own large numbers of local police and government officials , particularly in the north .
Public figures who do n't cooperate are routinely assassinated , their quartered bodies often dumped in the street .
Far more unknown individuals are also killed , often young men in their 20s , their bodies dumped en masse and frequently displaying signs of torture .
Indeed , more Mexicans died due to the " drug war " in 2008 than all Americans killed in action in Iraq and Afghanistan since both those wars began .
The drug war was , of course , escalated by Mexico 's conservative President Felipe Calderón , who has vowed to somehow defeat the organizations that serve the world 's largest market for illegal drugs : the United States .
Meanwhile , organized crime in Mexico has also increasingly entered into the lucrative business of kidnapping in recent years .
It has historically been the wealthy and near - wealthy who are targeted for kidnapping .
But now it 's not just the rich any more .
Migrants from Mexico and Central America trying to reach the U.S. are now seized by kidnappers posing as coyotes , the people who facilitate border crossings .
Relatives of migrants already in the north are forced give up what little they have to free their loved ones .
Some of the stories of kidnapping are truly horrific .
One woman , recently rescued three years after having been seized , had given birth to two children in captivity , due to her having been sexually assaulted on so many occasions .
In such a climate , people like Mayor Fernández can gain support for extreme law - and - order policies .
In fact , 76 percent of Mexicans currently support introducing the death penalty in Mexico .
And many people , not just the rich , support taking the law into their own hands .
In a town near Mexico City , an attempted kidnapping of a local small - business owner led to protests and riots by roughly 3,000 people .
They blockaded roads , burned cars and set fire to the police station because the authorities would n't hand over four would - be kidnappers to be lynched .
BUT AS with everything else , the elite in Mexico has attempted to manipulate the fear of crime and violence for their own interests .
The narcos have become a super - scapegoat -- everything can be blamed on them , including the killing of a peasant leader .
They can be denounced in the press as corrupt nouveaux riches who exploit the common people -- while little is said about the far more numerous corrupt nouveaux riches in Mexico who exploit the common people completely legally .
They can be denounced by the government as being at the root of Mexico 's public insecurity , while completely ignoring the country 's growing levels of economic insecurity .
More significantly , the spread of illegal violence provides an opening for perfecting the use of legal violence .
The various weapons that the state develops , ostensibly to fight organized crime , can and will be employed against their critics and the left .
This is where Mayor Fernández comes in .
The spread of illegal violence also provides an opening for the rich to engage in their own .
The community that Fernández represents is one of the wealthiest in Mexico .
In recent years , so its fearful residents claim , it has gone downhill .
The poor who have always lived in and around town have increasingly turned to the drug trade .
Rich narcos now drive around town in fancy cars .
And so it 's time to turn to " special cleansing . "
One conspicuous narco , who liked to show off his yellow Lamborghini , was recently rubbed out in Mexico City .
The mayor was somehow able to announce his elimination even before the police knew about it .
Privately funded " special cleansing " groups are already known to exist in various parts of the country , exterminating the sorts of petty criminals -- like car thieves -- who harass the rich and the upper middle class .
But it 's also likely that they will start expanding their definition of pests who need to be cleansed -- if they have n't already .
One such category of pests is journalists , for example .
The Mexican north has already become a dangerous place for reporters asking pesky questions .
Eight of them have been murdered in Mexico in the last six months .
So : kill a journalist , or a political figure , one who was never a friend of the local rich .
Dump the body in the street .
Pin a sign on it saying the narcos did it .
Do n't bother to investigate the crime .
If this is n't happening already , Mayor Fernández 's " rudos " will ensure it does .
Put differently , it 's hard to imagine paramilitary and intelligence organizations , formed at the behest of Mexico 's wealthiest people , not acting as an instrument to protect their interests as a social class -- and doing so by taking a page out of the narcos ' book .
And it is easy to imagine that such organizations would also come to be used against men like Margarito Montes .
PERHAPS MONTES was killed because he was involved with narcos - - it 's not unthinkable .
Time will hopefully tell .
But he had certainly angered plenty of other powerful people over the years .
Montes was a Trotskyist many years ago , a founding member of the Revolutionary Workers ' Party ( PRT ) in Mexico in the 1970s .
He first started organizing peasants in Tuxtepec , Oaxaca , in the 1980s , a place with a long history of agrarian violence .
Take the response to just one land invasion organized by Montes in 1991 - - local ranchers assembled 500 armed men to expel the invaders , and killed 39 people .
And so Montes quickly became a very tough customer , as one has to be to take land from rich people and give it poor people .
Two political bosses who lost their land to peasants led by Montes were later found dead and buried , with their ears cut off , on that same land .
In 2005 , Montes was linked ( though never charged ) with the murder of César Toimil Robert and four others -- members of a notorious armed organization that defended the interests of ranchers and landowners around Tuxtepec and had fought bitterly with the UGOCP .
Montes had also been accused of collaborating with Mexico 's authoritarian Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) since the late 1980s .
Critics say he focused many of his land invasions on political enemies of the PRI -- particularly rivals of the " Salinas clan , " the corrupt family of ex-President Carlos Salinas de Gortari .
The Yaqui people of Sonora , for example , accuse Montes of working repeatedly with the PRI and Salinas to invade lands they claimed as their own .
The latest contested land invasion was on the very month Montes was killed .
The UGOCP and other local and national peasant organizations have said that Montes was killed by a group resembling Mayor Fernández 's " rudos " - - a death squad assembled by the angry rich .
They are demanding a thorough investigation of the massacre .
They are asking how such a large number of assassins could have just slipped away .
They suspect the state government had a hand in the massacre , or at least looked the other way .
It 's true that perhaps the best time to commit a political murder is when killings over things like drugs are far too common .
But whether the government will bother to seriously investigate Montes ' death is an open question .
It will certainly be easiest for them if they can just blame it all on the narcos .
Many automotive addicts will cringe when they see this , while many other jealous folks might just cheer .
Whatever your reaction to this Bugatti Veyron lake crash , the circumstances leading up to this supercar blunder are rather comical .
Apparently , while the owner of the vehicle was cruising through Galveston , Texas , on his way to check out some real estate , he was chatting on his cell phone when , all of sudden , a low flying pelican caught his attention .
It was reported that “ the man jerked the wheel , dropped his cell phone , and the car ’s front tire left the frontage road and entered a muddy patch , which foiled his attempt to maneuver away from the lagoon . ”
And therein lies the rub — a 1,001 hp quad - turbo 16 - cylinder engine may be great for propelling one to 62 mph in just 2.5 seconds , but without reverse rocket thrusters or some type of Batman - like grappling hook to jettison , does no good when hurling through mud .
With a curb weight of 4,162 pounds , no traction control , ABS or electronic wizardry today can help you here .
But what makes no sense is that the news reported “ the Veyron ’s powerful engine gurgled like an outboard motor for about 15 minutes before it died . ”
Somehow , turning off the engine and keeping the doors closed did n’t seem like a good idea to this guy .
If it was me , I would have gently climbed out the window and tried to keep the cabin dry .
Maybe he just panicked in the nearly 2 feet of salt water .
Let ’s take score here in the US , where this vehicle is ultra rare .
1 Bugatti down , 14 to go …
Lesson for ye other faithful drivers : save a little bit of cash over the $ 2 million purchase price for a hands free device .
Come to think of it , does n’t the Bugatti Veyron have Bluetooth ?

" The idea that we must choose between public healthcare and politicized - private healthcare is false .
We can also move to depoliticize the healthcare industry . "
Rising costs are the main issue in the debate over healthcare reform .
Most everybody thinks of healthcare as expensive , but there is much confusion over these costs .
On September 9 , President Obama attempted to clarify cost issues concerning the medical industry .
The federal government will supposedly reduce costs , curtail abuses , and make healthcare services more affordable .
The president proposes creating a low - cost market for health insurance .
Previously uninsured people would be required , with some exemptions , to buy health insurance — so as to avoid high - cost emergency - room visits .
Businesses would be compelled to provide insurance , with some exemptions for the smallest businesses .
The federal government would also promote preventative care and nonprofit health clinics .
Senator Baucus has proposed a new plan whereby people who do not buy health insurance will be fined $ 3,800 .
These fines will force people to buy insurance , and this will spread costs more broadly .
Economist Paul Craig Roberts criticizes proposals for forcing people to buy insurance .
He argues that fining people who cannot afford health insurance is like " solving the homeless problem by requiring the homeless to purchase houses . "
Roberts recognizes that fines forcing more people to buy health insurance are the equivalent of a new tax .
He objects to this new tax on the grounds that it is imposed on those who cannot afford it .
Roberts believes that taxes for healthcare should be apportioned according to the " ability - to - pay " principle .
He favors a " single - payer , not - for - profit healthcare system . "
According to him , private healthcare does not work because of expensive medical technology , malpractice suits , bureaucratic third - party - payer costs , and the " cost " of shareholder returns .
The remarks that the president , Senator Baucus , and Paul Roberts have made regarding profits and executive compensation reveal problems with their understanding of economics .
The president , for instance , sees profits and high executive salaries in insurance companies as unnecessary costs , fat that can be cut from the health industry .
In economic terms , however , profits represent success in satisfying consumers of particular products at relatively low costs .
Successful executives keep revenues high by gaining market share and satisfying customers in large numbers .
They also keep financial costs low by cutting waste in the use of labor , capital , and supplies .
High profits are often a sign that companies are serving their consumers at a low cost .
The president 's remarks regarding profits and executive salaries likely derive from the hostility towards all profits characteristic of many people on the Left ( such as Michael Moore ) , rather than from sound economic reasoning .
Executives earn high salaries by delivering high profits to owners , and high profits derive in part from keeping costs under control .
Would a nonprofit , single - payer ( i.e. , taxpayer - funded ) system also be run on a cost - minimizing basis ?
" High profits are often a sign that companies are serving their consumers at a low cost . "
The basic choice we have to make is between healthcare based on the profit motive and healthcare based on some kind of service principle .
On the one hand , corporations do make profit by developing new drugs for consumers , and by manufacturing medical supplies and equipment .
On the other hand , nonprofit clinics do exist , medical professionals do perform pro bono services , and some companies do donate medical supplies and equipment .
But what serves the public best : private profit seeking , or the desire to do public service ?
Of course , we do n't want to assume that all profits and executive salaries derive from efficient management .
Some executives increase the profitability of their operations through lobbying the government to secure state - granted privileges and subsidies .
Roberts recognizes such problems with special interests .
Senator Baucus proposes that people be pressured into buying more insurance , but Roberts notes that Baucus has taken large campaign contributions from insurance companies .
Lobbying by special - corporate interests generates profits that are " fat in the system " and should be cut .
But will increased government involvement in the healthcare industry cause more or less corporate lobbying ?
Both mandated - private and single - payer , nonprofit insurance proposals will likely increase wasteful lobbying by corporate interests .
The real question is , how far can we replace legitimate profit seeking with public service ?
Some people donate time and goods to healthcare .
It is also true that some people work at Medicare or the Center for Disease Control because they want to do public service .
But how much more of this conscientious public service can we expect ?
Other people seek federal jobs for an easy path to early retirement , or for power .
The president is assuming a ready supply of capable and conscientious public servants , as well as effective means of managing and organizing healthcare along bureaucratic lines .
In the absence of market prices and profits , large - scale organization requires central planning .
The idea of such planning scares many people , and rightly so .
The planning of entire national economies during the 20th century ended in disaster .
Large public bureaucracies have also exhibited significant problems with waste and rigidity .
These problems exist for specific reasons : central planning suffers from the defect that small groups of leaders or officials cannot possibly understand local conditions in modern industries like healthcare .
The modern world is simply too complex to be planned .
Of course , the private system of profit and loss also has defects , but we must be careful in identifying the source of the worst problems with profit seeking .
" Income taxes create a bias in favor of healthcare funding through insurance . "
President Obama wants to further politicize the medical industry .
He seems to assume that private profit seeking is wasteful .
The president would be right if he specifically criticized profiteering through the manipulation of public policies .
Since the medical industry is heavily regulated , we should expect that part of its profits serves special interests rather than consumers .
But the president 's complaint about executive pay and profits in general is more in line with the socialist idea that profits necessarily serve a particular interest group — capitalists — at the expense of everybody else .
There are , of course , other sources of waste in the current healthcare system .
Laws that mandate coverage of minor and routine healthcare services increase private administrative costs .
For that matter , income taxes create a bias in favor of healthcare funding through insurance , rather than through per-service fees charged directly to consumers .
Third - party administrative costs could be slashed simply by removing the current bias towards healthcare financing through so - called insurance ( as opposed to through true insurance for high - cost / low - probability health events ) .
Frivolous and fraudulent lawsuits have also imposed high costs through inflated malpractice - insurance rates .
Would either single - payer or mandated - insurance proposals decrease these costs ?
We have three options : our current system , permeated by ill - gotten politicized profits and wasteful special - interest lobbying ; a largely untried privatized system , based on private profits and limited private charity ; and a system of centralized , single - payer healthcare through public bureaucracies .
The type of compromises that the president proposed in his September 9 speech have already been tried and failed .
We already have regulation by bureaucratic agencies .
Public bureaucracies have well - known and well - deserved reputations for rigidity , waste , and , at times , abuse .
The private sector has a bad reputation in the healthcare industry , but that is largely due to the fact that healthcare has already been politicized .
Obama 's plan for healthcare amounts to a self - fulfilling prophecy : if we further politicize the healthcare industry its profits will be even less justifiable , and public options will gain legitimacy .
Paul Craig Roberts has seen ahead of this curve , and recognizes that a centralized , single - payer system might have some advantages over a politicized system of government mandates favoring private - corporate interests .
But the idea that we must choose between public healthcare and politicized - private healthcare is false .
We can also move to depoliticize the healthcare industry .
A depoliticized , free market in healthcare would be run on the basis of profits that are for the most part earned through cost efficiency and customer service .
A truly competitive health industry of this kind would best serve American consumers .
Unfortunately , we are as far from approaching this situation as President Obama is from comprehending its merits .

Info : if you come from Google and want to know what PSGI and Plack are : take a look at our PSGI / Plack project web page that has links to PSGI spec and FAQ , and then Plack git repo for the actual code .
HTTP :: Engine is the best thing that happened in the Perl web application development land lately .
It 's a port of Catalyst : : Engine and takes all the goodness from Python 's WSGI and Ruby 's Rack interface , as well as using Moose 's Role - base abstraction but using Any :: Moose under the hood so it runs fast at runtime under Moose but still boots up fast with less memory in CGI using Mouse as a backend .
This should be great for everyone .
Well .
Did you smell something fishy about the last paragraph ?
If your friend cooks something for you and says " Yeah I learned a great technique from Chinese cookbook and trying to apply that with raw fish Sushi stuff mixed into some mexican Chicken Tacos thing so this should be pretty good . " you 'll probably want to avoid eating it .
HTTP :: Engine does n't do the exact same thing but something similar .
A few months ago I was writing AnyEvent - based HTTP :: Engine adaptor and swore a couple of times during coding it : there are too much abstractions going on and as an adaptor implementor you need to know which hook you should implement and which parameters should pass when , but the class hierarchy is still monolithic so your adaptor code totally depends on the HTTP :: Engine 's implementation .
That really sucks .
The basic motto of HTTP :: Engine - " WSGI / Rack equivalent for Perl " is quite wrong .
WSGI / Rack has the specification which is just a protocol between adaptors and an application .
WSGI implementation calls the application , which is just a Python 's callable object ( could be an iterator , callable or just a method ) with single big ' env ' hash that contains everything and start_response callback .
Rack omits the start_response and instead excepts an array of 3 values as a response ( because Ruby has this wonderful thing called Iterator ) , but the basic design is the same .
HTTP :: Engine is monolithic and the adaptor 's implementation is so much tied to its sometimes badly designed API or over - engineered implementation .
Last night tokuhirom , Yappo and I brainstormed this thing on IRC and agreed to drop those engine specific drivers ( which is called Interface : : and Builders in HTTP :: Engine ) from HTTP :: Engine and clone WSGI / Rack hash and callback based protocol as much as possible .
HTTP :: Engine API will stay the same , but now HTTP :: Engine will become a thin wrapper on top of PSGI ( Perl WSGI - a little goofy but straightforward name , right ? ) .
PSGI is a specification ( gateway protocol ) , and we 'll probably create PSGI implementation for HTTP :: Engine , probably named Plack .
The separation of spec and implementation is important here : JavaScript's Jack does it pretty nice - JSGI is the spec and Jack is the implementation including middleware .
Ruby 's
Rack does both , which could be sometimes confusing .
Anyway , this should make the whole HTTP :: Engine stack much easier to implement and allow us to reuse tests in different environments as much as possible .
I proposed this on #moose and #http - engine IRC channels this morning , and got a response like below :
10:33 rjbs : sounds cool 10:33 mst : miyagawa : good plan .
10:33 confound : tokuhirom ++ miyagawa ++ excellent 10:35 stevan : tokuhirom ++ yappo++ miyagawa ++ # very nice 10:48 autarch : overall , I think this is a good idea
So this is promising .
There were some things to bikeshed , based on some buggy reference code and misunderstandings , but that actually proves the benefit of this PSGI thing .
If you think the reference implementation sucks , you can write your own .
Actually we think PSGIRef should not be used by the real applications and there should be more implementations written by experts on FastCGI / ModPerl / Gearman / Mojo / Perlbal and alike .
We 'll keep the HTTP :: Engine API compatible , but writing your own API wrapper should be much easier as well , and writing adaptors for frameworks like Catalyst , Jifty , Ark , Angelos and Squatting would still be pretty easy .
Also , some of them already use or have an adaptor for HTTP :: Engine which does n't need to change anyway .
By the way , the fact I proposed at and got positive feedbacks from #moose IRC channel might have given you an impression that PSGI has something to do with Moose , e.g. PSGI implementation is based on Moose Roles , or implementations should use Moose .
Absolutely not .
The fact I did it in #moose is that the channel has lots of perl rockstars and many eyes who are keen and insightful on this kind of topic .
PSGI protocol and reference implementations would not be tied to Moose , or more importantly , any modules at all .
In fact , we should n't worry about the whole Moose vs non-Moose battle with this design , since those who want to run a small app under CGI can write CGI . pm based plain hash adaptor without buying more RAM , while large scale web apps developer can make Moose and FastCGI based adaptor to take the advantage of their 64bit machine with 4GB of RAM .
tokuhirom ++ for bootstrapping the whole thing by JFDI the reference code .
We should start dumping out the specification soon , based on this reference : there 's a couple of things we need to think about how to adopt Python 's callable , Ruby 's iterator or streamable IO object etc .
but hopefully we can come up with a pretty simple but flexible and extensible API for those things .
Hope we could come up with the result soon in YAPC :: Asia 2009 hackathon at Tokyo .
Keep your eyes on , or join us on the development on #http-engine@irc.perl.org .
A chat with Kevin Smith , Kevin Smith interview , The Best of the SModcast , Reaper
Movies Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
Ever since Alanis Morissette released Jagged Little Pill in 1995 , pop culture writers have been obliged to put serious consideration into whether or not they ’re using the word “ ironic ” correctly , lest someone somewhere sneer at them , “ Uh , excuse me , Alanis , but that actually is n’t ironic . ”
But if you ’ve ever listened to Kevin Smith ’s podcasts …oh , sorry , SModcasts … with his longtime friend and producer Scott Mosier , then you know that it is , without question , extremely ironic that Smith ’s best - known character is named Silent Bob .
For those who do n’t have the time to listen to all of the audio archives , however , Titan Books has the perfect solution : a transcription of the show ’s greatest moments , entitled " Shootin ' the Sh*t with Kevin Smith : The Best of the SModcast . "
Bullz - Eye had a chance to chat with Smith about the book , the history of the SModcast and some of the highlights from the collection , but we also had enough time to get an update on the status of “ Hit Somebody ” ( based on a song written by Warren Zevon and Mitch Albom ) , the experience of working on “ A Couple of Dicks , ” and how directing the pilot for “ Reaper ” provided the perfect stepping stone to helming a film that he did n’t actually write himself .
Kevin Smith : Yellooooooo…?
Bullz - Eye : Is this Kevin ?
KS : Yeah , it is .
How are you , sir ?
Nice to talk to you .
BE : You as well .
You and I talked a few years ago , and normally I would n’t expect you to remember me , but we talked about something that I ’ve never heard come up elsewhere : your real - life “ National Lampoon ’s Vacation ” experience at Busch Gardens , in Williamsburg , VA .
KS : ( Laughs )
Too funny !
BE : Now there ’s a topic that I ’m surprised has never come up on the SModcast .
KS : Yeah , so far we have n’t gone over that yet .
But now that you ’ve reminded me , maybe we ’ll bring it on .
BE : For those who only know you from your films , they might actually be surprised that there ’s really precious little about filmmaking within the SModcasts .
Smith 's summary of the SModcasts : " Generally , we just kind of sit around and it ’ll be , like , ' Okay , you and I , Scott , we ’re on an Oceanic airliner and it goes down .
We wind up on the island of ‘ Lost , ’ it ’s just you and me , and nobody else is there … but there ’s the polar bear , the black cloud , and all that shit .
How long before we start fucking each other ? '
And we jump from there and extrapolate . "
KS : Yeah , the SModcast is …I mean , we do n’t really sit around talking about the biz or the industry or what we ’ve done .
I mean , we talk about what we ’ve done by virtue of the fact that it leads to a good story , but not , like , “ Yeah , man , we ’re filmmakers .
Does n’t that rock ?
It ’s so serious being a filmmaker . ”
We do n’t talk about stuff like that .
Generally , we just kind of sit around and it ’ll be , like , “ Okay , you and I , Scott , we ’re on an Oceanic airliner and it goes down .
We wind up on the island of ‘ Lost , ’ it ’s just you and me , and nobody else is there … but there ’s the polar bear , the black cloud , and all that shit .
How long before we start fucking each other ? ”
And we jump from there and extrapolate .
( Laughs ) I mean , to a large degree , it ’s kind of like …remember in “ Clerks , ” where they ’re talking about the Death Star contractors ?
BE : Absolutely .
KS : That ’s the prototypical SModcast right there , you know ?
Essentially .
I mean , somebody described it once by saying , “ It just seems like you spend a lot of time trying to convince Scott or talk Scott into a corner where he admits that he may be gay for a situation . ” ( Laughs )
But , yeah , it ’s nothing … like , some folks have asked , “ Hey , man , you shot with Bruce Willis and Tracey Morgan , you should put them on the SModcast . ”
But it ’s not really about that , you know ?
It ’s not like a chat show or something like that .
I mean , it is strictly a chat show , actually , but not the kind of chat that I guess most people think of .
I mean , I do n’t want to interview somebody on the show .
I just want to have conversations on the show .
BE : So do you go in with a list of hypothetical questions to start the ball rolling , or is it completely off the cuff ?
KS : No , it ’s kind of off the cuff .
I mean , every once in awhile back in the day , I used to bookmark shit I read online that I could pull up , and that could be a topic , but we ’ve done that less and less in the second half of the run , I think .
So generally we just kind of sit down and go , like , “ Do you have anything ? ”
And , shit , 9.95 times out of 10 , he ’s , like , “ Nah . ” And then we just kind of go from there .
Every once in awhile , he ’s got something that he ’ll want to get into , like when he got the vasectomy , or something like that .
But , no , there ’s no real planning .
We just kind of go .
I mean , y’know , maybe the secret is that we keep going .
Like , the show records for two to three hours , and when it goes up , it ’s about an hour , sometimes an hour and change .
That ’s ‘ cause I sit there and take out everything that ’s boring .
( Laughs )
You know ?
Everything that ’s …like , when we go off on those tangents where we start spitting out factoids that are n’t actually accurate or anything like that ?
Imagine four times the length and sixteen times less the interest .
( Laughs )
Sometimes shit like that has to get pulled out , or else people would be , like , “ Boy , SModcast is terrible ! ”
So I pull that stuff out , and then I give it over to Ken ( Plume ) , and Ken lays the beds down , and up it goes .
But there ’s not much planning that goes into it .
I mean , Ken does n’t even really get to plan , because when he gets it , he has to listen to it and then kind of figure out how to editorialize or comment on what we ’re talking about .
So it ’s not like he can sit there and go , “ All right , I ’ve got nineteen songs that I ’m going to put in the next SModcast that goes through , ” because they ’re very , uh , SMod - specific , for lack of a better description .
I ’ve got to tell you : a lot of work goes into something that ’s absolutely free .
( Laughs )
BE : It ’s a labor of love , then .
KS : Oh , totally .
But , like , between me and Mos recording , me editing , and Ken music - editing , then taking it live , that ’s a lot of hours going into it , man .
I mean , I ’d say that we record for two , probably edit for four to six , so that ’s eight right there , and I do n’t know how long it takes Ken , but I have to imagine a minimum of two , and he ’d probably tell you a lot more .
So you ’re looking at at least ten hours per SModcast … but I would n’t have it any other way , man .
This is my favorite thing in the world that I do right now , even way more than the films .
I mean , think about it : the films were kind of meant to communicate , right ?
It ’s a communication medium , film .
You throw something out there into the void , a message , and hope somebody responds back .
I mean , “ Clerks ” in essence … and I kind of view it from this vantage point … seems less like a film to me and more like a very expensive icebreaker , to be , like , “ Hey , my name ’s Kevin Smith .
How are you ? ”
And then everything that follows that is the conversation .
SModcast just takes that conversation even closer to home .
Like , back in the day , it ’d take a year or year and a half from the time you dream up a movie and the time it comes out .
That ’s a long time to wait for a response to a question , so to speak .
SModcast , I throw it up there and I can find out in an hour what people thought of it …and have fun with them talking about it , too .
Mutually appreciating it and shit like that .
Without all the sturm and drang of , “ Wow , it took us four months to shoot that , and so long to edit it , and all the test screenings , and it kind of looks like the script a little bit . ”
SModcast is kind of pure .
Very pure , in fact .
And the fact that it became a book is a very , very fun but stupid development in terms of , y’know , new media stepping backwards into old media .
But leave it to the Brits : it was Titan who suggested it .
" It ’s not like someday my kid ’s gonna be standing over my grave , and somebody ’s gonna hang her a folded flag and say , ' You know what ?
This is ‘ cause he did 24 hours straight on Twitter . '
But it ’s just one of those little personal victories , like , ' I wonder if I can do this . '
And I did it .
A stupid goal , but I accomplished it .
Life ’s all about … for me , at least … having very stupid achievable goals .
That way , you always feel like a winner . "
BE : And who contacted me to let me know about it , in fact .
KS : Yeah , this dude over there , Adam Newell …he ’s the same guy who suggested taking my blog and turning it into My Boring Ass Life …he ’s , like , “ What if we take the SModcasts , transcribe it , and turn that into a book ? ”
And I was , like , “ Dude , people are gonna think I ’m the fucking money - grubbing - est piece of shit on the planet ! ”
But , y’know , I ’m here to tell you that there ’s very little money in publishing unless you ’re J.K. Rowling .
So I was , like , “ I dunno , I do n’t know if this is a great idea , part of the fun of SModcast is listening to it , and without the inflections , would n’t it be boring if you read it on the page ? ”
And he hit me with a file of a transcription that he ’d had done , and it was funny .
It made me chuckle .
And I said to Scott …he ’s the real litmus test , because Mosier hates everything .
He ’s like Mikey from Life Cereal .
He does n’t even listen to the SModcast because he does n’t like the sound of his own voice or something like that …or maybe he secretly hates the sound of my voice , and he ’s , like , “ Ugh !
Living through it once is terrible enough , I ca n’t live through it a second time . ”
But for whatever reason , he does n’t listen .
So I hit him with the file , and he read it , and he was just so into it .
He was , like , “ Wow , man , I would never listen to the SMod , as you know , but I would totally read it .
It ’s fun to read .
We ’re actually kind of funny ! ”
So that ’s when I kind of went forward and said , “ Hey , let ’s do it .
If Mosier can approve of this book , then by all means , let ’s do it . ”
BE : So when you look back at some of the SModcasts in print , are you amazed at how long they go on ?
I mean , the Helen Keller alone translates to 24 pages .
KS : Does it really ?
BE : It does .
KS : You know , the only reason I sensed the time in regards to them was when we were performing it a couple of weeks back .
No , last week , actually .
We did a live SModcast in Red Bank , me and Mos are up on stage , and about an hour and a half into it …I wanted to do two hours , but an hour and a half into it , I ’m kind of losing anything that I had to talk about .
He ’s wonderful , but he ’s…hey , he ’ll be the first one to tell you , “ Ah , I ca n’t generate .
I ’m happy to be the guy who is the other half , but … ”
That ’s why there ’s never been a SModcast with Mosier and someone else .
You know what I ’m saying ?
Mosier does n’t like to drive .
He ’s like a baby in the car .
He does n’t want to drive .
Dude does n’t like to take the wheel .
So at the hour and a half mark , I realized that I did n’t have much left , and I was , like , “ Well , this motherfucker ai n’t gonna help me out .
He never has anything going on in terms of generating . ”
So I was , like , “ I guess we ’re gonna wrap it up . ”
And then I was , like , “ You know , on Twitter lately , I ’ve been getting this question , and I know some people are kidding , but I also know that some people are being really serious , but …they ask me , ‘ Hey , man , when ’s the audio book version of this book coming out ? ’ ”
BE : Seriously ?
( Laughs )
KS : Oh , yeah .
And , of course , I hit ‘em with the link to the SModcast archives and shit .
But Mosier and I started talking about this on stage , and we ’re , like , “ It ’s ridiculous , because why would you record something from the text version of something that we ’ve already recorded once ?
Could n’t you just edit it from there and put it out ? ”
And then we were talking about maybe trying it , just reading the parts aloud and acting it out ?
And everyone was , like , “ Do it ! ”
And someone else said , “ Switch parts ! ”
That ’s where it really took off .
So I ’m up there reading him , he ’s up there reading me , and we ’re doing “ Hero ? ”
And it would n’t end , dude .
( Laughs )
It just went on and on , page after page .
And , now , mercifully , it was very , very funny , and I was crying doing it , because I was reading his parts , and he was pretty fucking funny that day , which I ’d totally forgotten .
But the length of it was something that really took me back .
I was just , like , “ Wow , we ’ve been doing this for what feels like half an hour . ”
And it did take us about half an hour to read that whole chapter aloud .
BE : Are there are any SModcasts where you ’ve gone back and been , like , “ Wow , is there no way to have this permanently stricken from the record ? ”
KS : Uh , not yet , man .
Mercifully , I have n’t encountered something where I ’m just , like , “ Holy Christ , this is terrible . ”
I mean , there are certainly some that are better than others , and there are some that really pop hardcore for me , but none where I ’m , like , “ God , that was bad . ”
On the first one , we clearly do n’t have our voices yet , but you can hear where it ’s going .
Other than that , I do n’t really have a complaint , man .
I actually thought we always sounded fairly decent from the start .
BE : It ’s funny that we ’re talking on a Saturday , since it ’s a primo flea market day , and the story of Walt Flanagan haggling with a flea market vendor over a VHS tape is one of my favorites from the book .
KS : ( Laughs )
That is one of the best ones .
And that motherfucker Flanagan … like , the beauty of Walt Flanagan is that he just never believes anything .
He does n’t believe that people enjoy him or anything like that .
Walt Flanagan currently sits atop the New York Times best - seller list for graphic novels .
Our “ Cacophony ” book was # 1 this week .
Now , I do n’t think our SModcast book is going to be # 1 , but it may wind up …may wind up on a New York Times best - seller list somewhere down the road .
If that ’s the case , then Walt will have been on that list twice in the span of a month , and it would n’t fucking phase him .
It ’s not like he ’d go home and fuck his wife a little harder or something like that , or get blown for his trouble .
You know , he just kind of shrugs at the whole thing , while I ’m , like , “ Dude , you are , like the favorite SModcast guest .
Why ca n’t you embrace that ? ”
But he just goes , “ Ah , they do n’t give a fuck about me .
No one cares .
It ’s just you , dude .
I ’m not stupid .
I know they ’re listening for you . ”
I ’m , like , “ Dude , that ’s not true !
I read compliments about you constantly , where motherfuckers are just , like , ‘ Flanagan : funnier than Smith , ’ and blah blah blah . ”
“ Ah , they just say that because they know you like me . ”
He ’s one of those dudes : he ca n’t take a fucking compliment .
BE : See , I ’ve got boxes of VHS tapes , and now I want to take them to a flea market and sell them so that someone like Walt will come up and try to haggle with me .
KS : Exactly !
BE : Has there been any sort of Canadian backlash over the SModcasts ?
KS : Never .
Never .
Canadians seem to love it more than Americans , even .
I think they kinda dig when we do their voices and whatnot .
If there was any Canadian outrage , it was over Malcom ’s failure to remember who the PM was .
BE : Absolutely .
He was impressive in his …okay , I ’ll say it : his ignorance .
KS : Yeah , it was astounding .
It really was .
BE : And , y’know , a small bit in one of the SModcasts that really made me laugh was when you were talking about your difficulties in watching “ Blue City ” while you were stoned .
KS : ( Laughs ) Oh , man …
BE : I was sent a review copy of that when it was reissued a year or two ago , and I was , like , “ Okay , I think we ’ve figured out why this has gone down as a lesser Brat Pack work . ”
KS : ( Laughs ) I gotta tell you , man : that was perfect SModcast fodder .
I was just … I mean , it had happened very close to when I started talking about it , and I was just very bemused by the whole thing .
“ This movie was defeating me , man ! ” I do n’t know , it ’s just that to invoke that picture … that ’s what SModcast is for .
Who the fuck else is going to be talking about “ Blue City ” in this day and age ?
BE : In one segment , you were talking about mix tapes with your daughter , Harley .
KS : Oh , yeah .
BE : I should perhaps preface this question by telling you that , when I told my daughter that I was going to be interviewing you , she asked , “ Is he the one who looks like you ? ”
KS : ( Laughs )
Oh , that ’s awesome .
BE : And the answer is “ yes . ”
KS : Nice .
BE : As far as your daughter goes , though , has there been any case where you were trying to get her hip to something that you liked when you were a kid and it was just total heartbreak when she did n’t get into it at all ?
KS : No , I mean , I always took for granted that , look , she ’s a kid , so she ’s not going to fucking like the same shit that I like necessarily .
But I ’ve definitely gotten lucky , inasmuch as there are things that I like that she ’s taken to .
Like , she digs hockey , and she digs any movie that I ’m , like , “ Let ’s watch this !
I ca n’t show you all of ‘ Fame , ’ but I can show you the original ‘ Fame . ’
Not Coco with her crying and the nipples and shit , but I can show you when they all start singing at lunchtime and whatnot . ”
And she gets into it .
The kid ’s real into musicals like me ; maybe she ’s a closet gay like me or something like that .
I do n’t know , but she ’s a delight .
Her mother ca n’t stand it .
She ’s , like , “ Ugh , at every turn , she ’s just more and more like you . ”
But it ’s kind of a cool thing , you know ?
It ’s like having a little twin of sorts .
BE : My greatest thrill is that my daughter likes “ Sigmund and the Sea Monsters . ”
KS : Ah , right .
And you ’re , like , “ Oh , thank God : she ’s not an idiot ! ” ( Laughs )
BE : Since you brought up hockey a second ago , let me go ahead and ask you about the status of “ Hit Somebody . ”
What was your experience with Warren Zevon prior to this ?
I mean , obviously , you were a hockey fan , so I can see why you ’d be taken with making a movie based on the song , but …
On directing the " Reaper " pilot and " A Couple of Dicks " : " After fifteen years , I had what they call a sensibility , I guess .
And sometimes that 's what people want : your sensibility .
They do n’t necessarily want your words .
They ’re , like , ' You can hold on to ‘ cocksmoker , ’ but we just like how you do things .
We like how you put things together , and we like how you view things . ' "
KS : Well , I mean , we all know ‘ Werewolves of London , ’ of course , and most of the other bigger stuff .
And when Warren died , it was certainly on my radar , ‘ cause it was kind of a large pop cultural moment .
And , also , there was the fact that he did Letterman ’s show right before he died ... while he knew he was dying , in fact , and talked about it openly .
A dude like that , you ca n’t really not notice , particularly when you like music as well .
I ’m not the world ’s biggest music enthusiast , but there ’s stuff that I absolutely dig .
So this song , though , I did n’t hear it until Ken Plume , our SModcast mixer , sent it to me when I was talking about hockey one episode .
He pitched it over to me , and I do n’t know if he ever used it as the bed under any of the episodes , but he threw me this song .
It sat on my desktop for awhile , and one day I played it , and I was entranced .
I mean , I ’m a big story - song fan to begin with , right ?
Who is n’t ?
But then I was just touched by the song , and I identified with the song , and …I do n’t know , it was pretty intense .
And from that moment forever , it suddenly became about that , thinking , “ I think this could be a movie .
I would like to turn this into a movie , and I ’m going to start pursuing this . ”
And that ’s how we wound up there .
I got in touch with Mitch , and he was the last guy , I guess …well , Warren ’s song , so you ca n’t really get in touch with him anymore , right ?
So I got in touch with Mitch , and Mitch was kind of overseeing it or watching over the rights at this point .
I was , like , “ Hey , man , my name ’s Kevin Smith , and there ’s this song of yours that I ’d really like to turn into a feature . ”
And he did n’t know who the fuck I was , but I knew who he was , of course .
I think it was , like , after a day or two that somebody said , “ You know , the fucking fat dude who made ‘ Clerks , ’ and he went , ‘ Oh , that guy ! ’
But at first , I think he had no fucking clue whatsoever .
But I talked to him for awhile on the phone , and I talked to him over E- mail , and then when I came out to New York to go into preproduction on “ A Couple of Dicks , ” Mitch was actually out here , because he comes out every other week for ESPN , I guess .
He does a talk show on Sunday mornings .
So we were able to sit down out in Battery Park and talk about it , and he could obviously see how passionate I was about it , and finally he was , like , “ Okay , let ’s try this .
I just wanted to sit down face to face , so in case this did become something , I ’d always remember the moment .
You seem like a good guy , so let ’s get going . ”
BE : Awesome .
KS : Yeah , and since then , we ’ve become closer and gotten to know each other a lot more .
A couple of weeks ago , he took me out to the Joe Louis Arena out in Detroit , home of the Red Wings , and we went all throughout the entire place , watched them practice , met the coach and Chris Osgood , the goalie , and basically just lived in Hockey Town for a little bit .
He was an excellent host , but , y’know , dude ’s one of the most recognizable people on the planet in Detroit .
People are , like , “ Hey , Mitch ! Mitch Albom ! ”
So , yeah , it looks like we ’re moving forward on it .
I mean , I ’ve got a shit - ton of notes , and I did start writing the ending already , but …I think December is when I ’m clear from , like , doing a bunch of gigs and Q&As and promoting the book .
I think that ’s when I ’m gonna kick back and actually break the back of the script .
I do n’t know where it ’s gonna wind up .
Naturally , my inclination would be to try Warner Brothers first , given that I just made a movie there , but I do n’t know if they ’re going to be into it .
It ’s not like hockey movies are insanely profitable .
Most sports movies are n’t .
Poor Drew Barrymore ’s movie , “ Whip It , ” seems to be withering on the vine this weekend , even though the reviews were insanely strong .
Anything that ’s not football , baseball , or basketball , generally people in cinema have a hard time going with it .
Unless it ’s boxing , like fucking “ Rocky ” or something like that .
( Laughs )
So hopefully the flick will be this kind of bittersweet …
I hesitate to call it a comedy , but if I ’m involved , then of course I ’m gonna try for some fucking laughs .
Tonally , though , I ’d like to go for something like the “ Forrest Gump ” of sports movies , but not that wide - eyed and wondrous and shit like that .
And the dude ’s not mentally challenged or some such shit .
But just that feel of following a life that intersects with other lives , historically speaking .
“ Dramedy ” some people call it , but I do n’t know if I want to go that far .
I would love to call it a hockey fable , but the problem is that anytime you call anything a fable , people do n’t want to go see it .
( Laughs )
At the box office , “ fable ” seems to be a term that turns people off and whatnot .
So let ’s just keep the “ Fable ” thing to you and me and the people reading this .
( Laughs )
BE : So how was the experience of “ A Couple of Dicks , ” directing something that you did n’t write yourself ?
KS : You know , it was interesting directing something I did n’t write .
I found that I became far more collaborative , because I could n’t consider myself the foremost authority on the subject matter anymore .
Like , on the other flicks that I ’ve written and directed , since I was the author , and since I generated the idea from the get - go , I always had a vision in my head , whether good or back or lack thereof , of kinda what it ’s gonna look like .
So the whole time , whether I ’m writing or in production or post - production , all I ’m trying to do is try and shape it into the image I have in my head .
So that meant that when I ’d get to the set , I ’d be kind of locked into an idea and not really interested in deviating from it that much , and that does n’t leave you open to much collaboration .
Being that I did n’t write the script for “ Dicks , ” I found myself deferring to the writers all the time …or to other people , like the actors or the producers .
I ’d be all , like , “ What do you think ?
And what do you think ? ”
Like , I would definitely kinda get everyone ’s input before making a decision , whereas back in the day , I ’d be , like , “ No , I know what I ’m doing .
This is it .
No , this is it .
I do n’t need it .
I ’m fine .
This is good .
This is it . ”
But on this one , I was able to go , “ What do you guys think ? ”
Then I ’d add to it what I thought and distill it down to what I assumed would be the answer that was in the best interest of the flick itself .
It was a weird process , because I could n’t feel like , “ Hey , man , I know everything there is to know about this , so I got this covered . ”
You know ?
BE : Sure .
KS : On this one , since I was n’t the author , I felt like , “ You know , I ’m going to ask everybody . ”
I was a lot more collaborative by virtue of that , and I think the film got better looking and it plays better .
We started playing “ Beat the Joke , ” inasmuch as …we knew we had a great base with the script , but you ’ve got Tracey Morgan , one of the funniest people in the world , on the set .
And then Sean William Scott , who ’s , again , one of the funniest people in the world and a fantastic comedic performer .
Fred Armisen came in for a day .
It ’s , like , you ’re not gonna tell these dudes , “ Just do the script .
That ’s fine .
All we need from you is the script . ”
We got the script , and then we were , like , “ Give us more , man !
Fucking gravy !
Pour it all over that shit , and we ’ll pick and choose later on . ”
And the movie ’s pretty damned strong .
I mean , when all was said and done , I just had a different idea back in the day , when I was a kid , about what a filmmaker was , or what a director was , or what an auteur was .
I did n’t go for the auteur title , but they throw it on me all the time .
It was always more about , “ I ’ve got it , I ’ve got this , it ’s my vision , I ’m responsible for my vision .
I ’m sorry , I ’ll do it , this is just me , I ’ve got this covered .
Just help me do it . ”
And now I ’m , like … you know , look , yeah , they ’re hiring me to kind of turn in the best version of this movie that I can make , the funniest version I can make , and how I get there does n’t really matter any more .
You know what I ’m saying ?
BE : Sure .
KS : I do n’t have to be a solo sojournist … or sojourner , sorry … going through the process by myself with no input from others .
Now I ’m just , “ Hey , man , if this motherfucker has a good idea , then I ’m totally using it . ”
Why not ?
Why not improve the flick and shit ?
So back in the day , it was just , like , “ No , it ’s all got to come from me ! ”
And the older you get , you realize , “ No , it does n’t . ”
It never comes from one fucking person , anyway .
I mean , it does n’t matter who you are .
Like , look , I love Quentin Tarantino and worship at his altar , but he ’s not the only guy who makes his movies .
Any of his movies .
It ’s “ no man is an island . ”
I was kind of raised and sold as an auteur by Miramax when I was kind of pushed out to be the frontman on the movie by virtue of the fact that we did n’t have any movie stars or anything like that .
That was kind of an era where they were turning directors into rock stars , kinda like they did in the ‘ 70s , so by virtue of kinda being forced out there as the front man , you become kind of a personality for your films as well .
But I would always be out there going , “ Hey , man , I ’m not the only person making the flick . ”
That ’s why you do n’t see a “ A film by ” in the credits .
I did n’t do that .
I wrote and I directed , and that ’s usually what I take credits for .
“ A film by ” just seems to be , like , “ I did this motherfucker by myself , with no aid whatsoever ! ”
It ’s just a little too hoity - toity , to be honest , and it seems disrespectful to the rest of the crew and to everybody who helped make the movie .
Even the cast .
Some guys get away with it .
I mean , Martin Scorsese , when you ’ve got a body of work like that …?
They should treat the “ A film by ” credit like a “ sir ” title over in England : you ’ve got to pick somebody to bestow that on people .
You ca n’t just fucking use it .
It gets used so often .
I ca n’t stand when first - time filmmakers use it , where it ’s , like , “ A Film by Doug Henning , ” or something like that .
It ’s , like , “ Dude , you ’ve never made a movie before ! ” Putting “ A Film By ” is n’t gonna bring one more fucking ass into the seats unless they ’re related to you or something like that .
It ’s the kind of thing you use when you can market off your name .
Like , Tim Burton ’s got a brand .
All of Tim Burton ’s movies kind of have a similar feel and look alike and shit like that .
So if it says , “ A Film by Tim Burton , ” I get it , because they can sell that fucking brand .
Steven Spielberg ?
Sure .
Scorsese , same thing .
But these first - timers are people whose work is , like , non-fucking - descript .
Why they need “ A Film By ” has always been beyond me .
BE : So when you did the “ Reaper ” pilot , was that what you ’d consider the stepping stone to “ A Couple of Dicks ” ?
KS : Yeah , the “ Reaper ” pilot definitely opened the door a little bit , because when all was said and done with it , I felt like , “ Hey , we brought something to the pilot , me and Dave ( Klein , cinematographer ) . ”
Like , you know , I read the script and I watched the pilot , and the pilot was better than the script , and not because , like , “ Oh , I ’m so much better than the chicks that wrote the script , ” but just because I felt like I was able to bring something to it .
Like , there was a reason that they hired me .
But the whole time , I was , like , “ Why did you guys hire me to do this ?
If I did n’t write it , what ’s the point in me being here ? ”
But what happened was that , after fifteen years , dude , I had what they call a sensibility , I guess .
And sometimes that what people want : your sensibility .
They do n’t necessarily want your words .
They ’re , like , “ You can hold on to ‘ cocksmoker , ’ but we just like how you do things .
We like how you put things together , and we like how you view things . ”
So you look at “ A Couple of Dicks , ” and the few people who ’ve seen it already have gone , “ It ’s weird : I know you did n’t write it , but it still kind of feels like your film . ”
And I think that ’s because of the “ sensibility . ”
BE : Last question , to bring it back to the SModcast : do you ever have a problem with your fans being too familiar with you ?
I mean , seriously , somebody you ’ve never met probably knows enough about you from what you ’ve written or said that they could perpetuate having gone to school with you .
KS : Probably .
( Laughs ) Yeah , but , y’know , it would only bother me if I had n’t been the one putting all of the information out there , you know what I ’m saying ?
It would be disingenuous and shitty to be all , like , “ Oh , these fuckers who know so much about me , why ca n’t they get any lives ? ” I mean , all I do is talk about me and my life , so it stands to reason that if they ’re listening to my shit , if they ’re big enough fans to tune in for shit like SModcast , then of course they ’re gonna know a whole lot more about my personal life than most people .
It ’s funny , though , when you meet people who know more about your personal life than family members .
You just want to tell the family members … not immediate family , but , like , my brother and sister , it ’s just , like , “ Hey , man , jump on Twitter !
You ’ll find out what I ’m up to all the time ! ” ( Laughs )
BE : Which reminds me : how did your 24 - hour Twitter - thon treat you ?
KS : I thought it was awesome .
I ’ve been training for it for , like , 15 years , though .
We ’ve been on the web since 1995 , so I guess that ’s actually 14 years .
But I was ready .
I was always curious , because I ’ve spent hours upon hours on the web answering questions over the years , but the one that I ’d never done was do it for 24 hours straight .
I was kind of curious : “ Can I pull it off ? ” And , alas , I could .
( Laughs )
It ’s a mean feat .
It ’s not like someday my kid ’s gonna be standing over my grave , and somebody ’s gonna hang her a folded flag and say , “ You know what ?
This is ‘ cause he did 24 hours straight on Twitter . ”
But it ’s just one of those little personal victories , like , “ I wonder if I can do this . ”
And I did it .
A stupid goal , but I accomplished it .
Life ’s all about … for me , at least … having very stupid achievable goals .
That way , you always feel like a winner .
BE : And , see , one of mine used to be that I wanted to interview Kevin Smith .
: And you did it , dude .
And now you ’re , like , “ Ugh … ” ( Laughs ) You should ’ve aimed higher .

New York City homeless population at an all - time high
By Sandy English and Ali Ismail
21 November 2009
According to a report released last month by the New York City advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless , there are currently almost 37,000 people in the city shelter system .
This includes approximately 10,000 homeless families with 16,500 children .
The number of homeless housed by the city marks an 11 percent increase over last year and is the highest number of people seeking shelter on record .
These figures are all the more significant because they reflect the state of the homeless population before the cold weather has started .
The report notes , “ The growing homeless family shelter population has been driven by historically high numbers of newly homeless families entering the municipal shelter system . ”
In August , over 1,900 families sought shelter in the city ’s system .
For the last fiscal year ( FY ) , over 120,000 homeless people used the city ’s shelters .
The emergence of mass unemployment in the city has been the leading cause of the increase in homelessness .
The official figure now stands at 10.3 percent , with a loss of 111,000 jobs since last year .
Among Blacks and Hispanics , the figure is over 20 percent .
If part - time workers who want full - time jobs and those who have stopped looking for work are counted , the overall unemployment rate rises to 15.8 percent .
Antonietta Bertucci , Director of Part of the Solution ( POTS ) Justice Center , a nonprofit agency that supplies services to the poor in the Bronx , told the WSWS : “ We ’ve seen people that would never have imagined they would be seeking our services .
One woman who came to us is sleeping her car .
She was evicted because she lost her job . ”
The city ’s capacity to shelter the homeless is being severely strained .
Mary Brosnahan , executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless , wrote in the Daily News , “ New York City is in the midst of a homeless emergency . …
As of Sept. 30 , there were only two empty beds left in the entire New York City shelter system for homeless men and only eight empty beds for homeless women — 10 available beds in a system of more than 7,000 for homeless single adults . ”
The city spent over $ 856 million providing these services in FY 2009 .
On November 7 , the Department of Homeless Services announced that it would close the city ’s largest drop - in shelter to make way for the construction of a new subway line .
The Open Door on 41st St. near the Port Authority Bus Terminal serves meals to homeless men and women .
According the Daily News , although the shelter does not have beds , an average of 94 people slept there each night in September .
Robert Hess , the chairman of the Department of Homeless Services , the city will not replace the center , but seek to add beds to churches and synagogues that house the homeless .
But Patrick Markee , a policy analyst for the Coalition for the Homeless , told the News : “ With all - time record homelessness , this is no time for the Bloomberg administration to close the city ’s largest drop - in center for homeless people ” .
Bloomberg ’s policies , like those of his predecessor , Rudolph Giuliani , are more concerned with hiding the homeless from view than with addressing the needs of people in distress .
One of these schemes involves providing homeless individuals and families with one - way bus or plane tickets to wherever they have contacts that could give them a place to stay .
The New York Times reported that at least 550 families have been relocated in this fashion .
City
Hall would much rather ship families off rather than spend the funds necessary to house them .
People have been relocated to many states and to a number of countries around the world .
According to the Times , many of these families are often long - time residents of the city , while others are newcomers .
Hector Correa , an immigrant from Puerto Rico , told the Times , “ I did n’t expect the city to be the way it is .
I was expecting something different , something better . ”
Ruby Davis told WCBS TV that she felt the city was trying to give her the boot when she was offered a one - way ticket to North Carolina , where her estranged mother lived .
She said , “ I did n’t take it because when I was living in North Carolina , I was sleeping on a broken pull - out couch , and I was n’t getting along with my mom at the time . ”
Domestic violence and domestic disputes often lead to homelessness — a fact the one - way ticket program obviously does not consider .
Arnold S. Cohen , president of the Partnership for the Homeless , criticized the policy for failing to address the underlying causes of homelessness .
He said , “ What we ’re doing is passing the problem of homelessness to another city .
We ’re taking people from a shelter bed here to the living room couch of another family .
Essentially , this family is still homeless . ”
In a grotesque scheme , the city ’s Department of Homeless services began charging rent ( see “ New York City demands rent from the homeless ” ) to some families living in shelters in May .
After a public outcry , the city backed off .
Based on WSWS interviews with families seeking shelter from the city , it is clearly difficult for families to obtain services to begin with .
In addition to mass unemployment , the irrationality of the housing market and the very high cost of housing in New York City aggravate homelessness .
Millions of working - class and middle - class people sacrifice huge portions of their income to pay rent or mortgages .
When someone in a family loses a job or has a medical emergency , it can become impossible to pay rent or make payments on a house .
In New York City , however , blocks of units remain unfinished or unoccupied because big landlords cannot make a profit by completing or renting them .
Often wealthy property owners chose to hold back empty apartments from the market , hoping to make a return on them later .
Three years ago , the group Picture the Homeless estimated that 24,000 units in Manhattan alone are empty and available .
The New York Times noted recently that , despite city financing for the creation of affordable housing , over 200,000 apartments for lower - income working - class families have been eliminated since 2002 .
According to data supplied by New York University ’s Furman Center , the city now has only 991,591 units that it considers affordable for families that make less than 80 percent of the city ’s median income , $ 37,000 a year .
This is a loss of 17 percent since 2002 .
Antonietta Bertucci of POTS told the WSWS that over the last year , a number of landlords have taken advantage of a program sponsored by the Department of Homeless Services .
The DHS will pay up to $ 3,000 to rent an apartment as a shelter for the homeless .
This has prompted mass evictions from some buildings , especially in the Bronx , because landlords see it as a way to make more money .
“ They take their tenants to housing court and accuse them of violating their leases , ” Bartucci said .
“ The tenants are obligated to prove that they did not ” .
She added , “ Everybody is suffering because of the recession , including the landlords .
They ca n’t afford their mortgages and pass the cost on to their tenants .
Many apartments are in awful condition .
It is quite widespread in the Bronx for tenants not to have hot water ” .
The housing crisis in New York City and nationwide is so egregious that the United Nations Human Rights Council recently appointed a special rapporteur on the right to affordable housing in the US .
The rapporteur , a professor of city planning from the University of São Paulo in Brazil named Raquel Rolnik , was denied entry into the US by the Bush administration .
Admitted to the US after the election of Barack Obama , she found that little had changed in US government attitudes to the homeless : “ One of the first meetings I had at the State Department , they clearly told me : here , adequate housing is not a human right . ”
The Federal Government has defended carbon capture and storage technology as a viable option for Australia to cut its emissions .
The Opposition 's emissions trading spokesman , Ian Macfarlane , says clean coal technology has passed Australia by and will probably never work .
The Government is putting hundreds of millions of dollars towards championing the commercial use of carbon capture , regarded by many as a key to cutting greenhouse emissions from coal by storing the polluting gases deep below the surface .
The technology was kicked off by the previous government but Mr Macfarlane has gone cold on the idea and says there is mounting evidence to back his pessimism .
The leadership of the Government and the Opposition are pulling out all stops to find enough common ground for the Senate to pass Prime Minister Kevin Rudd 's emissions trading scheme later this month .
Both want a deal and to remove the threat of a double dissolution election , but Nationals Senate leader Barnaby Joyce is doing his best to scuttle the bill .
" Last night I launched an online petition , " he said .
" In the first couple of hours I got 1,054 signatures on it .
That is incredible .
This fight will go down to the wire . "
Mr Macfarlane is no longer sceptical about humans causing global warming but he is now sceptical about carbon capture and storage , something he championed as resources minister in the Howard government .
" The Government 's incentive is just that , " he said as minister .
" It is an aim to bring forward the introduction of this technology into commercial plants as soon as possible . "
Just three years on , he doubts it will ever take off .
" What happened was nothing happened and that is really the problem for Australia , " he said .
" The clean coal option has passed us by .
Twenty years to wait before the technology is available .
Thirty years before it is commercial .
We will need to move on to other options by then . "
' Technology will solve problem '
The Government is counting on locking up a lot of carbon to help cut Australia 's emissions growth from 2035 .
Resources Minister Martin Ferguson has been travelling the world , promoting Mr Rudd 's brainchild - the $ 100 million a year Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute .
The Minister still thinks the technology will work if there is a carbon price to drive investment .
" I actually think we are going to see a breakthrough on carbon capture and storage , " he said .
" I think technology created the problem and technology will solve the problem in terms of reducing CO2 emissions .
All the renewable options , including an initial growth in gas , we are gas rich .
" So we do n't have all the eggs in one basket . "
The two men see eye - to - eye on a lot of things .
Mr Ferguson is a nuclear energy enthusiast but the Government has ruled it out .
The Minister now argues Australia does not need to go down that path .
" Our Government is focused on examination of all clean - energy options , " he said .
" It does not include nuclear .
Perhaps Ian Macfarlane has actually now come clean about the Coalition policy for the next election .
Perhaps he needs to say yes or no to that question today . "
" In the short - to - medium term , obviously we will use gas , " Mr Macfarlane said .
" We could burn gas at the same emissions as clean coal but half the price , because gas is so clean .
But in the longer term Australia will , like all our other economic partners , need to consider nuclear . "
I ’ve been working on , and writing about , running Clojure Wide Finder code .
But I was never satisfied with the absolute performance numbers .
This is a write - up in some detail as to how I made the code faster and also slower , including lessons that might be useful to those working on Clojure specifically , concurrency more generally , and with some interesting data on Java garbage collection and JDK7 .
[ Update : My relationship with the JVM is improving , based on good advice from the Net .
This article has been partly re-written and is much more cheerful . ]
[ This is part of the Concur. next series and also the Wide Finder 2 series . ]
In a comment on my last piece , Alexy Khrabrov noted “ I saw WF2 has a pretty good Scala result , apparently better than Clojure 's — and that 's a year - old Scala . ”
Alexy is right ; my best times were mostly over 30 minutes , while Ray Waldin ’s Scala code ran in under 15 .
There ’s no obvious reason I can see why Clojure should be significantly slower than Scala , and while I stand by my Eleven Theses on Clojure , I was puzzled and irritated .
The following are organized roughly chronologically ; if the narrative is n’t all that coherent , that would be an indicator of me having done considerable thrashing about .
Low - Hanging Fruit ·
The information you can get from the JVM with the - Xprof argument is not brilliant , but it ’s a whole lot better than nothing .
What you want to see in profiling output is a big fat obvious culprit , and I did , and it was the code fragment below , which breaks up buffers into lines ; text is the text we ’re wrangling , first - nl and last - nl are the first and last places where a newline character ( whose value , note , is 10 ) appears in the block .
destination is the user - provided payload function .
( loop [ nl first - nl ] ( let [ from ( inc nl ) to (. text indexOf 10 from ) ] ( if ( < from last - nl ) ( do ( destination ( new String (. text substring from to ) ) accum user - data ) ( recur to ) ) ) ) ) ) )
This sucker was burning well over half of all the CPU .
There are a few things wrong with it .
First of all , since I was already using Java to split up the text , why not do it all at once like this ?
( let [ chunks ( . # "
" split text )
Yep , that helped .
( I ’d actually had it that way in a previous iteration but had unrolled it while fighting a memory leak that turned out to be unrelated ) .
Lesson :
Any time you can package up a bunch of work as a single call into Javaland , that ’s probably a good idea .
Reducing ·
The second thing that was wrong was that I was iterating at all .
Lisps want you to think in terms of lists not their members , and I was n’t .
What I was actually wanted to do was to call the payload function on each line of text , passing the output of each invocation to the input of the next .
And of course Clojure , like any decent functional language , has a nice reduce function .
So let ’s just add a line to that fragment :
( let [ chunks ( . # "
" split text ) ; ... turn " chunks " into " lines " by stripping leading / trailing fragments ... accumulator ( reduce per-line nil lines )
Lispers are now nodding their heads in a despairing of - course - the - moron - should - have - done - it - that - way way .
Me , I like it when a profiler shows me where I ’m being stupid .
Some non-Lispers are probably thinking “ That ’s slick ” .
Most modern languages , not just Lisps , have some sort of a reduce equivalent .
I ’m a bit amused here : this code has ( basically ) a map / reduce architecture , except for I ’m using reduce in the map phase .
Lesson : Operate on lists instead of iterating .
Type Hinting ·
The code was now running visibly faster ; time for another whack at the profiler .
I saw a whole lot of time being sucked up by java.lang .
Class.forName0 .
This suggested to me that the Clojure runtime was spending a bunch of time trying to figure out what type of thing was crossing some method - dispatch barrier .
I already had a wrapper around the user - provided payload function because it has three arguments and reduce wants just two , and to protect myself from Java issue 4513622 .
I seemed to remember from somewhere that Clojure has “ type hints ” , so I looked that up and decorated the wrapper :
( let per-line ( fn [ accum # ^String line ] ( destination ( new String line ) user - data accum ) )
See that # ^String goober ?
It ’s a hint telling Clojure to assume that the incoming line argument is a Java string .
It helped too , quite a bit .
I was sort of irritated at having to hold the system ’s hand like this .
But I think this may be a Release - 1.0 symptom rather than a Clojure design flaw .
It feels to me like there ’s quite a bit more scope for type inferencing , maybe even JIT inferencing at run-time .
Lesson : A little static typing can go a long way .
Reading vs. Mapping ·
My first cut at this problem used Java ’s NIO subsystem ; I ’d noted that java.nio.channels .
FileChannel advertises itself as being thread - safe and furthermore had a map ( ) method for mapping stuff into memory .
So I had this pretty slick ( I thought ) setup where multiple threads would just get dealt out an offset and block size and map successive regions of the file , then do the string - i- fying and splitting .
I was twiddling buffer sizes and thread counts and not observing any real helpful patterns and wondered if I was maybe overthinking the problem .
So I made another version that uses a Clojure agent to synchronize sucking in the data with good old - fashioned java.io. FileInputStream.read( ) and fires off a new thread for each block .
Right off the bat , it was faster .
Experimenting with this one seemed to suggest that it ran faster and faster the smaller I made the buffers .
I ’d started with 64 M and eventually went all the way down to 2M ; 1 M was n’t any faster .
I hypothesize that with the big buffers , the big String . split operation illustrated above was creating too many short - lived transient objects that were overloading the garbage collector .
Lesson : Disk really is the new tape .
Stabilizing the JVM · Early on , when I was fighting a memory leak , Rich Hickey suggested using a smaller heap size .
I did that , and was astounded .
I was now seeing throughput on the order of 50 - 60 M / sec .
But as I watched the program run , I could see that as the program built up its heap to the ceiling ( set via java ’s - Xmx argument ) , it was running much slower , as slow as a tenth of that speed .
When it hit the ceiling , absent other pathologies , it would ramp up to production speed , I assume as the GC got into balance with the rest of the program ’s work .
Since it can easily take minutes for the JVM to expand to fill a 10 G - or - bigger heap , you really can shave a couple of minutes off your run time by giving it a whole lot less .
Yes , this is profoundly counter - intuitive .
Lesson : Measure , do n’t guess .
Happy Dance ! ·
At this point , I was starting to see run-times down well below fifteen minutes , and profiler output that looked like this ( the primitive - Xprof facility gives you a little dump every time a thread exits , which turns out to work really well for me as I ’m running through hundreds of ’em ) :

In other words , the program is spending most of its time using Java ’s regex machinery to grind away at all that text input ; which is I think what you ’d like to see .
This was around 10 PM last Friday , and I was crowing exultantly on Twitter , feeling like a rockin ’ sockin ’ functional - programming ’ concurrin ’ homoiconic wizard .
“ Faster than Scala ” I uttered , incautiously .
Lesson : Read some Classics in transition from the archaic Greek and learn to fear the punishment for hubris , especially public hubris .
Which Wide Finder Was That ?
· Because , you see , I was actually running a Wide Finder 1 program , just computing one little statistic , whereas Ray Waldin ’s Scala code , and the others on the results page , were working on the benchmark from Wide Finder 2 .
It ’s a lot more complex and computes five different statistics which require looking at a much higher proportion of the data .
Well , I thought , How hard can it be ?
Lesson : [ Never mind .
We ’ve all been there . ]
Attitude Problem · I now have one , because it seemed like a lot more work than it should be to code this up .
The stats you want to compute could be called “ hits ” , “ bytes ” , “ referers ” , “ 404s ” , and “ fetchers ” .
So I accumulated results in a map whose keys were : hits , : bytes , : referers , :404s , and : fetchers ; the values were maps whose keys were the URIs and values the in - progress statistics .
So if you want to add increment the : hits value for some URI , you say :
( bump accumulator :hits uri 1 )
Here ’s the bump function :
( defn bump [ accum stat uri increment ] ( let [ totals ( accum stat ) currently ( if - let [ total ( totals uri ) ] total 0 ) ] ( assoc accum stat ( assoc totals uri (+ currently increment ) ) ) ) )
In Ruby it ’d all be a one - liner ...
accumulator [ stat ] [ uri ] += increment
... but then I ’d be promiscuously mutating state and condemning myself to single - threadedness .
Which is what this series is all about trying to avoid .
On the other hand , it says exactly what I want to say without any ceremony or extra arm - waving .
Is there a middle way ?
Anyhow , here ’s my gripe : I started sketching in the code to gather the five Wide Finder 2 stats Sunday while I was watching football .
I spent all day Monday , until late in the evening , getting it all to work ; admittedly , I ’m a relative Clojure newb , but I ’m not that terrible a programmer and I think I ’m actually fairly quick at learning new things .
This is way too long .
The result - merging step in particular gave me heartburn .
If you can merge two maps with Clojure ’s elegant merge - with and you can turn a list - or - vector into another list - or - vector with map , why ca n’t you run a map on a map and get a map ?!?
Now , the situation was n’t helped by the fact that Clojure is after all 1.0 , so its tracebacks are not models of helpful transparency ; also , the code is running in dozens of threads in parallel which made for extra work in tracking down where what provoked that NullPointerException or ClassCastFailure .
Lesson : Some combination of faults in Clojure and faults in your humble correspondent is interacting badly .
Performance · Improved , but not terribly satisfying .
The wrong collection of JVM options can drive this sucker into Garbage - Collection hell .
This is painfully obvious when it ’s going on ; suppose you ’re using a simple monitoring tool like top ( 1 ) while you monitor the output , you can see it trundling along processing 30 to 50 MB/sec and reporting a CPU burn rate anywhere between 1200 % and 3000 % , which means you ’re keeping all the cores and threads pretty darn busy .
Then all of a sudden the CPU drops to around 100 % and the output just stops .
For like 90 seconds or more .
If you ’ve picked a bad combination of options , this happens more and more frequently until you ’re spending way more time garbage - collecting than actually computing .
[ Update : ]
Someone who wishes to remain anonymous read the first version of this piece had a discussion with me about JVM options and suggested simply taking all of them out , except for - Xms and - Xmx to ensure there ’s enough heap ; letting it manage its own GC strategy .
This person turned out to be smarter than the tribal lore I ’d picked up over the years and around the net , and I ’ve managed to stay out of GC Hell for the last couple of days .
On the other hand , after all the profiling and adjusting , my code has grown tons of extrusions and decorations ; here ’s the bit that actually does the work of processing a line of logfile :
1 ( defn proc -line [ line so - far accum - 1 ] 2 ( if ( nil ? line ) 3 ( send so - far merger accum - 1 ) 4 ( let [ accum - 2 ( if accum - 1 accum - 1 ( new - accum ) ) 5 fields (. # " " split line ) 6 ; [ client _ _ _ _ _ uri _ bstring status ref ] (. # " " split line ) 7 # ^String uri-1 ( aget fields 6 ) # ^String uri (. uri-1 intern ) 8 # ^String status ( aget fields 8 ) 9 accum - 3 ( if ( = status " 404 " ) ( bump accum - 2 :404s uri 1 ) accum - 2 ) 10 # ^String bstring ( aget fields 9 ) 11 accum - 4 ( if ( re-find # " ^\d + $ " bstring ) 12 ( bump accum - 3 : bytes uri ( new Integer bstring ) ) 13 accum - 3 ) ] 14 ( if ( re - find re uri ) 15 ( let [ accum - 5 ( bump accum - 4 :hits uri 1 ) 16 # ^String ref ( aget fields 10 ) 17 accum - 6 ( if ( or ( = ref " \ " - \ " " ) ( re-find # " tbray.org / " ref ) ) 18 accum - 5 ( bump accum - 5 : referers ref 1 ) ) 19 # ^String client ( aget fields 0 ) 20 accum - 7 ( bump accum - 6 : fetchers client 1 ) ] 21 accum - 7 ) 22 accum - 4 ) ) ) )
Boy , that ai n’t pretty .
At one point , I was pulling out the fields with fragments like ( get fields 6 ) but that led to some XxxArrayAccessor method bubbling to the top of the profile output .
I attempted to replace that with “ destructuring ” , as in the commented - out Line 6 , but that turns out to be just a macro that apparently generates about the same calls .
I settled on aget , apparently specialized for fishing around in Java arrays .
But you still have to type - hint what comes out of it .
Feaugh .
In Line 7 , you can protect yourself from our old friend 4513622 by either calling new String on the uri , or by interning it , as above .
The former causes more memory stress but , if you can spare the memory , runs faster .
Lesson 1 : I ’m not sure there ’s a clear one here , but it makes me nervous when application code that should be simple is hard to get right , and so far Clojure ’s not making this developer happy the way Matz designed Ruby to .
Lesson 2 : The Concurrency Tax is too high .
Fallback hypothesis : I ’m just Doing It Wrong .
GC Explosion · I accidentally ran an experiment that showed me where a lot of my GC pain was coming from .
Reminder : this works by having one Clojure agent read blocks sequentially and handing them off to threads to process , and build those tables of tables with the results .
When each thread is done , it sends its table off to another agent to merge .
One time , I had a bug that turned the merger into a no-op , the agent was invoked all right but simply ignored the incoming table .
This version ran very fast ; not as fast as the simple Wide Finder 1 code I ’d been working with earlier , but not bad at all , with a lot less GC overhead .
So that code above may be ugly but it actually runs OK .
Here ’s the code that does the merge :
( defn merger [ current incoming ] ( loop [ keys ( keys current ) output {} ] ( if - let [ key ( first keys ) ] ( let [ merge - 1 ( merge - with + ( current key ) ( incoming key ) ) ] ( recur ( rest keys ) ( assoc output key merge - 1 ) ) ) output ) ) )
It ’s iterating all right , but only over the keys of the top - level map , of which , remember , there are only 5 : : hits , : bytes , and so on .
Not much to it , and reasonably idiomatic I think .
But boy does it ever generate garbgae .
I note that in Ray Waldin ’s nicely - performant Wide Finder 2 code he relied on a java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap .
I suppose it ’s unsurprising that that would outperform the sort of pure functional / dynamic code above , but it feels a bit like cheating .
Java Versions and Options ·
My best times for the full WF 2 run are now around 30 minutes .
29:38 with JDK7 , 35:10 with Java 6 .
The results of tinkering with GC options and generation sizes and so on seem insignificant - to - damaging .
In particular then new “ G1 ” garbage collector in JDK7 does n’t seem appropriate for this problem .
What I Could Do Next ·
Use a ConcurrentHashMap like Ray did .
Bring VisualVM to bear on the problem and really do a deep - dive on what ’s happening inside this code .
Try refactoring the app some more .
I dunno .
I still like Clojure and stand by my 11 Theses , but that impedence mismatch with my conventional procedural object - oriented programer ’s mind grows fatiguing .
When even Evan Bayh has given up on bipartisanship , you know the game is up .
As he says , the real debate is within the Democratic Party .
When it comes down to counting the votes on the floor of the House or the Senate , Republicans could n't be more irrelevant .
Transcript :
KING : Are you confident , are we any closer to a bill that can have broad bipartisan support , or are we , in fact , closer to a Democrat - versus - Republican Armageddon in the Senate ?
BAYH : Well , it looks as if it ’s going to be unlikely , to use your term , John , to get broad bipartisan support .
You might get Olympia Snowe .
I mean , Bob Corker ’s a very reasonable person .
We could agree on many things , but there may be some elements in this he just ultimately can’t agree with .
So the real debate is within the Democratic Party .
And even getting that consensus — which I think will ultimately be achievable — is taking time and will be difficult .
" Will it ever stop ?
Yo , I do n't know .
Turn off the lights , and I 'll glow . "
It 's just before 8 a.m. on a recent Friday at Mom 's Kitchen , a country - style breakfast joint in Wellington .
In walks a six - foot - tall , 42 - year - old man in cargo shorts , a navy - blue hoodie , and a black ball cap with the flat brim nudged ever so carefully to the side .
Tattoos cover his body and hands , and his hair — once a tall , creamy - blond pompadour — is now dark , cropped short .
He takes a seat next to a bearded man at the counter , his back to most of the restaurant .
Regulars barely notice him .
Strangers stare for a moment before recognizing him , their eyes tracing the familiar broad shoulders , the staunch jaw , the glowing white teeth .
To the staff here , he 's " Rob . "
But to most of the world , he will forever be known by one moniker : Vanilla Ice .
" ' Morning , Rob , " a smiling waitress says .
" Know what you want today ? "
He does : orange juice , coffee , eggs with extra hot sauce , and hash browns .
" No meat , " he reminds her .
These days , Rob is a vegetarian .
Soon , three of his buddies arrive .
Over breakfast , Rob tells them about getting stopped by a police officer the previous day .
" I was only going maybe ten over when he got me , " he says .
" He 's asking me why I 'm in such a rush .
' What 's the emergency ? '
That kind of stuff .
And he asks me for my license and registration .
I pull it out , and he takes one look at it .
He goes , ' You 're Vanilla Ice ! '
I 'm like , ' Yes , sir . '
He 's like , ' All right , well you drive carefully , and have a good day . ' "
His buddies chuckle .
On this typical busy day , Rob will star in a photo shoot , go to his mechanic 's shop to check on his vintage ' 67 Cadillac , feed his pet wallaroo , and take his wife and daughters up to a weekly car show .
But before all that , he must jump a motorcycle over a monster truck full of people — part of a morning - radio stunt .
The group pays for breakfast ( Rob pulls out a wad of cash with hundred - dollar bills poking out , but one of his friends is a second quicker and gives the waitress a credit card ) , then caravans down Okeechobee Boulevard to a small , private dirt - bike track .
Rob is standing in the mud behind his black Escalade , changing into his motocross suit when his wife , Laura , arrives in her Mercedes carrying their miniature poodle , Teddy .
As Rob takes a few practice jumps on the bike , a swarm of people from a local Top 40 radio station ( WiLD 95.5 ) arrives at the track .
A morning - show DJ and eight other loud young men hop up into the bed of a jacked - up truck .
Most are carrying cans of Bud Light .
One man is dressed as Abraham Lincoln ( " Drinkin ' Lincoln , " he says .
" Great to meet ya ! " )
Rob gives a thumbs - up and revs the engine until it sounds like crackling thunder .
Then he guns it .
He rockets up a ten - foot dirt hill and into the air .
He clears the cab of the truck , sprinkling bits of mud over the screaming drunks .
He twists the handlebars midair for the cameras .
Then he lands hard on the top of the next hill .
The impact rattles his entire body , though he plays it off .
Everyone cheers .
Afterward , taking off his pads and helmet , Rob admits the last landing stung like a bitch .
In many ways , the jump serves as a metaphor for his life : the meteoric rise , the brief time on top of the world , the hard , awkward landing .
Now though , he 's grinning .
" I 'm definitely going to feel that tomorrow , " he says .
" But when you feel the pain , that 's how you remember you had a good time . "
Remember what the world was like in 1990 .
Before Vanilla Ice , radio airwaves were dominated by Phil Collins , Wilson Phillips , Sinéad O'Connor , New Kids on the Block , and a spattering of hair bands whose sole existence seemed to be aerosol distribution .
Maybe it was the daring shiny suits , the fascinating balloon pants .
Maybe it was the novelty of a white rapper .
Maybe it was the hard - to - ignore swagger .
Or maybe it all came down to that irresistible , unshakable , deviously catchy sound :
If there was a problem , yo , I 'll solve it Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Ding - ding - ding ding - a ding - ding
Ding - ding - ding ding - a ding - ding dink
Whatever the reason , within days of its release , " Ice Ice Baby " gripped America tightly , unleashing a wave of consumption like no song before or since .
The single was spun hourly on radio stations from coast to coast .
The video played at least that often .
Cars with neon - lit underbellies and hydraulics blasted the tune in high school parking lots .
Teenaged boys danced across pep rallies , one hand behind the head , elbow out , the other hand grabbing a foot .
A generation of suburbanites was captivated .
Of course , the phenomenon was short - lived .
In just over a year , Ice was out of the spotlight , replaced by darker , ultraserious acts like Nirvana .
The feel - good dance - along sounds soon gave way to Tupac Shakur and gangsta rap .
Vanilla
Ice became America 's favorite joke , mocked as a symbol of the silly extravagance and neon sensibilities of the late ' 80s and early '90s .
With time , though , the vitriol has worn off .
These days , if " Ice Ice Baby " were to come on in a club or at a party , heads would bob , feet would tap , and 30 - year - old asses would inevitably shake in every direction .
Now , the name Vanilla Ice evokes the sweet charm , the unknowing innocence of another time .
In a world of school shootings , mass murders , endless wars , and economic despair , we miss that time .
" These things tend to go in cycles , " says Vanilla Ice 's manager , Tommy Quon , " and that time in history , the period when Rob was the biggest , seems to be cycling around and getting popular again . "
Imagine spending the rest of your life being famous for something you did when you were 16 .
Back then , did you do anything that , in retrospect , seems a little silly ?
Did you incur any funny nicknames ?
Did you , perhaps , do something regrettable with your hair ?
As a teenager who grew up bouncing between divorced parents in Dallas and Miami , Rob Van Winkle had hobbies that included riding dirt bikes , break dancing , and listening to hip - hop music , which was , at the time , still relatively new .
He had a lot of black friends who would tease him , dubbing him " Vanilla Ice . "
He hated the nickname , but the more he protested , the more they used it .
In Dallas , he lived with his mother and stepfather .
" I used to tell my mom all the time that I was gonna be famous for something , " Rob says now .
" Whether it was for racing motorcycles or rap or whatever .
She told me , ' White kids do n't rap . ' "
But by age 16 , he was trying .
He spent hours with his friends , writing short rhymes .
One day , while going through some of his brother 's records , he sampled a riff from the David Bowie / Queen hit " Under Pressure . "
He recorded some simple lyrics about his rapping prowess — " flow like a harpoon , daily and nightly " — and mixed in South Florida references like " A1A Beachfront Avenue " and " Miami's on the scene , just in case you did n't know it . "
He used an old African - American fraternity chant for the hook : " Ice , ice , baby ! "
The entire thing took only a few hours .
Over the next couple of years , he performed live in small , predominantly black clubs around Dallas and Miami .
The crowds were entertained by this young white kid rhyming and dancing all over the stage .
When Rob was 19 , Tommy Quon , a Dallas nightclub owner , began managing him and put together an independent single , a rap cover of the Wild Cherry classic " Play That Funky Music . "
But when a DJ in Georgia accidentally played the B - side , it was that song people started requesting on radio stations across the South .
By the time Rob was 21 , in 1989 , the underground single featuring " Ice Ice Baby " had sold 48,000 copies .
" I thought I had it made then , " Rob says , looking back .
" I was packing these black clubs .
I was opening up for Ice - T , bro .
I thought it was the coolest thing in the entire world . "
Vanilla
Ice debuted around the time that hip - hop acts like Run- D.M.C. and Public Enemy started getting national mainstream radio play .
Corporate music companies noticed a growing number of middle - and upper - middle - class suburban kids listening to urban music .
Each one of those kids represented a tree of cash that could be shaken with every birthday , bar mitzvah , Christmas , and straight - A report card .
What the industry needed was a fresh , clean ( read : white ) face that conservative moms in Topeka , Kansas , and Peoria , Illinois , would n't mind bringing home to little Johnny and Jenny in the form of a new " compact disc . "
Quon started getting calls about his new client , this white rapper , this " Vanilla Ice . "
Big music executives knew that Rob , with his smooth cheeks and million - dollar smile , represented the perfect way to sell hip - hop music to America 's suburbs .
What kid could resist when executives from SBK Records — one of the biggest labels in music at the time — came knocking with millions of dollars and giant recording contracts ?
Who would n't put on the shiny clothes and sign off on the ridiculous biographies as the money piled up ?
When " Ice Ice Baby " dropped , " It was like out of nowhere , more than anyone could imagine , " Rob remembers now .
" I sold 2 million records before we even put out the video .
Before people even knew I was white .
Then life completely exploded . "
Quon put together about $ 10,000 to shoot a guerrilla - style music video in Dallas .
It was a montage of Rob dancing in abandoned warehouses — grabbing his ankle and putting his hand behind his head — and driving his Mustang convertible in slow motion , with the ragtop down so his hair could blow .
The video was an instant staple on MTV .
Wal - Marts across the nation struggled to keep his album , To the Extreme , on shelves .
" Stores were getting truckloads of nothing but Vanilla Ice tapes and CDs and selling out in the same day , " Rob recalls .
At one point , he was literally selling 1 million records a day .
It was the first album ever to go triple - platinum in its first month .
" It sounds like everybody 's dream , " Rob says .
" But it was a nightmare .
It sounds funny , but it was like a prison .
All of a sudden , I 'm surrounded by strangers telling me what to do .
I had stylists and publicists telling me where to go all day from the time I woke up to the time I went to sleep .
I had wardrobe people holding shit up and telling me ' You 're going to wear this when you do this thing and this when you 're on this show . '
I did n't even know these people 's names .
" I was so young .
I did n't know anything about the record industry .
I just trusted these people knew what they were doing .
For a while , it seemed like it was working .
I made billions of dollars for these people . "
The catapult into celebrity was surreal .
He was on hundreds of magazine covers and talk shows .
He went on the Arsenio Hall Show donning shaved eyebrows and a shimmering silver and green space suit with extra - wide shoulder pads .
He had a celebrated cameo in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II : The Secret of the Ooze , which he considers one of the coolest experiences of his career .
Next thing he knew , Rob had attracted the most famous woman in music .
" I had Madonna stalking me , " he says .
" She 's flying me up to Indiana to the set of her movie [ A League of Their Own ] .
She 's taking my shirt off , putting me in her book .
[ He 's featured in her coffee - table picture book , Sex . ]
This is Madonna .
I was just some kid .
It really fucks with your head . "
They dated for eight months .
" We would go out to the movies in these wigs , " he says .
" We 'd go to restaurants in crazy , stupid disguises , and seriously nobody would know it was us . "
Out of respect for his wife , he does n't like to talk about the superstar at length .
Despite the perks , though , Rob says he felt trapped .
" You hate it .
You feel like a puppet .
But you can't just quit .
You look around you and there are 400 people who are supporting their families because of you .
If you quit , they can't pay for their kids ' college . "
Every time he refused a proposal , someone would throw money at him , he says .
" They 'd say , ' Look , the big new thing in rap is slow songs .
LL Cool J has a slow song .
We want you to write a slow song . '
I 'd be like , ' I 'm not gonna write a fucking slow song — are you kidding me ? '
And they'd be like , ' Here 's a check for a million dollars . '
So I sat down and wrote a slow song .
It was a million dollars .
I 'd lick my mother 's asshole for a million dollars . "
Quon says that , at the time , the industry did n't use words like overexposure .
" All publicity was considered good publicity , " he recalls .
All told , " Ice Ice Baby " sold 40 million records .
It remains the highest - selling rap song of all time .
For a span of about 18 months , Rob was one of the most famous people in the country .
Then , the awkward landing .
News spread that the majority of Rob 's bio — and Ice by Ice , the autobiography released by his label — was fictional .
He did not grow up in a gang on the streets of Miami , for instance , or have more than 1,000 motocross trophies .
Rob says that he was paid $ 850,000 to allow an " authorized " label to be slapped on the cover and that Quon wrote the book .
Then came the lawsuits .
He was sued by Queen and David Bowie for using their song without permission .
He defended his beat in an infamous video clip —
" Theirs goes ding - ding - ding dada ding - ding , and mine goes ding - ding - ding dada ding - ding dink " — but eventually paid them $ 4 million .
And there was the movie .
Cool as Ice was written as a modern retelling of Rebel Without a Cause .
The film starred Rob riding a motorcycle , courting a woman on a horse , and using the notorious line " Drop the zero and get with the hero . "
The week the movie came out , October 18 , 1991 , it was a pathetic 14th place at the box office .
( A comedy troupe in Chicago now performs Cool as Ice as a stage show , using a tricycle as the motorcycle . )
There were other legendary tales of fame 's shackles , including one that may have changed the course of music history .
An associate of hip - hop mogul and felon Suge Knight claimed he was shorted a producing credit on " Ice Ice Baby . "
For weeks , Rob says , Knight and his bodyguards would eerily show up wherever Rob went .
" They would n't say anything .
They 'd just stand there staring .
This happened again and again at restaurants and clubs all over L.A. "
He says the whole thing culminated one day when Knight and his bodyguards confronted Rob in a hotel room in Hollywood , California .
Knight asked Rob to step out on the balcony .
" There was n't anybody dangling over the side , but they were definitely strong - arming me , " he says .
" But I signed it over , and that 's how Suge Knight got the money to start Death Row records .
In a way , there might not have been a Snoop or a Dr. Dre or a Tupac if not for that , so the whole thing is weird . "
The entire rise and fall was over in no time .
After
To the Extreme sold 13 million copies in 1991 , the follow - up album , Mind Blowin ' , released in 1994 , sold fewer than 45,000 copies .
America had turned the lights off on Vanilla Ice .
" I had a lot of anger at that time , resentment that this had been done to me , " he says .
" I made a lot of mistakes , but I was young .
Honestly , there 's no way I could have foreseen these things .
Nobody could have . "
Rob fell into all the clichéd VH1 Behind the Music trappings of fame .
He descended into a fog of inebriants .
" My drug of choice was always X , " he says .
" More than heroin and blow .
I could just pop a pill and instantly feel better about all the shit in life .
Of course , the problems did n't go away .
The next morning , things were even worse than the day before . "
For months at a time , he refused to go out in public .
He could n't take being America 's punch line , a Saturday Night Live parody .
" I wanted to completely disappear , " he says .
" I would n't go to the grocery store .
I would n't go to the gas station .
If I ordered pizza , I 'd have somebody else answer the door just so nobody would ever see me . "
Rock bottom , he says , came in 1994 , when he tried to kill himself with a drug overdose .
He took every bit of every drug he could find and laid on the floor , waiting to die .
" Somehow , I lived , " he says .
" I woke up to my buddies dumping buckets of water on my face .
It was right then I decided I needed to start living for me .
I kicked everybody out of my house .
I wanted to start everything over . "
He started racing Jet Skis competitively in Florida .
He met his wife at a Fourth of July party on the water .
He resurfaced publicly in the late '90s , post Limp Bizkit , with a radically new image ( lots of tattoos ) and a rap-metal sound .
When MTV viewers voted " Ice Ice Baby " the worst video of all time in 1999 , Rob was invited to a studio set with Jon Stewart and Janeane Garofalo to smash the tape with a baseball bat .
Although the stunt was supposed to demonstrate that Rob was a good sport , he launched into a rage , destroying the tape , the sound stage , and nearly Jon Stewart .
The next time America saw Rob was a few years later , in 2004 , this time on reality TV .
On the second season of the VH1 show The Surreal Life , he shared a house with late televangelist Tammy Faye , porn star Ron Jeremy , and Erik Estrada , who 'd starred as sexy state trooper Ponch Poncherello on the ' 70s TV cop show ChiPs .
Rob had a few outrageous tantrums , and for the first time , viewers got to see the psychological consequences of life as Vanilla Ice .
It was here , Rob says , that he was first able to come to terms with his role in the world .
" That show helped me get to a point where I could laugh at that image I hated for so long , " he says .
" For a long time , I blamed that image for almost killing me . "
Estrada and Jeremy served as unlikely mentors , urging Rob to be grateful for the experiences he'd had and use his fame to his advantage .
" Those people helped me learn to let go of a lot of the anger I had , " Rob remembers now .
" At one point , Erik sat me down and was like , ' Dude , wipe your ass with those people , the ones who do n't get what you 're all about . ' "
Still , when he was voted off the show , he threw a drum set over Ron Jeremy 's head .
Living as Vanilla Ice has taken its toll on Robert Van Winkle 's soul .
He hides it well , but there are signs : the shifting , suspicious eyes whenever he 's in public ; the guarded language in conversation ; sitting in the back of restaurants so people wo n't interrupt dinner with photo requests and questions like
Do you have any words to our mothers ?
No matter what he does for the rest of his life , Rob knows he 'll never escape the image — the history — of Vanilla Ice .
He 'll never get away from that song , those lyrics , the legacy of so many shiny clothes .
Any attempt to do so would be Sisyphean .
Today , nearly 20 years after the height of his fame , he has learned to accept the life he once hated .
After all , that brief window of superstardom set him up comfortably for life .
Rob lives in a posh , gated subdivision populated with doctors and lawyers and retired pilots .
The county appraiser values the two - story Van Winkle home , which includes an expansive pool and covered hot tub , at around $ 1 million .
" I made some good investments , " he says .
" I did n't go Hammer with my money or anything . "
Still sore the afternoon of the motorcycle jump , Rob opens his home to offer a tour ( guests are asked to remove their shoes at the door ) and share his excitement about recent and upcoming projects .
He has a grand piano and modern art , and for his birthday in October , his wife bought him a telescope that can transform a living room into a planetarium .
Among his handful of Cadillacs is the ' 67 convertible Eddie Murphy drove in 48 Hours .
Nearby are Bucky , his pet wallaroo ( a cross between a kangaroo and a wallaby ) , and Pancho , the family goat .
Rob got Bucky — full name : Bucky Buckaroo Van Winkle — at an auction in West Palm Beach for $ 2,000 .
The pets made the news in 2004 when Pancho nudged a gate open and the duo wandered around town for five days .
Rob had to pay $ 3,000 in fines and cover the damage done to a scratched car in the neighborhood .
Their lifestyle is a comfortable one .
Laura says she likes Louis Vuitton purses in particular because the tiny LVs are also her initials .
Their daughters — Dusti Rain , 12 , and Keelee Breeze , 10 — attend private school .
The girls especially like playing with the old Vanilla Ice dolls when they have sleepovers .
Every so often , someone even pops in an old VHS tape of Cool as Ice and the whole family sits down to watch .
" The girls love it , " Laura says .
" They 're really into horses . "
Dusti's already hinting that she 'd like to be a singer one day .
" She 's good , " Laura says .
" She could be a Hannah Montana type , I 'm sure , if we went that route — "
" No , " Rob says , almost instinctually .
" That 's not happening .
Not for many years .
Kids need to be kids . "
Rob says that being a family man is his " true purpose . "
Over the years , though , the Van Winkles have had a few domestic disturbances .
In 2004 , Rob was arrested for assaulting his wife , pleaded guilty to charges of disorderly conduct , and was sentenced to probation and family therapy .
In 2008 , he was arrested for domestic battery after Laura called 911 saying he hit and kicked her .
She later claimed he only pushed her , and the case was dropped .
" He 's really smart , and it makes him really hard to argue with sometimes , " Laura says .
Any family drama seems muted now , and the couple seems fully devoted to each other .
" He 's very protective , and a protective father , " she says .
" Like a bear . "
One thing you wo n't find along the walls and bookcases in the Van Winkle house : any reference to Rob 's past life .
But a small office near the garage has a handwritten sign taped on the door that says PLEASE DO NOT ENTER .
Rob opens the door .
Inside , stacked in boxes and leaning against walls are all sorts of Vanilla Ice paraphernalia .
The walls are covered with platinum records , People 's Choice Awards , and photos of Rob with MC Hammer and Wilson Phillips .
A tiny Vanilla Ice doll stares out from its original packaging next to a one - of - a- kind Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles skateboard .
There is a special - edition Vanilla Ice Nike shoe , designed in the same colors as the blue and red , smooth silk shirt he wore on the To the Extreme cover .
" It even has the same three stars , " he says with a smile , a hint of pride .
Inside the heel is an image of a tall , coifed , blond pompadour .
Rob says it 's taken two decades of turbulence and " thousands of dollars of therapy " to come to peace with this past .
" I had a weekend that lasted a few years , " he says .
For a second , the trademark meter in his voice stops and the wall of confidence cracks slightly .
" Ya know , I was really lonely .
For a really long time . "
Of all the advice he 's received over the years , he says the words he repeats to himself most often came from , of all people , Tammy Faye .
" She told me , ' We are who we are because of who we were . '
I would n't wish my past on my worst enemy .
But I also would n't change lives with anyone in the world .
I know it sounds weird , but that 's what it 's like to be me . "
Of late , there 's been something of an international Vanilla Ice resurgence .
He just filmed a beer commercial in South Africa that has him lip- synching " Ice Ice Baby " and dancing around a sedate office party in a resplendent silver and blue jumpsuit , sequins galore .
And not long ago , he recorded an Australian Virgin Mobile commercial in which he takes to the streets with a bullhorn and apologizes for " the hairdos , the baggy pants , the scandals , the lies ... and the music . "
He 's also begun filming a new reality show he 's hoping to sell by next year .
It 'll offer an inside peek at his life and family mixed with footage of him performing crazy stunts with his friends .
For one episode , Rob bought an old Cadillac .
He wants to douse it with gasoline , light it on fire , then drive the flaming vehicle off a giant ramp and into a lake .
Back in the living room , Laura sighs .
" We worry about him very , very much when he does things like this , " she says , " but if there 's one thing I 've learned in 13 years of being married to Rob , he 's going to do what he 's going to do .
We just hope for the best . "
And there 's still music .
He just got back from South Africa , in fact , where he played several sold - out arenas .
" I 've been playing all around the globe , " he says , his voice fixed with a trademark cadence .
" I was just in Australia .
I did some dates in Vegas .
I played in Russia and Estonia and all the Baltic places out from under the Iron Claw .
They do n't even speak English most of the time , but they know every single word to ' Ice Ice Baby . '
After all these years , it 's really an amazing thing . "
On December 5 , Rob will host and headline the fourth - annual " Vanilla Ice 's Holiday Block Party , " a public concert on Clematis Street benefiting Toys for Tots .
Erik Estrada will make a special guest appearance .
Last year , Rob collected more than 68,000 toys for the charity and delivered some of them in person on Christmas Eve .
He hopes to top 100,000 this year .
The album he 's working on is called Yesterday Is History , Tomorrow Is a Mystery .
You may never again see him playing a concert in sparkling pants and pompadour , but he 's game for doing a few shows with Hammer .
This year , they played a date in , of all places , Orem , Utah .
In March , they 're slotted to play Wembley Stadium in London .
Being prone to adrenaline - inducing behavior — he 's reached 150 miles per hour in " many , many different cars " — it 's only natural for Rob to ponder what he might want done with his remains when he dies .
Though it makes for rather macabre conversation at a recent dinner .
There are arguments in favor of cremation .
Then for burial .
" Blasted into space " comes up .
Then , of course , there 's cryogenics .
" He 's always talking about what he wants done with his body when he dies , " Laura says .
" Now it 's getting frozen . "
" The Iceman sealed in a block of ice forever , " Rob says , tilting his head in thought .
" I do n't know , there 's just something that sounds right about that . "
A few weeks before the big block party , Rob is headlining a throwback show at the James L. Knight Center in Miami .
Other names on the ticket include Big Daddy Kane and the Sugarhill Gang .
Rob is slotted to play for about 20 minutes to close the show .
This is the first time he 's played this stage in 16 years .
Near showtime , in his dressing room backstage , Dusti and Keelee discuss the potential set list with their father .
" We 're going on soon , " he says to the girls .
" So what should we play ? "
Their favorite is " Ninja Rap , " the song he did for Secret of the Ooze .
Someone taps at the curtain covering the doorway to the dressing room .
The guys from the Sugarhill Gang just closed their set with an inspired version of " Rapper 's Delight , " the song that music critics cite as having launched the hip - hop movement .
For 30 years , the trio has been swaying in front of microphones , reciting " a hip hop the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop , a you do n't stop the rock it to the bang bang boogie . "
They want a photo with Rob .
" Oh yeah , definitely , " Rob says , smoothing out his T - shirt in the mirror .
A little after 12:30 a.m. , fans have been chanting his name between sets all night .
Laura and the girls sit in the fifth row .
Rob busts onto the stage through an inflatable grim reaper .
A friend is jumping around in a Santa Claus outfit and a clown mask .
Confetti rains down on the crowd .
The girls stand on chairs for a good view of their dad .
After two songs that are n't " Ice Ice Baby , " the audience begins to wonder :
Will he play it ?
After a third song they do n't recognize : Maybe he wo n't , they think .
Maybe he does n't do it anymore .
Then Rob strolls to the front of the stage .
" Does anyone want to take it back to the old school ? " he says into the microphone .
The crowd returns a frenzied roar .
The anticipation is palpable .
What 's happening here is not irony or mockery .
These people are here for their moment in another time .
For a few seconds , when he turns just so and the spotlight hits him in just the right way , it looks like Rob actually glows .
He sneaks a quick wave and a wink to his girls .
As the volume of the crowd crests , Rob holds up the mic and lets fly the words he 's said thousands of times now : " All right , stop ! " he begins .
" Collaborate and listen !
Ice is back with my brand - new invention ! "

Our leaders lie to us every day about Afghanistan .
They lie about why we are there .
They lie about what we are doing .
And now they are lying about Australian casualties .
According to Paul Toohey in The Weekend Australian :
In hospitals around Australia , soldiers who have been seriously wounded in Afghanistan are checked in under false names in order to protect them from the public eye .
Our leaders do n’t want us to know the reality of what is happening in Afghanistan .
They do n’t want us to know we are killing innocents there .
They do n’t want us to know our hit squads are killing Afghan leaders .
They do n’t want us to know the Afghans are fighting back and maiming Australian invaders .
So they hide the truth in our hospitals .
They ca n’t hide those killed there so the liars turn their deaths into a patriotic circus .
To the liars we are just the dumb schmucks who ca n’t be trusted with the truth .
They fear that if we knew the truth , some of us , god forbid , might begin to question having our troops killing Afghans for .. well , exactly what for ?
For democracy ?
The Karzia government has no legitimacy .
It rigged the recent vote .
For women ’s liberation ?
The Karzai Government legalised rape in marriage and its girls ’ schools are just for consumption on TVs in western lounge rooms .
Its real policy is to oppress women .
For stability ?
We have been there years and despite the death and destruction we have unleashed , there is no stability .
The Taliban on the other hand were a stable government with control over about 85 percent of the country .
To end ‘ terrorism ’ ?
We are the terrorists .
To end corruption ?
This Karzai Government is made up of corrupt war lords and war criminals .
They thrive and survive on the drug trade .
Australian troops are in Uruzgan Province , with the Dutch providing the main contingent .
( They will leave next year . )
The Dutch commissioned a report by The Liaison Office , an Afghan non-government organisation , on the Province .
The report found that in four sectors of the province the situation is actually worse than before we went in .
The Taliban have a shadow Government there ready to assume power .
The Afghans in Uruzgan do n’t support our puppets , a pack of corrupt , crooked criminals .
The resistance , what the invaders label the Taliban , now challenge for power in large swathes of the country .
Their victory seems almost inevitable .
The Russian imperialists could n’t beat the mujaheddin , despite having over 100,000 troops there every year for over 8 years .
What makes the American imperialists , hated as much as the Russians , think they can achieve what the Soviets could n’t ?
The time has come to challenge our liars about Afghanistan .
Let ’s build a mass movment to bring Australian troops home .
Holidays are a favorite target of horror films dating back to original slasher classics like Black Christmas and Halloween . Â

Researchers in MIT 's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering believe they have pinpointed a pathway by which arsenic may be contaminating the drinking water in Bangladesh , a phenomenon that has puzzled scientists , world health agencies and the Bangladeshi government for nearly 30 years .
The research suggests that human alteration to the landscape , the construction of villages with ponds , and the adoption of irrigated agriculture are responsible for the current pattern of arsenic concentration underground .
The pervasive incidence of arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh and its link to drinking water were first identified in the scientific literature in the early 1980s , not long after the population began switching from surface water sources like rivers and ponds to groundwater from newly installed tube wells .
That national effort to decrease the incidence of bacterial illnesses caused by contaminated drinking water led almost immediately to severe and widespread arsenic poisoning , which manifests as sores on the skin and often leads to cancers of the skin , lung , liver , bladder and pancreas .
Since then , scientists have struggled to understand how the arsenic , which is naturally occurring in the underground sediment of the Ganges Delta , is being mobilized in the groundwater .
By 2002 , a research team led by Charles Harvey , the Doherty Associate Professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at MIT , had determined that microbial metabolism of organic carbon was mobilizing the arsenic off the soils and sediments , and that crop irrigation was almost certainly playing a role in the process .
But the exact sources of the contaminated water have remained elusive , until now .
In a paper appearing online in Nature Geoscience Nov. 15 , Harvey , former graduate students Rebecca Neumann and Khandakar Ashfaque and co-authors explain that ponds excavated for the purpose of providing soil to build up villages for flood protection are the source of the organic carbon that presently mobilizes the arsenic in their 6 - square - mile test site .
The carbon settles to the bottom of the ponds , then seeps underground where microbes metabolize it .
This creates the chemical conditions that cause arsenic to dissolve off the sediments and soils and into the groundwater .
The researchers also found that in their test area , which is flooded by annual monsoons , the rice fields irrigated with arsenic - laden water actually serve to filter out much of the arsenic from the water system .
" Our research shows that water from the ponds carries degradable organic carbon into the shallow aquifer .
Groundwater flow , drawn by irrigation pumping , transports that pond water to the depth where dissolved arsenic concentrations are greatest and where it is then pumped up into the irrigation and drinking wells , " says Harvey .
" The other interesting thing we found is that the rice fields are a sink of arsenic -- more arsenic goes in with the irrigation water than comes out in the groundwater . "
Scott Fendorf , a professor at Stanford University who studies arsenic content in soils and sediments along the Mekong River in Cambodia , says Harvey 's previous research , published in 2002 , " transformed the scientific community 's outlook on the problem . "
The current work , he adds , has two big ramifications : " It shows that human modifications are impacting the arsenic content in the groundwater ; and that while the rice cropping system appears to be buffering the arsenic , the ponds excavated to provide fill to build up the villages are having a negative impact on the release of arsenic . "
Neumann , now a postdoctoral associate at Harvard University , took seven trips and spent nearly a year doing fieldwork in Bangladesh , studying the hydrologic behavior and chemical nature of rice fields and ponds , and performing tests on rice field and pond waters to determine if the organic carbon in these water bodies would stimulate arsenic mobilization .
She and Ashfaque developed an understanding of the surface and underground water flow patterns over a seven - year period , using natural tracers and a 3 - D model to track rice field and pond water as it traveled into and through the subsurface .
" When we compared the chemical signatures of the different water sources in our study area to the signatures of the aquifer water , we saw that water with high arsenic content originates from the human - built ponds , and water with lower arsenic content originates from the rice fields , " says Neumann .
" It 's likely that these same processes are occurring at other sites , and it suggests that the problem could be alleviated by digging deeper drinking water wells below the influence of the ponds or by locating shallow drinking wells under rice fields . "
The researchers suggest that irrigation wells remain at the shallow level .
At 159 million people , Bangladesh is the seventh most populous country in the world , and it is growing quickly .
That means that new tube wells and ponds are being dug every day to accommodate the growing population .
Most of those wells are being drilled to less than 100 feet .
At that depth , they draw water directly from the contaminated shallow aquifer .
Holly Michael , a professor at the University of Delaware and former PhD student in the Harvey Lab , also studies the physics of groundwater flow and transport of the dissolved arsenic in Bangladesh , but in the deeper aquifer .
" Charlie 's team is looking at the impacts at and near the surface , and my team is looking at the potential impacts of human activities at depth , " says Michael .
" My team found that if only the drinking - water wells are put into the deep , low - arsenic parts of the aquifer -- at depths greater than 450 feet -- then it is likely that the supply of low - arsenic water will continue for a very long time over much of the arsenic - affected area .
Because so much more water is pumped for irrigation , it is important that irrigation wells are not installed deeper , as this would likely cause high - arsenic groundwater to flow downward toward the wells . "
Harvey estimates that the prevalence of arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh is approximately 2 million cases and that the incidence of death from arsenic - induced cancer will rise to approximately 3,000 cases per year if consumption of contaminated water continues .
He and a team of environmental scientists and physicians are making plans for a multi- year study that would provide deep wells for two villages in Bangladesh whose inhabitants suffer from arsenic poisoning .
There they would combine continual testing of the well water and hydrogeological modeling of the groundwater system with a study of how the clean water effects the villagers ' health , placing special emphasis on the neurological development of children .
" There are all sorts of studies to show how arsenic hurts people .
We 're trying to turn it around and show how removal of the arsenic will help them , " says Harvey .

This topic is very prominent in the news right now , and rightly so .
Dr. Jack Kervorkian ( AKA Dr. Death ) has recently published a book – When the People Bubble POPs is a clear and detailed analysis of human overpopulation of Planet Earth .
“ Not many of us know what chaos really implies : it is
usually defined as confusion , a mixed mass without due
form or order .
Life under such conditions is unimaginable
if not experienced first - hand .
And it is inevitably coming
for all humanity to experience as part of a cataclysm of
monumental magnitude caused by the “ crime ” of
widespread “ biocide ” and the involuntary suicide now
being senselessly committed by the kind of serial biological
killers called us . ”

From the introduction –
This is a very unusual book , which it is meant to be .
Parts of it , like fiction , would seem to overstep one ’s
conventional idea of ordinary propriety as well as limits of
decently fanciful human imagination .
But some readers will
persevere out of piqued curiosity underscored by an
uneasy feeling that the book ’s message , no matter how
outlandish it may at first strike one to be , somehow seems
relevant and important to one ’s own existence .
Others may
choose to read on merely because they find the book ’s
pretentiously farcical seriousness somewhat amusing .
Nevertheless , I trust that every reader will in the
end conclude that such judgments should be of little
concern and that what really matters is reflection on its
dour message , which must be pondered by every sentient
person of every color and race everywhere on this ailing
earth .
To many , the message may be unconvincing ,
ludicrous , and totally incapable of provoking action on any
of the extraordinary and weighty , even revolutionary ,
corrective or preventive measures called for .
Therefore , it
is imperative that this book ’s message be deeply and
permanently ingrained in human consciousness — that this
book at least be read .
And , for that alone , I thank you .
This book contains his theories on how to overcome our
population issues – some of which you will find disturbing !!

Get ready for the battle of TARP .
President Obama wants to use money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program -- so - called " bailout money " -- to provide loans to small businesses to hire more people , as well as reduce the federal budget deficit .
The program was due to expire this year , but Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said today he is extending it until Oct.

Republicans , meanwhile , are moving to end the TARP program sooner rather than later ; they argue that all the money unused or repaid by bailed - out banks should go to debt reduction .
" It should n't be recycled , respent , reused , and allowing TARP to become what is essentially a political slush fund , " said Sen .
John Thune , R - S.D .
During his jobs speech Tuesday , Obama said untapped TARP money can be used to reduce the deficit and help small businesses .
He said the program is expected to cost $ 200 billion less than once thought , in addition to the repayments by banks and other financial institution that got TARP money .
" This gives us a chance to pay down the deficit faster than we thought possible and to shift funds that would have gone to help the banks on Wall Street to help create jobs on Main Street , " Obama said .
Some of that debate takes place later this morning , as Obama discusses his new jobs plan with members of Congress from both parties .

KABUL — The U.S. military has announced the opening of a new prison on Bagram Air Base .
The prison , costing 60 million dollars , will hold up to 1,100 prisoners at any one time .
U.S. Brig . Gen. Mark Martins , a U.S. Army lawyer who undertook an examination this year of Afghan and American prisons , said that the prison would be handed over to the Afghan government , though it is unclear when that handover will take place .
Last week , reporters were taken on a tour of the facility , a dramatic move by the military , as no journalists — and few visitors of any kind — were allowed inside the old prison .
The tour was part of a U.S. effort to show more transparency .
Washington has been accused of a variety of human rights violations against Afghan detainees at Bagram .
Brig .
Gen Martins stressed that " vocational training " will be available at the facility , to give job skills to those who have been held there .
A review board , which examines prisoner ’s cases , will sit at the new jail as well as provide resources for prisoners to challenge their detention through legal means .
By the end of this year about 700 prisoners from the old Bagram prison will be transferred to the new facility .
Abdul Qadir Adalat , a deputy at the Ministry of Justice , says that the construction of this facility is a positive step .
Though he just learned about the new prison " last Thursday , " he said the fact that Afghan and international security forces will be conducting joint operations to apprehend anti-government fighters is a good thing .
But some legal analysts say that a foreign power building a prison on Afghan soil to hold Afghans without charge is in fact illegal .
Nasrullah Stanikzai , professor of law at Kabul University , says that according to Afghan and international law , the right to hold citizens against their will belongs solely to a nation ’s government .
He described the act of building such a prison on Afghan soil without being subject to Afghan laws as a revocation of Afghanistan ’s independence .
" Article Two of Afghan prison law says that building prisons and incarcerating citizens can only be done with the approval of the attorney general and the high court , " said Stanikzai .
" Additionally , only the Ministry of Justice is authorized to arrest and detain individuals .
This prison , " he adds , " is illegal . "
Meer Ahmad Juyehdah , a member of parliament , echoes this sentiment .
" It is the government ’s duty to deal with enemies of the state and criminals . "
He says that the fact such prisons exist lead Afghans to question just who is in charge in this country .
Despite these protests , the new facility should be an improvement over the old .
Fareed Hamidi , commissioner of Afghanistan ’s Independent Human Rights Commission ( HRC ) , says that the rooms where the detainees will live as well as other on - site spaces were built in accordance with international standards of detention .
" The Human Rights Commission ’s concern , " says Hamidi , " is the way prisoners are dealt with .
Are international principles , rules and standards followed or not ? "
Hamidi says that one of the jobs of his group is to monitor conditions in jails .
Given that organizations like the HRC are usually not allowed into military prisons , keeping tabs on prisoner treatment will be difficult .
He adds that detainees will have access to non-attorney advocates , but the fact that the length of their detention is indefinite raises serious concerns .
Hamidi asserts that those held at Bagram have not been found guilty of any crime and no Afghan court has seen evidence against them .
What is known is that prisoners have been treated severely at the old Bagram facility .
In 2002 , two prisoners died there after severe beatings , which included chaining the men to the ceiling and beating their legs .
A military coroner ’s report likened the condition of the bodies to those that had been run over by a bus .
Last summer , a BBC report featured interviews with dozens of men who were detainees at Bagram between 2002 and 2008 .
The men told the reporters that they faced cruel punishment , including severe beatings .
" They put a pistol to my ear , " said one man .
" They said I had to speak or be shot . "
" They did things you would not do against animals , let alone humans , " said another .
Such reports led some to label Bagram " The new Guantánamo , " referring to the U.S. military detention center in Cuba .
Upon becoming the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan , General Stanley McCrystal made clear that he wanted to reform the treatment of detainees at Bagram .
A detainee review board is part of this reform process , and the new facility has space for the review board to meet .
The board would give detainees the opportunity to challenge their detention and even present evidence on their own behalf .

Los Angeles , California ( CNN ) --
The sudden end to a legal battle between dethroned Miss California USA Carrie Prejean and pageant officials was prompted by the revelation of a " sex tape , " according to a source familiar with the lawsuits ' settlement .
Prejean was fired in June after lingerie - modeling photos of her emerged that pageant officials said were a breach of her contract .
Prejean sued the pageant in August , arguing her firing was religious discrimination because of her opposition to same - sex marriage .
Pageant officials countersued last month , demanding their former beauty queen repay $ 5,200 in pageant money spent for her breast implants and give them all proceeds from a book she 's written .
A settlement of both lawsuits was signed in New York Tuesday , but no details were made public .
Lawyers and parties for each side were bound by a confidentiality pledge , according to the source .
The veil of secrecy was partially lifted Wednesday after celebrity gossip
Web site TMZ reported the deal was sealed after pageant lawyers presented an " extremely graphic " home video involving Prejean .
TMZ Managing Editor Harvey Levin said during a webcast Wednesday that he obtained the Prejean video during the summer , but found it " too racy " to post on his site .
He indicated Prejean was alone in the video .
The source with knowledge of the settlement talks told CNN those details were accurate .
Prejean 's lawyer , Charles LiMandri , responded with a short statement issued through an employee at his law office .
" It 's a confidential settlement , and he can't discuss it , " the statement said .
Several calls and e-mail to Prejean 's publicist were not returned Wednesday .
Prejean 's tell - all book hits bookstores next week , and she is scheduled for media interviews to promote it .
Pageant spokesman Kenn Henman said Tuesday the settlement means all lawsuit demands are dropped .
The pageant had claimed that the contract she signed when she entered their competition last year gave the pageant the rights to anything she wrote .
The settlement ended that claim .
Pageant officials also dropped their attempt to be repaid for her breast enhancement , which was done before she represented California in the Miss USA competition , according to Henman .
Prejean , in exchange , withdrew her suit accusing the pageant of violating her privacy by confirming to reporters that her breasts were enhanced , Henman said .
" We are moving forward from the past and looking towards the crowning of two winners and the new look of the upcoming Miss California USA pageant , telecast live on November 22 , " pageant Executive Director Keith Lewis said Tuesday .
" We 're back in the business of beauty , " he told CNN .
There was nothing pretty about the public fight that began in April when Prejean , 22 , stepped into controversy by declaring her opposition to same - sex marriage while answering a judge 's question at the Miss USA pageant .
Prejean finished as first runner - up .
While state and national pageant officials publicly supported her initially , their opinions eventually changed after she continued to make public statements about same - sex marriage .
She held onto her crown through May , despite a series of questionable photos that emerged on gossip Web sites .
Those images showed a topless Prejean , photographed from behind .
She was dethroned in June by Miss USA pageant owner Donald Trump amid growing complaints by state officials that she was uncooperative and not meeting her contractual obligations .
Prejean filed her lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court in August , claiming that her firing was religious discrimination because of her stand against same - sex marriage .
The pageant 's countercomplaint said what it called Prejean 's belligerent behavior , lack of cooperation and contract breaches caused her firing , not her opposition to same - sex marriage .
In what may be the first recorded instance of a Muslim wife attempting to murder her husband for not being pious enough , a Staten Island woman was charged this week with attempted murder , assault and criminal possession of a weapon .
Rabia Sarwar , a 37 - year - old Muslim , said she did it because her husband , a 41 - year - old Pakistani native , enjoyed booze and pork and wanted her to dress in revealing clothes .
( She held fabric over her face and threw a shawl over her head before leaving court on Thursday . )
While the Sarwar case is sensational by dint of the role - reversal and the method of attempted murder ( throat - slitting ) , it ’s also pedestrian :
Over the past two years , there have been about a dozen attempted or successful honor killings committed in the US .
Last week in Arizona , an Iraqi - born man tried to kill his 20 - year - old daughter because she wanted out of her arranged marriage ; he escaped .
In July , a 17 - year - old named Rifqa Bary ran away from home because , she said , her Muslim family would literally kill her for converting to Christianity .
( She has been ordered by a Florida court to return to her home state of Ohio , where she will appear before another judge . )
So :
Why is there such a recent spate of honor killings in America ?
What does it mean when a woman tries to exact the same vengeance that ’s been wreaked upon her gender by men for centuries ?
“ This is not a reverse honor - killing — it ’s martyrdom , ” says Islamic apostate and activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali , herself the target of death threats .
“ It ’s a ticket for heaven for her , to clear her books .
The only exception that ’s made for a wife or daughter to disobey her husband or father is if he forces her to do something that ’s un-Islamic .
This is a message to other Muslims : ‘ This man is defying God .
What am I supposed to do ? ’ ”
“ The vast majority of honor killings do appear to be cases where there is some attempt to violate or leave [ Muslim ] cultural norms , ” says David Bryan Cook , associate professor of religious studies at Rice University .
“ They ’ve been going on in the US and Britain for a number of years , but in the recent past they ’ve gotten a lot more publicity . ”
Barring terror attacks , independent Muslim expression of anti-Western sentiment seems to be more virulent in Europe .
There was the 2004 daylight assassination of filmmaker
Theo van Gogh by the same Muslim extremist who also targeted his collaborator Hirsi Ali ; the riots and death threats issued after the publication of a cartoon that was critical of Islam in a Danish newspaper in 2005 .
Some believe that the sheer vastness of the US has kept such incidents largely off the radar .
“ We ’ve not been seeing it yet because our country ’s so big , ” says Amil Imani , who was born in Iran but raised in the US , and is the founder of Former Muslims United .
He points to the recent killing of a radical imam in Michigan , who hoped to carve out a separate Islamist state in the Midwest , as evidence that America has more to worry about than it may be aware .
“ Look at what is going on in England , which is almost identical to our culture , ” he says .
“ Stealth jihad is happening in America before our eyes . ”
Does Hirsi agree with this assessment ?
“ Oh yes , oh yes , ” she says .
“ Believe me .
Yes .
The kind of American Muslim you ’re seeing now is changing — not because America is changing , but because the world is .
Someone from Pakistan is coming here not for freedom , but to escape a horrible situation .
[ Once here ] , they are being radicalized . ”
Imani also believes that the fear and loathing of the West tends to be a generational thing ; kids born and raised in America by Muslim immigrants tend to reject such orthodoxy , while older Muslims embrace it .
“ In the privacy of their home , Muslim parents will call every American woman a prostitute , every man corrupt , ” Imani says .
“ People who are 20 and over , who have lived in Muslim countries — they cannot handle American culture .
This case is very new , very rare .
But you have n’t seen anything yet . ”
Ich sehe den Reizthemen “ Leistungsschutzrecht fÃ¼r Verlage ” und “ bezahlte Inhalte ” sehr gelassen entgegen .
Es ist die freie Entscheidung der Verlage , wie sie mit den Texten , die durch sie verÃ¶ffentlicht werden , umgehen .
Und es ist die freie Entscheidung der durch Medienbeihilfe ins Amt gekommene Koalition zweier Klientelparteien , wie sie ihre SteigbÃ¼gelhalter entlohnen .
Ich bin so gelassen , weil der Blick auf die Entwicklung des Verlegerwesens zeigt , dass es nichts bringt .
WÃ¤hrend die erklÃ¤rten Hauptgegner der Verlage im Fall von Google eine einzigartige Erfolgsgeschichte schrieben und im Fall der angeblich klauenden Blogger , wenn es nicht gerade erklÃ¤rte Inhaltelutscher und Aggregatoren sind , auch ohne Medien existieren – wer wÃ¼rde beispielsweise den Dreck klauen , den man in der Springer - Welt findet – haben die Verlage die letzten 20 Jahre nur an der Kostenfront in ihren HÃ¤usern Erfolge vorzuweisen .
Das hat nur begrenzt mit dem Internet zu tun ; die Menschheit hat sich einfach weiter entwickelt und mÃ¶chte den Horizont nicht mehr durch schwarzbraube VerlegerpersÃ¶nlichkeiten begrenzt sehen , die mit der Politik ins Bett steigen , wann immer es nÃ¼tzlich ist .
FrÃ¼her war das , was die Regionalzeitung schrieb , Gesetz .
Heute ist das gerade noch mal bei den zurÃ¼ckgebliebenen Ãsterreichern mit der Kronenzeitung so .
Ansonsten hat das Internet – und nicht allein Google – den Zerfall dieser Bindungen beschleunigt .
Heute sind die meisten Verlage hocheffiziente Kostenstellen , deren Mitarbeiter nach 20 Jahren Entrechtung und Entlassungsrunden oft gar nicht mehr wissen , warum sie in den Journalismus gegangen sind .
Die Erfahrung aber lehrt , dass hocheffiziente Firmen auch nichts bringen , wenn man sie sich den Markt neu erschliessen mÃ¼ssen .
Mit den neuen Strategien stehen die Verlage vor neuen Herausforderungen , denn sie mÃ¼ssen etwas bieten , wofÃ¼r man zahlt , und sie mÃ¼ssen damit rechnen , dass Google , das damit angegriffen werden soll , bislang immer einen
Weg gefunden hat , auf MÃ¤rkten aktiv zu werden , die andere abschotten wollten .
Sprich , wenn bezahlte Inhalte Geld bringen sollen , mÃ¼ssen Verlage mit ungewissem Ausgang in bessere Inhalte investieren .
Es muss besser sein als E - Paper , es muss besser sein als die Blogs , die sie bislang betreiben und besser als der MÃ¼ll , den Newsdesks kostenoptimiert verbrechen .
Entweder es wird teuer .
Oder schlecht .
Vielleicht sogar beides .
Aber es lÃ¤sst FreirÃ¤ume .
Wer mit Bezahlschranken Mauern im Internet baut , gibt Marktanteile auf .
Die Bindung der Leser an Onlinemedien ist so miserabel , dass die meisten eben nicht zahlen werden , sondern Alternativen suchen .
Diese den Verlagen wegbrechenden Leser sind ein Markt , von dem man profitieren kann .
Ob das jetzt nur Spiegel Online ist , die sich sicher schon Ã¼ber steigende Leserzahlen freuen , oder ob das auch Blogs sind , liegt an den Bloggern selbst , und ihrer FÃ¤higkeit , Alternativen anzubieten .
Verlage , die unter das Leistungsschutzrecht fallen , sind ja nicht die einzige Quelle , die man erschliessen kann .
Und mit dem Abschotten von Medien und fallenden Nutzerzahlen wird auch ein Teil des Werbemarktes frei .
Kurz , das sind eigentlich wirklich gute Zeiten , wenn es sowas wie gute Blogs mit Breitenwirkung in Deutschland gÃ¤be , und nicht nur den den immer gleichen netzaffinen Schrott , den Carta , Turi , Netzwertig und andere so rausblasen .
Wenn die “ Szene ” etwas geschaffen hÃ¤tte , das in die LÃ¼cke stossen kann – aber man soll die Hoffnung bekanntlich nie aufgeben .
Vermutlich aber wird es mal wieder Google nutzen .
Sollten die Verleger wirklich , wie angekÃ¼ndigt , Google ausgrenzen und Microsoft einen exklusiven Deal anbieten , zeigen sie auch diesmal wieder , dass sie nichts verstanden haben :
Sie sind nach globalen MassstÃ¤ben zu klein .
Deutsche Medien kÃ¶nnen am Ende der Fahnenstange der deutschen Lobbywirtschaft die Stiefel lecken und der Politik den SteigbÃ¼gel halten .
Global betrachtet sind sie irrelevant .
Und der Dreck , den sie bei Google News abkippen – wie billig man den machen kann , zeigen sie selbst .
Sollte Google auf die Idee kommen , statt der verhinderten Suche von Inhalten eine Mischung anzubieten aus Medien , die aus der Verlegerfont ausscheren , und selbst erstellten Inhalten , kÃ¶nnte es spannend sein zu sehen , was Lesern nÃ¤her liegt : Blattbindung oder Bindung an die GeldbÃ¶rse .
Zumal Google noch nicht mal angefangen hat , die aktuelle Version von Google News aktiv zu bewerben .
Da sind noch viele Potenziale .
Im Kern aber muss ich sagen : Jedes StÃ¼ck von Springer und Murdoch , das hinter einer Bezahlwand verschwindet , steigert die QualitÃ¤t des Internets .
Also , sperrt Euch ein !
Baut mÃ¶glichst hohe Mauer !
Und krepiert dahinter !
Es wird unser aller Schaden nicht sein .
At a covert forward operating base run by the US Joint Special
Operations Command ( JSOC ) in the Pakistani port city of Karachi , members
of an elite division of Blackwater are at the center of a secret program
in which they plan targeted assassinations of suspected Taliban and Al
Qaeda operatives , " snatch and grabs " of high - value targets and other
sensitive action inside and outside Pakistan , an investigation by The
Nation has found .
The Blackwater operatives also assist in gathering
intelligence and help run a secret US military drone bombing campaign
that runs parallel to the well - documented CIA predator strikes ,
according to a well - placed source within the US military intelligence
apparatus .
The source , who has worked on covert US military programs for years ,
including in Afghanistan and Pakistan , has direct knowledge of
Blackwater 's involvement .
He spoke to The Nation on condition of
anonymity because the program is classified .
The source said that the
program is so " compartmentalized " that senior figures within the Obama
administration and the US military chain of command may not be aware of
its existence .
The White House did not return calls or email messages seeking
comment for this story .
Capt .
John Kirby , the spokesperson for Adm .
Michael Mullen , Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , told The
Nation , " We do not discuss current operations one way or the other ,
regardless of their nature . "
A defense official , on background ,
specifically denied that Blackwater performs work on drone strikes or
intelligence for JSOC in Pakistan .
" We do n't have any contracts to do
that work for us .
We do n't contract that kind of work out , period , " the
official said .
" There has not been , and is not now , contracts between
JSOC and that organization for these types of services . "
The previously
unreported program , the military intelligence source said , is distinct
from the CIA assassination program that the agency 's director , Leon
Panetta , announced he had canceled in June 2009 .
" This is a parallel
operation to the CIA , " said the source .
" They are two separate beasts . "
The program puts Blackwater at the epicenter of a US military operation
within the borders of a nation against which the United States has not
declared war -- knowledge that could further strain the already tense
relations between the United States and Pakistan .
In 2006 , the United
States and Pakistan struck a deal that authorized JSOC to enter Pakistan
to hunt Osama bin Laden with the understanding that Pakistan would deny
it had given permission .
Officially , the United States is not supposed
to have any active military operations in the country .
Blackwater , which
recently changed its name to Xe Services and US Training Center , denies
the company is operating in Pakistan .
" Xe Services has only one employee
in Pakistan performing construction oversight for the U.S. Government , "
Blackwater spokesperson Mark Corallo said in a statement to The
Nation , adding that the company has " no other operations of any kind
in Pakistan . "
A former senior executive at Blackwater confirmed the military
intelligence source 's claim that the company is working in Pakistan for
the CIA and JSOC , the premier counterterrorism and covert operations
force within the military .
He said that Blackwater is also working for
the Pakistani government on a subcontract with an Islamabad - based
security firm that puts US Blackwater operatives on the ground with
Pakistani forces in counter - terrorism operations , including house raids
and border interdictions , in the North - West Frontier Province and
elsewhere in Pakistan .
This arrangement , the former executive said ,
allows the Pakistani government to utilize former US Special Operations
forces who now work for Blackwater while denying an official US military
presence in the country .
He also confirmed that Blackwater has a
facility in Karachi and has personnel deployed elsewhere in Pakistan .
The former executive spoke on condition of anonymity .
His account and that of the military intelligence source were borne
out by a US military source who has knowledge of Special Forces actions
in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
When asked about Blackwater 's covert work
for JSOC in Pakistan , this source , who also asked for anonymity , told
The Nation , " From my information that I have , that is absolutely
correct , " adding , " There 's no question that 's occurring . "
" It would n't surprise me because we 've outsourced nearly
everything , " said Col. Lawrence Wilkerson , who served as Secretary of
State Colin Powell 's chief of staff from 2002 to 2005 , when told of
Blackwater 's role in Pakistan .
Wilkerson said that during his time in
the Bush administration , he saw the beginnings of Blackwater 's
involvement with the sensitive operations of the military and CIA .
" Part
of this , of course , is an attempt to get around the constraints the
Congress has placed on DoD .
If you do n't have sufficient soldiers to do
it , you hire civilians to do it .
I mean , it 's that simple .
It would not
surprise me . "
The Counterterrorism Tag Team in Karachi
The covert JSOC program with Blackwater in Pakistan dates back to at
least 2007 , according to the military intelligence source .
The current
head of JSOC is Vice Adm. William McRaven , who took over the post from
Gen. Stanley McChrystal , who headed JSOC from 2003 to 2008 before being
named the top US commander in Afghanistan .
Blackwater 's presence in
Pakistan is " not really visible , and that 's why nobody has cracked down
on it , " said the source .
Blackwater 's operations in Pakistan , he said ,
are not done through State Department contracts or publicly identified
Defense contracts .
" It 's Blackwater via JSOC , and it 's a classified
no - bid [ contract ] approved on a rolling basis . "
The main JSOC / Blackwater
facility in Karachi , according to the source , is nondescript : three
trailers with various generators , satellite phones and computer systems
are used as a makeshift operations center .
" It 's a very rudimentary
operation , " says the source .
" I would compare it to [ CIA ] outposts in
Kurdistan or any of the Special Forces outposts .
It 's very bare bones ,
and that 's the point . "
Blackwater 's work for JSOC in Karachi is coordinated out of a Task
Force based at Bagram Air Base in neighboring Afghanistan , according to
the military intelligence source .
While JSOC technically runs the
operations in Karachi , he said , it is largely staffed by
former US special operations soldiers working for a division of
Blackwater , once known as Blackwater SELECT , and intelligence analysts
working for a Blackwater affiliate , Total Intelligence Solutions ( TIS ) ,
which is owned by Blackwater 's founder , Erik Prince .
The military
source
said that the name Blackwater SELECT may have been changed recently .
Total Intelligence , which is run out of an office on the ninth floor of
a building in the Ballston area of Arlington , Virginia , is staffed by
former analysts and operatives from the CIA , DIA , FBI and other
agencies .
It is modeled after the CIA 's counterterrorism center .
In
Karachi , TIS runs a " media - scouring / open - source network , " according to
the source .
Until recently , Total Intelligence was run by two former
top
CIA officials , Cofer Black and Robert Richer , both of whom have left
the
company .
In Pakistan , Blackwater is not using either its original name
or its new moniker , Xe Services , according to the former Blackwater
executive .
" They are running most of their work through TIS because the
other two [ names ] have such a stain on them , " he said .
Corallo , the
Blackwater spokesperson , denied that TIS or any other division or
affiliate of Blackwater has any personnel in Pakistan .
The US military intelligence source said that Blackwater's
classified contracts keep getting renewed at the request of JSOC .
Blackwater , he said , is already so deeply entrenched that it has become
a staple of the US military operations in Pakistan .
According to the
former Blackwater executive , " The politics that go with the brand of BW
is somewhat set aside because what you 're doing is really one military
guy to another . "
Blackwater 's first known contract with the CIA for
operations in Afghanistan was awarded in 2002 and was for work along the
Afghanistan - Pakistan border .
One of the concerns raised by the military intelligence source is
that some Blackwater personnel are being given rolling security
clearances above their approved clearances .
Using Alternative
Compartmentalized Control Measures ( ACCMs ) , he said , the Blackwater personnel are
granted clearance to a Special Access Program , the bureaucratic term
used to describe highly classified " black " operations .
" With an ACCM ,
the security manager can grant access to you to be exposed to and
operate within compartmentalized programs far above ' secret '-- even
though you have no business doing so , " said the source .
It allows
Blackwater personnel that " do not have the requisite security clearance
or do not hold a security clearance whatsoever to participate in
classified operations by virtue of trust , " he added .
" Think of it as an
ultra - exclusive level above top secret .
That 's exactly what it is : a
circle of love . "
Blackwater , therefore , has access to " all source "
reports that are culled in part from JSOC units in the field .
" That 's
how a lot of things over the years have been conducted with
contractors , " said the source .
" We have contractors that regularly see
things that top policy - makers do n't unless they ask . "
According to the source , Blackwater has effectively marketed itself
as a company whose operatives have " conducted lethal direct action
missions and now , for a price , you can have your own planning cell .
JSOC
just ate that up , " he said , adding , " They have a sizable force in
Pakistan -- not for any nefarious purpose if you really want to look at it
that way -- but to support a legitimate contract that 's classified for
JSOC . "
Blackwater 's Pakistan JSOC contracts are
secret and are therefore shielded from public oversight , he said .
The source is
not sure when the arrangement with JSOC began , but he says that a
spin-off of Blackwater SELECT " was issued a no - bid contract for support
to shooters for a JSOC Task Force and they kept extending it . "
Some of
the Blackwater personnel , he said , work undercover as aid workers .
" Nobody even gives them a second thought . "
The military intelligence source said that the Blackwater / JSOC
Karachi operation is referred to as " Qatar cubed , " in reference to the
US forward operating base in Qatar that served as the hub for the
planning and implementation of the US invasion of Iraq .
" This is
supposed to be the brave new world , " he says .
" This is the Jamestown of
the new millennium and it's meant to be a lily pad .
You can jump off to
Uzbekistan , you can jump back over the border , you can jump sideways ,
you can jump northwest .
It 's strategically located so that they can get
their people wherever they have to without having to wrangle with the
military chain of command in Afghanistan , which is convoluted .
They
do n't have to deal with that because they 're operating under a
classified mandate . "
In addition to planning drone strikes and operations against
suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban forces in Pakistan for both JSOC and the
CIA , the Blackwater team in Karachi also helps plan missions for JSOC
inside Uzbekistan against the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , according to the military intelligence source .
Blackwater
does not actually carry out the operations , he said , which are executed on the ground by JSOC forces .
" That piqued my curiosity and really worries me because I do n't know if
you noticed but I was never told we are at war with Uzbekistan , " he
said .
" So , did I miss something , did Rumsfeld come back into power ? "
Pakistan 's Military Contracting Maze
Blackwater , according to the military intelligence source , is not
doing the actual killing as part of its work in Pakistan .
" The SELECT
personnel are not going into places with private aircraft and going
after targets , " he said .
" It 's not like Blackwater SELECT people are
running around assassinating people . "
Instead , US Special Forces teams
carry out the plans developed in part by Blackwater .
The military
intelligence source drew a distinction between the Blackwater operatives
who work for the State Department , which he calls " Blackwater Vanilla , "
and the seasoned Special Forces veterans who work on the JSOC program .
" Good or bad , there 's a small number of people who know how to pull off
an operation like that .
That 's probably a good thing , " said the source .
" It 's the Blackwater SELECT people that have and continue to plan these
types of operations because they 're the only people that know how and
they went where the money was .
It 's not trigger - happy fucks , like some
of the PSD [ Personal Security Detail ] guys .
These are not people that
believe that Barack Obama is a socialist , these are not people that kill
innocent civilians .
They 're very good at what they do . "
The former Blackwater executive , when asked for confirmation that
Blackwater forces were not actively killing people in Pakistan , said ,
" that 's not entirely accurate . "
While he concurred with the military
intelligence source 's description of the JSOC and CIA programs , he
pointed to another role Blackwater is allegedly playing in Pakistan , not
for the US government but for Islamabad .
According to the executive ,
Blackwater works on a subcontract for Kestral Logistics , a powerful
Pakistani firm , which specializes in military logistical support ,
private security and intelligence consulting .
It is staffed with former
high - ranking Pakistani army and government officials .
While Kestral's
main offices are in Pakistan , it also has branches in several other
countries .
A spokesperson for the US State Department 's Directorate of Defense
Trade Controls ( DDTC ) , which is responsible for issuing licenses to US
corporations to provide defense - related services to foreign governments
or entities , would neither confirm nor deny for The Nation that
Blackwater has a license to work in Pakistan or to work with Kestral .
" We cannot help you , " said department spokesperson David McKeeby after
checking with the relevant DDTC officials .
" You 'll have to contact the
companies directly . "
Blackwater 's Corallo said the company has " no
operations of any kind " in Pakistan other than the one employee working
for the DoD. Kestral did not respond to inquiries from The
Nation .
According to federal lobbying records , Kestral recently hired former
Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roger
Noriega , who served in that post from 2003 to 2005 , to lobby the US
government , including the State Department , USAID and Congress , on
foreign affairs issues " regarding [ Kestral 's ] capabilities to carry out
activities of interest to the United States . "
Noriega was hired through
his firm , Vision Americas , which he runs with Christina Rocca , a former
CIA operations official who served as assistant secretary of state for
South Asian affairs from 2001 to 2006 and was deeply involved in shaping
US policy toward Pakistan .
In October 2009 , Kestral paid Vision Americas
$ 15,000 and paid a Vision Americas - affiliated firm , Firecreek Ltd. , an
equal amount to lobby on defense and foreign policy issues .
For years , Kestral has done a robust business in defense logistics
with the Pakistani government and other nations , as well as top US
defense companies .
Blackwater owner Erik Prince is close with Kestral
CEO Liaquat Ali Baig , according to the former Blackwater executive .
" Ali
and Erik have a pretty close relationship , " he said .
" They 've met many
times and struck a deal , and they [ offer ] mutual support for one
another . "
Working with Kestral , he said , Blackwater has provided convoy
security for Defense Department shipments destined for Afghanistan that
would arrive in the port at Karachi .
Blackwater , according to the former
executive , would guard the supplies as they were transported overland
from Karachi to Peshawar and then west through the Torkham border
crossing , the most important supply route for the US military in
Afghanistan .
According to the former executive , Blackwater operatives also
integrate with Kestral 's forces in sensitive counterterrorism operations
in the North - West Frontier Province , where they work in conjunction with
the Pakistani Interior Ministry 's paramilitary force , known as the
Frontier Corps ( alternately referred to as " frontier scouts " ) .
The
Blackwater personnel are technically advisers , but the former executive
said that the line often gets blurred in the field .
Blackwater " is
providing the actual guidance on how to do [ counterterrorism operations ]
and Kestral 's folks are carrying a lot of them out , but they 're having
the guidance and the overwatch from some BW guys that will actually go
out with the teams when they 're executing the job , " he said .
" You can
see how that can lead to other things in the border areas . "
He said that
when Blackwater personnel are out with the Pakistani teams , sometimes
its men engage in operations against suspected terrorists .
" You 've got
BW guys that are assisting ... and they 're all going to want to go on the
jobs -- so they 're going to go with them , " he said .
" So , the things that
you 're seeing in the news about how this Pakistani military group came
in and raided this house or did this or did that -- in some of those
cases , you 're going to have Western folks that are right there at the
house , if not in the house . "
Blackwater , he said , is paid by the
Pakistani government through Kestral for consulting services .
" That
gives the Pakistani government the cover to say , ' Hey , no , we do n't have
any Westerners doing this .
It 's all local and our people are doing it . '
But it gets them the expertise that Westerners provide for
[ counterterrorism ] - related work . "
The military intelligence source confirmed Blackwater works with the
Frontier Corps , saying , " There 's no real oversight .
It 's not really on
people 's radar screen . "
In October , in response to Pakistani news reports that a Kestral
warehouse in Islamabad was being used to store heavy weapons for
Blackwater , the US Embassy in Pakistan released a statement denying the
weapons were being used by " a private American security contractor . "
The
statement said , " Kestral Logistics is a private logistics company that
handles the importation of equipment and supplies provided by the United
States to the Government of Pakistan .
All of the equipment and supplies
were imported at the request of the Government of Pakistan , which also
certified the shipments . "
Who is Behind the Drone Attacks ?
Since President Barack Obama was inaugurated , the United States has
expanded drone bombing raids in Pakistan .
Obama first ordered a drone
strike against targets in North and South Waziristan on January 23 , and
the strikes have been conducted consistently ever since .
The Obama
administration has now surpassed the number of Bush - era strikes in
Pakistan and has faced fierce criticism from Pakistan and some US
lawmakers over civilian deaths .
A drone attack in June killed as many as
sixty people attending a Taliban funeral .

In August , the New York Times reported that Blackwater works
for the CIA at " hidden bases in Pakistan and Afghanistan , where the
company 's contractors assemble and load Hellfire missiles and 500 - pound
laser - guided bombs on remotely piloted Predator aircraft . "
In February ,
The Times of London obtained a satellite image of a secret CIA
airbase in Shamsi , in Pakistan 's southwestern province of Baluchistan ,
showing three drone aircraft .
The New York Times also reported
that the agency uses a secret base in Jalalabad , Afghanistan , to strike
in Pakistan .
The military intelligence source says that the drone strike that
reportedly killed Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud , his wife
and his bodyguards in Waziristan in August was a CIA strike , but that
many others attributed in media reports to the CIA are actually JSOC
strikes .
" Some of these strikes are attributed to OGA [ Other Government
Agency , intelligence parlance for the CIA ] , but in reality it 's JSOC and
their parallel program of UAVs [ unmanned aerial vehicles ] because they
also have access to UAVs .
So when you see some of these hits , especially
the ones with high civilian casualties , those are almost always JSOC
strikes . "
The Pentagon has stated bluntly , " There are no US military
strike operations being conducted in Pakistan . "
The military intelligence source also confirmed that Blackwater
continues to work for the CIA on its drone bombing program in Pakistan ,
as previously reported in the New York Times , but added that
Blackwater is working on JSOC 's drone bombings as well .
" It 's Blackwater
running the program for both CIA and JSOC , " said the source .
When
civilians are killed , " people go , ' Oh , it 's the CIA doing crazy shit
again unchecked . '
Well , at least 50 percent of the time , that 's JSOC
[ hitting ] somebody they 've identified through HUMINT [ human
intelligence ] or they 've culled the intelligence themselves or it's been
shared with them and they take that person out and that 's how it works . "
The military intelligence source says that the CIA operations are
subject to Congressional oversight , unlike the parallel JSOC bombings .
" Targeted killings are not the most popular thing in town right now and
the CIA knows that , " he says .
" Contractors and especially JSOC personnel
working under a classified mandate are not [ overseen by Congress ] , so
they just do n't care .
If there 's one person they 're going after and
there 's thirty - four people in the building , thirty - five people are going
to die .
That 's the mentality . "
He added , " They 're not accountable to
anybody and they know that .
It 's an open secret , but what are you going
to do , shut down JSOC ? "
In addition to working on covert action planning and drone strikes ,
Blackwater SELECT also provides private guards to perform the sensitive
task of security for secret US drone bases , JSOC camps and Defense
Intelligence Agency camps inside Pakistan , according to the military
intelligence source .
Mosharraf Zaidi , a well - known Pakistani journalist who has served as
a consultant for the UN and European Union in Pakistan and Afghanistan ,
says that the Blackwater / JSOC program raises serious questions about the
norms of international relations .
" The immediate question is , How do you
define the active pursuit of military objectives in a country with which
not only have you not declared war but that is supposedly a front - line
non-NATO ally in the US struggle to contain extremist violence coming
out of Afghanistan and the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan ? "
asks Zaidi , who is currently a columnist for The News , the
biggest English - language daily in Pakistan .
" Let 's forget Blackwater for
a second .
What this is confirming is that there are US military
operations in Pakistan that are n't about logistics or getting food to
Bagram ; that are actually about the exercise of physical violence ,
physical force inside of Pakistani territory . "
JSOC : Rumsfeld and Cheney 's Extra Special Force
Colonel Wilkerson said that he is concerned that with General
McChrystal 's elevation as the military commander of the Afghan
war -- which is increasingly seeping into Pakistan -- there is a concomitant
rise in JSOC 's power and influence within the military structure .
" I
do n't see how you can escape that ; it 's just a matter of the way the
authority flows and the power flows , and it 's inevitable , I think , "
Wilkerson told The Nation .
He added , " I 'm alarmed when I see
execute orders and combat orders that go out saying that the supporting
force is Central Command and the supported force is Special Operations
Command , " under which JSOC operates .
" That 's backward .
But that 's
essentially what we have today . "
From 2003 to 2008 McChrystal headed JSOC , which is headquartered at
Pope Air Force Base and Fort Bragg in North Carolina , where Blackwater's
7,000 - acre operating base is also situated .
JSOC controls the Army's
Delta Force , the Navy 's SEAL Team 6 , as well as the Army 's 75th Ranger
Regiment and 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment , and the Air
Force 's 24th Special Tactics Squadron .
JSOC performs strike operations ,
reconnaissance in denied areas and special intelligence missions .
Blackwater , which was founded by former Navy SEALs , employs scores of
veteran Special Forces operators -- which several former military
officials pointed to as the basis for Blackwater 's alleged contracts with JSOC .
Since 9/11 , many top - level Special Forces veterans have taken up
employment with private firms , where they can make more money doing the
highly specialized work they did in uniform .
" The Blackwater individuals
have the experience .
A lot of these individuals are retired military ,
and they 've been around twenty to thirty years and have experience that
the younger Green Beret guys don't , " said retired Army Lieut .
Col .
Jeffrey Addicott , a well - connected military lawyer who served as senior
legal counsel for US Army Special Forces .
" They 're known entities .
Everybody knows who they are , what their capabilities are , and they 've
got the experience .
They 're very valuable . "
" They make much more money being the smarts of these operations ,
planning hits in various countries and basing it off their experience in
Chechnya , Bosnia , Somalia , Ethiopia , " said the military intelligence
source .
" They were there for all of these things , they know what the
hell they 're talking about .
And JSOC has unfortunately lost the
institutional capability to plan within , so they hire back people that
used to work for them and had already planned and executed these [ types
of ] operations .
They hired back people that jumped over to Blackwater
SELECT and then pay them exorbitant amounts of money to plan future
operations .
It 's a ridiculous revolving door . "
While JSOC has long played a central role in US counterterrorism and
covert operations , military and civilian officials who worked at the
Defense and State Departments during the Bush administration described
in interviews with The Nation an extremely cozy relationship that
developed between the executive branch ( primarily through Vice President
Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ) and JSOC .
During the
Bush era , Special Forces turned into a virtual stand - alone operation
that acted outside the military chain of command and in direct
coordination with the White House .
Throughout the Bush years , it was
largely General McChrystal who ran JSOC .
" What I was seeing was the
development of what I would later see in Iraq and Afghanistan , where
Special Operations forces would operate in both theaters without the
conventional commander even knowing what they were doing , " said Colonel
Wilkerson .
" That 's dangerous , that 's very dangerous .
You have all kinds
of mess when you do n't tell the theater commander what you 're doing . "
Wilkerson said that almost immediately after assuming his role at
the State Department under Colin Powell , he saw JSOC being politicized
and developing a close relationship with the executive branch .
He saw
this begin , he said , after his first Delta Force briefing at Fort Bragg .
" I think Cheney and Rumsfeld went directly into JSOC .
I think they went
into JSOC at times , perhaps most frequently , without the SOCOM [ Special
Operations ] commander at the time even knowing it .
The receptivity in
JSOC was quite good , " says Wilkerson .
" I think Cheney was actually
giving McChrystal instructions , and McChrystal was asking him for
instructions . "
He said the relationship between JSOC and Cheney and
Rumsfeld " built up initially because Rumsfeld did n't get the
responsiveness .
He did n't get the can - do kind of attitude out of the
SOCOM commander , and so as Rumsfeld was wont to do , he cut him out and
went straight to the horse 's mouth .
At that point you had JSOC operating
as an extension of the [ administration ] doing things the executive
branch -- read : Cheney and Rumsfeld - - wanted it to do .
This would be more
or less carte blanche .
You need to do it , do it .
It was very alarming
for me as a conventional soldier . "
Wilkerson said the JSOC teams caused diplomatic problems for the
United States across the globe .
" When these teams started hitting
capital cities and other places all around the world , [ Rumsfeld ] did n't
tell the State Department either .
The only way we found out about it is
our ambassadors started to call us and say , ' Who the hell are these
six - foot - four white males with eighteen - inch biceps walking around our
capital cities ? '
So we discovered this , we discovered one in South
America , for example , because he actually murdered a taxi driver , and we
had to get him out of there real quick .
We rendered him -- we rendered him
home . "
As part of their strategy , Rumsfeld and Cheney also created the
Strategic Support Branch ( SSB ) , which pulled intelligence resources from
the Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA for use in sensitive JSOC
operations .
The SSB was created using " reprogrammed " funds " without
explicit congressional authority or appropriation , " according to the
Washington Post .
The SSB operated outside the military chain of
command and circumvented the CIA 's authority on clandestine operations .
Rumsfeld created it as part of his war to end " near total dependence on
CIA . "
Under US law , the Defense Department is required to report all
deployment orders to Congress .
But guidelines issued in January 2005 by
former Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence Stephen Cambone
stated that Special Operations forces may " conduct clandestine HUMINT
operations ... before publication " of a deployment order .
This effectively
gave Rumsfeld unilateral control over clandestine operations .
The military intelligence source said that when Rumsfeld was defense
secretary , JSOC was deployed to commit some of the " darkest acts " in
part to keep them concealed from Congress .
" Everything can be justified
as a military operation versus a clandestine intelligence performed by
the CIA , which has to be informed to Congress , " said the source .
" They
were aware of that and they knew that , and they would exploit it at
every turn and they took full advantage of it .
They knew they could act
extra-legally and nothing would happen because A , it was sanctioned by
DoD at the highest levels , and B , who was going to stop them ?
They were
preparing the battlefield , which was on all of the PowerPoints :
' Preparing the Battlefield . ' "
The significance of the flexibility of JSOC 's operations inside
Pakistan versus the CIA 's is best summed up by Senator Dianne Feinstein ,
chair of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence .
" Every single
intelligence operation and covert action must be briefed to the
Congress , " she said .
" If they are not , that is a violation of the law . "
Blackwater : Company Non Grata in Pakistan
For months , the Pakistani media has been flooded with stories about
Blackwater 's alleged growing presence in the country .
For the most part ,
these stories have been ignored by the US press and denounced as lies or
propaganda by US officials in Pakistan .
But the reality is that ,
although many of the stories appear to be wildly exaggerated , Pakistanis
have good reason to be concerned about Blackwater 's operations in their
country .
It is no secret in Washington or Islamabad that Blackwater has
been a central part of the wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan and that the
company has been involved -- almost from the beginning of the " war on
terror " -- with clandestine US operations .
Indeed ,
Blackwater is accepting applications for contractors fluent in Urdu and
Punjabi .
The US Ambassador to Pakistan , Anne Patterson , has denied
Blackwater 's presence in the country , stating bluntly in September ,
" Blackwater is not operating in Pakistan . "
In her trip to Pakistan in
October , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton dodged questions from the
Pakistani press about Blackwater 's rumored Pakistani operations .
Pakistan 's interior minister , Rehman Malik , said on November 21 he will
resign if Blackwater is found operating anywhere in Pakistan .
The Christian Science Monitor recently reported that
Blackwater " provides security for a US - backed aid project " in Peshawar ,
suggesting the company may be based out of the Pearl Continental , a
luxury hotel the United States reportedly is considering purchasing to
use as a consulate in the city .
" We have no contracts in Pakistan , "
Blackwater spokesperson Stacey DeLuke said recently .
" We 've been blamed
for all that has gone wrong in Peshawar , none of which is true , since we
have absolutely no presence there . "
Reports of Blackwater 's alleged presence in Karachi and elsewhere in
the country have been floating around the Pakistani press for months .
Hamid Mir , a prominent Pakistani journalist who rose to fame after his
1997 interview with Osama bin Laden , claimed in a recent interview that
Blackwater is in Karachi .
" The US [ intelligence ] agencies think that a
number of Al - Qaeda and Taliban leaders are hiding in Karachi and
Peshawar , " he said .
" That is why [ Blackwater ] agents are operating in
these two cities . "
Ambassador Patterson has said that the claims of Mir
and other Pakistani journalists are " wildly incorrect , " saying they had
compromised the security of US personnel in Pakistan .
On November 20 the
Washington Times , citing three current and former US intelligence
officials , reported that Mullah Mohammed Omar , the leader of the Afghan
Taliban , has " found refuge from potential U.S. attacks " in Karachi " with
the assistance of Pakistan 's intelligence service . "
In September , the Pakistani press covered a report on Blackwater
allegedly submitted by Pakistan 's intelligence agencies to the federal
interior ministry .
In the report , the intelligence agencies reportedly
allege that Blackwater was provided houses by a federal minister who is
also helping them clear shipments of weapons and vehicles through
Karachi's Port Qasim on the coast of the Arabian Sea .
The military
intelligence source did not confirm this but did say , " The port jives
because they have a lot of [ former ]
SEALs and they would revert to what
they know : the ocean , instead of flying stuff in . "
The Nation cannot independently confirm these allegations and
has not seen the Pakistani intelligence report .
But according to
Pakistani press coverage , the intelligence report also said Blackwater
has acquired " bungalows " in the Defense Housing Authority in the city .
According to the DHA website , it is a large gated community established
" for the welfare of the serving and retired officers of the Armed Forces
of Pakistan . "
Its motto is : " Home for Defenders . "
The report alleges
Blackwater is receiving help from local government officials in Karachi
and is using vehicles with license plates traditionally assigned to
members of the national and provincial assemblies , meaning local law
enforcement will not stop them .
The use of private companies like Blackwater for sensitive
operations such as drone strikes or other covert work undoubtedly comes
with the benefit of plausible deniability that places an additional
barrier in an already deeply flawed system of accountability .
When
things go wrong , it's the contractors ' fault , not the government 's .
But
the widespread use of contractors also raises serious legal questions ,
particularly when they are a part of lethal , covert actions .
" We are
using contractors for things that in the past might have been considered
to be a violation of the Geneva Convention , " said Lt. Col .
Addicott , who
now runs the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary 's University School of
Law in San Antonio , Texas .
" In my opinion , we have pressed the envelope
to the breaking limit , and it's almost a fiction that these guys are not
in offensive military operations . "
Addicott added , " If we were subjected
to the International Criminal Court , some of these guys could easily be
picked up , charged with war crimes and put on trial .
That 's one of the
reasons we 're not members of the International Criminal Court . "
If there is one quality that has defined Blackwater over the past
decade , it is the ability to survive against the odds while
simultaneously reinventing and rebranding itself .
That is most evident
in Afghanistan , where the company continues to work for the US military ,
the CIA and the State Department despite intense criticism and almost
weekly scandals .
Blackwater 's alleged Pakistan operations , said the military
intelligence source , are indicative of its new frontier .
" Having learned
its lessons after the private security contracting fiasco in Iraq ,
Blackwater has shifted its operational focus to two venues : protecting
things that are in danger and anticipating other places we 're going to
go as a nation that are dangerous , " he said .
" It 's as simple as that . "

The number of dead in floods following Saudi Arabia 's heaviest rains for years has risen to around 100 , officials say .
Dozens are said to be missing and some reports suggest the death toll will rise further in the city of Jeddah .
The authorities say they are providing food and temporary housing for those made homeless and considering how to compensate the worst affected .
But critics accuse them of negligence and say this " disaster " should never have been allowed to happen .
A lawyer has threatened to sue the Jeddah authorities , while thousands of people turned to the social networking site Facebook to vent complaints about inadequate infrastructure on a specially created webpage .
Many of the victims in the Red Sea port city died in their vehicles after the flash floods - either by drowning or in car crashes .
Some reportedly were killed when bridges collapsed on top of them .
Heavy rainstorms on Wednesday hampered the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage in the nearby city of Mecca , but officials said there were no pilgrims among casualties of the flooding .
Apart from Jeddah , flood deaths were reported in Rabigh and Mecca .

We arrived in a stretch limousine , complete with red carpet .
It was hard to stay together , although a group of us did make it up to the stage .
Lloyd Marcus performed the " Tea Party Anthem " and we were whooping it up on the dance floor .
Then , when Marcus invited some ladies up to the stage - believe it or not - an uninformed organizer invited me up .
As I was making my way up the steps their " leader " Harry Kaloogian grabbed my arm and said that I could n't go .
I said " Yes I can , I was invited ! " and so up I went .
Marcus sang a song about taking back our country by 2010 , to the tune of " New York , New York " and we girls did a kickline .
Many cameras , including one recognizable from Channel 8 news , were filming the whole performance .
Promptly after the song , we Billionaires were craftily lured away from the stage by the same organizer who invited me up to the stage ; she was trying to bribe us with water .
HA HA - we saw right through her ploy , but left anyways .
We mingled ; there were surprisingly many nice folks , who enjoyed our performance and were laughing along with us and taking pictures .
However , there were MANY more vitriolic tea baggers , some of whom were violent and , of course , racist .
We were interviewed by the SD Union Tribune , and Channel 8 .
Three of our Billionaires , including The Commodore , sang a song that the Commodore wrote .
Channel 8 filmed the whole song !
I 'm telling you , we got great exposure !
We also had three videographers , and I will be posting pics , footage and the lyrics to the Commodore 's song as soon as it's available .
A pattern I 'm seeing is that in the beginning , the repubs do n't really understand and do n't know what to think .
But , as they catch on , they become more violent , and really in your face .
By the time our limo came to pick us up and Todd , our faithful driver , laid out the red carpet once again , things were getting pretty bad .
Many people wanted to know who is behind all of this ???
Who 's paying us ??
One very " bright " woman was angry because the Tea Baggers " barely had the money to put this together "
while we are funded by someone ( Soros ? ) and she DEMANDED to know who !!
She screamed that we were " fucking hypocrites " .
And I mean SCREAMED .
Their grassroots effort is pretty impressive - although they " barely had the money to put this together " , they managed to have two buses fully wrapped in Tea Party regalia and plenty of vehicles , all marked with Tea Party Express signage .
Cops were pretty thin , surprisingly , since any lefty rally I 've ever been to seems to bring them all out in full riot gear .
I guess the tea baggers are n't a threat to public safety ...?
Anyhoo , much thanks to all the San Diego Billionaires for making such a beautiful performance .
It really is a fun bunch !

Here are the lyrics to a song written by The Commodore :
Sung to : Hey Look Me Over
Hey , we ’re the wealthy
We run your HMO
We love when you are healthy
Let ’s keep the status quo .
We do n’t like Public Options
Single payer is a curse
And anti-trusting , monopoly busting
We do n’t know which is worse .
God help us . . .
Thank you Senator Baucus
Our lobby pays you well
And as for that liberal caucus
They can go to hell .
Keep the government out of health care
Our profits do just fine
It ’s not we who do curing , but under - insuring
And let those socialists whine .
Thanks Tea Baggers . . .
Hey , we have billions
And yachts , trust funds , and more
Not our fault that there are millions
Who are ill , uninsured and poor .
So listen to Hannity , Limbaugh , and Beck
They know of what they speak
Sarah Palin , what .
. the. . heck !
I wrote this post over the weekend but given Paul Samuelson 's classic contribution to public goods theory and to economic textbooks it seems to also fit today .
In Modern Principles we use asteroid deflection as our example of a public good .
Aside from memorability , the example has two virtues as a teaching tool .
First , asteroid deflection is a true public good for all of humanity which raises free riding issues on a worldwide scale .
Second , asteroid deflection is an example of a public good that is currently provided neither by the market nor by government .
Thus the example underlines the fact that public goods are defined by their characteristics –nonexcludability and nonrivalry –and not by whether they are publicly provided , a point of confusion for many students .
The example may seem fanciful but Tyler and I are quite serious about the
importance of asteroid deflection .
Large asteroid hits are rare but if
a large asteroid does hit , billions will be killed .
As a result , sober calculations suggest that the lifetime risk of dying from an asteroid strike is about the same as the risk of dying in a commercial airplane crash .
Yet we spend far less on avoiding the former risk than the latter .
A new report from the National Academy of Sciences discusses efforts to detect near earth objects ( NEOs ) .
Progress is mixed :
The United States is currently the only country with an active , government - sponsored effort to
detect and track potentially hazardous near - Earth objects ( NEOs ) …
Congress has mandated that NASA detect and track 90 percent of NEOs that are 1 kilometer in diameter
or larger .
These objects represent a great potential hazard to life on Earth and could cause global
destruction .
NASA is close to accomplishing this goal .
Congress has more recently mandated that by
2020 NASA should detect and track 90 percent of NEOs that are 140 meters in diameter or larger , a
category of objects that is generally recognized to represent a very significant threat to life on Earth if
they strike in or near urban areas… .
The administration has not requested and Congress has not
appropriated new funds to meet this objective …. [ Thus ] the current near - Earth object surveys cannot meet the goals of the 2005 NASA
Authorization Act …
Moreover , detection is only the first step towards deflection .
As a classroom discussion starter I like the video embedded below .
The jovial attitude of the announcers contrasts amusingly with the topic while subtly illustrating some of our biases in perception yet the video does cover the main points about the worldwide risk , the fact that asteroid deflection is a public good and it hints at the free rider problem .
I do doubt the bit about the riches available from asteroid mining .
Enjoy .

While you are working on this change , let 's pretend that somebody committed a change on a ' const - fix ' branch to tighten constness .
$ git checkout - b const - fix master $ git apply << \EOF && git commit - a -m " constness fix " diff -- git a/hello.c b/hello.c index e0dbe10..9970 faa 100644 --- a/hello.c +++ b/hello.c @@ - 4,7 +4,7 @@ /* *

Now , you would want to try your topic with this new branch to make sure they play well together .
Do n't merge ' const - fix ' into your topic for this , though .
Your ' upcase - first ' branch is about upcasing the first word in the message , and should only contain commits that are relevant to that goal .
Instead , you would try merging on a throw - away branch .
Recent git allows you to " detach HEAD " , so let 's make use of that .
$ git checkout upcase - first^0 Note : moving to ' upcase - first^0 ' which is n't a local branch
If you want to create a new branch from this checkout , you may do so ( now or later ) by using -b with the checkout command again .
Example : git checkout - b < new_branch_name > HEAD is now at 362a9 fb ... upcase first
This temporarily checks out the named commit ( in this case , the commit at the tip of your upcase - first branch ) .
Since the purpose of this article is to show the power of rerere , we will do a little magic here to enable it .
$ mkdir .git/rr-cache
Do n't worry too much about it for now .
This needs to be done only once in your repository .
Now to the merge .
$ git merge const - fix Auto - merging hello.c CONFLICT ( content ) : Merge conflict in hello.c
Recorded preimage for ' hello. c '
Automatic merge failed ; fix conflicts and then commit the result .
This results in a merge conflict .
Let 's examine what happened .
$ cat hello.c # include < ctype.h > # include < stdio.h > # include < string .h>
/* * Say the message */ <<<<<<< HEAD void hello( char * message , int upcase_first ) ======= void hello( const char * message ) >>>>>>>
const -fix { char * cp ; for ( cp = message ; * cp && !isspace ( * cp ) ; cp ++ ) * cp = toupper ( * cp ) ; printf ( " %s
" , message ) ; } /* * Show greetings ...
There is a constness change on the ' const - fix ' side , while your side added an " upcase_first " argument to the function hello ( ) .
The conflicted part is shown enclosed in <<<<<<< HEAD void hello( char * message , int upcase_first ) --- your changes ======= void hello( const char * message ) --- their changes >>>>>>>
const-fix and you would resolve it to read like this .
void hello ( const char * message , int upcase_first )
But that is not enough .
The way you implemented your upcase - first is to use a pointer cp that walks the message and upcase the first word in place .
Now you are not allowed to overwrite message , so a different solution is necessary .
Your new hello ( ) function may look like this : void hello ( const char * message , int upcase_first ) { const char * cp ; for ( cp = message ; * cp && !isspace ( * cp ) ; cp++ ) putchar ( toupper ( * cp ) ) ; message = cp ; printf ( " %s
" , message ) ; } After editing hello. c like that , test the result .
$ cc -o hello ./hello.c && ./ hello " hello world " HELLO world
Your message is 11 bytes long
You are satisfied that your changes , even though they have conflicts with somebody else 's changes , still work well .
You can go back and continue working on your topic , but before doing so , tell git that you are done , and the easiest way to do so is to make a throw - away commit .
$ git commit - a -m ' test resolution ' Recorded resolution for ' hello.c '. [ detached HEAD 2fe010b ] test resolution Notice it says " Recorded resolution " ?
Now let 's go back and keep working on the upcase - first topic .
$ git checkout upcase - first Previous HEAD position was 2fe010 b ... test resolution Switched to branch ' upcase - first ' $ git apply << \EOF && git commit - a -m " add comment " diff -- git a /hello.c b/hello.c index 9970 faa..53abee2 100644 --- a/hello.c +++ b/hello.c @@ - 20,7 +20,7 @@ void greetings ( const char * message ) } /* - * Main program + * Main program - give greetings with the first word upcased .
*/ int main ( int ac , char ** av ) { EOF $ cc -o hello ./hello.c && ./ hello " hello world " HELLO world
Your message is 11 bytes long
Now let 's try the " test merge with const - fix " again .
$ git checkout HEAD^0 $ git merge const - fix Auto - merging hello.c CONFLICT ( content ) : Merge conflict in hello.c
Resolved ' hello.c ' using previous resolution .
Automatic merge failed ; fix conflicts and then commit the result .
This again results in a merge conflict , but notice that the message says " Resolved ' hello. c ' using previous resolution . "
If you look at hello.c , you actually do not see any conflict markers .
Instead , the hello ( ) function is already updated with the change you made earlier , even though you are not merging exactly the versions as you tried earlier .
If you are curious , here is how to check what conflict you got : $ git checkout -- conflict=merge hello.c $ cat hello .c
Try it .
You will notice that :
The branches produced the conflict exactly the same way .
The hello( ) function has different sets of arguments .
The body of the hello ( ) function did not have any conflict ; it merged cleanly at the textual level , but it is wrong as the merge result .
Running " git rerere " explicitly at this point will again resolve the conflict for you .
$ git rerere Resolved ' hello.c ' using previous resolution .
Things to notice : Rerere remembers how you chose to resolve the conflicted regions ;
Rerere also remembers how you touched up outside the conflicted regions to adjust to semantic changes ;
Rerere can reuse previous resolution even though you were merging two branches with different contents than the one you resolved earlier .
Even people who have been using rerere for a long time often fail to notice the last point .
Suppose someone said in casual conversation that " men are pigs . "
What would society 's reaction be ?
Can we imagine anyone objecting to
this statement , upbraiding the speaker for bigotry or inaccuracy or
sexism ?
Perhaps , on hearing this slur against half the human race , most
men would take it as an occasion to laugh at themselves .
Perhaps most
women would nod in unthinking agreement .
But is n't there something dangerous in humoring such a statement of
bigotry ?
Here is what I have recently observed : Statements with hostile
content directed at the male gender are increasing .
More and more , a
generalized hostility to men breaks to the surface in the casual talk of
college - educated women ( i.e. , recently educated ) .
It is suddenly a
proof of masculine unfairness -- and villainy , perhaps -- that most
senators and all past U.S. presidents have been men .
It is suddenly
evidence of masculinity 's oppressive nature that Europe 's classical
composers were men , or that the " great books " were written by men , or
that the Bible refers to God as a masculine entity .
Day by day , as we
are increasingly bombarded by such complaints , we are imperceptibly led
to understand that -- yes -- men are pigs .
They have hogged all the
glory and power for themselves .
Of course , 99.99 percent of men were neither great composers , great
authors , presidents or senators .
In historical terms , most men could
not be accused of hogging glory or power .
The lives of most men
throughout history , in fact , have been spent in a constant and
unglamorous struggle to support their families in the face of war ,
famine , tyranny and pestilence .
TRENDING : The indictment of Anthony Fauci for his Big Lie
Of course , one should be careful not to say anything that will
justify or excuse what militant feminists call " the patriarchy , " because
it is now an article of faith with such people that men control
society 's wealth to the disadvantage of women .
Therefore , one must
forget about the realities of history and the struggle for survival in
ancient and Medieval times .
It is sufficient to demonstrate that men
are dominant , and therefore men are pigs .
Momentarily setting aside the question of male dominance , let us
dissect the dehumanizing formula in question , which could be rendered
as : " x are pigs . "
What if we substituted x for some other group ?
What
if we said , for example , that " Homosexuals are pigs " ?
What if we said
that " Women are pigs " ?
Would most men laugh and nod in agreement ?
( Somehow , I do n't think they 'd dare . )
And imagine what would happen if
a university professor said to his class that blacks or Jews or Asians
are pigs ?
But oddly , at the university today , one might form an entire
discipline around the notion that men are pigs .
In fact , " women's
studies " might be this discipline , as it subtly extends and elaborates
on the theme of patriarchal tyranny .
By using sociological arguments
and statistical fabrications , by looking at history with a view to
blaming men , some political feminists have intellectually organized
their resentments and hatreds into a coherent body of thought .
They
have fashioned for themselves intellectual weapons .
And they are using
these weapons , day by day , spreading a message of hate to other women
and to that pathetic creature -- the " self - hating man . "
In the 1920s a French writer named Julien Benda wrote a book
entitled , " The Treason of the Intellectuals " ( La Trahison des
Clercs ) .
He wrote that " Our age is the age of the intellectual
organization of political hatreds . "
Benda said that the chief political
hatreds in modern society are those of race , class and nation .
But
today Benda would have to add a new category to the list .
He would have
to add the category of sexual hatred .
Think of the devastation wrought by nationalism in the First World
War .
Think of the devastation wrought by racism in the Second World
War .
Add to that , as well , the hundred million plus lives claimed by
Communist dictators in the name of class hatred .
And now we have sexual
hatred in our midst .
As Benda said , the modern era is one of increasing
intellectualization and rationalization .
We have built huge
bureaucracies , we have thoroughly rationalized authority , commerce and
war .
In other words , we have used reason to make every human activity
more efficient and perfect .
Government has become a gigantic machine ,
commercial transactions continue to get easier and easier , and war has
become a matter of destroying an entire city with the push of a button .
In this context is it any wonder that human intelligence -- in this same
era -- has been used to organize and systematize personal hatreds into
more general hatreds , perfecting and refining the personal
disappointments and resentments of individuals until they become
academic disciplines and political battlecries ?
According to Julien Benda , the problem began with the advent of
modern materialism .
He said that 20th century writers and thinkers ,
insofar as they embrace materialism , have been led away from genuine
humanity , love and charity .
He also noted that democracy involves a
political struggle for power and money between contending and
impassioned groups .
With the French monarchists Benda said that , in
terms of this struggle , " democracy is war . "
And what is war except hatred ?
Julien Benda blamed the writers and thinkers of his time , especially
those living in democratic countries , for perfecting man 's political
passions .
" The present age , " wrote Benda , " is essentially an age of
politics . "
Politics first , always and everywhere .
That is how modern
democratic plunder works .
And hatreds are the raw stuff for organizing
and motivating the plunderers .
In this context , said Benda , " political
passions have obtained the habit of discipline . "
If you think that modern feminism is not an example of the
intellectual organization of political hatred , as described by Benda ,
you should think again .
Christina Hoff Sommers has written a striking
new book entitled , " The War Against Boys : How Misguided Feminism is
Harming Our Young Men . "
According to Sommers a bias against boys has emerged within our
society .
She documents how feminist agitation and intellectual
organization has created the myth of the shortchanged girl .
" Inevitably , writes Sommers , " boys are resented , being seen both as the
unfairly privileged gender and as obstacles on the path to gender
justice for girls . "
Sommers has discovered that the case against masculinity ( made by
misguided feminists ) is full of holes , fabrications and errors .
Worse
yet , this new propaganda of sexual hate threatens our society with a
grave crisis .
Sommers notes that " some educators will tell you that it
is boys , not girls , who are on the fragile side of the gender gap . "
Increasingly , boys are dropping out of school .
They are involved in
drugs and crime .
They are less active in student government , honorary
societies , academic clubs and music programs .
Today 's boys are less
likely to enter college .
The only refuge for boys , it seems , is
sports .
And Sommers tells us that the militant feminists have zeroed in
on this last remaining male fortress in a long - term effort to batter it
down .
Several years ago David Thomas wrote an excellent book entitled , " Not
Guilty : In Defence of the Modern Man . "
One of his chapters is called
" The Myth of the Bad Man . "
Thomas shows that today 's intellectual elite
is creating a myth that men are violent and violence is male .
A huge
cottage industry has grown up to demonstrate that within families , men
are a bad influence -- a necessary evil at best .
" Meanwhile , " asks
Thomas , " why wo n't anyone have the courage and the honesty to confront
and deal with abuse carried out by women ? "
There is no balance , says Thomas , who writes of a " pattern of
prejudice " in social science itself .
Thomas argues that today's
accepted orthodoxy holds " that all abusers are male . ... "
This is
especially true in the area of sexual harassment .
The organization of hatred along sexual lines is , in my view , the
most troubling intellectual trend in modern thought today .
The next
time you hear somebody say that men are pigs -- or some similar comment
-- you might want to object .
But be forewarned .
Your objection might be met with an unexpected
expression of blind rage .
England ( 6 ) 6
Pens : Wilkinson 2

Cowan 's beautifully - worked try gave the All Blacks a decisive lead
By James Standley
A much - improved performance from England was not enough to prevent New Zealand pulling away in the second half to win with some ease at Twickenham .
Two penalties apiece from Dan Carter and Jonny Wilkinson made it 6 - 6 after an even first half on Saturday .
But the All Blacks then upped their game and , after Carter had edged the All Blacks ahead with a third penalty , Jimmy Cowan scored the decisive try .
Carter converted and added a late penalty to guide the All Blacks home .
New Zealand fly - half Carter passed a personal milestone when he landed his first penalty , overtaking Andrew Mehrtens as the all - time leading scorer for the All Blacks .
BRYN PALMER'S BLOG
When a 13 - point deficit , and an eighth consecutive defeat , by the All Blacks is cause for some kind of cheer , surely it only highlights how far English rugby 's stock has fallen
But Carter , considered by many to be the finest fly - half in the modern game , had a mixed afternoon as England tore into the number one - ranked side in the world before running out of steam in the second half .
Lewis Moody turned in another destructive performance for the hosts and the returning Simon Shaw was a big presence but ultimately the All Blacks ' greater attacking ability was the difference between the two sides .
England had been heavily criticised after their performances against Australia and Argentina , despite victory against the latter , and coach Martin Johnson had decided the answer to the question posed by the All Blacks was power , and plenty of it .
In came noted tackler Joe Worsley , 6ft 8in second row Shaw and 17 stone centre Ayoola Erinle , but Johnson 's plans were undermined inside the first 60 seconds .
Worsley carried powerfully into the heart of the visitors ' defence but twisted his ankle and had to limp off , with the less physical Tom Croft coming on in his place .
England had penalty of power but lacked a cutting edge on Saturday England shrugged off his loss and made sure they got stuck into the hosts , with 6ft 7in Bath wing Matt Banahan making his presence felt with some powerful early hits .
Despite England 's committed start the All Blacks were handed the first chance to open the scoring when Moody went offside at a ruck .
But Carter , to the amazement of the 80,000 in attendance at Twickenham , missed a straight attempt which would have edged him past Mehrtens at the top of the New Zealand points chart .
Just before the 10 - minute mark the forecast rain began to fall but England soon opened the scoring through the boot of Wilkinson after All Blacks captain Richie McCaw infringed at a ruck .
The All Blacks then exploded into life with a dazzling attack from a line - out but Ugo Monye 's despairing tackle was enough to just force Mils Muliaina into touch .
After the turgid fare of the previous two weeks it was a surprisingly open game , despite the wet conditions , but tries were at a premium and two Carter penalties , either side of a second Wilkinson kick , ensured the two sides went in level at the break .
Carter had managed to miss another simple penalty before the interval but the All Blacks had shown signs of taking control and they duly edged into a 9 - 6 lead through a Carter penalty seven minutes into the second half .
England were under pressure at the scrum and increasingly on the back foot in defence and the dam finally burst just before the hour mark .

When the All Blacks combined down the blind side it looked as though England had enough defenders but Sitiveni Sivivatu and McCaw linked sweetly to send Cowan over untouched .
Carter finally managed to select the right club and converted from the touchline what looked , even with a quarter of the game remaining , like being the decisive score .
England had shown a fighting spirit throughout but when they established a couple of good attacking positions deep in the All Blacks ' half they lacked the cutting edge required to open up the visitors ' solid defence .
And the All Blacks duly made the game safe when , shortly after Conrad Smith and Muliaina had sliced the England defence apart , Carter slotted his fourth penalty of the game .

Consumer Credit Has Fallen Off a Cliff
Here ’s a chart sent to us by colleague Justice Litle :
Interesting huh ?
Consumer credit has fallen off a cliff .
What does that mean exactly ?
It means Americans are n’t borrowing … and they are n’t buying either .
This weekend , The New York Times noticed :
“ Americans stop buying ; trade deficit declines ” begins the headline .
This is the story we ’ve been telling here at The Daily Reckoning for two years .
Americans have to cut back .
They are out of time and out of money .
Ten years closer to retirement than they were in before the tech stock crash , Baby Boomers are not a penny richer .
Now , they ’re facing a funky economy where housing prices are in decline , jobs are hard to find and lenders are reticent to lend them more money .
Daddy has finally taken the T - bird away .
But wait …if the Baby Boomers stop spending wo n’t it have , like , repercussions ?
The NYT continues :
“ For the first eight months of the year , the United States trade deficit with China is down by about 14 percent or $ 20 billion , compared with one year ago .
The nation ’s trade deficit with Japan has shrunk by almost 20 percent , and its deficits with Mexico , Canada and the European Union are down more than 40 percent .
“ The huge shift stems mainly from the staggering collapse in trade .
With credit markets frozen and Americans facing the highest unemployment in more than 30 years , the United States suddenly stopped shopping overseas at anywhere near the volumes that had become normal . ”
Americans were the world ’s champion consumers .
Just lend them money ; they ’d spend it .
But when they stop spending it brings a hush to the entire planet .
The malls go quiet … trucks slow down … ships are idled … and finally factories are shut down .
Clerks , drivers , stevedores and assembly line workers all go home .
That is what a depression is all about .
The feds are trying to get consumers to spend again .
They ’ve given them tax rebates , incentives , loans , and bribes .
They ’ve run a federal deficit three times higher than the previous record .
They promise $ 1 trillion deficits “ as far as the eye can see . ”
And they put at risk a sum of money equal almost to the entire US GDP .
Still those hardheaded consumers wo n’t consume like they ’re supposed to .
Suddenly , it ’s the ‘ Age of Thrift . ’
But if it ’s really the age of thrift , the stock market does n’t seem to have gotten the message .
The Dow rose 78 points on Friday , to a new post - crash high .
Oil held at over $ 72 .
And gold lost $ 7 to close at $ 1,049 .
What are stock market investors thinking ?
Are they thinking at all ?
If the consumer credit party is over …and the Baby Boomers are on the wagon … is it really possible for US businesses to grow …and prosper ?
Yes , it is .
America has great businesses with great brands .
As the dollar falls it should be able for them to gain global market share in some sectors .
But 70 % of the economy is consumer spending .
Until that changes , the US economy is hostage to US consumer spending .
When consumers stop consuming , the US economy ’s wheels stop turning .
Okay , so you ’re thinking : “ Well … maybe Americans have to cut back , but there are plenty of other people in the world .
Let them do the buying for a while ! ”
And you are right .
America has less than 5 % of the world ’s population .
But it consumes more than 20 % of the total world ’s output – as measured by GDP .
Clearly , Americans have been doing more than their fair share .
It ’s time to let the foreigners belly up to the bar .
Heck , they ’re skinny .
They could use a good drink .
In time , foreigners will spend more .
We do n’t doubt it .
But rebalancing the world ’s economies wo n’t happen overnight .
Nor even in a couple years .
It will take a long , long time .
And a lot of investment in new tools , new training , and new techniques .
Until that happens , when US consumers stop buying it slows wheels all over the world .
Every time finance ministers and heads of state get together they talk about “ rebalancing ” the world economy .
They promise to take steps to make it happen .
But so far , the market is doing all the rebalancing work on its own .
And instead of letting nature take her course … allowing the invisible hand of capitalism to direct capital to where it is actually needed … the heavy hand of government blocks the process of correction .
Credit is still contracting .
And Reuters reports that “ small US firms face credit squeeze . ”
In theory , a genuine recovery in the United States could be led by exports .
A cheaper dollar … and a cheaper workforce ( in global terms ) … would make the United States a better competitor .
But even a cheaper dollar is not guaranteed .
Consumers may have stopped borrowing , but the US government borrows more than ever .
This borrowing – in dollars – increases demand for greenbacks and may actually sustain the dollar at a higher level than it should be .
The feds ’ appetite for borrowing could also force up interest rates – further restricting small businesses ’ access to easy credit .
There is a big difference between selling a few more Harley Davidsons overseas and real export - led economic growth for the US economy .
The latter would require hundreds … thousands …of Harley Davidson enterprises , selling billions worth of goods and services to foreigners .
And right now , those enterprises do n’t exist .
They have no lobbyists trying to get TARP funds .
They have no pet Congressmen slipping tax breaks for them into defense bills .
They have no unions backing them .
How could they ; they have n’t even gotten off the ground yet .
And they may never get off the ground if they ca n’t get financing .
The boomers are saving .
They put their money into the safest possible place – US bonds !
That is , they lend it to the government .
They ’re the feds ’ biggest single source of financing – even bigger than the Chinese .
Meanwhile , the feds pump billions into the banking system .
They supply the banks with capital for expansion and consumption .
But instead of making loans to the private sector , the banks take the feds ’ money and lend it right back to them .
They can borrow at a negligible rate … and then use the money to buy long - dated T - bonds yielding over 4 % .
Result : banks make money ; the private sector has no money to create new businesses .
This weekend , we had a conversation with an English carpenter .
“ It ’s rough .
I remember just a couple of years ago , I could get work anywhere .
Now it ’s off and on .
I still find work , but I have a lot of free time too .
“ It ’s not easy .
Not with four children .
We do n’t have any choice .
We do n’t get any public benefits , you know … because I ’m working .
But I ’m not working as much as I used to .
And I ’m not getting paid as much .
So what can we do ?
We have to tighten our belts .
We get by .
But we ’re definitely not spending money they way we used to .
In fact , I wish we had n’t spent so much back then .
I ’d like to have some of that money now . ”
A report in the Telegraph predicts British property prices – which have been in an upward trend for several months – are headed down again … with a 17 % decline expected .
Until tomorrow ,

A British man found guilty of drug smuggling in China has been told he will be executed on Tuesday morning .
Akmal Shaikh , from London , has been told by his family that he faces death at 1030 ( 0230 GMT ) .
The 53 - year - old has denied all knowledge of the 4kg of heroin found in his possession in the remote north - western city of Urumqi in 2007 .
A No 10 spokesman said the government would continue to ask for clemency and would be " engaged in the coming hours " .
Mr Shaikh 's family say he is mentally ill .
His cousins , who informed him of his fate , told the BBC he was " very upset " .
Soohail and Nasir Shaikh spent an hour and a half with him on Monday at the secure hospital in Urumqi where he is being held .
China does have a history of granting reprieves right at the last minute
Sally Rowen
Reprieve
Executions shrouded in secrecy Soohail Shaikh said his cousin " has n't given up hope " .
Despite that " his feelings and his conversation with us included some items which we strongly feel were still not rational and further go on to stress in our minds that he does need some medical assistance , " he said .
Mr Shaikh has been detained in hospital since August , suffering from high blood pressure .
Meanwhile , supporters are gathering outside the Chinese embassy in London .
They will deliver a letter to the ambassador calling for a stay of execution .
It has been organised by a group formed on the social networking site Facebook called Stop The Execution of Akmal Shaikh .
Maya Farr , 18 , who helped organise the vigil , said she was " opposed to the death penalty " .
" But there are so many aspects to this case which we are really opposed to , " she said .
" His mental history has not been assessed . "

Legal charity Reprieve has been working with Mr Shaikh and his family .
The organisation said the Foreign Office had done a " huge amount " for Mr Shaikh and it had made 10 approaches to the Chinese government in the past six months .
Sally Rowen , legal director of Reprieve 's death penalty team , told the BBC Home Secretary Alan Johnson had said on Monday that " efforts would be intensified " .
The Chinese authorities had assisted the cousins ' visit and there was still hope for Mr Shaikh , she added .
" China does have a history of granting reprieves right at the last minute , literally as prisoners are walking out to the execution ground , so it 's definitely not time to give up hope yet , " she said .
Reprieve says Mr Shaikh was visibly ill to those who knew him in Poland
The charity also released witness statements it said it had collected from people who knew Mr Shaikh while he was living homeless in Poland .
Reprieve 's witnesses all say Mr Shaikh had been clearly mentally ill when they knew him , and that he was fixated on recording a song that he believed would usher in world peace .
The Chinese authorities said they would notify Mr Shaikh about his execution 24 hours beforehand , but it is not certain if they have done so - aside from having informed his family .
His cousins also handed in a petition to the local court asking for a stay of execution and a mercy plea to the Chinese President Hu Jintao .
They were the first family members to have face - to - face contact in two years and the cousins are now on their way back to the Chinese capital Beijing .
' Erratic and extreme '
Mr Shaikh 's family and the UK government have been calling for clemency but Mr Shaikh 's final appeal was turned down last week .
He is set to become the first EU national to be executed in China in 50 years .
The last Briton executed abroad was John " Jackie " Elliott , 42 , who died by lethal injection in Huntsville , Texas , in February 2003 having been convicted of rape and murder .
His family and his defence team have said Mr Shaikh suffers from bipolar disorder and did not know what he was doing .
They say he was duped by a criminal gang into carrying a suitcase that did not belong to him .
His daughter Leilla Horsnell has said he was approached by drug smugglers in Poland and they convinced him they would make him a popstar in China .
CHINA DEATH PENALTY China executed 1,718 people in 2008 , according to Amnesty International Last year 72 % of the world 's total executions took place in China , the charity estimates
It applies to 60 offences , including non-violent crimes such as tax fraud and embezzlement

She has spoken out about his mental health problems and his " erratic and extreme " behaviour .
She said she hoped the authorities would listen to the family 's final pleas but admitted she was not optimistic " because they have n't looked at the evidence previously " .
" I 'd like to be hopeful , but time just seems to be running out , " she added .
MDF , a charity for people coping with bipolar issues , said it had written to the Chinese ambassador to add its voice to pleas for clemency .
Mental health charity Sane said the Chinese authorities " may have overlooked " the impact of bipolar disorder on a person 's behaviour .
A spokesman for the Chinese embassy in London said Mr Shaikh was found with more than 4kg of heroin , which he said was enough to kill 26,800 people .
" Drug trafficking is a grave crime worldwide , " he said .
" The general public has a deep - seated hatred toward it . "

Problems in China continue to mount .
Money supply is growing rampantly out of control , property prices are in a bubble , exports are weak , commodity speculation is pervasive , and GDP growth is more of a mirage than real .
Money Supply Growing Record 29.74 %
Please consider China Monthly New Loans Are 294.8 Billion Yuan , Above Forecast
New local - currency loans totaled 294.8 billion yuan ( $ 43.2 billion ) , compared with 253 billion yuan in October , according to data released by the People ’s Bank of China on its Web site today .
The median forecast of 19 economists in a Bloomberg News survey was 250 billion yuan .
M2 , the broadest measure of money supply , rose a record 29.74 percent in November from a year earlier .
China ’s banking regulator plans to slow new lending to between 7 trillion yuan and 8 trillion yuan next year , a person familiar with the matter said this week .
China is trying to ensure that there is enough credit to support an economic recovery without increased risks of bad loans and asset bubbles .
“ We believe slower credit growth in 2010 will be key to avoid a boom - bust scenario in the economy , ” Wang Tao , a Beijing - based economist for UBS AG , said in a report .
What is China doing with all that printing ?
China Plans To Control Property Prices
The government “ plans to control property prices by accelerating property investment and increasing supply , ” economists Lu Ting and T.J. Bond said in an e-mailed note today .
That contrasts with efforts in 2006 to cool prices by controlling investment , the economists said .
China Is Overbuilding Already
China 's Empty City
China Has Trouble Maintaining Demand Growth
China , the world ’s third - largest economy , faces “ increased difficulties ” in maintaining growth in domestic consumption , the nation ’s top economic planning agency said .
A recovery in external demand is “ difficult , ” the National Development and Reform Commission said on its Web site today , citing Vice Chairman Du Ying .
The nation ’s economic recovery “ is not yet solid , ” the agency known as NDRC said .
China will maintain a “ moderately ” loose monetary - policy stance and “ proactive ” fiscal policies in 2010 as its economic recovery is n’t solid yet , the official Xinhua News Agency said Dec. 7 , citing a statement by the annual central economic work conference .
The country still faces a “ very challenging ” international environment and “ the domestic problems it is confronted with are also complicated , ” Du said in the statement today .
“ The potential risks in the fiscal and financial sectors ca n’t be underestimated , ” Du said .
Economic growth in China , which is spending $ 586 billion on a stimulus package , accelerated to 8.9 percent in the third quarter after slipping to 6.1 percent in the first .
The government is targeting 8 percent growth for the full year .
Moderately Loose Monetary Policy ?!
Bubble Concerns In ‘ Sizzling ’ Shanghai
Escalating prices in Pudong , transformed within two decades from vegetable fields to skyscrapers for Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc , underscore a Chinese property market that set record highs this year after the government unleashed $ 1.3 trillion in new bank lending to counter the global recession .
Premier Wen Jiabao said Nov. 28 that property speculation must be suppressed , and the government on Dec. 9 reinstated a sales tax on homes sold within five years of purchase after reducing the period to two years in January .
That change is superficial and will have minimal impact , said Lu Qiling , an analyst at Shanghai Uwin Real Estate Information Services Co .
“ It ’s only a token measure , ” Lu said .
“ It wo n’t change the upward trend in housing prices . ”
“ The government is clearly in a dilemma , ” Luk said .
“ It wants to address the surging property prices and concerns on bubble - bursting , yet it dares not take drastic measures for fear of hitting the market too hard . ”
The nation ’s real estate and stock markets are a “ bubble ” that will burst when inflation accelerates in 2011 , former Morgan Stanley chief Asian economist Andy Xie said in an interview in Hong Kong today .
“ China ’s asset markets are a Ponzi scheme , ” said Xie , now a Shanghai - based independent economist .
“ Property is heading for one huge bust that will take a year and a half to unfold . ”
The Shanghai Property Index , which tracks 33 developers listed in the city , has more than doubled this year , compared with a 75 percent gain for China ’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index .
True Believers
It wo n’t change the upward trend in housing prices .
China ’s asset markets are a Ponzi scheme
Copper Stockpiles Soar
Copper stockpiles held in duty - free warehouses in China , the top user , may be re-exported after surging to as much as 350,000 tons from almost none at the start of the year , according to Xi’an Maike Metal International Group .
“ We can hardly find buyers for refined copper , ” said Luo Shengzhang , general manager of the copper department at Xi’an Maike .
The company ranks among the country ’s three biggest importers , according to the executive .
“ China ’s got to export some copper from now and next year , ” Luo said in an interview .
Luo ’s estimate of the bonded - zone stockpiles compares with 60,000 tons by Macquarie Group Ltd. in July .
It ’s also more than triple the inventory in Shanghai Futures Exchange warehouses , which stood at 104,275 tons as of the week of Nov. 2 .
A bonded zone holds imported goods before duty has been paid .
In addition to the bonded - zone stockpiles , China may also hold 150,000 tons in the Shanghai area , including in exchange - monitored warehouses ; 235,000 tons at the State Reserve Bureau , which maintains government holdings ; and 200,000 tons with fabricators and private investors , Luo , 36 , said yesterday .
Chinese Pig Farmers Speculate In Copper
Private investors in China , the world ’s largest metals user , have stockpiled “ substantial ” quantities of copper as the government ramps up stimulus spending to spur the economy , according to Sucden Financial Ltd .
Pig farmers and other speculators may have amassed more than 50,000 metric tons , Jeremy Goldwyn , who oversees business development in Asia for London - based Sucden , wrote in an e- mailed report after a visit to China .
That ’s about half the level of inventories tallied by the Shanghai Futures Exchange , which stood last week at a two - year high of 97,396 tons .
Sucden ’s estimate underscores the difficulty analysts face in gauging metals demand in China amid increased speculation by retail investors , whose holdings remain outside the reporting framework undertaken by exchanges .
Private investors in China also had as much as 20,000 tons of nickel , Goldwyn wrote .
Before getting into to the relationship between copper and pork products , I want to draw your attention to what makes me nervous , have a look at these photos from China .
They are excerpted from a China Central Television Channel ( CCTV ) program documenting private speculation and hoarding of metals throughout the country .
According to an associate of mine at an Asia - focused hedge fund who was just in China , “ It ’s pervasive ; people are piling this stuff up in their backyards . ”
China 's Banks Capital Strained
Dec. 18 ( Bloomberg ) Chinese banks ’ capital strength is probably more “ strained ” than it appears as lenders use more off - balance sheet transactions to make room for loan growth , Fitch Ratings said .
The increasing amount of unreported transactions , including repackaging loans into wealth management products to sell to investors , and the outright sale of loans to other financial institutions , represent a “ growing pool of hidden credit risk , ” Fitch said in an annual review of Chinese banks .
Music , Pumpkins , And Lessons Not Learned

Kimi Raikkonen 's switch to the World Rally Championship is expected to be confirmed in the next few hours , AUTOSPORT has learned .
The Finn has been considering his options in the wake of a failure to complete a deal with McLaren , which was his only realistic chance to remain in F1 next year after he agreed to end his Ferrari contract early .
He had been widely expected to make the move to the WRC , and sources have revealed that he has now completed a deal to compete with the Red Bull - backed Citroen junior team alongside Sebastien Ogier .
It is understood that Raikkonen will contest the entire WRC season apart from the New Zealand Rally , which his team is not competing in .
He will also participate in the Arctic Rally .
Raikkonen has made no secret of the fact that he is looking at a return to F1 in 2011 - with speculation already suggesting he is high on Red Bull Racing 's list to partner Sebastian Vettel .
The fact that Red Bull is backing Raikkonen 's rally efforts will do little to quell those rumours , although sources at the energy drinks company are adamant that the current ties mean nothing for his future F1 ambitions .
" This has no prejudice at all for Kimi 's further F1 career if he intends one , " a source close to Red Bull told AUTOSPORT .
" It does not mean at all that he will replace a current Red Bull F1 driver in our team from 2011 . "

Iran has insisted it will not stop enriching uranium Iran 's announcement that it intends to build another 10 uranium enrichment plants is a typically defiant response to international demands for it to stop work on a previously - secret underground site .
Whether this is more than a rhetorical rebuff remains to be determined .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad linked the sites to an expansion of nuclear power in Iran .
But Iran has only one such power plant , dating back to the Shah 's time and it is only now being completed by the Russians .
There are no concrete plans for any more , so this announcement represents at the moment an ambition only .
What it indicates is that recent negotiations to achieve a compromise might be heading nowhere .
Iran 's government appears to think once again that it is strengthened internally by external confrontation .
Another aspect of Mr Ahmadinejad 's statement is that he is threatening to enrich uranium higher than the level needed for nuclear fuel , for potential use in a medical reactor .
However , Iran cannot produce the fuel rods from such materials .
Only France and Argentina can , according to experts .
So again the motivation is not clear , beyond defiance .
Sanctions Iran 's attitude and the latest criticism of Iran by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) are signs that that new sanctions could be on the way .
And down the road , the Israelis will be watching .
Israel is not and will not be convinced that Iran 's intentions are peaceful .
New sanctions would have to be given time to work .
But a military strike at some stage cannot be ruled out .
Resolution
The IAEA resolution , censuring Iran 's secret construction of a uranium enrichment plant near Qom , was supported by Russia and China .
This does not mean they will join in a new round of international measures against Iran .
But it does mean that Iran cannot count on them for diplomatic support .
And it shows that Russia might not supply Iran with the S - 300 anti-missile system that Iran has ordered .
That would be a sanction in itself .
President Barack Obama has indicated that he will assess the Iranian position by the end of the year .
If he goes for more sanctions , he will try to get Russia and China on board .
If he cannot , he will act with fellow negotiators Britain , France and Germany , plus , he hopes , the whole EU and other players .
Target oil
The UN Security Council has approved three rounds of sanctions so far - covering trade in nuclear material , as well as travel and financial restrictions aimed at Iranian organisations and individuals .
If there are to be new sanctions , then the targets will be Iran 's oil trade , especially its reliance on imported refined petroleum products , and the buzzword is reinsurance .
Q&A : Iran and the nuclear issue Nuclear fuel cycle Reinsurance is the means by which insurers can protect themselves against losses and the idea would be to stop or dissuade companies from proving such services for trade with Iran .
According to Wilkie , Farr and Gallaher , an international law firm , the intent is this : " The Obama Administration 's sanctions could affect most Iranian import and export trade .
" [ Its ] proposals could ban goods , services , technology , information , or other activities that support the importation or production of refined petroleum by Iran , including refinery construction , modernization , and repair . "
Some governments might be satisfied with that for the time being , bearing in mind that there is no evidence of actual nuclear bomb - making activity and Iran 's repeated insistence that it will not build any such device .

The United States Supreme Court on Monday refused to hear an appeal by four former Guantanamo inmates who want to sue the US government for torture they say they endured during their stay at the prison camp , a move the inmates ’ lawyers say could pave the way for future torture practices by the US military .
The four plaintiffs — Rhuhel Ahmed , Jamal al - Harith , Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul — say they were subjected to numerous forms of physical abuse and religious humiliation , including having their beards shaved , being threatened with dogs and being placed in cells that were alternately very hot or very cold .
The lawsuit also alleges that one of the guards at Guantanamo flushed a Koran down the toilet to anger and humiliate the prisoners .
One of the inmates , Ahmed , has also alleged “ sexual abuse . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Three of the detainees —
Ahmed , Iqbal and Rasul — are British residents who say they were in Afghanistan in 2001 to provide humanitarian relief in the wake of the US invasion when they were kidnapped by Afghan warlord Rashid Dostum , a US ally , and accused of belonging to Al Qaeda .
The fourth inmate , Al - Harith , says he was in Pakistan on a religious retreat when he was kidnapped by the Taliban and taken to a prison in Afghanistan .
When the Taliban fled and US forces seized the prison , Al - Harith was taken into US custody .
All four were transferred to Guantanamo by the US military and spent more than two years there before being returned to the UK .
With the help of the Center for Constitutional Rights , the four men have been fighting to sue former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and 10 other military officials since 2004 .
After a federal appeals court in Washington , DC , rejected their lawsuit in 2008 , the Supreme Court ordered the lower court to reconsider its ruling , in light of another Supreme Court ruling , earlier that year , that Guantanamo inmates had constitutional protection .
When the case returned to the lower court , the Obama administration argued against the plaintiffs , saying that former Guantanamo detainees do n’t have any constitutional rights .
And even if they did , the administration argued , the defendants should be immune from prosecution because the Supreme Court had n’t yet ruled that detainees have rights at the time the alleged abuses took place .
The lower court accepted this argument and quashed the lawsuit yet again .
On Monday , the Supreme Court effectively upheld that ruling by refusing to hear the appeal .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ It is an awful day for the rule of law and common decency when the Supreme Court lets stand such an inhuman decision , ” said Eric Lewis , the lead attorney for the plaintiffs , in a statement from the CCR .
“ The final word on whether these men had a right not to be tortured or a right to practice their religion free from abuse is that they did not .
Future prospective torturers can now draw comfort from this decision . ”
“ Where can these men seek justice now for the terrible things that were done to them ? ” asked CCR attorney Shayana Kadidal .
“ The entire world recognizes that torture and religious humiliation are never permissible tools for a government , yet our highest court seems to think otherwise . ”

UPDATE
The White House is denying a news report that it is pressuring Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to negotiate a deal with Sen. Joe Lieberman on health care reform .
“ The report is inaccurate , ” White House communication adviser Dan Pfieiffer told Greg Sargent at the Plum Line .
“ The White House is not pushing Senator Reid in any direction .
We are working hand in hand with the Senate Leadership to work through the various issues and pass health reform as soon as possible . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Citing “ an official close to the negotiations , ” Politico reported Monday :
The White House is encouraging Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - Nev. ) to cut a deal with Sen. Joe Lieberman ( I - Conn . ) , which would mean eliminating the proposed Medicare expansion in the health reform bill .
But Reid is described as so frustrated with Lieberman that he is not ready to sacrifice a key element of the health care bill …
“ There is a weariness and a lot of frustration that one person is holding up the will of 59 others , ” the official said .
“ There is still too much anger and confusion at one particular senator ’s reversal . ”
The proposed health care compromise would see Medicare expanded so that people aged 55 and over can buy in to the government - run plan , which currently covers senior citizens aged 65 or older .
Supporters of health care reform have criticized Lieberman ’s stance , pointing out that the independent Connecticut senator who caucuses with the Democrats had been in favor of such an idea as recently as three months ago .
Politico reports that the Democrats and the Obama administration now have “ limited options ” in terms of getting a health care bill passed :
They can negotiate a deal with Lieberman , which would strip out most of the “ progressive ” reforms in the bill ; they could try to get Republican Senator Olympia Snowe ( R - ME ) on board , though Politico describes this as doubtful ; or they could pass a reform bill through reconciliation with the already - passed House bill , a move that would allow the Democrats to move forward with only 51 votes , but which is seen as politically risky .
Update at bottom : 81 percent of Democrats want Lieberman punished for healthcare filibuster : poll

Sen .
Joe Lieberman is n’t backing down from his demand that health care reform not include a public option .
But as he said on Sunday , there are now more items that must be removed before he will give his vote .
“ I want to tell you , we could pass a health care reform bill this week with more than 60 votes and it would be bipartisan if we just took a few things out of the bill as it is today , ” Lieberman told CBS ’ Bob Schieffer during a Sunday broadcast .
“ Give me the list of things that have to be taken out to pass , ” Schieffer prompted .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ From my point of view , no public option , ” the senator replied .
“ No Medicare buy - in .
Class act , which will add to our debt in the future , ah , it does n’t take much more than that .
You ’d have a great bill left . ”
According to a poll conducted by Progressive Campaign Change Committee and Democracy for America released Monday , Democrats want Lieberman punished if he joins a Republican filibuster of healthcare reform .
ADVERTISEMENT
Eighty - one percent of Democrats said they would like to see the senator ’s chairmanship — which he was allowed to keep despite campaigning for Sen .
John McCain in 2008 — taken away should he sustain a filibuster .
Only 10 percent of Democrats said there should be no punishment .
Even fewer ( nine percent ) said they had yet to make up their minds , underscoring just how divisive Lieberman is within the party .
An additional 43 percent of independents agreed that Lieberman should lose his post , with 30 percent saying no .
Only ten percent of Republicans , meanwhile , thought Lieberman should be punished under such a scenario — while 66 percent said he should not .
All told , 47 percent of the public said Senate leaders should remove Lieberman from his chairmanship if he joins the Republican filibuster ; 32 percent said they should allow him to keep the post ; 21 percent said they were n’t sure .

Comedian and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel , who is white , visits an African American barber shop to talk about handshakes and race .
The piece suggests that norms we use to greet others vary by race .
I wonder what consequences such differences might have for casual interaction across racial boundaries .
Later , Jamie Foxx appears on Kimmel ’s show and they continue on the same topic .
If such differences are widespread , to what extent might it help to be more open and up front about their existence and possible consequences ?
Many of my games boil down to , at some level , a large collection of circles ( or spheres ) interacting with each other .
I use circles for collision detection , and otherwise whenever I can for organization , because the results look more natural than using boxes .
If you organize using boxes , your simulation will tend to “ align ” to the axes , which nature surely does not do .
So naturally , detecting when two of these circles are touching each other is one of the larger computational problems that my games face .
And bewilderingly , I have not found anywhere a good solution that covers circles in a wide variety of sizes .
That is what this article is about .
If your circles are all about the same size , and in particular fairly small in comparison to the needed accuracy of the algorithm , the obvious and de-facto solution is to use a quadtree .
That is , start with the whole screen and divide it up into 4 regions , and do so recursively until you have a nice spatial arrangement of your objects , categorizing objects by which region their center lies in .
When you have a circle and want to see what other circles are touching it , you just look for other objects in the smallest region .
Well , except you are not a point , you are a circle , so you might penetrate the edge of the region , in which case you need to look at the adjacent region as well .
Well , except other circles might penetrate the edges of their regions , so you actually need to look at all adjacent regions .
Well , except you might be really big , so you need to look in all the regions that you touch .
Well , except other objects might be really big , so … you need to look in all the regions .
A quadtree has not bought us anything if circles can be arbitrary sizes ; collision detection is still linear .
You could say things like the number of very big circles is usually small ( because they would collide away their competition ) , so you can put an upper bound on the size of circles in the tree then just do a linear check on the big ones .
But that is an awful hack with a tuning parameter and does n’t generalize .
Should n’t the right solution work without hacks like that ( for the fellow game developers in my audience : despite your instincts , the answer is yes :-) .
I have worked with quadtrees before , and saw this problem a mile away for my game with circles of many different sizes .
The first variation I tried was to put circles into regions only if they fit entirely .
Circles on the boundaries would be added to the lowest branch that they could fit into .
Then to check collisions on an object , you look at where it is in the tree , check all subregions , and then check all superregions ( but not the superregions ’ subregions ) .
You will get small things in your vicinity on your way down , and large things on your way up .
And it ’s still logarithmic time … right ?
Wrong .
Suppose that every object in the world lay on the horizontal and vertical center lines .
Even very small objects would accumulate in the top node , and no region subdividing would ever occur .
This degenerate situation causes linear behavior , even though just by shifting the center of the region a little bit you get a sane subdividing .
It ’s not just a “ let ’s hope that does n’t happen ” thing : there are a lot of bad situations nearby it , too .
Any object lying on those center lines will be checked when any other object is testing for its collisions , because it is on the way up .
This did , in fact , become a major issue in my 10,000 particle simulation .
But if we could somehow salvage the original idea of this solution without the degenerate case , then we would get logarithmic behavior ( when the field size is large relative to the radii of the particles ) .
To understand this solution , I would like you to turn your attention to one dimensional simulations .
Here the previous solution would be subdividing the real line into a binary tree .
But the new solution divides intervals into not two , not four , but three child intervals .
However , not in thirds like you would expect .
( 0,1 ) is divided into ( 0,1/2 ) , ( 1/4 , 3/4 ) , and ( 1/2,1 ) — the intervals overlap .
Any “ circle ” ( in 1 - D , so it ’s another interval ) with diameter less than 1/4 must fit into at least one of these subregions .
We use that property to organize the circles so that their size corresponds to their depth in the tree .
If you know the diameter of the circle , you know exactly how deep it will be .
So now when we are looking downward , we really are looking for small circles , and when we are looking upward we are looking for large ones , and there is no possibility of an accumulation of small irrelevant circles above us that are really far away .
However , on your way up , you also have to check back down again .
If you are in the left portion of the ( 1/4,3/4 ) interval , you might intersect something from the right portion of the ( 0,1/2 ) interval , so you have to descend into it .
But you can prune your search on the way down , cutting out “ most ” ( all but a logarithm ) of it .
For example , you do n’t need to check the interval ( 1/16,1/8 ) and its children even though you are checking its parent ( 0 , 1/2 ) — it is too far away .
When you are deciding which region to put a circle in and you have a choice , i.e. the circle fits in multiple subregions , always pick the center one .
When the circles are in motion , this gets rid of the degenerate case where a circle bounces back and forth across a deep , expensive boundary .
If you generalize to 2D , you end up cutting a region into 9 subregions ( thus the name enneatree ) .
The way I did it was to alternate cutting horizontally and vertically , so that I did n’t have to have 9 - way if - else chains .
That had more subtleties than I had expected .
I have yet to find a straightforward , elegant implementation .
The algorithm seems to work well — I am able to support 5,000 densely packed circles in C# without optimizations .
The inspiration for this algorithm comes from the field of computable real numbers ( infinite — not arbitrary , but infinite precision numbers ) .
You run into trouble if you try to represent computable reals infinite streams of bits , because some interactions might be “ non-local ” ; i.e. you might have to look infinitely far down a stream to find out whether a bit should be 0 or 1 .
Those guys solve the problem in the same way I did , by dividing intervals into 3 overlapping subintervals , and using this 3 - symbol system as their number representation .
I see a glimmer of a connection between the two problems , but I ca n’t see it formally .
Maybe it would become clearer if I considered infinite collections of infinitesimal objects needing collision detection .
Woodward played a spy in TV series Callan Veteran actor Edward Woodward has died aged 79 , his agent has confirmed .
The Croydon - born star had been suffering from various illnesses , including pneumonia , and died in hospital , said Janet Glass .
Woodward is most famous for his roles in the cult 1973 horror film The Wicker Man , alongside Sir Christopher Lee , and TV series The Equalizer and Callan .
Sir Christopher described Woodward as " a very good friend and a splendid actor " .
Ms Glass said he had been ill for several months and passed away surrounded by members of his family .
The actor , who lived in Hawker 's Cove near Padstow , died at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro .
" I knew him a very long time and he was a superb human being , " she said .
" That integrity shone through in the roles he played .
I can't ever remember , in all the productions he undertook , anyone having a bad word to say about him and he never had anything bad to say about anyone else either . "
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Ms Glass added : " Universally loved and admired through his unforgettable roles in classic productions , he was equally fine and courageous in real life , never losing his brave spirit and wonderful humour throughout his illness .
" His passing will leave a huge gap in many lives , " she said .
Albert Square
He was last seen on screen in BBC One soap EastEnders as Tommy Clifford earlier this year .
Barbara Windsor said she was " deeply saddened " at the news .
" I have such fond memories of our time working together , " she added .
Diederick Santer , executive producer of EastEnders , said : " All of us at EastEnders are very sad to learn that Edward has passed away .
" We were thrilled when he joined us for a stint of six episodes earlier this year .
He was a delight to work with , and delivered a characteristically touching and layered performance .
Our thoughts are with his family . "
Woodward won a Golden Globe in 1987 for his role in The Equalizer Robin Hardy , who directed The Wicker Man , said of Woodward : " He was one of the greatest actors of his generation , without any question , with a broad career on American television as well as British film .
" He was the absolute star of The Wicker Man .
He was an extremely nice human being . "
Film critic Barry Norman described Woodward was a " very fine " actor .
" He made about three dozen movies but he was rarely given the chance to star in a movie , " he told BBC News .
" The two films that do stand out are obviously The Wicker Man and Breaker Morant , about three British soldiers in the Boer War .
In both he gave excellent performances . "
What a true legend of the entertainment industry - they do n't make them like him anymore
Tom Rickard , Bearwood
Read your comments Actor Simon Pegg , who was a big fan of Woodward and cast him in his 2007 film Hot Fuzz , said on Twitter : " So sorry to hear we have lost the great Edward Woodward .
Feel lucky to have worked with him . "
He later released a statement , saying that Hot Fuzz rehearsals " were often gleefully tossed aside just to hear him ( Woodward ) recount stories from his life and career .
" Edgar Wright and myself sought him out because we were fans of his work , by the time the cameras stopped rolling , we were devoted fans of the man .
My love and sympathy goes out to Michele and his family . "
Woodward is survived by his second wife , the actress Michele Dotrice , and four children , three of them from his first marriage .

For most of the last century , the West faced real enemies : totalitarian , aggressive , armed to the teeth .
Between 1918 and 1989 , it was possible to believe that liberal democracy was a parenthesis in history , destined to be undone by revolution , ground under by jackboots , or burned like chaff in the fire of the atom bomb .
Twenty years ago today , this threat disappeared .
An East German functionary named Günther Schabowski threw open his country ’s border crossings , and by nightfall the youth of Germany were dancing atop the Berlin Wall , taking hammers to its graffiti - scarred facade .
It was Nov. 9 , 1989 .
The cold war was finished .
There will be speeches and celebrations to mark this anniversary , but not as many as the day deserves .
( Barack Obama could n’t even fit a visit to Berlin into his schedule . )
By rights , the Ninth of November should be a holiday across the Western world , celebrated with the kind of pomp and spectacle reserved for our own Independence Day .
Never has liberation come to so many people all at once  to Eastern Europe ’s millions , released from decades of bondage ; to the world , freed from the shadow of nuclear Armageddon ; and to the democratic West , victorious after a century of ideological struggle .
Two more urban guerrilla attacks occurred in Athens and Salonica respectively within 24 hours of the armed attack against a police station in Athens .
A time - bomb hit the house of a leading conservative politician in Athens and another explosive mechanism hit the Spanish consulate in Salonica .
At the same time confusion reigns over the communique with which a new armed group appears to be claiming responsibility for Tuesday 's attack .
Within less than 60 hours of the Tuesday armed attack against the police station of Agia Paraskevi in Athens which has left 6 police officers seriously wounded ( two remain in intensive care ) , two more attacks , with explosives this time , have come to add up tension to the already heated social and political climate in greece .
On the early hours of Friday 30 of October , a time - bomb hit the entrance of the house of a leading conservative politician , Ms Marietta Giannakou , causing material damage but no human injuries , as a phone - call by the urban guerrillas to the press had warned of the explosion .
Ms Giannakou is the leading MEP of the now in opposition New Democracy right - wing party , and was the Minister of Education during the massive movement against educational reforms in 2006 - 2007 .
The attack against Ms Giannakou 's house has been claimed through a long communique by the Nuclei of Fire Conspiracy who amongst other things used the opportunity to communicate their views against anarchist participation in educational protest marches , professing once again their self - proclaimed nihilist platform .
Earlier this week the Minister of Public Order , Mr Chrisochoidis , has gone public urging the 6 persons wanted in relation to the Nuclei of Fire bomb campaign to surrender , arguing that the State will show lineancy due to the young of their age .
The same night in Salonica , the Spanish Consulate was hit by an explosive mechanism .
A communique by a first appearing group has claimed the attack was in solidarity to Amadeu Casellas , a long - term anarchist prisoner in Spain .
Last week more explosive mechanisms in Salonica had hit several MP offices , including the office of the Debuty Minister of Public Order , Mr Vougias , as well as the house of the extreme - right minded Archibishop of Salonica .
The new attacks come to add to the climate of escalating tension in the country , to which considerably confusion was added by a communique published on Friday in the daily press , claiming responsibility for the Tuesday attack against the police station of Agia Paraskevi .
The communique which employs long quotes from the Communist Party leader during the Civil War , Nikos Zachariadis , as well as from the Communist International , is signed by the acronyms OPLA , the name of the Communist Party " Groups for the Protection of People 's Struggle ' , an elite corps of combat units and intelligence teams during the Civil War , notorious for assassinations of both monarchofascists and political opponents within the communist movement .
Besides changing the acronym to now mean " Groups of Popular Proletarian Self - Defense " , the communique consists largely of paraphrases of the original text announcing the forming of OPLA in the 1940s , urging " the organisation of structures of mass popular self - defense " against state and parastate repression .
The Communist Party of Greece has responded angrily , denouncing the communique as a provocation and a mockery of history and the armed struggle of the Democratic Army of Greece ( DSE ) .
The authenticity of the communique remains highly disputed and controversial .
The Neuralynx System translates thoughts into speech .
It connects to the neurons , sending signals wirelessly to a laptop , which translates the brain activity into spoken English .
It 's not science fiction :
They tried it with a paralyzed 26 - year - old and it works .

According to the research paper , they inserted the electrodes into the patient 's brain , installing signal amplifiers and transmitters under the scalp .
The circuitry — powered by an induction electric supply — transmits the signals to a laptop via FM radio .
The software then converts the analog signal to digital data that the neural decoder interprets these into speech commands , which are then sent to the synthesizer .
The whole process takes 50 milliseconds , which is the same amount of time it takes to any normal person to do the same process , using their nerves , vocal chords , and mouth .
According to Neuralynx project leader Frank Guenther — from the Department of Cognitive and Neural Systems and the Sargent College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences at Boston University — their system is going to get even better soon .
The results of our study show that a brain - machine interface ( BMI ) user can control sound output directly , rather than having to use a ( relatively slow ) typing process .
Our immediate plans involve the implementation of a new synthesizer that can produce consonants as well as vowels but remains simple enough for a BMI user to control .
We are also working on hardware that will greatly increase the number of neurons that are recorded .
We expect to tap into at least 10 times as many neurons in the next implant recipient , which should lead to a dramatic improvement in performance .

Obviously , this is going to be a miraculous invention for people who can't talk because of nerve damage or any other reason .
It could also mean the beginning of something bigger , perhaps enabling new kinds of communication .
Imagine an implant that could do the same thing on reverse , basically enabling long distance telepathy .
Or an jet fighter that can take mind commands in Russian !
Hmmm ... on second thought , this may be the best worst idea ever created .

James sez , " I just completed a working build of Donald Michie 's MENACE ( Matchbox Educable Noughts And Crosses Engine ) , an early ( 1960 ) example of machine learning .
MENACE uses 304 matchboxes to play Noughts and Crosses ( or Tic Tac Toe in the US ) – and learns over time to play it better .
I built it for a talk at the UK games conference Playful , about Awesomeness and Miracles , particularly focussing on the work of Charles Babbage – and culminating in a surprisingly large version for playing Go … "
MENACE is a machine that plays noughts and crosses , built out of 304 matchboxes .
Each matchbox corresponds to one of the 304 board layouts that the opening player might face ( there are actually 19,683 possible board layouts , but we only need to calculate the opening player 's first four moves , and many are rotationally or reflectively identical ) .
In turn , each matchbox contains a number of glass beads corresponding to each possible next move .
When it is MENACE 's turn to play , the operator simply selects the matchbox corresponding to the current state of play , shakes it , and opens it to see which move has been chosen .
Each matchbox contains a small nook into which one bead falls–and MENACE plays in the square corresponding to that bead .
But what 's really clever is that MENACE learns .
Every time it wins a game , an additional bead is added to each matchbox played , corresponding to each winning move .
Likewise , every time it loses , a bead corresponding to each losing move is removed .
As a result , over time , MENACE becomes more likely to play moves that have previously resulted in wins and less likely to play moves that have resulted in losses .
Sushi , huh ?
is a program that allows Linux users to update and install packages without having an active Internet connection .
This oddly named software allows one to download the updates and desired packages on another computer , transfer it to a removable media and use it on the target Linux computer directly from the removable drive , like portable applications .

I apologize for the long hiatus since my last post .
I 've had this story on my desk for weeks , but the sheer brilliance of it finally brought me back to this blog .
New York City 's first completely non-smoking apartment building will soon open at 1510 Lexington Avenue .
Residents will be prohibited from smoking both inside and within the immediate outside perimeter of the building .
This story might upset a lot of people - after all , the building is banning a legal activity .
However , allow me to explain my positive excitement over this news .
The government did not have a finger in this decision .
This is not a public housing project .
Rather , this is a private , family - owned apartment building that saw unmet market demand for smoke - free housing .
CBS New York reported :
And even with a surplus of apartments on the market , Kenbar [ Management ] feels theirs will be in demand .
Backing that up was a Zogby poll in July , which found that 58 percent of New Yorkers would be willing to pay more for a smoke - free home .
If you want to be free to smoke in your apartment - fine , live someplace else .
force
The much - promoted view that non-smokers would be rushing to premises has not materialised .
We expect another 100 to close next year .
Government intervention is tailored to only meet the needs of the majority
The private market , on the other hand , meets the needs of every individual
All levels of government can learn a valuable lesson from this story .
There is no need toprivate businesses to ban smoking in their establishments .
If a market for smoke - free establishments exist , the private sector will respond to it .
The government will cause more harm than good by intervening in these matters that lie outside its proper scope .
For example , Ireland 's smoking ban in pubs has been highly lauded around the world .
However , it is not as widely known that in the first year of the smoking ban , over 100 pubs went out of business .
According to Stephen Kelly , chief executive of the Federation of Retail Licensed Trade :
If non-smokers want to spend their money only at smoke - free establishments , the private market will react far more appropriately than the government in taking actions to accept their money . ( or , more specifically , the majority of the electorate ) .- an incomprehensible concept to supporters of big government .
It is unclear where the story originated , although officials have suggested that a publicity stunt by the northern Swedish town of Palaja in the 1980s may have been lost in translation .
The male - dominated town arranged for busloads of women to be driven through in an effort to attract more female residents .
How bad is National 's abuse of urgency ?
I 've just obtained some hard data from Parliament , and it speaks for itself :
The 48th Parliament sat for a total of 1503.75 hours between 2005 and 2008 .
Of that time , 148.75 hours - 9.9 % - were under urgency .
The 49th Parliament has sat for 545 hours since its election in 2008 .
Of that time , 183 hours - 33.6 % - have been under urgency .
So there you have it .
Not only is National using urgency more than three times as often as Labour - they 've already sat for more hours under urgency than the previous three years of Labour - led government .
Quite an achievement .
Labour 's low use of urgency was n't due to any virtue on their part ; rather , they simply did n't have a majority for it except for the rare cases where it was actually necessary , or the pre-holiday crush .
By contrast , National 's rubberstamp support partners give it an easy majority , which they are abusing in full autocratic style .
The result is a return to the " elected dictatorship " of old , when the government does whatever it wants and Parliament is reduced to a rubberstamp " fastest legislature in the west " .
This autocratic approach to government is one of the reasons people voted for MMP : to hamstring government , slow it down , and thereby bring it back under control .
Clearly , we did n't do a good enough job last time round ...
Plans for a new windfarm are set to make the Maldives the country with the highest proportion of renewable power in the world .
The 30 - turbine proposed windfarm , close to the capital Malé , will deliver 75 megawatts of electricity at full capacity , enough to provide electricity for the whole of the capital , the international airport and the surrounding resorts .
Excess power will be used to run desalination plants that will produce bottled drinking water from the sea .
If built , the project will mean that per head of population , the Maldives will be getting about six times more electricity from wind than the UK .
Mark Lynas , the British climate change expert who helped the Maldives develop its draft programme for carbon neutrality , welcomed the windfarm proposal , saying that it was an important signal to the rest of the world .
" If a middle - income country can cut its emissions by a quarter through standard commercial partnerships , the rich world has little excuse for saying that carbon reductions are too expensive . "
The Maldives government is taking the lead on climate change mitigation in an effort to push larger states into taking more determined action .
Last month , President Mohamed Nasheed held a cabinet meeting under - water to highlight the plight of the low - lying island nation as the sea - level rises .
In March , he announced a 10 - year plan to reduce its use of fossil fuels to zero .
On part of this is a partnership announced in September with the British biochar company Carbon Gold to improve the country 's soils by adding charcoal produced from coconut shells and other woody waste materials .
The Japanese government is also giving $ 10 m to provide solar panels to power schools and government buildings in Malé .
And Nasheed will be hosting a planning meeting for a group of countries most vulnerable to climate change in the run-up to the UN climate change negotiations in Copenhagen in December .
The $ 200 m windfarm project is being financed and built by Falcon Energy and will use turbines from the American company GE , one of the world leaders in wind energy .
The project will start with a year - long analysis of wind conditions to assess the best arrangement for the turbines .
It will then take up to two years to build .
Hassan Zahir , chairman of the local electricity company , STELCO , said that the windfarm represented an important step in the country 's move towards a carbon - neutral society .
A new gas turbine power station will provide back - up power when conditions are too calm for wind generation .
The Maldives has moderate but reliable winds that blow for most of the year , making this source of power a good choice for the country .
Once built , the windfarm and the gas generator will replace old and inefficient diesel generators on which the Maldives has been completely reliant .
The project is likely to provide about 40 % of the country 's electricity and reduce its overall carbon footprint by about a quarter .
When completed , the windfarm should provide this small island state with the largest percentage of electricity sourced from renewable source of any country in the world .
Another major windfarm announcement is expected within the next few months .
Chinese scientists claim to be able to control the weather .
But is so - called geoengineering more than wishful thinking ?
And , if so , should we be worried ?
The unseasonal snow that fell on Beijing for 11 hours on Sunday was the earliest and heaviest there has been for years .
It was also , China claims , man-made .
By the end of last month , farmland in the already dry north of China was suffering badly due to drought .
So on Saturday night China 's meteorologists fired 186 explosive rockets loaded with chemicals to " seed " clouds and encourage snow to fall .
" We wo n't miss any opportunity of artificial precipitation since Beijing is suffering from a lingering drought , " Zhang Qiang , head of the Beijing Weather Modification Office , told state media .
The US has tinkered with such cloud seeding to increase water flow from the Sierra Nevada mountains in California since the 1950s , but there remains widespread scientific sniffiness in the west at such attempts at weather control .
The chemicals fired into the sky , usually dry ice or silver iodide , are supposed to provide a surface for water vapour to form liquid rain .
But there is little evidence that it works – after all , how do investigating scientists know it would not have rained anyway ?
Such doubts have not stopped China claiming mastery over the clouds .
Officials said the blue skies that brightened Beijing 's parade to celebrate 60 years of communism last month were a result of the 18 cloud - seeding jets and 432 explosive rockets scrambled to empty the sky of rain beforehand .
Last year , more than 1,000 rockets were fired to ensure a dry night for last year 's Olympic opening ceremony .
" Only a handful of countries in the world could organise such large - scale , magic - like weather modification , " Cui Lianqing , a senior meteorologist with the Chinese air force , told the Xinhua news agency after last month 's parade .
Magic or not , there is growing interest in such attempts to deliberately steer the weather , and on a much larger scale .
Next spring , a group of the world 's leading experts on climate change will gather in California to plan how it could be done as a way to tackle global warming , and by whom .
The ideas , some of which , similar to cloud - seeding , involve firing massive amounts of chemicals into the atmosphere , can sound far - fetched , but they are racing up the agenda as pessimism grows about the likely course of global warming .
As interest grows , so does concern about whether such techniques , known as geoengineering , could be developed and unleashed by a single nation , or even a wealthy individual , without wide international approval .
" What will happen when Richard Branson decides he really does want to save the planet ? " asks one climate expert .
If China thinks it can make cloud seeding work , then what about geoengineering ?
" If climate change turns ugly , then many countries will start looking at desperate measures , " says David Victor , an energy policy expert at Stanford University and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations .
" Logic points to a big risk of unilateral geoengineering .
Unlike controlling emissions , which requires collective action , most highly capable nations could deploy geoengineering systems on their own . "
Victor is a heavyweight policy analyst , but one of his most impressive academic feats could have been to smuggle the name of the world 's favourite secret agent into the sober pages of the Oxford Review of Economic Policy .
" Geoengineering may not require any collective international effort to have an impact on climate , " he wrote in an article published last year .
" A lone Greenfinger , self - appointed protector of the planet and working with a small fraction of the [ Bill ]
Gates bank account , could force a lot of geoengineering on his own .
Bond films of the future might [ enjoy incorporating ] the dilemma of unilateral planetary engineering . "
Move over , Goldfinger .
Unilateral geoengineering worries experts for two reasons .
First , the massive side effects ; what it could do to the world 's rainfall , for example .
Second , once started , geoengineering would probably have to be continued , as stopping could bring an abrupt change in climate .
" One of the many dangers with unilateral geoengineering is that once a country starts , it becomes very hard to stop , " Victor says .
" Removing a warming mask , even if it is a flawed mask , would expose the planet to even more rapid and probably dangerous warming . "
In a world where action on global warming has created new markets in carbon worth billions of pounds , countries are not the only players .
Geoengineering would require investment and the private sector is already eyeing up opportunities .
Two companies have emerged with a business plan based on dumping iron in the sea and then selling carbon offsets based on the extra pollution supposedly soaked up by the resulting algal bloom .
And in their new book , Superfreakonomics , Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner talk approvingly of Nathan Myhrvold , the former chief technology officer of Microsoft , whose company , Intellectual Ventures , is exploring the possibility of pumping large quantities of reflective sulphur dust into the Earth 's stratosphere through a patented 18 - mile - long hose held up by helium balloons .
This is the point where most people will shake their heads , say the whole silly idea will never happen , and skip to the crossword .
They could be right , but the global warming story has a tendency to outpace most attempts to predict its path .
Just a few years ago , scientists and politicians talked of the need to avoid a 2C rise in global temperature , yet experts recently gathered at an Oxford University conference openly talked of a likely 4C rise , which , without urgent and unlikely action , a new report from the Met Office says could come within many of our lifetimes .
A decade ago , an unproven idea called carbon sequestration , that would see carbon emissions from power stations trapped under the ground , was talked up by a small group of advocates , but was dismissed by most people as too expensive and unworkable on a large scale .
Renamed carbon capture and storage , the idea is now mainstream energy policy in countries including Britain , despite still being unproven and dismissed by many as too expensive and unworkable on a large scale .
Last month , the International Energy Agency said the world should build 100 full - scale carbon - capture power stations by 2020 , and 850 by 2030 .
If the geoengineering narrative follows a similar arc , then how long until nations or individuals that have the most to lose , or are the first to accept that the required massive emission cuts are impossible , turn to the presently unthinkable option ?
The US government , under President Bush , has already lobbied the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to promote geoengineering research as " insurance " .
When the Royal Society recently carried out an investigation of the options , senior figures privately expected it to dismiss the whole concept as nonsense .
Instead the society , Britain 's premier scientific academy , concluded in September that methods to block out the sun " may provide a potentially useful short - term backup to mitigation in case rapid reductions in global temperature are needed " .
The society stressed that emissions reductions were the way to go , but recommended international research and development of the " more promising " geoengineering techniques .
" My guess is that we will be taking geoengineering a lot more seriously in the next decade , " says Victor , " but we wo n't be in a position to deploy systems for some time .
Most nations will decide it is needed only if we have really bad luck as warming unfolds and if we fail miserably in controlling emissions .
I put the odds of using such systems in the next 40 years at perhaps one in five . "
Of all the apparent obstacles to geoengineering , cost is not likely to be among them .
Compared with the expense of investing in renewable energy and phasing out fossil fuels , the cheapest geoengineering options come with a price tag of just a few billion pounds , perhaps 1 % of what it could cost to tackle global warming through emissions cuts .
Alan Robock , an expert on volcanos and climate at Rutgers University in New Jersey , has looked at how much it might cost to carry out one of the most commonly discussed geoengineering options , to mimic the cooling effect of a volcanic eruption by filling the high atmosphere with sulphur compounds , which reflect sunlight .
The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991 threw so much shiny sulphurous dust into the atmosphere that temperatures across a shaded Earth dropped a year later by about 0.5C .
The 1815 explosion of Mount Tambora in Indonesia triggered the notorious " year without a summer " and widespread failure of harvests across northern regions including Europe , the north - east US and Canada .
Robock has worked out the likely cost of technology needed to deposit a million tonnes of sulphur in the stratosphere each year , an amount equivalent to a Mount Pinatubo eruption every four to eight years , and which scientists think could be enough to cancel out the global warming caused by a continued rise in carbon emissions .
The cheapest option could be to use giant mid-air refuelling aircraft , such as the US air force 's KC - 10 Extender , filled with sulphur dioxide or hydrogen sulphide gas .
It would be a round - the - clock operation , with nine aircraft each required to fly three sorties a day .
In a new paper in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , Robock and his colleagues say it could be done for " several billion " dollars a year .
The results have forced Robock to revise a high - profile list of 20 objections to geoengineering he published last year .
" It turns out that being way too expensive is not the case . "
Robock 's new analysis still includes 17 reasons why geoengineering is a bad idea .
Throwing sulphur into the atmosphere could slow down the world 's water cycle and do more damage to rainfall patterns than the global warming it aims to prevent .
And because techniques that focus on stopping sunlight do nothing to stop carbon dioxide pollution from cars , factories and power stations , they cannot address the looming disaster of ocean acidification .
The surface of the world 's ocean is slowly turning to acid as our extra carbon pollution dissolves in seawater .
Coral reefs already appear doomed and many shellfish could follow .
Altering the atmosphere could also weaken solar power and reverse years of work to close the hole in the ozone layer .
With such a catalogue of potential disasters waiting to unfold , there must be a law against geoengineering ?
The international rulebook is fuzzy on this issue .
The only international framework that directly covers many geoengineering techniques , the 1976 Environmental Modification Convention , designed to stop nations at war from meddling with each other 's weather , has never been tested .
The 1982 UN Law of the Sea Convention and the 1967 Outer Space Treaty could be used to regulate activities and experiments in those shared spaces , but releases to the atmosphere are legally more problematic because nations have sovereignty over their own airspace .
Rather than laws and treaties , many experts argue that the best way to prevent countries or companies from going it alone is to plunge in and start serious research .
" The way to tame the worst forms of unilateral geoengineering is to promote a lot more research , especially [ into ] the side effects , " Victor says .
" One of the biggest dangers is that some governments will try to create a taboo against geoengineering .
A taboo would stop a lot of research but it would n't stop determined rogues .
That scenario would probably be the worst , because rogues would not abandon their efforts and the rest of us would not have done enough research to know what to expect . "
Mike MacCracken , chief scientist at the Climate Institute in Washington , is organising the California meeting next spring , which aims to figure out some guidelines .
He says large - scale unilateral geoengineering is " not very plausible " and his main concern is fairness to future generations .
Once started by anybody , a geoengineering attempt would probably need to be continued by everybody else because it would offer a mask on global warming that could be dangerous to remove .
" It might be that this is how unilateral concerns should be reframed ; this generation more or less deciding it will take only slow action on any type of emissions , essentially forcing the next generation to be more likely to have to invoke geoengineering to save much that anyone considers beneficial and unique about the Earth . "
Read between the lines of most scientific reports on geoengineering and there is a tacit assumption that the idea sounds so extreme that merely discussing it will refocus efforts on emission cuts .
But what if the reverse is true ?
What if a heavily funded research programme , and articles such as this , promote the idea to people who have little interest in moving to a low - carbon world ?
" Knowledge is hard to hide , " says Robock .
" It would be great if people did n't know how to build nuclear bombs , but they do .
We need to research and debate the consequences and then use politics and influence to let people know what would happen . "

Nadie puede ignorar la desigualdad social que padece el país ni menospreciar el costo humano que representa o la enorme oportunidad desperdiciada que su mera existencia entraña .
La desigualdad va de la mano de la pobreza , pero no es lo mismo : ambas coexisten y las dos son resultado de circunstancias estructurales e históricas .
Si bien no es posible cambiar la historia , la experiencia alrededor del mundo es que existen instrumentos para combatir la pobreza y reducir , si no es que eliminar , las causas de la desigualdad .
De hecho , en las últimas décadas la pobreza ha disminuido drásticamente en más del 80 % del mundo .
Aunque algo de eso también ha ocurrido en nuestro país , es evidente que ésta sigue teniendo enormes dimensiones absolutas .
Desde un punto de vista analítico , hay dos maneras de conceptualizar el problema de la pobreza y la desigualdad : uno es reclamándole sus desencuentros a la historia y la otra es construyendo mecanismos que de hecho las reduzcan .
Ambas posturas estuvieron claramente representadas en la contienda electoral de 2006 .
Entonces fue evidente que el país tiene una percepción encontrada sobre la forma en que se deben enfrentar estas dolencias .
Algunos toman una perspectiva moralista e intentan resolver sus cuitas con reclamos históricos atacando la sensatez de la política económica de los últimos años , en tanto que otros buscan formas de corregir los problemas , reducir los costos sociales y atacar las manifestaciones más agudas de la pobreza y la desigualdad .
Lo que es evidente de los últimos años es que la pobreza se puede reducir , pero que los obstáculos que existen son formidables no porque las políticas gubernamentales hayan sido fallidas , sino por el enorme número de obstáculos a su instrumentación .
Si bien es posible imaginar diversas maneras de atacar estos males , existen mecanismos ya probados que permiten discernir entre la charlatanería ( como aumentar el gasto público o imponer limitaciones al comercio ) y las políticas idóneas para enfrentar el problema ( incluyendo la estabilidad macroeconómica y una política social focalizada ) .
Con mucho , el mecanismo más importante para combatir la desigualdad reside en la educación .
La experiencia en este rubro es abrumadora y bastante obvia : los niños de las familias más pobres , rezagadas y desprotegidas no tienen acceso a buenos profesores , los programas educativos no son los adecuados y el enfoque de esa supuesta educación es siempre hacia el control de la población y su subordinación .
No se requiere más que comparar las abrumadoras diferencias entre la educación rural y urbana , privada y pública , para reconocer una fuente abismal de desigualdad .
Muchos países enfrentan serios problemas de desigualdad ; la diferencia entre los que son desarrollados o que realmente avanzan en esa dirección y los que siguen siendo relativamente pobres y rezagados como nosotros es que los primeros han creado mecanismos educativos para que cualquier niño , independientemente de su origen social o económico , tenga la misma oportunidad de hacerla en la vida .
El tema no es sólo mexicano .
En su reciente libro , " El billón de abajo " , Paul Collier analiza lo que ha pasado en el mundo en décadas recientes .
Profesor de economía de Oxford , Collier estudia la evolución de la pobreza y la desigualdad en las últimas décadas y concluye que un conjunto de países hizo suya la globalización y ha logrado disminuciones drásticas en la pobreza .
Instrumentando políticas de acceso a la educación , extendiendo el alcance de la infraestructura más moderna y procurando mecanismos de igualación de oportunidades , la mejoría ha beneficiado a más del 80 % de la población mundial .
La pregunta que se hace Collier es por qué el billón de personas restante no ha mejorado en forma alguna .
Su enfoque es hacia naciones del sub Sahara africano , pero su análisis es extensivo al resto de las naciones que padecen problemas similares .
Según Collier , el problema central de las naciones en que persiste la pobreza es la lucha política entre los reformadores y los liderazgos corruptos y que donde estos últimos ganan , la pobreza aumenta .
Su análisis muestra que las causas del fracaso en esas naciones se evidencia en la forma de trampas al desarrollo , mitos construidos para proteger intereses particulares y , frecuentemente , una elevada dependencia de recursos naturales .
Un poco como López Velarde , Collier afirma que los recursos naturales tienden a distorsionar la economía de una nación y a facilitar la permanencia de malos gobiernos .
Un mal gobierno puede consistir en exactamente eso ( malos funcionarios ) , pero en ocasiones tiene que ver con todos los factores dedicados a preservar un statu quo que impiden atacar las causas de la pobreza .
A pesar de su enfoque ortodoxo en términos económicos , el libro de Collier tiene el gran valor de desafiar a tirios y troyanos .
A los heterodoxos en términos económicos les dice que sus soluciones ( dejar de pagar deuda , procurar un elevado gasto público , vincular inflación con crecimiento ) son contraproducentes y potencialmente catastróficas .
Ningún mexicano que haya tenido conciencia al menos en 1995 puede dudar la veracidad de esa aseveración .
Pero Collier también fustiga a los ortodoxos : para él , el comercio , a pesar de sus enormes beneficios generales , tiene poca probabilidad de beneficiar a los más pobres , cuyas habilidades para fines comerciales son limitadas .
Eso no implica que deba acotarse el comercio , simplemente que es necesario procurar otros medios para atacar la pobreza .
Entre las propuestas que hace Collier , la educación es particularmente prominente .
Un Ggobierno eficaz tiene que ser capaz de romper con los impedimentos sociales , culturales y políticos para asegurar que los pobres tengan las mismas oportunidades que los demás .
Asimismo , el autor propone acciones mucho más agresivas para las naciones más pobres , incluyendo la imposición por parte de la Unión Europea de sanciones ( hasta intervención directa ) para asegurar que se instrumenten medidas contra la corrupción y el respeto a los derechos de propiedad .
Una conclusión ineludible de este libro es que no hay salidas fáciles para la pobreza y la desigualdad , pero tampoco es imposible ser exitoso en la lucha contra estos males porque las estrategias para lograrlo son conocidas y están disponibles para todo aquel que tenga la honestidad de quererlas ver .
La pobreza existe porque hay intereses políticos que se benefician de que todo siga igual .
Los veneros escriturados por el diablo acaban encontrándose con Lampedusa para crear un sistema corrupto dedicado a que nada cambie .

T- Mobile is taking a huge financial hit in the fallout over the Sidekick data loss .
But Microsoft , which bears at least part of the responsibility for the mistake , is paying the price with its reputation .
As reported earlier this week , the phone network had to admit that some users ' data had been permanently lost due to a problem with a server run by Microsoft - owned company , Danger .
The handset works by storing data such as contacts and appointments on a remote computer rather than on the phone itself .
Microsoft Recovers Lost Data
BBC news reports today that Microsoft has in fact recovered all data , but a minority are still affected out of 1 million subscribers .
" The outage was caused by a system failure that created data loss in the core database and the back up , " Microsoft Corporate VP Roz Ho wrote in an open letter .
Microsoft says a more resilient back - up process has been installed to safeguard against a repeat incident .
( Source : bbc.co.uk )
Customers Offered Free Service , $ 100 Credit
The incident , however , has caused serious repercussions for T - Mobile as it attempts to quell customer anger .
As well as telling some customers they can cancel their contract before its scheduled end date , they have now offered those who 've lost their data a $ 100 gift card in compensation , which can be used to pay phone bills or buy other products and services .
This is on top of the month 's free service the network is giving all Sidekick users in response to the week or so when nobody had access to their data .
( Source : infoworld.com )
That may not be enough to satisfy everyone .
At least two lawsuits have already been filed accusing T - Mobile of false advertising in claiming that users would always have access to their data .
The lawsuits also accuse Microsoft of failing to act responsibly in handling the data .

Device Withdrawn From Sale
So hostile has been the response that T - Mobile has ( for the time being ) stopped selling the device .
The Sidekick is currently listed as temporarily out of stock , though some are arguing that the incident has struck a devastating blow to its reputation and future sales .
Cloud Computing Future Questioned
Amidst this , Microsoft appears not to have suffered any financial damage .
However , it seems certain that its relationship with T - Mobile will have taken a major knock .
The software giant is also the target of some very bad publicity as critics question how on earth it failed to put in place adequate back - ups of the data .
That could seriously damage the potential success of the firm 's other " cloud computing " plans , such as web - only editions of Office .

President Barack Obama delivered a rather odd speech Dec. 10 when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize at ceremonies in Oslo .
In the name of peace , he sought to justify former President George W. Bush ’s invasion and occupation of Afghanistan , as well as his own decision Dec. 1 to vastly expand this unnecessary and essentially lost endeavor by ordering another 30,000 troops to the war zone .
In the process , Obama misinterpreted the “ Theory of Just War , ” the subject of this article , which argues it is not a just war .
Most Republicans , especially the neoconservatives , strongly approved of the speech , largely because of its bellicosity and its justification for Bush ’s foray into Afghanistan .
Sarah Palin “ liked what he said . ”
Newt Gingrich “ thought the speech was actually very good . ”
Karl Rove defined it as “ superb , ” “ tough ” and “ effective . ”
The pro-war Wall Street Journal offered a “ Congratulations , Mr. President . ”
Antiwar Democrats and the peace movement were critical , but many liberal Democrats praised it , though seemingly less for its rationalization of war and imperialism and more for its smooth intellectual style and philosophical wanderings , as when Katrina vanden Heuvel , editor of the liberal flagship weekly The Nation , focused on the president ’s “ humility and grace . ”
Salon commentator Glenn Greenwald put it this way : “ Much of the liberal praise for Obama ’s speech yesterday focused on how eloquent , sophisticated , nuanced , complex , philosophical , contemplative and intellectual it was .
And , looked at a certain way , it was all of those things — like so many Obama speeches are .
After eight years of enduring a president who spoke in simplistic Manichean imperatives and bullying decrees , many liberals are understandably joyous over having a president who uses their language and the rhetorical approach that resonates with them .
But that ’s the real danger .
Obama puts a pretty , intellectual , liberal face on some ugly and decidedly illiberal policies . ”
Obama had little option but to express humility in accepting the Nobel Committee ’s award that he himself knew was entirely undeserved and an embarrassment , coming as it did just after his big move to widen the Afghan war .
Under the circumstances , he carried off the necessary humility sequence quite well , noting that “ Compared to some of the giants of history who have received this prize — Schweitzer and King ; Marshall and Mandela — my accomplishments are slight . ”
About half the Nobel speech was devoted to justifying the Afghan war , while most of the rest was a spirited , idealized , and mendacious defense of the U.S. role in foreign affairs since the end of World War II .
Obama ’s foreign policy resembles a combination of that put forward by Presidents Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush ( the elder ) .
It continues the dubious tradition embraced by American presidents since 1945 consisting of seeking hegemony and world supremacy based on overwhelming military power .
In attempting to legitimize Bush ’s Afghan war , Obama declared :
Over time , as codes of law sought to control violence within groups , so did philosophers , clerics and statesmen seek to regulate the destructive power of war .
The concept of a ‘ just war ’ emerged , suggesting that war is justified only when it meets certain preconditions : if it is waged as a last resort or in self - defense ; if the force used is proportional ; and if , whenever possible , civilians are spared from violence … .
The world rallied around America after the 9/11 attacks , and continues to support our efforts in Afghanistan , because of the horror of those senseless attacks and the recognized principle of self - defense …
I believe that all nations , strong and weak alike , must adhere to [ just war ] standards that govern the use of force … .
Where force is necessary , we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct .
And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules , I believe that the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war .
That is what makes us different from those whom we fight .
That is a source of our strength .
President Obama is incorrect when he suggests that the Afghan war conforms with the theory of just war .
Here ’s why :
Over the last 1,500 years , secular and religious ethicists have developed the theory of just war .
The Roman Catholic Church is a major organizational upholder of the just war concept , but the theory enjoys universal application and is embraced in international law and the UN Charter .
This is not a pacifist theory because it finds some wars just and some unjust .
For instance , U.S. participation in World War II against German and Japanese imperialism is considered just , but its role in Iraq is termed unjust .
Justness , not nonviolence , is the international criterion .
There are nuanced differences in the interpretation of just war theory , but there is general agreement on its six principal stipulations — all of which be must honored for the resort to war to be considered just .
Four of the points are relevant to Afghanistan , the most important being “ Just Cause . ”
This means war is permissible to confront “ a real and certain danger ” — either an attack or imminent attack from another country — and includes self - defense or the defense of others from external aggression .
Afghanistan neither attacked the United States on Sept. 11 , 2001 , nor was it threatening an imminent attack .
This rules out the just cause of self - defense .
We will explain this before moving to the other three points .
Al - Qaeda , a small decentralized fundamentalist religious organization on the fringes of Islam was responsible for the attack , not the state or government of Afghanistan .
Al - Qaeda was formed in Afghanistan by Osama bin-Laden , a Saudi exile , in 1988 .
Its members were drawn from foreign Muslim jihadist fighters taking part in the Afghan civil war ( 1979 - 1996 ) against a left wing government in Kabul that was being defended by Soviet troops , followed by a war between the various Afghan factions after the left was overthrown in 1992 .
The U.S. financed the anti-government civil war , as did Pakistan and Saudi Arabia on a lesser scale .
Al - Qaeda was among the beneficiaries of Washington ’s support .
Most al - Qaeda recruits returned to their own countries in the Middle East and Europe after the war .
Some set up small branches of the organization where they lived .
A sector of al - Qaeda , including bin-Laden , remained in Afghanistan with the approval of the fundamentalist Taliban government , which emerged victorious from the civil war in 1996 .
No Afghan was among the 19 Al - Qaeda suicide operatives , armed with box cutters , who hijacked four airliners on 9/11 and slammed one of them into the Pentagon and two others into New York ’s World Trade Center , killing about 3,000 people .
Much of the planning for the attack evidently took place in Europe and then in the U.S.
There has never been any proof that Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar was aware of the Sept. 11 plan , much less a party to it .
Just hours after the Washington and New York City destruction , the Taliban authorities denounced the attacks .
At the same time , Afghanistan ’s Taliban ambassador to Pakistan stated to the media “ We want to tell the American children that Afghanistan feels your pain .
We hope the courts find justice . ”
President Bush immediately rejected suggestions for a major international police effort to apprehend the leaders of the attack .
Instead , after conferring with his neoconservative advisers , he defined this small - group terrorist raid as an act of war carried out from Afghan territory with the connivance of the Taliban government .
This allowed Bush to declare an open - ended “ War on Terrorism , ” paving the way for his Oct. 7 bombing and invasion of Afghanistan , and then Iraq in March 2003 .
Another of the just war points is “ Last Resort .
This means a country may resort to war only after exhausting every other possible alternative .
This is reflected in the UN Charter , which calls for serious efforts to resolve differences nonviolently through diplomacy or the courts , before the resort to military means .
Bush rejected an offer by the Taliban to produce bin-Laden if the U.S. would n’t invade .
Its only stipulation was that Washington provide proof that the al - Qaeda leader actually committed the crime , as would any country asked to surrender a suspect to another country .
Bush swiftly refused , ruled out any negotiations , and began a bombing campaign and invasion .
President Obama said in Oslo that “ America did not seek ” the Afghan war , but war was Bush ’s first resort , not last , as was the case 18 months later when he attacked Iraq .
A third stipulation is “ Right Intention ” — i.e. , fighting only on behalf of an expressed just cause without a trace of ulterior motivation such as the acquisition of power , land , resources , riches , etc .
Bush ’s ulterior motivations were to interject U.S. military power into Central Asia in proximity to Russia , China and resource - rich former Soviet republics , and also to occupy a territory adjacent to Iran , another neoconservative target for regime change at the time .
The last point is “ Proportionality , ” meaning that the quantity of violence , damage and costs is proportionate to the expressed reason for resorting to war .
Given the violation of the Just War standards of just cause , last resort , and right intention , the disproportion involved in Bush ’s bombing , invasion , occupation and continuing warfare is self - evident .
In any event , Bush ’s expressed reason for war was that the Afghan authorities did not hand over bin-Laden , but that was compromised by the U.S. refusal to provide the evidence required for extradition or to even discuss with the Kabul government the question of the Taliban ’s alleged complicity in the terror attacks .
Thus , despite President Obama ’s efforts to define Bush ’s invasion of Afghanistan as just , he has decided to send another 30,000 troops , on top of approximately 30,000 sent earlier in this year , to fight in a manifestly unjust war .
It is common belief that all purchases on the App Store are definitive .
Well , it 's not the case .
It 's true indeed that you might get disoriented in iTunes but if you know how to proceed and as long as you have a valid reason , there is no obstacle to getting your money back .
1. Launch iTunes
2 . Log on to your account ( using the upper right box )
3. Proceed to Purchase history ( iTunes link )
4. Report a problem
5 . Fill out the form politely and concisely .
You 're going to have to provide a valid reason to be refunded
5b . In case you 're unsuccessful or unable to access the form just use the online form , do n't forget to give your purchase number and such
There are hundreds of stories around the web of people obtaining a refund because of a purchase mistake or because the app did n't function properly ( like push notification would n't always go through ) .
You also need to precise that a refund is what you would like to obtain .
After that you should receive an answer in the next 48 hours and you 'll be refunded in 4 to 5 business days .
However , there is an issue with obtaining a refund .
When Apple grants you a refund it keeps its 30 % , so basically when you ask for a refund the developer is gonna be billed 30 % of his app price .
Try to use this possibility with parsimony and be fair

NuSofting ’s Collide and Play .
Johan Larsby points us to a developer contest at the mind - bogglingly comprehensive audio plug - in site , KVR Audio :
KVR Audio Developer Challenge
Developers are competing for a prize fund donated by readers and users , currently up to US $ 1770 ( probably more than you ’d make from a small plug ) .
Developer entries are currently closed , but that means voting is on .
There are 31 entries ; the contest is pretty Windows - biased with only 5 Mac - compatible entries , which makes me suspect that cross - platform developers will have a major edge in voting .
Of course , the upshot of all of this is that you get to take advantage of lots of free software — just leave a few dollars in the hat to keep the thing going .
Here are a few of the more unusual contributions :
Bram Bros Lunchbox Battles : “ Play drum contests in your lunchbreaks and earn street cred from your coworkers with your block rocking jams ! ” Videovst by Metamorphosis : “ Videovst is a freeware VST plugin for playing back MPEG1 movie files in time - sync with your favourite audio host . ”
Pondular by Mopiskevin @ Mopis- Synth.com : “ Pondular is a unique way of interacting with a synth .
The grid on the screen is your “ pond . ”
Playing notes or clicking creates ripples in the pond . ”
Collide and Play by NuSofting : Standalone program for Windows designed to compose ambient music in realtime by the interaction of animated graphic elements
There are also some very mature - looking instruments and effects in there , including some feature - laden pattern sequencers , compressors , and synthesizers , as well as the usual experimental stuff and a random plug - in featuring a picture of a voluptuous woman in a Catwoman outfit to “ sweeten ” your sound .
Updated : Johan ’s own submission is one that should interest a lot of you : Repeatler is a real - time “ sample accumulator ” for adding loops from prerecorded or live sources .
I ’m constantly getting requests for plug-ins just like this , so the fact that this is simple , elegant , free , and Mac / Windows compatible probably means you ’ll want to check out the download !
Repeatler from Larsby of BetaBugs is a live looper plug - in for Mac and Windows .
Not that I ’m necessarily endorsing them for victory , but I find it interesting that there are unusual new , game - like interfaces with built - in physics , as I think you ’ll see a lot more of this in the future .
( From me , even , if I can keep practicing my ActionScript skills . )
I had to picture those , because I ’ve seen enough of the usual plug - in interface fare .
May the best contribution win !
Like , totally Pondular : probably the first of many liquid - simulation interfaces for music .

Asylum seekers involved in a wild brawl on Christmas Island over the weekend are being threatened with deportation .
More than 40 detainees and five security staff were injured in the clash .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says detainees found guilty of serious offences as a result of the riot will have that taken into account during the processing of their asylum claims .
Mr Rudd and his Immigration Minister Chris Evans were peppered with questions during Question Time this afternoon about the riot and the Government 's asylum seeker policies .
One - hundred - and - fifty people were involved in the half - hour brawl at the Christmas Island detention centre on Saturday night .
Three detainees suffered serious injuries and were flown to Perth for specialised care .
It is claimed that pool cues , tree branches and broom handles were used in the fight between Sri Lankan and Afghan detainees .
Refugee campaigners say overcrowding led to the violence , but the Government says tension had been building at the centre for some time , due partly to concerns from some Sri Lankans that their asylum applications will fail .
Mr Rudd says the riot could affect the refugee applications of the asylum seekers involved .
" If a detainee on Christmas Island has committed a serious offence , this will be taken into consideration as part of the assessment as to whether or not they are granted a visa , " Mr Rudd said .
Senator Evans says the Immigration Department is investigating the riot and Federal Police are looking at laying criminal charges .
" Those that were responsible , if we can identify them , will be prosecuted after an AFP investigation , " he said .
" Clearly though security at the centre will be tightened to ensure we do n't have any incidents like this again . "
Capacity concerns
The Federal Government recently announced plans to expand the capacity of the Christmas Island detention centre to 1,400 , but it is not there yet .
It can only accommodate 1,028 and the latest head count is 975 .
Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition has been in contact with some of the detainees since the riot .
He says many asylum seekers are worried by some recent deportations , but the sheer number of asylum seekers at the centre is the main reason for the riot .
" I have spoken to one Afghan and one Tamil detainee inside the detention centre .
The incident seems like it was confined to just one compound , but they were aware of the situation and had spoken to people and the Afghan guy had observed some of it certainly , " he said .
" What they say is that there was no particular cause .
That is was a result , people are angry , people are frustrated .
" The overcrowded conditions inside simply boiled over inside the Green 1 compound and the Afghan detainee told me he was surprised it has n't happened before and he is very certain that it will happen again . "
Mr Rintoul says the overcrowding is leading to restricted access to recreation facilities and the internet has been cut off .
" There is restricted news access , restrictions on some of the access to kitchen facilities and making tea and coffee during the day , trying to save , " he said .
" It is those kinds of tensions or there are ethnic tensions simply to divert attention away from the deteriorating conditions inside Christmas Island and all the problems that are associated with mandatory detention .
" The Rudd Government has seen fit to continue those Howard government policies and it is now reaping the whirlwind .
" All the consequences , all the difficulties that were faced by the Howard government , will be visited on the Rudd Government because they have perpetuated the appalling conditions in mandatory detention . "
Ames emailed me a New York Times blog post from last February by one Casey B. Mulligan –which may sound like a fictional baseball player ’s name , but no , he ’s real all right , just another in a long line of insane econ professors from the University of Chicago .
In the blog post , Mulligan cheerfully announced that when it comes to commercial real estate , we ’ve got nothing at all to worry about .
There ’s no danger of a CRE crash , like the one we ’ve experienced in the residential market , so we can all go back to being happy free market beneficiaries .
No CRE crash ?
Ha-ha !
I just love these Chicago School alchemy frauds !
It is truly a joy to see them make such fools of themselves on the permanent public record .
And not surprisingly , although Mulligan struck out , he ’s still at the plate , batting out barely comprehensible economic fatwahs for the New York Times like nothing ever happened — that ’s the kind of free market a real Chicago School economist likes .
So that you do n’t have to wait , here ’s what Casey wrote for the Times in February 2009 .
Note how he denigrates those damn pesky “ experts ” :
For months now , experts have been predicting that commercial real estate will be “ the other shoe to drop . ”
But in fact , non-residential building fell far behind housing construction during the housing boom .
This shortage of commercial buildings relative to housing suggests that a commercial real estate crisis will not occur , or that at worst it will occur with much less severity than did the housing crash .
. . .
We all know that there is a nationwide surplus of housing .
But there is little if any nationwide surplus of non-residential buildings .
You heard him right .
He said there is “ little , if any , surplus in non-residential buildings . ”
That ’s how fucking stupid Casey “ 1000 Strikes And I ’m Never Out ! ” Mulligan is !
Even back in February , any lay person could see dangerous levels of empty storefronts piling up in just about every city in America , but now commercial real estate types are starting to have a major freakout .
Here ’s a sample of how bad it is :
There is a 20 % vacancy rate in the Silicon Valley right now .
Atlanta has a 18 % office vacancy rate , with many estimating that it will take a decade or two to get back to normal occupancy levels .
In Manhattan , office vacancies are hovering somewhere around 13 % and are expected to go up to nearly 20 % .
Nationally , about 1 out of every 5 offices stand empty .
Properties that do manage to find tenants rent at a 30 to 50 % discount , compared to two years ago .
It ’s even worse in Buttfucksville , America .
Here in my newly - adopted home of Victorville , California , some neighborhoods have brand new strip malls that have vacancy rates somewhere around 75 % .
Nothing illustrates the size of the speculative bubble in commercial real estate better than this simple line graph :
You can see that commercial real estate is back down to pre-boom years , but the graph only goes up until July 2009 .
And the past three months have been none too good on the market , which is sinking further into a deep , dark depression the likes of which it has n’t seen in many a decade .
There ’s been about a 3 % drop in value every month since July , with no bottom in sight .
So just how wrong was Mulligan ?
Here ’s how : the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries ( NCREIF ) has an index tracking the rate of return on investments in commercial property .
Since it was started in 1978 , the index has never dropped more than about 7 % in a single year .
This year it has dropped by 15 % , and there is still one quarter unaccounted for .
To put it another way :
Most investment funds with commercial property in their portfolios are scarily underwater and are finding it hard to unload them in these vanishing market conditions .
To put it yet another way : Check out the NCREIF index in visual form above .
See the inverted spike of the current crash ?
Keep going lower .
The graph is slightly dated , so the tip of it should be placed well into the margins .
Now compare it to the inverted spike of the early 90’s on the left .
See how our crash is already almost three times as bad ?
Well guess what ?
That ’s exactly the opposite of what Mulligan predicted .
According to him , today ’s slump in the non-residential sector would not be as bad as the crash that happened in the 90’s because the ratio of residential to non-residential structures was 1 % lower today than it was back then ( meaning that there were 1 % less commercial buildings when compared to residential ones ) .
It is a weird comparison to make , as if the supply and demand of office space and housing are locked to each other .
Seems like Mulligan got lazy , grasping at any data that would give his boosterism credibility .
That ’s part of Mulligan ’s economic prowess , I guess : the ability to shill by shifting numbers around , but not the ability to get things right .
Moving on to Exhibit C of the Mulligan smackdown :
“ We all know that there is a nationwide surplus of housing .
But there is little if any nationwide surplus of non-residential buildings . . . it is a mistake to assume that commercial real estate shares the housing sector ’s ailments , ” he so presciently wrote .
Ah , yes .
Just because we built too many houses does not mean we built too many office buildings , right ?
Well , wrong .
About the only thing different between the two real estate markets is that the commercial side of it started crashing a little later .
The timing and speed of their rise and fall were slightly different , but in the end , the two real estate markets followed very similar bubble trajectories .
See the place I marked with the red arrow on the chart above ?
That ’s when Mulligan used Chicago School ’s patented free - market statistical analysis to predict that commercial real estate prices were n’t going to drop much further , weeks before that little flatlining knob plunged downward at a nearly vertical pitch .
How did Mulligan manage to get it so wrong ?
Hard to say , but what is clear is that anyone with a functioning brain stem could see that commercial real estate was the next bomb to drop a year ago .
It could n’t have been more obvious that Mulligan would be proven wrong , so totally , obvious - to - anyone - who - reads - Bloomberg - News - or - walks - through - business - districts wrong that it truly is funny , in a what - the - fuck kind of way .
Kinda reminds me of the Chabad - Lubavichers , a weirdo Jewish Orthodox sect in Brooklyn whose supreme leader started proclaiming that he was the second coming of the messiah who would bring peace and everlasting tranquility to Earth .
All of his 200,000 followers believed him and worshipped him like a god in human form , and then the old man promptly died in 1994 .
Ever since , the movement has been pretending that the whole thing never really happened , but that has n’t stopped them from being the laughing stock of the Jewish world .
And that ’s exactly the position Mulligan and the rest of the Chicago School minions should be finding themselves right now : ridiculed by their peers and divorced by their vapid wives , pelted with rotten tomatoes and fired without notice .
But that ai n’t where he ’s at .
Mulligan still enjoys a blogger position at the New York Times , and still spews incoherent freemarket dribble and economic predictions , which proves that for the idiots running this country , it ’s all about the “ free markets ” and the “ free pass for whatever fuckup I make , no matter how disastrous the consequences for you ! ”
People like him need to be outed and ridiculed as a matter of public service .
Have they no memory or shame ?
There was a great psychology study done at Cornell about a decade ago called the “ Unskilled and Unaware of It : How Difficulties in Recognizing One ’s Own Incompetence Lead to Inflated Self - Assessments . ”
The experiment proved that stupid people are consistently , pathologically unable to recognize their own mistakes .
Their brains just were n’t wired for “ learning from mistakes ” ; in fact , they were always convinced that they were always right , reality be damned .
From the study :
We argue that when people are incompetent in the strategies they adopt to achieve success and satisfaction , they suffer a dual burden :
Not only do they reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices , but their incompetence robs them of the ability to realize it .
Instead they are left with the mistaken impression that they are doing just fine .
. . .
It is one of the essential features of such incompetence that the person so afflicted is incapable of knowing that he is incompetent .
To have such knowledge would already be to remedy a good portion of the offense .
That ’s right , some people are just born too incompetent to learn , no matter what .
They ’re missing the necessary brain module .
They did n’t come equipped with the deluxe instant playback analyzer package that most of us come standard with .
Howler monkey to Mulligan : “ You are the weakest link ”
“ Unskilled and Unaware of It ” goes a long way to explaining the Mulligan phenomenon : the ability to keep on consistently and shamelessly spewing wrong predictions .
Thoughtless shill - drones like him may be semi-hairless , five - fingered bi-peds with linguistic abilities , but they are n’t really human beings like the rest of us .
Learning ability - wise , they ’re more on level with Costa Rican howler monkeys — the dumbest , loudest , shrillest primates around .
And last I heard , they had open huntin ’ season on the howler monkeys down there because not only does shooting howlers make for good fun , those stupid monkeys make for some good eatin’s .

Yes , Sarah , There is a Media Conspiracy :
The press corps that is bashing her skull in right now is the same one that hyped that WMD horseshit for like four solid years and pom-pommed America to war with Iraq over the screeching objections of the entire planet .
It ’s the same press corps that rolled out the red carpet for someone very nearly as abjectly stupid as Sarah Palin to win not one but two terms in the White House .
If there was any kind of consensus support for Palin inside the beltway , the criticism of her , bet on it , would be almost totally confined to chortling east coast smartasses like me and Glenn Greenwald and Andrew Sullivan .
What the people who are flipping out about the treatment of Palin should be asking themselves is what it means when it ’s not just jerks like us but everybody piling on against Palin .
For those of you who ca n’t connect the dots , I ’ll tell you what it means .
It means she ’s been cut loose .
It means that all five of the families have given the okay to this hit job , including even the mainstream Republican leaders .
You teabaggers are in the process of being marginalized by your own ostensible party leaders in exactly the same way the anti-war crowd was abandoned by the Democratic party elders in the earlier part of this decade .
Like the antiwar left , you have been deemed a threat to your own party ’s “ winnability . ”
And do you know what that means ?
That means that just as the antiwar crowd spent years being painted by the national press as weepy , unpatriotic pussies whose enthusiastic support is toxic to any serious presidential aspirant , so too will all of you afternoon - radio ignoramuses who seem bent on spending the next three years kicking and screaming your way up the eternal asshole of white resentment now find yourself and your political champions painted as knee - jerk loonies whose rabid irrationality is undeserving of the political center .
And yes , that ’s me saying that , but I ’ve always been saying that , not just about Palin but about George Bush and all your other moron - heroes .
What ’s different now is who else is saying it .
You had these people eating out of the palms of your hands ( remember what it was like in the Dixie Chicks days ? ) .
Now they ’re all drawing horns and Groucho mustaches on your heroes , and rapidly transitioning you from your previous political kingmaking role in the real world to a new role as a giant captive entertainment demographic that exists solely to be manipulated for ratings and ad revenue .
What you should be asking yourself is why this is happening to you .
Even I do n’t know the answer to that question , but honestly , I do n’t really care .
All I know is that I find it extremely funny .

" Within the framework of youth literature , picture books occupy a special place .
In picture books , the images are just as important as the texts .
They are by no means intended exclusively for young children .
Old picture books reflect the views people held about good and evil , poor and rich ; about education , with examples of dutiful and bad behaviour ; about love for one ’s own country and about people from foreign countries .
They illustrate a changing world of new inventions and modes of transport , of living and fashion , of daily life in towns and villages .
There is both humour and moralism to be found in children ’s books ; they play with the relationship between reality and fantasy .
A total of six hundred and fifty Dutch picture books , dating to the period 1810 – 1950 , are brought together in this collection , which runs the gamut from Robinson Crusoe to Tielse Flipje ( a cartoon mascot on ‘ De Betuwe ’ jam pot labels ) and from old nursery rhymes to fairy tales from the Brothers Grimm : there is something for everyone in the collection .

Tonight on FNC’s The O’Reilly Factor , Laura Ingraham called out host Bill O’Reilly for gushing over Michelle Obama , and when she asked Bill - O if he ate an acorn cookie at the White House , O’Reilly got annoyed and called her a blind ideologue and Kool - Aid drinker who wo n’t admit when someone is nice to her .
Here is the video courtesy of Media Media :
Ingraham started on O’Reilly by saying , “ I ’m gushing over your gushing last night about the Christmas party . ”
O’Reilly replied , “ Wait a minute , I ’m calling you out on this .
I thought she was very nice at the party .
I thought she treated everyone very respectfully , and you ’re giving me a hard time about that because I reported honestly .
So what ?
She was nice I reported what happened and you have a beef with it ? ”

After they bickered about whether or not O’Reilly ever said anything else , Ingraham really got under his skin , when she said , “ I have one question .
Did you eat an acorn cookie last night , yes or no ? ”
This seemed to tick off O’Reilly who replied , “ Ah bull , you are a blind ideologue who even if somebody ’s nice to you wo n’t admit it because you , talk about a Kool - Aid drinker , come on , you have an IV attached to your arm on the Kool - Aid . ”
The funny thing about this whole exchange is that O’Reilly is right about her .
The next original thought Ingraham has will be her first .
She is nothing but a walking GOP talking point machine .
The question is , if Ingraham is so far gone on the right wing Kool - Aid why is she the permanent guest host of O’Reilly ’s show ?
One has to wonder if Bill - O who was the poster boy for right wing crazy is now too moderate for Fox News .
Consider that Ingraham was criticizing O’Reilly for admitting that Michelle Obama was nice to him , and he had a good time at the Christmas party .
Ingraham offered the standard FNC position that the Obamas are evil all of the time .
O’Reilly committed a no - no by telling Fox News viewers that the Obamas might actually be decent people .
Since Glenn Beck hit Fox News , O’Reilly looks tame by comparison .
He is still a righty , but propensity to be honest on occasion does not fit in with the current style at Fox .
Who would have thought that one day , I would write that Bill O’Reilly might be the most moderate host on Fox News .
Carefully electronically tuned , Ángel Sampedro del Rio's Bamboo saxophones consist of segments of bamboo successively larger in diameter .
This progression has now been demonstrated by acoustical studies as the most harmonically effective .
The joints are extremely solid and resistant over time .
They have keys that cover toneholes outside the reach of the fingers .
Since 1985 he has developed and built this instrument , with equal attention to acoustic design and aesthetics .
Their interior is protected against changes of humidity , frequent in all wind instruments .
The work with mouthpieces led him to use different bamboo types that give the instrument its own and characteristic sound .
They use conventional sax reeds , which can be acquired in any good musical store in the world .
This improves the acoustic design and the fingering distribution .
The Bamboo sax is not an imitation of brass saxes , it is an instrument in its own right .
They have certain differences and similarities .

Now that everything bad is good again , critics are getting to work dismantling the houses they built .
Enter Spin ’s new feature : “ 16 Rock Myths Debunked . ”
The magazine takes apart the idea that Nirvana destroyed hair metal , tells us Marilyn Manson is a fairly normal guy and reveals that Ozzy Osbourne never bit the head off a bat .
But the # 1 rock myth of all time , according to Spin , is this : “ Radiohead can do no wrong . ”
Strangely , writer Chris Norris ’ is the second high - profile attack on Radiohead this month .
A few weeks ago , The Fiery Furnaces ’ Matt Friedberger rocked the web by making fun of the band ’s newish song , “ Harry Patch ( In Memory Of ) . ”
Then , to make sure no one misunderstood him , Friedberger issued a press release reaffirming that he does n’t like Radiohead .
What ’s weird about all this is that the band has n’t put out an album in over two years , and it ’s not like they ’re out picking fights with indie rockers .
So , what ’s the deal with the current backlash ?
Well , let ’s look at what the haters are saying .
According to Norris — who feels that “ Radiohead kinda blow ” — they ’ve become “ an exceptionally well - dressed jam band .
That you ca n’t even dance to . ”
Moving from catchy Pablo Honey to anthemic
The Bends to Dark Side of the Moon- rivaling OK Computer , Radiohead raised the stakes with each new release .
Then they made Kid A , “ a deft , sometimes beautiful experiment in electronica - based songwriting . ”
But Norris notes that the band ’s new direction alienated some fans , who found the album “ a bit formless and switched to Coldplay . ”
( We ’d like to point out here that anyone who finds Coldplay an adequate substitute for Radiohead may well be better off listening to the former . )
Strangely , Norris skips over the best argument for the band ’s infallibility ( Hail to the Thief ) , moving right to In Rainbows , with its comparatively pleasurable compositions and game - changing , pay - what - you - want distribution model .
And therein , apparently , lies the problem :
So they ’re a band , making records .
Why all the newspeak ?
Does Radiohead ’s every move have to be without precedent ?
Must they define a new music language ?
And really , does anyone believe that the creators of the finest , most original , and significant rock album of the last 15 years should n’t be making rock albums ?
Norris ends with a similar sentiment : “ A band that can make iconic songs that stretch across a fractious culture , ” he says ( and here he ’s talking about , of all classic Radiohead tracks , “ Creep ” ) , “ that can weave them into an even greater whole , and that have a unique , haunting musical voice we will remember for decades , is plenty special .
As special as it gets .
If only they ’d settle for good . ”
Honestly , we find these critiques a bit depressing .
At a time when mainstream rock is dominated by formulaic teen emo bands and aging veterans cashing in on exorbitantly - priced reunion tours , is n’t it actually a relief to find a popular group dynamic enough to take real stylistic and economic risks ?
As strictly casual Radiohead fans , we thought we ’d turn to an expert for further response to Norris ’ provocation .
Here ’s what our friend Marvin Lin , Editor - in - Chief of Tiny Mix Tapes and the author of a forthcoming 33 1/3 book on Kid A , had to say about the piece :
Radiohead have hardcore fans , so the din of their accolades almost gives the appearance of critical consensus .
But I think that ’s far from the truth .
Radiohead have been shit on almost as much as they ’ve been lauded , from Morrissey to Courtney Love , Aphex Twin to Nick Hornby .
Just look back at Kid A reviews or , say , fan reactions to Hail to the Thief .
Aside from perhaps OK Computer , most of the reactions to their albums have been decidedly mixed .
The Spin article is essentially trying to debunk a myth that was never there in the first place .
But of course Spin had to put Radiohead at # 1 so that they can put Thom Yorke on the cover and sell more magazines .
While the author of the Spin article had a great chance to critique the press ’ blind devotion to Radiohead , he instead tries to critique Radiohead in a horribly misguided diatribe with factual errors included .
As for The Fiery Furnaces , Friedberger ’s press release is fairly incomprehensible .
“ Like most creative musicians , ” it begins , “ Matt Friedberger is not a fan of Radiohead and most of their chart busters . ”
Then there ’s some hedging about what he actually meant in criticizing “ Harry Patch ” and ( perhaps ) confusing the song ’s title with the name of avant - garde composer Harry Partch .
Friedberger ends by expanding his vendetta :
Matt has not heard the Radiohead song about Harry Patch , but if he did , he is sure he would n’t like it .
No doubt Radiohead and their fans can ignore his opinion of this matter and continue with their triumphant artistic interventions .
Matt would have much preferred to insult Beck but he is too afraid of Scientologists .
Oy .
To review : “ Radiohead is really popular , and so is Beck .
Thus , because I consider myself creative and unique , I hate them . ”
We love The Fiery Furnaces , but Friedberger ’s press release reads as little more than an intentionally incendiary plea for more media coverage .
Or , as Lin puts it , “ Friedberger was speaking so out of his element that it ’s barely worth talking about . ”
What we get out of both attacks is this : Picking on Radiohead is somewhat subversive , so it causes a stir .
And that ’s a good way to get people to buy your magazine or write about you on their blog .
( And dammit , it worked on us , too ! )
So , at a slow time for music — and late November - December always is , as publications start compiling their best - of lists and labels hold off on releasing major albums until January — an outrageous pronouncement will surely keep the news cycle moving .

BOWLING GREEN , KENTUCKY – Leading United States Senate candidate Rand Paul today criticized the Obama administration ’s decision to close the Guantanamo Bay detention center and try terrorism suspects in United States Civil Courts .
“ Foreign terrorists do not deserve the protections of our Constitution , ” said Dr. Paul .
“ These thugs should stand before military tribunals and be kept off American soil .
I will always fight to keep Kentucky safe and that starts with cracking down on our enemies . ”
Dr. Paul believes in strong national defense and thinks military spending should be our country ’s top budget priority .
He has also called for a Constitutional declaration of war with Afghanistan .

The Waterfall model is originally invented by Winston W. Royce in 1970 .
He wrote a scientific article that contained his personal views on software development .
In the first half of the article , he discusses a process that he calls “ grandiose ” .
He even drew a figure of the model , and another showing why it does n’t work ( because the requirements always change ) .
This model is the waterfall .
He used it as an example of a process that simply does not work .
In the latter half of the article he describes an iterative process that he deems much better .
OK , so why do people still advocate the waterfall ?
If you look at the scientific articles on software engineering that discuss the waterfall , they all cite Royce ’s article .
In other words , they ’re saying something like “ The waterfall is a proven method ( Royce , 1970 ) . ”
So they base their claims on an article that actually says the opposite : that the model does not work .
This is how science ( unfortunately ) often works – researchers just cite something , because everyone else does so as well , and do n’t really read the publications that they refer to .
So eventually an often cited claim becomes “ fact ” .
Agile methods and the linear method were both originally used already in the 1950’s .
The scientific mis-citing boosted the waterfall ’s popularity , but in the 1980 ’s it was being phased out – because people had found out ( the hard way ) that it does not work .
But , things change as a busy engineer in the US defense organization is asked to come up with a standard for military grade software projects .
He does n’t know what a good process would be , and he ’s told that “ Hey , Royce already came up with the correct method : the waterfall .
Use it . ”
So the waterfall becomes the US military standard DoD-2167 .
A bit later the NATO countries notice that they too need a software engineering standard .
And they ask the US for their standard – no need in reinventing the wheel , right ?
And thus the waterfall is again used everywhrere , since if the military uses it , it must be good .
Right ?
Here in Finland we had already dropped the waterfall in the 1980 ’s , but after the DoD - 2167 was sent over the Atlantic like a weapon of mass desctruction , it became the standard , again .
What have we learned here :
The agile ( iterative , incremental ) methods are not new .
They ’re as old as the waterfall .
There is no scientific evidence that the waterfall works – on the contrary , most projects fail .
There is , however , massive evidence that agile methods improve productivity , quality and success rates .
So what should we really have learned : People remember images .
And people often read the beginning of an article , but not the end .
So : Do n’t draw figures or diagrams of wrong models , because people will remember them .
And in the worst case that could cause hundreds of thousands of failed projects and billions of euros and dollars wasted for nothing .
Update ( February 2010 ) : Commenters have been asking for references to back up my claims , so I added links to the most central documents referred in this blog post .
As hundreds of medical marijuana dispensaries have opened this year in a startling rollout across California , unnerved local officials have started to push back aggressively .
Many cities and a few counties have banned them .
Others have imposed emergency moratoriums .
And some have started to sue dispensaries to force them to close .
So far , the state ’s courts have sided with local officials .
For marijuana advocates , who have seen over - the - counter sales become commonplace and watched the steady drift of California ’s vibrant weed counterculture into the mainstream , these setbacks are a discordant development .
“ At this point , we ’re not winning a battle we should be winning , ” said Joe Elford , chief counsel for Americans for Safe Access , who believes that local bans violate state law .
“ There ’s been this kind of backlash of ‘ Let ’s give ourselves this great enforcement tool of just banning dispensaries . ’ ”
Advertisement
Three years ago , Elford ’s organization found that 29 California cities had banned dispensaries .
Now , at least 120 have done so , according to advocates and opponents of medical marijuana .
That ’s a quarter of the state ’s cities .
In recent months , the pace appears to have accelerated .
The number of cities allowing dispensaries has grown much more slowly , from two dozen to about 30 .
Last week , Red Bluff , about 130 miles north of Sacramento , became the latest city to vote for a ban , one that outlaws not only dispensaries , but also collectives and marijuana cultivation .
This week , Nevada City , a postcard - perfect Gold Rush city in the Sierra foothills , is likely to follow .
Los Angeles , the apogee of the uncontrolled dispensary boom , has become the scare story that has driven many other cities to act .
The city attorney ’s office estimates that about 1,000 dispensaries have opened , most of them after a moratorium that was adopted in 2007 .
“ We actually tell cities around the state to look at the failure in Los Angeles , ” said Paul Chabot , the founder of the Coalition for a Drug Free California .
“ That ’s why the cities are moving fast and furious across the state to adopt bans . ”

This blow - back has come as local politicians look at the experiences of other cities and decide that they do n’t much like what they see :
Anyone who wants to smoke pot can easily get a doctor ’s recommendation ; dispensaries can attract crime ; and some operators are in it for the money even though profits are prohibited .
Even places widely seen as pot-friendly have become wary .
Santa Cruz passed a law in 2000 to allow dispensaries .
One opened in 2005 , another in 2006 , in the same industrial area .
City officials say they have not had any trouble with them .
But Mike Ferry , a Santa Cruz city planner , said he was inundated with inquiries about opening dispensaries after the Obama administration announced in March that federal agents would lay off stores that adhered to state law .
Advertisement
“ It goes from a trickle to a call a day , from all over the state and even out of the state , ” he said .
The city studied its dispensaries and learned that about three - quarters of their customers were not from Santa Cruz .
The prospect of being a regional marijuana hub did not excite city leaders .
“ We kind of felt like we were going to end up with a concentration , ” he said .
City officials have recommended a cap at two .
Advertisement
Some towns that once welcomed dispensaries have switched off the “ Vacancy ” sign .
Dixon , a bedroom community on Interstate 80 between the Bay Area and Sacramento , decided years ago to allow dispensaries .
None opened .
This year , several people who did not live in the city inquired about starting one .
This was surprising to Jack Batchelor , the mayor .
Why Dixon , a city of about 17,500 ?
“ My sense is that it would be people living outside Dixon and driving by , ” Batchelor said .
Given the push - the - envelope innovation in California ’s marijuana industry , Batchelor ’s fear that his city might host the first drive - through dispensary does n’t seem far - fetched .
It was not an appealing prospect , he said .
Advertisement
The more Batchelor learned , the more he worried .
On the web , he realized how easy it was for anyone to get a doctor ’s recommendation for marijuana .
He read reports that dispensaries attract crime .
And he decided that he did n’t believe that the aspiring dispensary operators had approached Dixon out of compassion for its residents .
“ It ’s a monetary issue , ” he said .
“ Here ’s a way to expand their business . ”
In August , Dixon ’s City Council banned the stores .
Other cities , including many in the Inland Empire and Orange County , have similarly enacted outright bans .
Advertisement
Laguna Beach adopted a ban in September .
Mayor Kelly Boyd said school officials urged the city to prohibit dispensaries .
“ We saw what was happening in other cities , and how they were rapidly growing and opening , and we did n’t want that happening in our city , ” he said .
At least eight of California ’s 58 counties now have bans .
Supervisors in Madera County , in the Central Valley , voted unanimously in September to outlaw dispensaries after listening to almost two dozen supporters .
One after another , they pleaded to be allowed to buy marijuana at the county ’s two dispensaries , telling emotional stories of how it helped them deal with anxiety , glaucoma , lupus , asthma , chronic pain and headaches .
One man , who said he was a veteran and suffered from post - traumatic stress syndrome , said , “ I do n’t know why you are being backward about it . ”
But the board was swayed by the sheriff who cited crime statistics , insisted a vote for dispensaries would be a vote to violate federal law , noted that county voters had rejected the 1996 medical marijuana initiative and offered this opinion of dispensary operators :
“ They ’re not compassionate caregivers , they ’re criminals . ”
Advertisement
Elford and other advocates for medical marijuana argue that it is the bans that are illegal and insist that the California Supreme Court will eventually invalidate them .
“ They ca n’t pass ordinances that are inimical to a matter of statewide concern , ” said Elford , who has provided legal counsel on many of the state ’s medical marijuana cases .
Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown concluded last year that dispensaries run by collectives “ may be lawful , ” but did not address whether cities and counties could outlaw them .
So far , cities have won several cases in state courts .
As cities wait to see whether an appeals court will uphold a ban imposed by Anaheim , they have embraced another appellate court ruling .
The state 2nd District Court of Appeal recently ruled for Claremont in its three - year battle with a dispensary that opened after the city denied it a business license and permit .
The panel decided the state ’s medical marijuana laws did not stop the city from enforcing its licensing and zoning requirements .
Advertisement
That approach -- using licensing and zoning rules to keep dispensaries out of town -- is becoming increasingly popular with cities .
A Superior Court judge recently sided with Fresno and ordered nine dispensaries to shut down .
In the Bay Area , Walnut Creek has issued daily $ 500 fines to a dispensary that officials say violates its zoning rules and have filed suit .
City Atty .
Paul Valle - Riestra estimates the total fine at about $ 15,000 .
“ Clearly , there seems to be a lot of money involved in this , and they do n’t seem to bat an eye at those kind of penalties , ” he said .
Lake Forest in Orange County has seen many dispensaries open in strip malls near the junction of the 5 and 405 freeways .
The city has sued 21 dispensaries ; five have closed .
Red Bluff officials said the Claremont decision emboldened them to push for their sweeping ban .
As in Claremont , a dispensary opened in Red Bluff without permission , triggering the City Council ’s action .
But city leaders also worried about crime and complaints of people smoking pot at houses used as collectives .
“ You can really just start seeing that there ’s a dark side to this , ” said Scott Timboe , the city ’s planning director , “ and so it was really the dark side that our community was concerned about . ”

WINNIPEG–One of Canada 's top northern researchers says the permanent Arctic sea ice that is home to the world 's polar bears and usually survives the summer has all but disappeared .
Experts around the world believed the ice was recovering because satellite images showed it expanding .
But David Barber says the thick , multi - year frozen sheets crucial to the northern ecosystem have been replaced by thin " rotten " ice that can't support weight of the bears .
" It caught us all by surprise because we were expecting there to be multi - year sea ice .
The whole world thought it was multi- year sea ice , " said Barber , who just returned from an expedition to the Beaufort Sea .
" Unfortunately , what we found was that the multi-year ( ice ) has all but disappeared .
What 's left is this remnant , rotten ice . "
Permanent ice , which is normally up to 10 metres thick , was easily pierced by the research ship , said Barber , who holds the Canada research chair in Arctic science at the University of Manitoba .
The team finally reached what it thought was stable ice , only to watch a crack appear just as researchers were preparing to descend onto the floe .
" As I watched , over the course of five minutes , the entire multi- year ice floe broke up into pieces , " Barber said .
" This floe was 16 km across .
Something that 's twice the size of Winnipeg , it just broke up right in front of our eyes . "
The ice is unable to withstand battering waves and storms because global warming is rapidly melting it at a rate of 70,000 square kilometres each year , he said .
Multi - year sea ice used to cover 90 per cent of the Arctic basin , Barber said .
It now covers 19 per cent .
Where it used to be up to 10 metres thick , it 's now 2 metres at most .
The findings , soon to be published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters , come as a shock to experts worldwide .
Although northern sea ice hit a record low in 2007 , researchers believed it was recovering because of what they were seeing on satellite images .
But the images the experts relied on were misleading because the rotten ice looks sturdy on the surface and has a similar superficial temperature , Barber explained .
" The satellites give us only part of the story .
The multi - year ice is disappearing and it's almost all gone now from the northern hemisphere . "

A former judge , Haitham Maleh , gave an interview to opposition TV
A Syrian human rights group says veteran dissident Haitham Maleh has been put under formal arrest after he was questioned by military prosecutors .
The 78 - year - old former judge was detained last week in a move which sparked international criticism .
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says he is likely to face charges of spreading false information .
In interviews and a recent open letter to the president he criticised repression and corruption in Syria .
Mr Maleh has advocated democracy in Syria for decades and spent seven years in prison as a dissident in the 1980s .
He disappeared , presumed arrested , last Wednesday , but there was no announcement by the authorities .
It was confirmed that he had been referred by a security branch to a military court on Tuesday and he was interrogated on Wednesday .
Britain has urged Syria to free Mr Maleh and allow Syrian citizens " to practise the right of freedom of expression and association without fear of sanction " .
Advocacy group Human Rights
Watch said Syria could not expect to be treated as a member of the international community if it arbitrarily imprisoned its own citizens .
Commanding figure
Before his arrest , Mr Maleh told an opposition - supporting TV station outside the country , that Syria is run " by decree " .
" Citizens have no protection from the arbitrary authority and the aggression of the security apparatus , " he said .
" The law is not applied except on the weak , " he added .
The BBC's Arab regional editor , Sebastian Usher , says that judging by similar cases , Mr Maleh would face between one and three years in prison if he is charged .
He remains a commanding and respected figure in Syria , our correspondent says , but inevitably his age makes him somewhat remote , even isolated , from younger generations of political opposition .
Human rights activists say such arrests show the growing rapprochement between Syria and the West has so far had little effect on state repression of dissent .
Hot and Dry Days Ahead for Australia
Earlier this month , the Australian Bureau of Meteorology released the October figure for the Southern Oscillation Index ( SOI ) .
It showed a precipitous plunge of almost 20 points down to - 14.6 .
Just how significant a drop this is can be seen in the chart below , which shows the distribution of monthly changes in the SOI going back to 1876 ( - 14.6 is at the lower 5 % quantile , which means that a fall as big as this , or bigger , has only occurred 5 % of the time ) .
Distribution of SOI changes ( Jan 1876 - Oct 2009 )
But what exactly is the SOI and what is the significance of this decline in the index ?
The index is the standardised anomaly of the monthly average difference in sea-level air pressure between Tahiti and Darwin .
“ Standardised anomaly ” means that the index measures the deviation of this pressure difference from the long - term average and is scaled by the standard deviation of the pressure difference and then multiplied by 10 .
The significance of the index lies in its relationship to the El Niño weather phenomenon .
According to the Bureau of Meteorology :
Sustained negative values of the SOI often indicate El Niño episodes .
These negative values are usually accompanied by sustained warming of the central and eastern tropical Pacific Ocean , a decrease in the strength of the Pacific Trade Winds , and a reduction in rainfall over eastern and northern Australia .
The most recent strong El Niño was in 1997 / 98 , although its effect on Australia was rather limited .
Severe droughts resulted from the weak to moderate El Niño events of 2002/03 and 2006 /07 .
The chart below gives a historical perspective of the SOI over the last ten years .
To get a better sense of the trends in the index , I have overlaid two different types of curve smoothing : a lowess ( “ locally - weighted scatterplot smoothing ” ) curve and a spline curve .
The two give very similar results and make the 2002/03 and 2006 /07 SOI downturns clearly visible .
The timing of these downturns suggest that the corresponding droughts follow with something of a lag .
Southern Oscillation Index ( Jan 2000 - Oct 2009 )
Over the last couple of years , the SOI has been solidly in positive territory and , again with a lag , there has followed an improvement in drought conditions .
Indeed , New South Wales recently replaced the tight water restrictions which had been in place for a number of years with the less onerous “ Water Wise ” rules .
Unfortunately , this change may turn out to have been premature .
If the downward trend in the index seen over the last few months persists , Australia may face a return to severe drought conditions .
For anyone who is interested in how these charts were created , here is the R code .
It is also available from the Stubborn Mule files section .
UPDATE : at the request of singingfish , here is a chart showing the full recorded history of the SOI back to 1876 .
The blue line is a spline smoothed curve .

Some Republican senators are taking heat for voting against an amendment that would allow employees of military contractors to sue their employers if they are raped at work — and they want the Democratic senator who wrote the amendment to help them fight off the bad publicity .
In October , 30 Republicans voted against Sen .
Al Franken ’s amendment to a defense appropriations bill that would de-fund contractors who prevent their employees from suing if they are raped by co-workers .
Since then , those Republicans have faced outrage for what critics say amounts to support for rape .
ADVERTISEMENT
A Web site called RepublicansForRape mocks the thirty senators as “ legislators who were brave enough to stand up in defense of rape . ”
Louisiana Sen .
David
Vitter took heat recently for walking away from a woman who was questioning him about his vote against the amendment .
Now , some of those GOP senators want Sen. Franken ( D - MN ) to come to their rescue .
An article at Politico reports , “ Republicans argue that Franken should make it clear that GOP senators do n’t support assault or rape — especially since the amendment deals only with civil claims , making it possible for alleged rapists to be prosecuted criminally . ”
“ I think it would be helpful for Sen .
Franken to come forward and say , ‘ I ’m not suggesting that anybody who votes for my amendment is indifferent to crimes against women or anybody else , ’ ” Politico quoted Sen. Lindsey Graham ( R - SC ) as saying .
“ What ’s going on politically with the amendment Sen .
Franken ca n’t control , but I think it would be helpful for him personally to just let the rest of us know that ’s the views of others — not him . ”
Sen . John Cornyn ( R - TX ) accused Franken of exploiting the story of Jamie Leigh Jones — a former KBR employee who says she was locked in a container in Iraq after alleging she was raped by co-workers — to further his political agenda .

“ Trying to tap into the natural sympathy that we have for this victim of this rape , and use that as a justification to frankly misrepresent and embarrass his colleagues , I do n’t think it ’s a very constructive thing , ” Cornyn told Politico .
But Politico notes that Franken ’s spokespeople have come to his defense , saying that Franken has n’t been exploiting the Republican senators ’ opposition to the anti-rape amendment .
“ Despite attacks on Republicans by liberal commentators like Rachel Maddow and Keith Olbermann and on blogs such as Daily Kos , Franken never appeared on any of the shows or on the blogs to make a partisan argument about the matter , saying that the senator turned down entreaties to do so , ” Politico reports .
“ Also , [ Franken ’s aides ] point to the 10 Republicans who voted for the amendment as proof that it was n’t a partisan measure . ”

The ruling by Denver District Judge Larry Naves means medical marijuana providers can continue supplying the drug to registered users without having to provide any other care , as a state Board of Health vote last week would have required .
Colorado now has at least 11,000 people registered with the state as medical marijuana users .
Naves was sharply critical of the Board of Health and at times appeared impatient with arguments by Anne Holton , a first assistant attorney general representing the board .
" Did this board ever think about the impact on the health of people like these people here ? " he asked , referring to a medical marijuana user and provider in the courtroom who had challenged the new requirements .
Holton said the board was only trying to clarify restrictions for users and providers alike , and the action was only temporary while officials settled on long - term requirements .
" It 's not temporary if you 're trying to down 30 pills , " Naves retorted , referring to testimony by a patient in an older , related case who said he can't keep his numerous medications down without marijuana .
The latest skirmish over regulation began in August , when the health board decided anyone who supplies marijuana to a registered user meets the criteria to be an authorized caregiver .
Last month , however , the state Court of Appeals ruled in a criminal case that a woman convicted of marijuana charges did n't qualify as a caregiver because she provided only the drug and no other health services , as some other states require .
The Board of Health then suspended its August decision and temporarily accepted the stricter requirements set by the Court of Appeals .
Attorney Richard Corry asked Naves to stop the move , saying the board did n't give enough public notice of the meeting .
Corry also argued that the Court of Appeals judges said their ruling applied only to the criminal case .
Naves agreed , saying the court ruling did n't apply to the state 's requirements .
He also ruled the board did n't give enough public notice to comply with state law .
Holton did n't know if the state would appeal .
The Board of Health previously scheduled a Dec. 15 meeting on the same issue .

With the end of the next kernel version 's main development phase , the most important new features of Linux 2.6.33 have been determined : DRBD , Nouveau , support of the Trim ATA command and a bandwidth controller for block devices .
The developers have also improved the Radeon drivers and the support of Intel Wi-Fi chips .
New stable kernels also fix a vulnerability in the code of Ext4 , but will shortly be superseded by even more current versions .
Exactly two weeks after releasing Linux 2.6.32 , Linus Torvalds has now released the first release candidate ( RC ) of Linux 2.6.33 , closing the " merge window " phase of the development cycle during which the majority of changes for the next Linux version are integrated into the main Linux development branch .
As previously reported , the developers have integrated a driver for recent Ralink Wi-Fi chips , the DRBD replication module and the kernel - side parts of the nouveau open source graphics driver into the kernel .
However , these are only three particularly prominent improvements .
For instance , the Libata subsystem now supports the Trim ATA command , which optimises SSD operation .
To take full advantage of this , other parts of the kernel have to inform the storage subsystem about newly disallocated areas – the Btrfs file system has already been capable of this since version 2.6.32 , and the developers have now added the required code for Ext4 .
However , this code is still classified as experimental and is not used in the standard configuration .
Other changes include a new graphics driver which supports KMS for the virtual graphics chip of VMware hosts and an SCSI driver which addresses the virtual Host Bus Adapters ( HBA ) of some VMware products .
Another addition to the kernel are the WiMax drivers for Intel 's series 6050 Wi-Fi / WiMAX chips and the " Intel Wireless MultiCom 3200 top driver " for a Wi -Fi chip with GPS , Bluetooth , Wi-Fi and WiMAX support .
The kernel 's DRM and KMS code for Radeon graphics chips now supports IRQs , DisplayPort and audio output via HDMI .
After much to -ing and fro-ing , the " blkio controller cgroup interface " has finally made it into the kernel .
It allows the maximum throughput of individual processes and groups of processes to be limited .
As expected , the drivers for Google 's Android have been kicked out of the staging area because nobody has been looking after them .
Now that the " merge window " has been closed , the kernel development enters a test phase of usually ten or eleven weeks during which the developers tend to release a new RC every week .
Apart from picking up some stragglers likely to be submitted over the next few days and the occasional individual new driver , this phase mainly serves for making minor corrections and improvements to fix any flaws that are found – this way , the developers try to prevent major changes from introducing new problems .

The maintainers of the Linux stable series have recently released versions 2.6.31.8 and 2.6.32.1 .
As usual , these versions mainly offer minor corrections and improvements – many of them affecting the code for the Ext4 file system .
The latter also fix the recently disclosed CVE - 2009 - 1298 vulnerability in Ext4 .
Meanwhile , Greg Kroah - Hartman – one of the maintainers of the stable kernel series – is already preparing versions 2.6.27.42 , 2.6.31.9 and 2.6.32.2 .
With over 150 corrections , the latter is one of the stable kernels that offer a quite a large number of changes .
As the time window for submitting comments about the planned changes is scheduled to close before the weekend , these three new Linux versions are likely to be released in the near future .
Those who'd like to know how Greg Kroah - Hartman incorporates changes into the stable series can find a video demonstrating the process in the developer 's blog .
In brief
Kernel
Christoph Hellwig provides an overview of the latest XFS file system developments in his " XFS status update for November 2009 " .
Linus Torvalds recently explained his basic process and timing when naming a kernel in an email to the LKML .
This was triggered by the question why several kernels in a row have been called the " Man-Eating Seals of Antiquity " .
However , Torvalds ' email is somewhat difficult to read , because the Linux Kernel Mailing List 's overly ambitious spam filter has discarded some of the thread 's earlier postings .
Ben Skeggs has started developing open source code to replace the " Voodoo code " or " firmware " parts the Nouveau driver currently relies on .
The whole thing is experimental , however , and currently only works with GeForce generation 6 and 7 chips .
Kernel environment ( " plumbing layer " ) and userland drivers
The Alsa developers have released version 1.0.22 of the Alsa components – find a list of all the changes on a page in the project 's wiki .
The developers of the Hplip project have released version 3.9.12 of the Hplip drivers for printers and multi-function devices by HP .
According to the release notes , supported devices now include various devices of the Color Laserjet and Designjet ranges .
Graphics
AMD has made version 9.12 of the Catalyst drivers for Linux , also known as fglrx , available to download .
The release notes mention several minor improvements and corrections , but they say nothing about the support of the series 1.7 X Servers available since the end of September – it is therefore likely that , like their predecessors , the new Catalyst drivers will not work with this series .
Aaron Plattner has released version 2.1.16 of the " nv " ( its full name is actually " xf86-video-nv " )
X.org graphics driver , which is predominantly maintained by Nvidia employees .
Among others , it supports numerous GeForce graphics cards introduced in the past few months – including the GTX 260M , 275 , 280 M and 295 models .
Dave Airlie has released version 1.6 of the radeontool program .
In his blog posting entitled " The [ Xx ] ( [ Ff ] ( ree ) ? [ 86 ] |[ \. ] ?
[ Oo ]rg ) glossary " , Peter Hutterer tries to clarify the terms and relationships between X , X.org , Xorg , XFree86 , xf86 and several other related terms .

Fourteen Senate Democrats signaled support for a bill that would extend many Americans ' jobless benefits by at least 14 weeks — a necessary expansion , they said , that Republicans have so far obstructed .
The majority party has been trying to pass its unemployment insurance extension since September , but a number of setbacks kept the Senate from voting on the bill .
But party leaders emphasized they hoped to rejuvenate that campaign this week , and Tuesday 's press event was perhaps an attempt to convince GOP lawmakers to follow suit .
" We are facing opposition from the Republicans , " Sen. Jack Reed ( D - R.I. ) said at a press conference on Monday .
" They were quick to provide bailouts to Wall Street , but they fall at helping people on Main Street . "

Many workers who lost their jobs as a result of this year 's economic meltdown are beginning to exhaust their maximum benefits , but the Senate 's bill would lengthen eligibility another 14 weeks for those Americans .
It would supply an additional six weeks of benefits for those workers in states with unemployment rates above 8.5 percent .
A similar effort passed the House earlier this year , but that bill only authorized an extension for those states with exceptionally high jobless numbers .
" The pending bill is a great bill , " said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen ( D - N.H. ) , who helped lead the charge to rewrite the House 's effort before it reached the Senate .
" It 's one that will stimulate the economy .
It 's one that will help unemployed workers who are struggling to get back on their feet during this recession . "
Senate Republicans seem to agree with the bill 's purpose , but many have taken issue with its funding mechanism .
GOP lawmakers said they would rather fund the effort using unspent stimulus dollars — rather than Democrats ' proposed extension of an unemployment surtax — and they have since blocked consideration of the bill .
Democrats , however , are growing increasingly frustrated with the GOP 's strategy -- a position a number of lawmakers at Tuesday 's press conference also echoed .
" [ Y ] ou have Republicans in this town that must be captivated by some interest or some point of view that does n't allow them to give us the chance to move this forward , " said Sen. Bob Casey Jr. ( D - Pa. ) .
" But I think they do that at their peril ... the reason they really should be doing this is because , in every state in this country , you see there 's misery . "
I know that lately I have n’t been blogging a lot , but recently something very notable happened that I feel everybody should learn about .
As you know our marble popping game StoneLoops ! of Jurassica has been ported to the iPhone platform and proved to be a huge success .
It stayed in the global US app top 10 for almost two months and never dropped out of top 100 .
Until now that is , because today StoneLoops ! has been removed from the App Store by Apple on the request of … MumboJumbo .
If you do n’t know Mumbo Jumbo , this is the company that creates Luxor marble popping games .
In fact Luxor is one of the biggest marble popper franchises in the entire casual games market .
When StoneLoops ! was released on the PC and MAC it was over 3 years after the first Luxor game and the marble popping genre was almost dead .
In result StoneLoops !
never reached any serious top-tens and has stayed in the shadow of the giants – Luxor and Zuma .
But on the iPhone it was the other way round .
Together with an external company Playcreek we managed to prepare a very solid port of StoneLoops ! to the iPhone platform .
It was a great success for us that we managed to launch the game sooner than MumboJumbo managed to complete their iPhone port of Luxor .
In result the roles for StoneLoops ! and Luxor have reversed in the AppStore .
Due to an excellent port and good timing our game became the genre leader receiving hundreds of positive user reviews .
In the meanwhile Luxor for the iPhone received very little attention and quickly dropped out of the various top100’s .
I can imagine that MumboJumbo was n’t entirely satisfied with this result , but hey – what can you do about it ?
It seems you can do quite a lot …
About 3 weeks ago we have learned that MumboJumbo supplied Apple with a formal complaint and a request to remove StoneLoops ! from the AppStore .
The reason ?
Infringing Luxor copyright , confusing customers , stealing Luxor ’s look & feel and even stealing their source code !
This might sound absurd to anyone who knows both games but apparently Apple decided otherwise as we ’ve been requested to prepare a formal response , which we did .
We described how ungrounded each claim is and supplied various materials to back our claims .
Among all the MumboJumbo claims there was a single one which had some merit .
The users were able to input “ Luxor ” in the iTunes search field and StoneLoops ! was one of the returned results .
Of course Luxor was still the first result .
This was because the game description featured several excerpts from game reviews .
The one which caused the “ problem ” was a citation from GameZebo – “ more than worthy match for even more established industry goliaths like Zuma and Luxor… ” .
Our response was that we are willing to remove this part from the game description if Apple decides that this common practice is not appropriate in this situation .
Several weeks have passed since our response and we started thinking that Apple has ruled in favor of our explanations .
Unfortunately to our great surprise today we have learned that StoneLoops ! had been removed from the AppStore .
It was also quite a shock to learn that the final decision was actually made by MumboJumbo as apparently Apple asked them if our response was satisfactory .
Of course MumboJumbo replied that they still want StoneLoops ! removed .
After all if you were to decide whether your direct competition will be allowed to sell products or not , would you allow them ?
Talk about unfair competition – Luxor is selling , StoneLoops ! is not .
I wonder what happens when Zuma launches in the AppStore .
Will PopCap request to remove Luxor with similar claims ?
Such case would be identical .
In fact if Apple stands by its decision this will create a dangerous precedence .
If you are a developer and have an application in the AppStore you should quickly request Apple to remove the apps of your competition , before someone else requests to remove you !
I do n’t believe this can get any more absurd , but this is exactly where this reasoning is getting us .
Another funny thing is that MumboJumbo was one of the publishers considered when releasing StoneLoops !
They ’ve been shown the game before it was launched and never expressed any serious interest in it or any doubts about copyright .
This of course changed when our game performed considerably better on the iPhone .
Unfortunately this is all of the story so far , but I hope it ’s not the end .
We ’ll be trying to bring StoneLoops !
back into the AppStore and I ’ll be writing about new developments as they unfold .
In the meantime if you want to play StoneLoops !
you can do it on a MAC or a PC .
In fact you can get StoneLoops !
on almost every casual game portal – the game has been selling right next to Luxor and other marble poppers for years without any problems whatsoever …

When Daryl Hall and John Oates met in 1967 , both men had been kicking around the Philadelphia music scene for nearly a decade .
They immediately found common ground , and they began collaborating a couple of years later , releasing their first album , Whole Oats , in 1972 .
In 1973 , they notched their first hit single , “ She ’s Gone , ” from the album Abandoned Luncheonette , though follow - up successes were more scattered throughout the ’ 70s , as the duo experimented with different sounds and styles .
With the 1980 album Voices , Hall and Oates began to hit their stride , and for the next half - decade , they released an album a year , with multiple Top 10 singles per record .
At the time , critics largely ignored or dismissed them , but in subsequent decades , their hits ’ pop songcraft and timeless sentiment have been more properly appreciated .
Since the mid-’80s , the duo ’s output has slowed considerably , though Oates has kept busy with solo albums between his projects with Hall , and Hall has recently launched a web series called Live From Daryl ’s House , in which he sits around his living room and talks music with friends like Todd Rundgren and Smokey Robinson .
Daryl Hall and John Oates recently spoke with The A.V. Club on the occasion of a new career - spanning four - CD box set , Do What You Want , Be What You Are .

The A.V. Club :
At what point in your life did you make the transition from just enjoying music to saying , “ Okay , this is going to be my career ? ”
John Oates : Never , really .
I know that sounds like I ’m not answering your question , but I guess I was born to be a musician .
I started out as a little kid , I began to sing as soon as I could talk , and began to take guitar lessons at 5 , and vocal lessons shortly thereafter .
And I was always identified as “ the kid who played music . ” I started a band in the sixth grade .
I played and got paid for the first time when I was about 12 , and worked my way through school playing music .
The only job I ’d ever had that might be considered not playing music was teaching guitar , which I did in college for a while , but that still falls in the same category .
I guess you could say that it was just a natural transition — I kept doing it , and as long as people kept appreciating and validating what I did , I never questioned it .
Advertisement
Daryl Hall : I never enjoyed music .
AVC : Never ?
DH : No .
I ’ve been a professional since I was 2 years old .
It ’s work .
I come from a musical family , my mother was in a band … music to me was hard work .
It was learning how to be in front of people , and how to deal with audiences .
Practice , constant practice with instruments .
It was never what most would call a pleasurable experience .
Advertisement
AVC : Even now , you ’d say that ?
DH : More so now even than then .
I ’m a professional musician .
I have been my whole life .
When people are born into the arts , they do n’t tend to see art as pleasure , they see it as work .
Advertisement
AVC : Would that be true even listening to other people ’s music ?
Listening to the Motown artists and Gamble and Huff , and people like that ?
DH : I get pleasure out of it , but pleasure in a different way .
Informational pleasure .
Pleasure as if you were attaining knowledge and being moved in a profound way that would influence your mind .
And I ’ve been ecstatically moved by certain songs .
But it ’s never been a pastime .
Advertisement
AVC : Have you found over time that it ’s difficult for you to enjoy because you can see the strings being pulled ?
DH : No , seeing the strings is sort of … it does n’t diminish my enjoyment .
In fact , it sort of enhances it .
Again , I look at it in a very analytical way .
Even though … you have to understand , it ’s analytical , but also I ’m moved by it .
But the machinations of it only add to the pleasure .
Advertisement
AVC : When you two first met and were putting an act together , did you ever consider using a band name ?
DH : Briefly , and I wish we had , to tell you the truth .
But we were living in an apartment in Philadelphia , and the mailbox said “ Hall & Oates . ”
That was how we got the name .
Advertisement
JO : We always thought of ourselves as two individuals working together , hence the name Daryl Hall and John Oates .
Which is a mouthful , so people just call us “ Hall & Oates . ”
But if you look on every album we ’ve ever made , it always has our full names .
That was a conscious decision many years ago , because we felt like we were two very different individuals who had a lot in common musically , but who were very different personally , and we ’ve always been that way .
AVC : If you ’d had a band name , as opposed to a duo name , do you think you would have lasted as long as partners ?
Advertisement
JO : Oh , I do n’t know whether that was important or not .
I mean , what ’s in a name , really ?
It ’s not that significant .
DH : It allows more flexibility , I think .
I ’m a good friend with Dave Stewart of Eurythmics , and that was a duo .
It just changes the dynamic a little bit ; opens up even more opportunities .
It ’s hard to say , though , the “ what if ” thing .
Advertisement
AVC : You had some hit singles in the ’ 70s , but really kicked it into second gear in the ’ 80s , when you recorded albums with multiple hit singles .
What do you think changed between the ’70s and the ’80s ?
JO : I think the key thing was that we began to produce ourselves in the early ’ 80s .
We got more assertive , especially on the creative side of what we were doing .
And that happened in 1980 ; the first album that happened on was Voices .
We had been building up to that point all through the ’70s .
We started with Arif Mardin , who was an incredible mentor , and an amazing influence on us .
We did an album with Todd Rundgren , and then we did three albums with a guy named Chris Bond , who brought us out to L.A .
Even though some of the records we did there were successful , we never felt comfortable in L.A. , in that environment .
By the time the late ’ 70s came around , we reconciled ourselves to doing it ourselves , if we were ever going to get this right .
Advertisement
DH : I think the world changed .
We ’ve never been part of a trend .
We had a regional background .
From that regional background , we quickly expanded in other areas , without ever losing that old Philly thing .
But I think the world …
When you become significant to large masses , it usually has to do with the masses , not the artists .
We did n’t really change anything , except that we started producing ourselves , so it became a more authentic version of what it is we wanted to do .
So maybe that was why , I do n’t know .
I think it was more just the way the world was moving that coincided with what we were doing .
AVC : What did you know about your own sound that other producers were not able to get out ?
Advertisement
JO : Just ourselves .
We knew what we wanted to do , and we had a band that could do it .
Over the years , we had changes in personnel in our live band , and one of our goals was to go into the studio with the same band we played with onstage .
Because throughout the ’ 70s , we used a combination of our own band and studio musicians , and it was fine , but we really wanted to have a very coherent sound that was consistent between our live shows and our recordings , and we finally had a band that could go into the studio and do that .
We became a band in the ’ 80s , basically .
AVC : Did you think of yourselves as having “ a sound , ” per se ?
DH : Yeah , sure .
One that ’s heavy on the vocals , and it comes from that early pop tradition .
There ’s a lot of harmony … mostly four - part , but sometimes five - part harmony .
There ’s a certain melodic continuity that comes from the notes that I choose , and the certain kind of chords we use .
Yeah , absolutely a style .
But as far as arrangements go , that ’s changed over the years .
How we put all this together and present it .
Advertisement
JO : I think we developed a sound , but it took that decade of the ’ 70s to figure it out .
If you look at some of the albums of the ’70s , they ’re very different stylistically .
But every one of those stylistic experiments coalesced in the ’ 80s .
We used elements from all those experimental sounds that we tried , and eventually we came upon this thing that was our own .
For lack of a better phrase , we called it “ rock and soul , ” because I guess that ’s what it was .
Everyone wants to pigeonhole it and create a handle for it , but we really felt like it was our own sound : Daryl ’s influences and my influences .
It has to do with his classical background , combined with his street and urban doo - wop background , combined with my traditional American folk - music background , and also my experience with urban R&B .
You put those together , and that ’s basically what we do .
AVC : Did you have artists back then that you considered your peers ?
People who you felt were fellow travelers ?
Advertisement
JO : Peers ?
Well , I guess everyone .
Everyone who was out there making records , we considered our peers .
That ’s a tough question to answer .
We toured with everyone from Stevie Wonder to David Bowie to Cheech & Chong .
We came up through the crazy ’ 70s singer - songwriter era and evolved through the glam - rock period , and then into the ’ 80s , which I actually think we helped define the sound of .
A lot of it was influenced by where we were .
Starting out living in Philadelphia in this kind of hippie enclave , with the singer - songwriter era upon us …
We came up through that , and then we moved to New York and fed off the chaos of the city , and the novelty .
Then new wave was starting to happen , and punk was starting to happen … it was all around us , and we were part of it .
As writers , I think you absorb wherever you are and what ’s going on around you , and you spit it back out in your music , and that ’s what we did .
DH : When I first started , we were all part of the beginning of the Philadelphia scene .
You know , Gamble and Huff , Patti LaBelle , and a lot of the groups that were associated with them were certainly my peers .
And then Todd Rundgren and I started around the same time .
I ’ve known Todd pretty much as long as I ’ve known John , and he has the same roots and the same motivations , to some degree , as me .
And then I ’ve met people over the years that I feel are on the same path in life .
Not a lot of people , but significant people .
Advertisement
AVC : You mentioned producing yourself , but a lot of other people have produced your work as well .
You did an album with Rundgren in the ’70s , some remixes with Arthur Baker in the ’80s .
What were you looking for from those relationships , when you worked with a “ famous producer ” ?
DH : One thing I ’ve done over the years is , I ’ve tried to assemble really , really amazing teams .
I know I do n’t exist on my own , by any means .
Nor do John and I exist on our own .
It ’s never been like that .
It ’s really about teams , and the writers I ’ve been associated with over the years and have collaborated with , like Sara Allen and Janna Allen , or even more recently , Nile Rodgers , Arthur Baker , all these people .
They all contributed a lot to the human spirit of the various projects we were doing .
And I owe a lot of the sound to working with them .
Advertisement
AVC : Did you have any sense when you had just recorded , say , “ One On One ” or “ Maneater ” or “ Adult Education ” that you had a hit on your hands ?
DH : No . No .
You can never tell .
You know when something comes out really well , when something ’s really good .
But that does n’t mean the mass of people are going to respond to it in that commercial way .
You just do your best work .
Advertisement
JO : We were very fortunate .
We came up in an era where the record companies allowed us to make the music we wanted to make , and then they found a way of marketing it and selling it , which is 180 degrees from what happens today in the business .
We were very conscious of making albums with substance .
Every song needed to have some redeeming quality , or else we basically did n’t put it on the record .
So it was n’t about making a few hits and filling out the album with quickies ; that was n’t the way we approached things .
The albums were thought of as a piece of work , and the singles that emerged from those albums were the songs radio gravitated to .
Many times , we allowed radio to pick the singles .
We would just put the whole album out there , and the record company would mull it over , and they ’d run it by various radio people , and they would say , “ That ’s the one , let ’s go with that . ”
We were very much not involved with the picking of the singles .
AVC : Were there any singles that you figured would do better than they did ?
DH : Oh , I do n’t know , you ’re talking about the marketplace .
That ’s got nothing to do with us , that has to do with program directors , A&R people , and who ’s paying who .
So many factors , it ’s got nothing to do with us .
Advertisement
AVC : Were there ever ones where you kind of cocked your eyebrow , like “ I ca n’t believe they picked that ? ”
JO : “ Sara Smile ” was the first one .
We had no intention of releasing “ Sara Smile ” as a single .
We thought it was a simplistic , beautiful little love song that did n’t jump out as something that would be a big hit on the radio .
What happened was that we released two or three singles from that album , and they did fairly well , like top 30 , top 20 , but nothing broke out as a major hit .
We had given up on that album , and were moving toward recording the next album .
We were on tour in Europe for the first time , and we got a call from our manager saying that a small R&B station in Ohio had chosen “ Sara Smile ” as an album cut , and that it was receiving tremendous response .
And they communicated that to RCA , our record company at the time , and RCA decided to release yet another single , even though the album had been out for almost a year at that point .
And it became a big hit .
Advertisement
By the way , that song only went to No. 4 . So even though it became a big hit over the years , and really emerged as a signature song in our repertoire , it never went to No.
1 . Speaking of that song , it was just recorded by a country artist —
AVC : And a hit again , right ?
JO : Yeah , Jimmy
Wayne is a good friend of mine , and he ’s always sung that song and done a beautiful job with it , and finally he convinced the record company to allow him to record it .
Daryl and I sang on it .
It ’s out right now , and it ’s doing tremendous .
Hopefully — I ’ve got my fingers crossed as I ’m saying this — it ’ll be No. 1 on the country charts .
So that ’s pretty cool .
You know , a great song is a great song .
I do n’t care if it ’s a Cole Porter song , or George Gershwin , or Lennon / McCartney , or Elton John , or you know , whoever , Bob Dylan .
Great songs are great songs , and they stand the test of time , and they can be interpreted and recorded with many points of view , but yet still retain the essence of what makes them good songs .

AVC : When you record a song or an album today , what are your expectations for it vs. , say , 20 years ago ?
DH : Well , I do n’t know .
My expectations … I go back to the same thing .
It ’s all about , you know , I hope a lot of people are going to enjoy it .
But that is n’t the point .
Just trying to do really good work , breaking ground , or really getting to the core of whatever it is you ’re trying to create emotionally .
It really does n’t go much beyond that .
It ’s really just striving for a certain kind of musical impact .
Advertisement
JO : I think the key to making records generally is to make ’em for yourself , regardless of the climate in the business .
I think that goes back to the very beginning .
You make an album that you like , the best album you can make , and then the commercial success is the byproduct of doing something that ’s creatively satisfying .
To me , that ’s the basic form that never really changes .
But you ’re right , in today ’s marketplace , it ’s a whole different world .
My last album , 1000 Miles Of Life , I did not have any commercial considerations .
I did n’t think about radio , I did n’t think about commerciality , I did n’t think about releasing a hit single .
I did n’t think about anything .
I just made the best album I could with the songs that I had , and tried to pick musicians who could enhance those songs and make them sound great .
And that ’s the way I think from now on that I ’ll probably make every record I ’ll make until the day I die .
Because I have a fan base out there around the world who will buy what I make , and that ’s good enough for me .
AVC : Do you have any plans to record any more solo albums ?
JO : Actually , yeah , I do .
I did two — I did Phunk Shui back in the early 2000s , and then I did 1000 Miles Of Life last year , and I was just asked recently to do another solo album .
I ’m planning on doing a traditional American album with some of the songs I used to play as a kid , before I met Daryl .
You know , some of the real traditional fingerpicking Appalachian kind of stuff I used to do , which people do n’t really identify me with at all .
It ’s stuff I do a lot of times at my solo shows , and people seem to love it , so I think I ’m going to do an album like that .
Advertisement
The key , I think , from a business point of view , is to learn how to be efficient in making a record that ’s not too expensive , so that you ’re not going crazy spending tons of money making a product that might not ever return that money .
But if you do it right and have a fan base that ’s loyal , and you reach out a little bit beyond your fan base , that ’s okay .
And you know , I ’m no longer signed to a label , I ’m an independent artist , so rather than make 18 cents on the dollar , I make a dollar on the dollar , and figure out my own expenses .
I ’m still selling my first two solo albums when I play live and when I do my solo shows , and even when I play with Daryl .
Those albums continue to sell , little by little .
They just keep selling .
AVC : Daryl , what was the inspiration for your web series Live From Daryl ’s House ?
DH : You know , I ’ve been on the road so many years , and I just said , “ How about I turn everything on its head , and bring the road to me .
Take it right into the gate , into the inner sanctum , and let it emanate from that .
Let ’s see how that changes the performance . ”
And that ’s really what it does , too .
It changes things .
It makes all the performers — whether it ’s me or the band or the guest artist — all perform in a different way .
They sort of throw their act away and become … sort of the way musicians really interact when there ’s no people around .
So the audience gets to observe that and appreciate that , and see artists in their native habitat .
Sort of like the zoo , you know ?
The way they used to have lions in cages , and now they put people in the cages , and let them watch the lions wandering around .
It ’s the same thing .
Advertisement
AVC : Going through this big box set , what impressions did you both get of the entire arc of your partnership ?
DH : Well , it was really interesting , because I do n’t listen to stuff .
You know , the past is the past , and other than when we do it onstage , I do n’t really pay much attention to it .
But when you ’re in project mode , it literally forces you to listen closely to all these things you ’ve done over the years .
And to hear it all in one big gulp , one big package , it really changed my own perception of what it is that I do .
And I ’m happy to say that it was a good experience .
You know , there were times when I went , “ Oh , man , why did I do that ? ”
But it was mostly , “ I ca n’t believe that . ”
Again , it has a lot to do with teams … a lot of really amazing people .
I heard all these innovations , things that we ’d done way before anybody else .
I ’d always hoped that I ’d be a groundbreaking person , and I guess I accomplished that .
You know , the music ’s very unique .
Not like anybody else’s .

JO : Being far enough removed , especially from the really early material , I have to say I was pretty darn impressed .
[ Laughs . ]
I ’m not saying this to brag or be egotistical , but it ’s an impressive body of work .
To me , it ’s like listening to a musical photo album of your life , because every song represents a period of time , a moment , some circumstance , some person , and it really just brings back all these memories .
I hear the lack of sophistication and charm in some of the earlier work , and then I hear the musical sophistication and the adventurousness in some of the work we did later , especially in the ’ 80s , when we hit our stride and we were just on such a roll that it seemed like everything we touched turned to gold .
But it was totally because we were doing exactly what we wanted to do .
You see the evolution of kid to adult , and beginner to full - fledged artist .
It ’s interesting .
I think for the casual fan , they ’ll be very surprised when they hear the depths of the catalog ; it goes beyond the hits that they know us for .
But then for the real hardcore fans who know those types of records , it ’ll be just a treasure .

All of Cuba 's early cases of swine flu were from foreign visitors
Cuba 's former leader , Fidel Castro , has blamed the growth in swine flu on an increase in US visitors to the island .
US President Barack Obama recently lifted restrictions on Cuban - Americans visiting relatives on the island .
This is the the first time any Cuban official has found cause to complain about the US president 's policy of relaxing travel restrictions .
But , in an editorial published by Mr Castro in all state media , he suggests more US visitors mean more swine flu .
The 83 - year - old former president said that the H1N1 virus had spread to all the island 's provinces , especially those with a large number of relatives living in the US .
At the same time , Fidel Castro noted , the US trade embargo prevents Cuba from obtaining equipment and medicines needed to combat the virus .
But he stopped short of calling it a conspiracy .
" I do n't think , of course , that it was the intention of the United States government , " Fidel Castro wrote .
" But this is the reality resulting from the absurd and shameful blockade , " he added .
There have been 800 reported cases of the flu in Cuba , including seven deaths .
All of the early cases were from foreign visitors , though not just from the US .
The head of the World Health Organisation , Margaret Chan , was in Havana last week and announced that Cuba should start receiving international swine flu vaccines within a month .
As world leaders gear up for what is being billed as an historic climate meeting in Copenhagen , scientists offer a grimmer outlook on the outcome that is supposed to replace the last major global climate deal , drawn up in 1997 .
" I do n't have high hopes , " said Josefino Comiso , a senior scientist at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt , Md. " But I hope that the participants could get to a good plan on how to minimize greenhouse gas emissions . "
Comiso told LiveScience that more research is needed to convince the public and " climate skeptics " that greenhouse gas emissions are causing global warming .
Other scientists say the United States needs to take more of a leadership role .
In addition , the climate - change problem is complex and deeply rooted in multiple sectors , including the economy and its push for consumption along with population growth , according to one climate scientist , who also thinks human nature and our love of material goods could need a fix .
" We need to change our mind frame — our values , " said Rasmus Benestad of the Norwegian Meteorological Institute .
" Perhaps quality time , love , family values , friendship and respect are preferable to material goods and status ?
Or maybe we humans are too vain .
In this problem , I think we are seeing the worst of ourselves in the mirror .
We see power struggle and corruption . "
Still hope
Even with these drawbacks , including the monumental need to change human nature , Comiso and others see this meeting as a step in the right direction .
" I am personally hopeful that the upcoming summit can result in agreement on a framework to guide further negotiation and decision - making , " said Peter Backlund of the National Center for Atmospheric Research ( NCAR ) in Boulder , Colo .
" I do n't think it likely that the summit will result in an agreement that legally binds nations to specific emission reduction goals . "
The results could just set the stage for next year , establishing " a strong process so that a binding treaty can be achieved in COP 16 , " said Kevin Trenberth of NCAR .
( The Copenhagen meeting , also known as COP 15 , is the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change . )
In fact , the 11 - day talks in Copenhagen have already upped the Kyoto Protocol , which was adopted in 1997 ( though did n't go into effect until 2005 ) .
The United States , India and China will be at the table this time .
That 's big , scientists say .
" With key countries like the U.S. , China and India declining to participate because of the requirements , there was no way such a protocol would work , " Comiso said , referring to the Kyoto Protocol .
While both China and India have ratified Kyoto , neither country is subject to emissions limits under the terms of the treaty , according to the Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) , and the United States never signed the agreement .
But is increased participation this time around enough ?
" Not really , because I do not see too many of the brave and intelligent leaders .
Barack Obama — although perhaps promising — is not enough , " Benestad said .
" The climate issue is so complex and has tentacles into so many different issues . "
Act locally
For those who believe actions speak louder than words , a key to curbing climate change would be for the United States to make real strides in cutting emissions domestically .
" In the case of the U.S. , I believe that domestic legislation on targets and timetables for emission reductions must be agreed and enacted before the U.S. can agree to a legally binding international agreement , " Backlund said .
Some of those changes are easier said than done , however .
" I think that in principle there are technological and infrastructure fixes to the problem , " Benestad said , citing one example as TGIF ( Thank God It 's Friday ) .
Four - day workweeks have been shown to result in less energy use .
" But the problem is deeply rooted in how our economy works , based on ever - increasing consumption ( an irrational concept ) , he said .
" It 's also closely related to the human population growth on Earth , and common justice . "
Too many people
More than 6.8 billion people breathe in the air and otherwise consume resources across the globe .
That number is projected to hit 9 billion by 2043 .
" Population is a major issue and not being addressed , " NCAR 's Trenberth said .
" China and India talk about the disparity in emissions per capita .
They are correct but it is total emissions that count . "
China 's coal - related carbon dioxide emissions are projected to reach 9.3 billion metric tons — or 52 percent of the world 's total — by 2030 .
India 's emissions are projected to reach 7 percent of the world 's total that same year , with the United States expected to come in at 14 percent of the world 's total by 2030 , according to the Energy Information Administration .
The technology fix
Perhaps the back - and - forth between politicians is just that , some figure .
" My view is that the problem is more likely to be solved by technological innovation than by the political process , not that they are entirely independent , since , for example , politicians can decide to promote innovation , " said Kerry Emanuel , professor of atmospheric science at MIT .
One idea off the bat is nuclear energy , Emanuel said in an e-mail interview .
" The solution to the problem is greatly retarded by the lack of scientific and technological awareness in certain societies , notably the U.S , where superstitions and political passions often trump sound reasoning , " Emanuel said .
" For example , we could make great strides toward energy independence and reduction of greenhouse emissions by undertaking a serious program of nuclear energy , which can easily supply our energy needs for 100 years .
This , coupled with innovation in electric vehicles , would solve much of the problem . "
But even if we were to stop emitting greenhouse gases all together , many of their effects would still emerge , say many scientists .
And for that , adapting to such an environment is necessary .
" I am also pleased to see the increased attention being paid to adaptation , " Backlund said .
" Commitments to help developing countries with adaptation funding would be very helpful , as would commitments by developed nations to increase funding for the research that is needed to support effective adaptation . "
An example of adaptation would be building up beaches to prevent sea level rise from inundating low - lying coastal areas .

GREELEY , Colo . 
Health and law enforcement officials around the nation are scrambling to figure out how to regulate medical marijuana now that the federal government has decided it will no longer prosecute legal users or providers .
For years , since the first medical marijuana laws were passed in the mid-1990s , many local and state governments could be confident , if not complacent , knowing that marijuana would be kept in check because it remained illegal under federal law , and that hard - nosed federal prosecutors were not about to forget it .
But with the Justice Department ’s announcement last week that it would not prosecute people who use marijuana for medical purposes in states where it is legal , local and state officials say they will now have to take on the job themselves .
In New Hampshire , for instance , where some state legislators are considering a medical marijuana law , there is concern that the state health department  already battered by budget cuts  could be hard - pressed to administer the system .
In California , where there has been an explosion of medical marijuana suppliers , the authorities in Los Angeles and other jurisdictions are considering a requirement that all medical dispensaries operate as nonprofit organizations .
VMware Fusion 3 was released last week into the anxiously trembling hands of desktop virtualization junkies , and we 've run the release through a gamut of heavy tests to see if it 's able to meet the hype .
At first glance , 3.0 does n't look to be teeming with new features , but the changes that are there are significant :
Supports running atop OS X 10.6's 64 - bit kernel and runs as a 64 - bit application
Direct - X 9.0 c support
New CPU core handling for better multicore support for desktop Windows versions
Better integration with Mac desktop environment , and Unity improvements
Windows 7 guest OS and Aero support
OpenGL 2.1 support for Windows client VMs
That 's quite a beefy set of coding accomplishments .
Let 's see if they were pulled off without any casualties .
Test Hardware
Mac Pro 2009 Xeon 5500 dual quad 2.66 GHz
24GB RAM
Mac OS X 10.6.1 ( 64 - bit kernel )
MacBook Pro Santa Rosa 2.4GHz
4GB RAM
Mac OS X 10.6.1 ( 32 - bit kernel )
System Requirements
Any Mac with an Intel processor
1GB of RAM , 2GB recommended
700 MB of free disk space for VMware Fusion , and at least 5 GB of free disk space for each virtual machine
Mac OS X version 10.5.8 or later ; Mac OS X version 10.6 Snow Leopard or later
Pricing
New license : $ 79.99
Upgrade from 1.0/2.0 : $ 39.99
Installation and VM upgrading
For users wondering whether 2.0 VMs will work in 3.0 , the answer is yes , with no exceptions .
The VM update process is very straightforward : update the application and update your VMware Tools inside your existing VM , reboot your VM , and you 're done .
In my experience , there were no problems upgrading 2.0 VMs , but I did have a problem with my Vista 64 - bit Boot Camp partition :
I had n't used the Boot Camp VMware install for a very long time , so this error could have been caused by any number of things .
I think I had installed a new version of Windows on the VM , so it was completely out of sync with the VMware files .
It was easily fixed by deleting all the VMware files from that folder referenced in the error , reimporting Boot Camp into VMware , and reinstalling the VMware Tools .
Save for that hiccup , upgrading my rather large library of test VMs was pretty painless .
Interface and Integration Enhancements
The VMware interface was always very functional with decent integration , but version 3 makes some welcome tweaks .
The menus have been rearranged and the hub of interacting with VMs , the Virtual Machine Library , got an overhaul to make it more welcoming :
The Home portion of the VM Library window is a list of application assistants for various starting point tasks .
Those are all pretty unremarkable except for the new switcher - friendly ability to convert a Windows PC to a VM .
While the " Connect your PC to your Mac with a simple Ethernet cable " migration tool is cool , if you install Apple 's Bonjour for Windows , you can automatically discover your PC on the network and do the import that way .
I could n't try a real " PC " conversion since I only have an old dusty Athlon with no hard drive and I do n't have any IDE disks around to toss into the dinosaur .
So I faked it and booted up my MacBook Pro into Boot Camped Windows XP 32 - bit , installed the Bonjour Tools and the VMware Migration Assistant ( thank you for not calling it a Wizard ) , and started the Bonjour - based migration :
I waited for a while for the Assistant to find my Windows MacBook Pro but with no luck .
I restarted the MacBook Pro and when the Windows Assistant loaded on boot , I tried again and it managed to find the machine and prompted me to save the VM file :
The Space Needed value is way off — my Windows Boot Camp partition is actually 20 GB and it only uses 11 of that .
Nevertheless , my imported VM file was 304GB :
So it seems that the assistant just reports the C : drive 's disk size , not the actual contents , unless this is a problem with the Apple GUID partition table interpretation .
Worse , the VM refused to boot .
I hesitate to be critical of this since it 's likely tripping on the Boot Camp partitioning scheme , which would n't be a factor for someone wanting to migrate from a genuine Windows PC .
I wish I could say for certain whether this was the case , but all my neighbors have Macs as well ( in the Plateau Montreal , you 're either a graphic designer or a photographer ) , so I can't test this feature the way it 's meant to be tested .
The team will carry out a trial of the breast - shaped scaffold Researchers in Australia plan to test a medical " scaffold " designed to stimulate natural breast tissue to regrow following surgery .
Doctors from the Bernard O'Brien Institute of Microsurgery in Melbourne , will test the technique next year in a trial involving six patients .
The team say that the permanent fat found in breasts can be grown inside this contoured scaffold .
They claim to have successfully tested the device in pigs .
The results of that experiment were presented at a plastic surgery conference in Sydney .
The researchers recently announced on the institute 's website that they had received funding from the Australian government to carry out the human trial .
If this is successful , they hope to develop it into a breast reconstruction technique that avoids using silicone .
Breast scaffold
The teams says that when the " empty chamber " is implanted , fat tissue will naturally fill it to form a new breast .
It 's at such an early stage , it is not yet clear whether it will work in people
Dr Lesley Walker
Cancer Research UK
This chamber will also contain a gel made using the patients ' muscle cells to " induce fat tissue production " .
Professor Anthony Hollander , an expert in tissue engineering from the University of Bristol in the UK , said the attractions of this approach were its simplicity and the fact that the tissue growth occurred inside the body .
" At the time of implanting the cells the surgeon redirects the vasculature of the body which keeps a good blood supply to the implant .
That is in itself nothing new , but combining it with a cell implant is an interesting step , " he said .
He said that the technological advance was the use of a biomaterial cage used to trap the cells in the right place .
In future , the team plan to make this cage biodegradable so it does not have to be removed .
" If it 's tried and it works that will be a really nice approach , " Professor Hollander said .
But he cautioned that there was " still some way to go " .
" This procedure is first likely to be used on cancer patients , " he said .
" [ The team will ] have to be able to demonstrate a technique that guarantees that all the cancerous cells are removed and none are grown up in the process , so there is still some way to go . "
Dr Lesley Walker , director of cancer information at Cancer Research UK , said : " We know that having a mastectomy can be a very difficult experience for many women and so research to try to improve breast reconstruction after surgery is important .
" [ But ] it 's at such an early stage , it is not yet clear whether it will work in people .
Even if this surgery proves to be effective , it will be a number of years before it can be used in the clinic . "

Mr Murdoch has come out strongly against free access online
Rupert Murdoch has said he will try to block Google from using news content from his companies .
The billionaire told Sky News Australia he will explore ways to remove stories from Google 's search indexes , including Google News .
Mr Murdoch 's News Corp had previously said it would start charging online customers across all its websites .
He believes that search engines cannot legally use headlines and paragraphs of news stories as search results .
" There 's a doctrine called ' fair use ' , which we believe to be challenged in the courts and would bar it altogether , " Mr Murdoch told the TV channel .
" But we 'll take that slowly . "
Mr Murdoch announced earlier this year that the websites of his news organisations would begin charging for access .
The target had been for all its sites to charge by June next year , but indications are that this is now unlikely .
News Corp owns the Times and Sun newspapers in the UK and the New York Post and Wall Street Journal in the US .
Newspapers across the world are considering the best way to make money from the internet , particularly in a time of falling advertising revenues .
The risk is that charges may alienate readers who have become used to free content and deter advertisers .
Supercars continue to get faster and more exotic , but there 's little evidence to suggest their drivers are getting any better at driving .

To make even the lowest end of this list a car had to have an MSRP or auction price of at least $ 165 K , have a driver with seriously bad luck and get caught on camera while crashing or after crashing .
And while an F1 wipeout costs a pretty penny , we 're talking about street - driven cars in the hands of karma - challenged private citizen .
Unless of course the private citizen crashed an F1 car — or , conversely , crashed a street car on an F1 course .
Maybe it was the market crashing , the housing bubble bursting , or Bernie Madoff screwing people , but the super wealthy had a lot on their minds this year leading to what seems a spike in exotic car accidents .

Last Tuesday morning at around 9.30 am , a group of settlers surrounded the al - Kurd family home in Sheikh Jarrah and took over a section of the house .
Fifteen to twenty settlers , accompanied by private armed security and Israeli police forces , entered an extension of the Palestinian house , and started clearing it of the familys belongings .
The family was not present in this section of the house in compliance with a previous court order .
However , local sources reported that the settlers also attempted , on several occasions , to gain entry to the inhabited part of the house .
One Palestinian resident , Khamis al - Gawi , was arrested shortly after the settlers arrived , and is still being held at a local police station .
Two international activists , American and Swedish nationals , who were filming the settlers taking over the house were also arrested by the police and their video cameras confiscated .
As the top American diplomat in Kabul , General Eikenberry has had nearly daily exposure to President Hamid Karzai , most recently during 20 hours of negotiations , along with Senator John Kerry , to persuade him to accept the results of an election investigation that required a second round of voting .
These encounters , officials said , have left him pessimistic that Mr. Karzai will seize the challenge of creating a viable , stand - alone Afghan army .
Image Karl W. Eikenberry , a retired lieutenant general , has been the United States ambassador to Afghanistan since April .

“ No one would dispute that putting in troops will improve security , ” an official familiar with General Eikenberry ’s views said .
“ The question is , what will Afghans do ?
Will the Afghan government embrace the mission of training and leading combat operations ?
The answer is , we do n’t know . ”
It was not clear if the White House asked General Eikenberry to submit his comments , or if he did so on his own .
But some senior officials who remain skeptical of the buildup seemed pleased that his perspective had entered the public debate , which has been dominated for two months by the leaked assessment of General McChrystal .
The behind - the - scenes tug - of - war over policy has become increasingly bitter .
Last Sunday , a few days after General Eikenberry sent his cable to the State Department , top military and civilian officials gathered for a regularly scheduled meeting at the embassy , where General McChrystal pointedly addressed many of the issues in the Eikenberry memo .
General McChrystal did not refer to the cable directly , but specifically challenged General Eikenberry ’s conclusions , according to one official familiar with the meeting .
General McChrystal , he said , said that no alternatives had been offered besides “ the helicopter on the roof of the embassy , ” a reference to the hasty American withdrawal from Saigon in 1975 .
After the meeting , General McChrystal and General Eikenberry had a private conference .
It is unclear what was said at the meeting , but American officials said that the next day General Eikenberry sent another cable softening his stance about the impact of a troop increase in Afghanistan .
A spokesman for General Eikenberry declined to comment .
As Mr. Obama left Thursday for a weeklong trip to Asia , he took his Afghanistan review with him .
The president asked his military and civilian advisers not to present entirely new options , administration officials said , but rather to help choose from what he believes are the most promising elements .
The discussions are not fixed on troop numbers alone , the officials said , but on underlying strategy and performance measures .
Paul Bruno and Erick Ruales hailed a New York City cab on Monday evening , and were shocked when the driver , Medhat Mohamed , pulled over after driving two blocks , allegedly muttered something about “ No hugging ” and tossed the pair out onto the street .
Bruno and Ruales , who are romatically involved , said they began to kiss and hug when they got into the cab , yet even a deputy TLC commissioner says “ there ’s no record of passengers ever being ejected before because of any of it . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I do n’t know if it was a personal or religious thing .
But it ’s never OK to deny anyone a ride , especially when it ’s such blatant and direct discrimination , ” Bruno told the New York Post .
NYC Mayor Bloomberg was quick to condemn the driver ’s actions .
“ I thought the taxi driver ’s behavior — if it is as reported — was a disgrace , ” Bloomberg said .
Mohamed told the New York Post that “ I wanted to pay attention to getting them to their destination instead of worrying if they were going to have sex or not . ”
HBO made a reality show series based on the goings - on in the back seats of taxi cabs , but we wo n’t be seeing this report on camera anytime soon .
Both Bruno and Ruales have filed reports with the NYC Taxi and Limousine and Human Rights Commissions , which are investigating .
The Taxi and Limousine Commission “ would take such an allegation very seriously and fully investigate , ” said spokesman Allan Fromberg .

City Council Speaker Christine Quinn also called on the city ’s Commission on Human Rights to levy charges .
“ Its outrageous , ” Quinn said .
“ If true , it ’s a clear violation of city human - rights law . ”
This Shinagawa - ken Beer brand was the first beer in Japan .
Whilst we all know the popular brands of Sapporo , Asahi and Kirin it was a little known company based in Tokyo that produced this first beer of Japan .
Back in 1869 ( Meiji 2 ) to 1871 Shinagawa - ken was established and represented some of the key areas that are now known as Tokyo .
It covered modern day Shinagawa , Setagaya , Meguro , Shibuya , Suginami , Nakano and a bit of Shinjuku as well .
In 1871 the Shinagawa - ken area was split up and Tokyo - fu ( not Tokyo - to ) , Kanagawa - ken , Saitama - ken were established .
The beer factory was created during this 2 year Shinagawa - ken period and carries the Shinagawa - ken name .
Do you have any old beers in your area of the world ?
How do they compare tatse wise to the major brands ?

Google had a low - key event today to preview Chrome OS , its new operating system based on Linux and the Chrome browser .
Things are still pretty early -- it 's not even in beta yet , let alone on shipping products -- but that 's the first official screen shot right there , and the big features are all roughed out .
The entire system is web - based and runs in the Chrome browser -- right down to USB drive contents , which show up in a browser tab , and the notepad , which actually creates a Google Docs document .
Web apps are launched from a persistent apps panel , which includes Gmail , Facebook , Twitter , and Hulu , among others , and background apps like Google Talk can be minimized to " panels " that dock to the bottom of the screen .
Local storage is just used to speed up the system -- everything actually lives in the cloud , so all it takes to swap or borrow machines is a login , and you 're good to go .
Google also said it's " very committed " to Flash , and that it 's looking to hardware accelerate whatever code it can -- although Google did n't have a solid answer to give when asked about Silverlight .
Overall , Google was upfront in saying that Chrome OS is focused on very clear use cases for people who primarily use the web , and that it 's not trying to do everything : " If you 're a lawyer , editing contracts back and forth , this will not be the right machine for you .
" As far as going to market , Google 's not talking details until the targeted launch at the end of next year , but Chrome OS wo n't run on just anything -- there 'll be specific reference hardware .
For example , Chrome OS wo n't work with standard hard drives , just SSDs , but Google is supporting both x86 and ARM CPUs .
That also means you wo n't be able to just download Chrome OS and go , you 'll have to buy a Chrome OS device approved by Google .
Interesting move , for sure -- but since the entire OS is totally open - source as of today , we 're sure it 'll be hacked onto all kinds of hardware soon enough .
( And for the record , the demo was run on an off - the - shelf Eee PC . )
Check Google 's intro videos after the break !
Are you sure this is n't counting the number of seconds until Google takes control of the universe ?
They have so much of our information , search habits , browsing history , ... I think they know more about me than I do .
“ Wherever there is a human being , there is an opportunity for a kindness ” – Seneca
A couple of days ago someone said to me : “ Be kind to yourself ! ”
Ever since hearing these words they have been stuck in my head .
I have always understood the importance of kindness , but I have always focused on kindness to others .
I had never thought about kindness towards myself .
It really got me thinking .
I started with how it feels to have someone be kind to you .
I know that feeling .
It ’s warm and cozy and bonding .
But I am not the one to evoke that type of feeling in myself .
I thought about how it feels to be kind – the type of emotions that surge within you when you are considering another person ; care and gentleness .
I do not often feel these types of emotions when dealing with myself .
This leads me to question whether I am ever pointedly kind to myself and how my life would be different if I specifically paid myself some kind attention .
I ’ve been thinking about how you can be kind to yourself and benefits of doing so .
Here are some of my suggestions .
Be Patient
It is important to be patient with yourself if you are battling with a task .
The other night I was in a yoga class , it was hot and sticky , and I was repeatedly falling out of a balance because my hands kept on slipping .
I was highly irritated with myself .
My teacher reminded me that some days I would be better at it than others , some days my practice would be stronger than on others and that it was not a competition with myself .
Now I think : “ What if I had said that to myself and not relied on the teacher to divert me from unkind behavior towards myself ? ”
Impatience has a tendency to lead towards decreased self - esteem and a general bad mood .
It is also something we tend to brood over ; getting stuck in the negative past instead of valuing the present moment .
Stay patient and you will be sure to have more peace in your life .
Watch Your Words
Everybody has self - talk or self - chatter .
Sometimes it is positive and sometimes it is negative ( or very negative ) .
Do you say things to yourself such as : “ you idiot ” or “ how could you do that ? ”
Do you say things to yourself that you would n’t say to others ?
Is what you say to yourself kind ?
I know that if someone said directly to me some of the reprimands that I give myself , I would be extremely hurt .
So why is it all right for me to make such comments to myself ?
For many reasons it is good to try to be aware of negative self - talk and to turn it around .
With awareness one can take action .
In the case of “ kindness to self ” , I think it is important to change ugly to words and tones into sentences that you would feel comfortable using with someone else .
Nice words , kind words , make you feel good or better or even accepted .
Encourage Yourself
When things are tough or you are battling with something , encouragement is a wonderful means of giving you a boost .
But , does encouragement have to come from someone externally ?
I think we should always have enough positive belief in ourselves to carry us through .
Belief is empowering .
Forgive
Forgiveness is often not easy .
One of the steps in attaining forgiveness is self - forgiveness .
So , if we do n’t get that right , we are “ doomed ” in attempts to forgive others .
Forgiving yourself is kind .
Forgiving others is kind .
Give
Acts of kindness involve giving – whether it is material or time or energy of some sorts .
Are you generous towards yourself ?
I think it is important to treat yourself with things you enjoy ( even if it is simply a bath in beautiful oils ) and gifts .
Everyone needs to take time and energy out for themselves , be it reading a book or attending a class or coffee with a friend .
I need to do more of this .
You give to others in order to rejuvenate them .
You are just as worthy of and in need of rejuvenation .
Rejuvenation is key to success .
Besides , you ca n’t give to others , if you do n’t have enough for yourself first .
Listen
Kindness also involves listening .
Do you listen to yourself ?
Do you hear what your body , heart and soul are saying ?
It ’s important to rest if you are tired , to take a break if you have been mentally overworking , to make changes if you are dissatisfied , to seek help if you need it etc .
It ’s another key to success and happiness .
Paying attention to yourself is part of a positive life journey .
Allow
With kindness , one creates a space for and allows another person to be themselves and experience their feelings .
Allowing yourself to feel painful or negative emotions helps with moving forward – so long as you deal with them .
If you keep on covering them up , they continue to draw you downwards and backwards .
You can be empathetic and compassionate with yourself without wallowing in self - pity .
I do n’t think that I am most efficient with dealing with my emotions .
There is a bit of fight going on there .
That energy is better spent elsewhere .
Give Advice
Kindness can involve the giving of advice or suggestions .
So it ’s a matter of taking things into your own hands , learning what you need and the applying it ( in a kind manner ! ) .
A step towards growth .
If you think about it , is everyone not worthy of kindness ?
So then too are you .
I ’ve decided that I need to cultivate kindness towards myself .
I need it in order to extend my acts of kindness , to raise my energy levels and I think it will bring more contentment into my life .
What about you ?
Do you need to treat yourself better ?
Or , do you have any tips for how to be kind to yourself ?

Heather Griffith works with foster children ... but is n't quite raking in the dough .
50 Best Jobs in America
$ 43,20072 % Social workers step in when everyone else steps aside to help people and families in vulnerable situations .
They provide patients with education and counseling , advise care givers and make referrals for other services .
And with social workers in short supply and programs underfunded , few must juggle the work of many , while reaping little reward .
Just ask Heather Griffith , a social worker who works with children in intensive foster care in Boston : " You 're getting paid $ 12 an hour and kids are screaming at you , telling you that you are just in it for the money and you 're just like , ? "
Your article stated that " the government is ready to put evolution on the primary curriculum for the first time after years of lobbying by senior scientists " ( Scientists win place for evolution in primary schools , 9 November ) .
Andrew Copson , director of education at the British Humanist Society , found this " particularly important " .
The plans , you report , come " in the wake of a recent survey commissioned by the British Council which found that 54 % of Britons agreed ... that 'evolutionary theories should be taught in science lessons in schools together with other possible perspectives , such as intelligent design and creationism ' . "
As a former science teacher and schools inspector , I am disturbed that proposals for science education are based on near - complete ignorance of intelligent design .
I also think the views of most British people in this matter should not be so readily set aside .
It is an all too common error to confuse intelligent design with religious belief .
While creationism draws its conclusions primarily from religious sources , intelligent design argues from observations of the natural world .
And it has a good pedigree .
A universe intelligible by design principles was the conclusion of many of the great pioneers of modern science .
It is easily overlooked that the origin of life , the integrated complexity of biological systems and the vast information content of DNA have not been adequately explained by purely materialistic or neo-Darwinian processes .
Indeed it is hard to see how they ever will .
In an area such as this , where we cannot observe what happened directly , a legitimate scientific approach is to make an inference to the best explanation .
In the case of the huge bank of functional information embedded in biological systems , the best explanation – based on the observation everywhere else that such information only arises from intelligence – is that it too has an intelligent source .
You quote schools minister Diana Johnson , who says : " Learning about evolution is an important part of science education . "
If so , then thinking about what must have preceded it is also a legitimate area for science .
The school pupil 's question is always going to be : where did it all come from ?
There is a tendency in school science to present the evidence for evolution as uniformly convincing and all - encompassing , failing to distinguish between what is directly observable – such as change and adaptation over time through natural selection – and the more hypothetical elements , like the descent of all living things from a common ancestor .
The evidence for these various strands is not of equal strength .
If you insist that intelligent causation is to be excluded in the study of origins then you are teaching materialist philosophy , not science .
I believe current government guidance is wrong in denying intelligent design the status of science .
However , it does encourage teachers to handle it " positively and educationally " .
That 's a small step in the right direction .
the unfortunate return of dennis sewell
Dennis Sewell is back , and this time with an entire book lazily recycling the worst and most thoroughly debunked arguments against evolution and Darwin 's work and impact on science .
You might remember Dennis Sewell , the pundit who penned a hackneyed article about the evils of evolution in The Sunday Times , heavily relying on worn and tried creationist canards , and quoting Ann Coulter as some sort of authority on the theory of natural selection .
If you thought his column was a waste of otherwise perfectly good bandwidth , you have n’t seen anything yet because the man has an entire book about the dire misuse of Darwin ’s work by pseudoscientific movements of racists and bigots to capitalize on the manufactroversy of the creationist movement and the naturalist ’s bicentennial .
In other words , he ’s a shameless hack with absolutely zero regard for the actual science , and who ’s more than willing to drag a dead luminary through verbal muck if at the end of the day he gets a dollar or two out of it .
Or since he ’s British , we should probably say quid …
While you might say that I ’m probably being a bit harsh , check out his interview with Time Magazine where he opines on Darwin ’s legacy and questions why the scientist is even in the history books at all , ascribing it to an intense public relations effort by biologists .
The fact that we could pick out hundreds of scientists who ’s ideas are celebrated today but have been used for nefarious means or corrupted to justify the ideas of groups which clearly lacked the ability or the desire to actually understand them , bothers him not at all .
This issue got about two short paragraphs of lip service in his aforementioned promotional piece and it does n’t stop him from the nonsensical declaration that school shooters and sociopaths trying to apply natural selection to those around them must be examples of how Darwin ’s work promotes “ disturbed thinking . ”
It ’s as if Sewell never looked up what the term non sequitur means .
But in this lurid display of witlessness , two quotes really stand out …
I think we have to decide what status we are going to give to the human race .
Most of the world ’s religions hold that human life is sacred in some way .
In teaching common descent with animals , we also have to examine what is special about human beings , and why they deserve to be treated differently and granted certain rights .
Anyone care to guess why religions hold human life is special ?
Because they ’re made by humans who want to survive and thrive , controlling the behavior of societies and ensuring that we stay at the top of the food chain so we can propagate our species .
Does he think that biology classes are taught by PETA ?
Does he not know that natural selection would actually dictate that we ’d have a vested interest in working with each other for our mutual benefit so we can survive and spread our genes ?
This is one of those collections of words which are supposed to mean something profound , but end up making vacuous , nonsensical statements .
What has the theory of evolution done for the practical benefit of humanity ?
It ’s helped our [ basic ] understanding of ourselves , yet compared to , say , the discovery of penicillin or the invention of the World Wide Web , I wonder why Darwin occupies this position at the pinnacle of esteem .
I can only imagine he has been put there by a vast public relations exercise .
Right , why do we need to know the theory of evolution ?
I mean it ’s only the driving force behind most of today ’s medicine and the fundamental framework for cutting edge inventions and discoveries in biology .
In his book , Sewell lets fly with the painfully dimwitted assertion that Darwin ’s work hardly holds as great of a place in the scientific hall of fame as the discovery of DNA .
You know , the DNA which was found when scientists wanted to reconcile Mendel ’s work on heredity and the theory of natural selection and has since been one of the biggest tools for evolutionary research ?
Did this idjit happen to forget his brain on a dark shelf somewhere before he set off to defile Darwin ’s memory some more ?
If Sewell tried to be intellectually honest , he could ’ve found all that on the web , the invention he considers a lot more important than anything Darwin ever did .
And speaking of the web , did you know you could find plenty of sociopaths , bigots , racists and even a homicidal maniac or two congregating on far flung websites ?
Should his next great expose be on Tim Bernes Lee and the dark legacy of the web he funds to be far more important than one of the seeds for modern biology ?
Nah .
That ’s not controversial enough to raise a ruckus and line his pockets so he ’ll stick to Darwin .
In an era when every airheaded loudmouth gets to publish a screed , it makes sense to go for the manufactroversy and force yourself into the spotlight .
From snow covered mountains to wide sand deserts – our planet offers us manifold impressions of colors and forms on its surface .
Using computer rendering techniques we can visualize these from any perspective without being impaired by clouds and dust .
Let me invite you to a journey around the Earth with astonishing views from unusual viewpoints .
You will be able to recognize well known elements as well as discover new worlds .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Rupert Murdoch has spent months complaining that Google is ruining the newspaper business , and now he wants to do something about it .
But , his proposal is a gamble , and one that could hurt News Corp instead of helping it .
Murdoch is considering removing News Corp ’s news from Google ’s Web search results , and is talking to Microsoft Corp about listing the stories with its Bing search engine instead .
Microsoft would pay for the privilege , sources have told Reuters , but it was not clear how much .
If Murdoch pulled this off , he will likely be followed by other newspaper publishers looking for ways to make money when all the old ones are waning in the digital age .
Newspaper owners resent Google because the Internet company makes money from the advertisements that it displays next to news search results .
News Corp ’s proposal is a way to get a cut of the action .
Risks include destroying ad revenue most news websites depend on if traffic goes down because Google users can’t find the stories .
It ’s also not clear how regulators would feel about such a move .
“ You ’re immediately cutting off audience , ” said Jeff Jarvis , media blogger and author of the book “ What Would Google Do ? ”
Google brings as much as 14 percent of incoming traffic to News Corp ’s U.S. news websites , including the New York Post and Fox News , Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay estimated .
If News Corp blocked access to Google , he wrote in a note to investors , it would hurt only News Corp .
Many people find their news on Google , which has 65 percent of the U.S. search market according to comScore .
Newspaper publishers whose websites depend on advertising sales want lots of visitors , and need Google to supply them .
Google provides news organizations about 100,000 clicks a minute , said company spokesman Gabriel Stricker .
“ Each of those visits offers a business opportunity for the publishers to show ads , win loyal readers and sell subscriptions , ” he said .
Making Microsoft ’s
Bing search engine the only way to look for news would slice away visitors and lower the amount of money news websites could charge advertisers .
There is little chance people will abandon Google , which has become such a giant that its name is also a verb .
“ Consumers do not expect search engines to be exclusive , ” Forrester analyst Shar VanBoskirk wrote .
“ If they ca n’t find something through search , it may as well not exist . ”
WEB SUICIDE ?
Microsoft declined to comment , but in theory would like partnering with News Corp to increase Bing ’s share of the lucrative search advertising market at Google ’s expense .
Microsoft had a 10 percent share of the U.S. search market in September , according to comScore .
Some shareholders worry Microsoft might pay more money to News Corp and publishers than the privilege is worth .
“ I do n’t want Microsoft to throw a lot of money toward News Corp , and I do n’t know why News Corp would do this to themselves , ” said Kim Caughey , senior analyst at investment fund Fort Pitt Capital Group , which holds Microsoft shares .
There could also well be U.S. government scrutiny over an exclusive deal between News Corp and Microsoft , or any sort of joint action by news publishers , at the expense of other Internet companies or consumers .
News Corp declined to comment , and sources close to the discussions emphasized talks so far are ideas , nothing more .
Nine of the largest U.S. newspaper publishers also refused to comment .
Other U.S. publishers , if they joined in , would feel more pain because they are far smaller than News Corp and depend on ad sales more than anything else , analysts said .
“ It ’s nothing short of suicidal , ” Jarvis said .
Risking suicide might not seem so crazy to publishers .
Many people say they face creeping death as readers drop print subscriptions and ad revenue falls .
As many deal with looming piles of debt , they must consider some radical moves after laying off thousands of workers .
“ They can not survive at the scale they are accustomed to online unless they can find a new economic model , ” said Tom Rosenstiel , head of the Project for Excellence in Journalism .
“ If it works , Google might say , ‘ wait a second , it ’s very important for us to maintain our market share of search ’ , ” he said .
“ Google has an interest in the news industry surviving . ”
CARTEL
Betting on that is risky .
“ The only way such a strategy would hurt Google in our view is if all of the major newspapers and the major news sources including the AP and Reuters were to agree to a watertight cartel , ” Lindsay wrote in his Bernstein note .
Jarvis agreed .
“ It would be a mosquito bite on the elephant ’s butt , ” he said .
Also , consumers could complain about media companies choking off access to news , something that would spark ire from Congress to the White House , analysts said .
It could carry the whiff of collusion among news outlets to fix prices , something publishers fear being accused of .
“ None of this sounds to me to be pro-competitive or efficient , ” said David Balto of the Center for American Progress , a former Federal Trade Commission policy director .
One possible outcome of News Corp threatening to drop Google could be detente : a common way for publishers to get paid for news that search engines from Google to Yahoo make available to readers , said Outsell analyst Ken Doctor .
“ I do n’t think the endgame for anybody here is to expect that Google ’s going to get turned off ... although you never know , ” he said .
The wider public might view investment bankers as ' vampire squid ' , as one commentator put it , but the newspaper of the business world has made him its ' person of the year '
Hats off to the Financial Times for refusing to pander to lily - livered liberals .
The pink paper has opined that its " person of the year " for 2009 is none other than Lloyd Blankfein , chief executive of the widely reviled Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs .
In the parallel universe inhabited by the FT , Blankfein is a hero - a " master of risk " .
The FT accepts that Blankfein has struggled to find an effective rebuttal of a deluge of public criticism unleashed on his bank .
But it says the former gold trader from the Bronx has " steered Goldman adeptly through the crisis , betting correctly that the global investment banks would survive the turmoil ( with government help ) and not be dismantled by regulators " .
The FT's John Gapper continues : " The bank has stuck to its strengths , unashamedly taking advantage of the low interest rates and diminished competition resulting from the crisis to make big trading profits . "
How charitable .
This is the bank that intends to distribute about $ 22bn in remuneration to its employees this year - more than $ 700,000 each - at the height of the worst recession since the war .
Money , of course , partly earned through government support of the US banking sector paid for with taxpayers ' funds .
And Goldman was the bank widely credited with bringing down the insurer AIG through billions of dollars of collateral calls in September 2008 - all , of course , for sound self - interested business reasons but perhaps with little reference to the broader impact of its actions on the financial system .
Blankfein , who is described by a rival , Morgan Stanley 's boss John Mack , as " smart , really engaged , funny and quick - very quick " , has been tone deaf to the public mood , bizarrely telling the Sunday Times recently that his merry band of bankers were carrying out " God 's work " ( a " joke " , his PR man later assured the financial media ) .
In response to a barrage of outrage , he recently made modest changes to Goldman 's widely pilloried compensation policies , shifting certain payments from cash into shares .
Writing in Rolling Stone magazine back in July , Matt Taibbi summed up public anger with Goldman by comparing the bank to a " vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity " .
Even on Wall Street , not everybody is impressed with the FT 's contrary worldview .
The Huffington Post reports that an influential US banking analyst , Christopher Whalen , has cancelled his subscription to the paper .
" Mr Blankfein and his colleagues at Goldman Sachs , in my view , have done more to damage the reputations of global financial professionals than any other organization in 2009 , yet you applaud them , " wrote Whalen , founder of Institutional Risk Analytics , in a letter to the FT .
" Not only is your suggestion ridiculous and repugnant , but it illustrates to me the fact that the FT is part of the problem in global finance , not as one would hope and expect , part of the solution . "

The small black fish swim around the tank ; gracefully gliding back and forth with little discernible pattern .
Then , barely audible over the watery whirr of the marine laboratory , a low buzz sounds .
And a few seconds later , the scene is transformed as the fish crowd into a small area , corralling themselves into a tightly packed ball .
They are awaiting a reward .
" Now we drop some food into the feeding tube , " says Scott Lindell , who is running the experiment .
" And voila , they are satiated and happy . "
Bass tones Mr Lindell is the director of the scientific aquaculture programme at the Marine Biological Laboratory ( MBL ) in Woods Hole , Massachusetts .
And for the last few years , he has been training fish .
It takes about four weeks to train a black sea bass
It 's a Pavlovian response , he explains .
Just as 19th Century scientist Ivan Pavlov conditioned dogs to associate the sound of a bell with the prospect of food , Mr Lindell 's black sea bass associate a 280 Hz tone emitted from an underwater speaker with food , and respond by gathering in a partitioned " feeding zone " .
" It takes about three or four weeks to train them , " says Mr Lindell .
But why train a fish ?
Currently , offshore fish farms use cages or nets to enclose fish , where they are regularly fed and then harvested .
But Mr Lindell believes " acoustic fish ranching " could offer another option .
He explains : " We are trying to train fish so that we do n't have to use cages to confine them , so that they can forage for natural food as well as the food that we offer them .
" It would keep them in a general area , and you could eventually recapture them and take them to market .
" This could lower the cost of fish farming . "
Underwater massacre
To test this , last year Mr Lindell moved his experiments out to the ocean - along with about 4,200 tagged black sea bass .
But not everything went to plan .
The black sea bass were trained up once they were in the aquadome Mr Lindell says : " We stocked the fish into what we call an aquadome : basically a hemisphere anchored to the sea floor - it's about 32ft across and 16ft high ( 10 m by 5 m ) . "
At first , the scientists covered the dome with a tight mesh , locking the fish inside while they underwent their rigorous sound - training regime with the help of an underwater speaker .
This took about four weeks .
" At that point , we took some of the 1in - mesh ( 3 cm ) off the cage , and replaced it with a 3 in - mesh ( 8 cm ) , " Mr Lindell continues .
" And that allowed some of our smaller fish to swim out , and it kept most of the predators from getting into the cage . "
Bluefish proved to be deadly predators
But there was one exception .
At first , the fish began to forage outside of the aquadome , moving in and out at the prompt of the sound , just as the researchers had hoped .
" But then we start seeing these bluefish circling our cage .
And these are notorious for being ravenous and ruthless hunters , " he says .
" Very frustratingly , we went back day after day to find these fish still showing up at the cage , and we could n't for the life of us call the black sea bass back .
The tags helped the researchers to identify their bass " They were scared to death - we went diving , and we could see them amongst the rocks , but nothing was going to make them run that gauntlet between the rocks and the cage when it would put their lives at risk . "
And the fish had good reason to be scared .
When the team caught one of the bluefish and slit open its belly , they discovered 12 tiny tags - the fish that they had been attached to had already been digested .
Mr Lindell adds : " It goes to show that we can provide all sorts of positive enforcement , but it only takes a little bit of negative enforcement to undo it . "
Robo- sharks
But the underwater massacre has not put Mr Lindell off .
He explains : " It is the same problem that sheep farmers have - if you do n't have fencing , then they need to have some kind of protection against predators .
So with sheep , people have sheep dogs .
" We need to find the equivalent in terms of what would protect our ' herd of fish ' if they were not protected by the confines of the cage . "
Could robotic fish research help with the fish ranching experiments
And a shark might just be the answer , he says .
Something like mako shark that has a taste for bluefish .
He says : " I can't imagine us training a mako shark the way you would train a killer whale .
" But it could be as simple as having a fibreglass , mako shark look - alike that is mechanically driven , that could swim around and around the cage , keeping the bluefish away . "
This summer , Mr Lindell and his team returned to the spot where the aquadome experiment had taken place .
They wanted to see if any of his black sea bass had survived the onslaught of the bluefish and if they still associated the sound with the prospect of a tasty reward .
He says : " We submerged our speaker and produced a noise a couple of times .
" But we only had about 4ft ( 1m ) of visibility , and to the best of our knowledge we did not see any black sea bass streaming back a year later as I 'd hope .
Although the odds of those fish being in that spot a year later would have been small . "
We are now asking what fish species in what geographical areas could be more suitable for this application
Scott Lindell
Despite the problems he experienced during last year 's experiment , Mr Lindell still believes trained fish could benefit fish farms .
And as well as looking into predator defence , he is also looking at the feasibility of training different fish and employing acoustic ranching in different locations .
An experiment that he carried out this summer revealed that a Pavlovian response could be prompted in wild striped bass - and he believes other fish can also be trained .
He says : " We are now asking what fish species in what geographical areas could be more suitable for this application .
" It might be that this makes more sense in reservoirs , for instance , which have a more limited flora and fauna - you would n't have to worry so much about intrusion of predators . "
He adds : " I think it definitively has some possibilities in terms of fisheries management or aquaculture but it has to be the right place and we obviously have to avoid potential problems with predators . "

BOULDER , Colo .
—A 26 - year - old man faces an animal cruelty charge after police say a 4 - month - old beagle asphyxiated after having its mouth taped shut for barking and chewing things .
Kenneth Gookin was arrested Friday following a two day investigation by Boulder police .
Police spokeswoman Sarah Huntley says Gookin told investigators the beagle had been chewing everything , including a phone charger .
He told investigators he taped the puppy ’s mouth shut , put him in the bathroom and left him there for about 1 1/ 2 hours while he went to the store to buy a new charger .
The dog , named Vicious , was dead when he got back .
Gookin had called police Wednesday for help in disposing of a dead dog .
He initially told investigators he did n’t know how the dog died .
I ’m picking up the books at lunch today and getting them ready to ship .
I should have all the pre-orders shipped by the end of the week .
A big thank you to all of you who pre-ordered , it helped us afford the print run .
We ordered plenty of books , so if you want to get one in time for the holidays , I recommend put your order in soon .
We ’ll ship them out right away .

COPENHAGEN : The industrialized countries are cheating the world .
A confidential document of the UN Frame Convention on Climate Change secretariat prepared on December 15 shows , contrary to what the rich nations might claim , even if they come true on their current pledges to reduce emissions the world is headed towards a 3 degree temperature rise by 2050 , not two degree Celsius – the tipping point .
( The document , an authoritative assessment by the UN itself , still kept a secret from the 192 country delegates presently at Copenhagen says , “ Unless the remaining gap ( of the emissions required to be reduced ) is closed and parties ( countries ) commit themselves to strong action prior and after 2020 , global emissions will remain on an unsustainable pathway that could lead to concentrations equal or above 550 ppm ( parts per million of carbon dioxide in air ) with the related temperature raise around 3 degree Celsius .
The UN global group of scientists – IPCC – has long ago warned that if the global temperatures go more than 2 degrees above pre-industrial era the world would tip over into irreversible natural calamities .
The 2 degree target is considered the beacon for how much emission cuts the industrialized countries and others should undertake .
The industrialized countries , such as US and Europe have made some offers and claimed it is enough to prevent disaster .
The UN secret document now shows that the targets the rich countries have unofficially claimed they could take are just not enough .
The rich countries have even 12 hours before the heads of the states meet at Copenhagen , refused to put even these numbers as part of their official positions .
The rich countries have taken commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce their emissions to keep temperatures stable .
While the rich countries are not on track to meet their targets even in the first phase that ends in 2012 they have so far refused to commit to deeper action as required by science in the next phase of the Kyoto Protocol starting 2013 .
They , instead , want the Kyoto Protocol to be killed completely .
QnA : Will the G77 countries be able to stall the West 's attempts to kill the Koyoto Protocol ?

Four men have been indicted in Georgia on charges that they hacked into the Atlanta - based bank card processing company RBS WorldPay .
They allegedly used an army of flunkies to steal $ 9.5 million in cash from ATM machines around the world in a span of hours .
Sergei Tsurikov , 25 , of Tallinn , Estonia ; Viktor Pleshchuk , 28 , of St. Petersburg , Russia ; Oleg Covelin , 28 , of Chisinau , Moldova ; and a fourth person identified only as " Hacker 3 " were indicted by a federal grand jury in what 's being described as " perhaps the most sophisticated and organized computer fraud attack ever conducted . "
The hack involved reverse - engineering PINs for payroll debit card accounts – the holy grail of bank card hacking .
Another four people based in Estonia were also indicted on access - device fraud charges in connection with the hack .
The case is being prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney 's office for the Northern District of Georgia , in Atlanta .
RBS WorldPay , the payment - processing arm of the Royal Bank of Scotland , provides a multitude of electronic payment processing services , including debit card transactions , electronic benefits transfer payments ( EBT ) , gift cards , customer - loyalty cards , prepaid cards , credit card and ATM - processing services .
The processor discovered last November 10 that it had been hacked and that the intruders had accessed account details for 100 payroll cards .
The hackers also obtained Social Security numbers of about 1.1 million account holders .
Initial reports painted the intrusion as a limited hack , due to the number of cards compromised .
But the 16 - count indictment ( .pdf ) charges that the four hackers " compromised the data encryption " that RBS WorldPay used on payroll debit cards to raise the amount of funds available on the cards , as well as withdrawal limits .
Payroll debit cards are used by employers to pay employees instead of checks .
In some cases the hackers raised the limits to $ 500,000 .
According to the indictment , Tsurikov conducted reconnaissance of the RBS network after Covelin provided him with information about vulnerabilities in the system .
Pleshchuk and Covelin then worked on exploiting the vulnerabilities to obtain access on November 4 .
Pleschuk allegedly developed the method for reverse - engineering the encrypted PINs .
Once the hackers raised the account limits , they provided an army of cashers with 44 cards embedded with the account details for a coordinated , simultaneous attack on ATMs around the world .
On November 8 , the cashers were instructed to begin siphoning money , and they hit more than 2,000 ATMs in less than 12 hours , netting about $ 9.5 million .
Three Estonian defendants charged for their role in cashing – Ronald Tso , Evelin Tsoi and Mihhail Jevgenov – allegedly were responsible for withdrawing about $ 289,000 from ATMs in Tallinn , Estonia .
The cashers kept 30 to 50 percent of the loot before transmitting the remainder back to the hackers in Eastern Europe through Western Union and Web Money , a Russia - based digital currency service .
The hackers , still in RBS 's network , were able to observe the withdrawals of funds from ATMs as they occurred in real time in order to monitor the amounts being taken by cashers and lock the accounts to prevent further withdrawals .
Once the mission was completed , the hackers tried to erase their tracks on the RBS network .
Tsurikov was arrested earlier this year in Estonia and is being held there pending extradition to the United States .
The Justice Department will not comment at this time on the status of Pleshchuk and Covelin , a spokesman told Threat Level .
Tsurikov , Pleshchuk , Covelin and " Hacker 3 " face a maximum sentence of up to 20 years in prison for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and other wire - fraud counts , and up to five years in prison for conspiracy to commit computer fraud as well as up to five or 10 years for each count of computer fraud .
They also face a two - year mandatory minimum sentence for aggravated identity theft and fines up to $ 3.5 million dollars .
Covelin was also indicted in September in New York as part of a gang that authorities dubbed the Western Express Cybercrime Group .
That group , operating between 2001 and 2007 , trafficked in at least 95,000 known stolen credit card numbers .
The group worked with a New York - based company called Western Express International , which authorities allege was used to coordinate and facilitate the illegal activities and launder the ring 's ill - gotten gains .

Well , I guess I have some legitimate claim to being one of the designers , since I implemented the first PDP - 11 Unix TCP and was involved in the ongoing TCP and Internet WG meetings and ICCB / IAB way back when .
Ted 's analysis is right on target .
There was considerable thought and discussion given to timeouts and timing in general .
The specific assumptions we made about timing ( e.g. , the maximum lifetime of a packet as it wandered around the net ) had direct impact on design decisions such as the size of the sequence space , and therefore the number of bits in the various fields in the TCP and IP headers .
It also drove the requirement for use of a random number generator to pick an initial value for the TCP sequence number - if a machine rebooted before all of its " old " packets were flushed from the net , much confusion could otherwise result .
TCP / IP was designed to function in a military environment , where nasty things could happen to the net - partitioning , destruction of nodes , etc .
The design criteria was that the data should get through if at all possible , no matter how long it took .
Networks might go away and be " reconstituted " as new hardware was deployed or moved into range .
The implication of this on the TCP / IP machinery was that it should never give up - things might get better .
Connections would be broken only if the " other end " responded and performed a close or abort sequence ( RST , FIN , et al ) .
If the other end did n't respond , the TCP / IP was to continue trying , forever , with an increasing length of time between retransmissions to avoid flooding the net .
The design principle was that only the higher - level application could legitimately decide that it was no longer worth trying to communicate , possibly because whatever it was trying to do was no longer relevant , or because it had additional knowledge that further attempts were futile , or because it had found an alternative way to accomplish its tasks .
In order to help the application make the decision whether to keep trying or abort , the TCP / IP implementation was supposed to make information about the connection behavior available to the application - e.g. , tell the application that it had n't heard anything from the other side for a while ( the " timeout " ) , or that the other side was responsive , but was not willing to take any more data ( the TCP window was closed ) .
The TCP / IP software was never supposed to close a connection because of a timeout - it would only close a connection on instructions from the application that opened the connection , or on word from the other end to close / reset .
These kinds of timing considerations also caused the protocol itself to change as we got some field experience .
Early TCP protocol specs have several fewer states in the state machine than the final TCPV4 because of that .
The protocol used " across the wire " between conversing TCP / IP implementations was well specified .
However , if I remember correctly , the interface ( " API " ) between a TCP / IP and it 's user application was only specified as an example .
There were simply too many different kinds of operating systems and computer environments around at that time to define a standard API .
IBM 360s did n't look like Unix which did n't look like Multics which did n't look like Tenex which really did n't look at all like the Packet Radio OS ( I forget it 's name ... ) .
DOS , Windows , and Macs were n't even around yet .
It was left to each implementation designer to provide an appropriate API which best fit into their particular machine environment .
Personally , the PDP - 11/40
Unix environment was so limited ( 32 K memory - that 's K , not M or G ) , that there was n't a lot of room for anything fancy in my API .
Unfortunately , I think that lack of specific standard API resulted in some TCP / IP implementations that did not provide the intended kind of information and control through the API , or that decided on their own to abort a connection that " timed out " .
The TCP / IP " service specification " was something like - " Keep trying until hell freezes over . "
So , getting back to the original question - yes , the Internet could n't " fail " as long as it kept trying .

The hot new contender in the space of interal DSLs ( domain - specific languages as libraries ) is Scala .
Scala is , as is implied by its name , a language that is designed to scale from small one - off scripts to large enterprise applications .
It is a statically typed language , and in many ways can be seen as a successor to Java .
It also compiles to JVM bytecode .
Similar to Ruby , Scala has a flexible syntax , which makes it an interesting choice to develop internal DSLs for ( like Ruby on Rails ) .
The most popular web application framework for Scala is Lift .
On its website it is described as follows :
Lift is an expressive and elegant framework for writing web applications .
Lift stresses the importance of security , maintainability , scalability and performance , while allowing for high levels of developer productivity .
In Lift , more configuration is done in Scala code rather than in XML files like in a framework like Seam .
Consequently , simple typing mistakes are typically caught by the compiler .
One area where mistakes are still easily made are in its XML - based language for constructing user interfaces .
I wo n’t milk this one too much , we know the trick by now , but let me demonstrate what happens when a programmer makes mistakes in templates .
Mistake # 1 : mistyping a class name
What happens if my satanistic fingers force me to type hellWorld , instead of helloWorld :
< lift : surround with = ” default ” at =” content ” >
< h2 > Welcome to your project !</h2 >
< p><lift:hellWorld.howdy /></p>
</lift:surround >
We get no error at compile time .
At runtime , however something odd happens .
It does display the “ Welcome to your project ! ” message , and the list item with “ Home ” on it is part of our global template .
But where did our howdy message go ?
In the console we see the following ;
In a way this is an acceptable message , but should n’t this be an error ?
Mistake # 2 : mistyping an opening tag
This is a nice one .
Instead of typing “ surround ” in our template , we misspell it as “ surrond ” .
A honest mistake .
How does Lift deal with this ?
< lift : surrond with = ” default ” at =” content ” >
< h2 > Welcome to your project !</h2 >
< p><lift:hellWorld.howdy /></p>
</lift:surround >
This is what we see when we load the page :
line 4 does not exist ?
I ’m pretty sure that it does …
Looking at the stacktrace , I see it has to do something with XML parsing , but other than that , the message is kind of unexpected .
Alright , one more , then it ’s been enough .
Mistake # 3 : mistyping a template block name
Let ’s now misspell some more , we ’re getting good at it .
< lift : surround with = ” default ” at =” conent ” >
< h2 > Welcome to your project !</h2 >
< p><lift:hellWorld.howdy /></p>
</lift:surround >
Again , no compilation errors .
When we load the page we see the following :
No error message on screen , or in our console .
What happened here ?
We only see the global template and nothing from the content we just defined .
This , of course , has to do with the fact that we ’re defining a template that ’s never actually called .
It ’s subtle , but can be tricky to find .
Enough already , we get it !
Ok , ok .
I know .
You get my point .
Statically typed framework fail to detect errors that are encoded in strings and XML files .
So what can we do to fix this ( other than IDE support ) ?
Well , the obvious thing is stop abusing strings and XML files in this way .
If we find an acceptable way to encode these things in Scala we can check a lot more .
Lift takes its first steps towards this by doing configuration in its
Boot class .
There are a few Scala DSLs that make database queries statically verifiable .
Still , the user interface part breaks .
To fix this I attempted to build a simple version of WebDSL as an internal DSL in Scala .
What follows is a piece of code that defines a user interface using this DSL :
This piece of code defines an entries template .
The template renders a header saying “ All entries ” .
Underneath we see a list of all Entry objects ( Entry.all ) .
For each entry there is a list item with a form .
The entry ’s name and text are displayed and there ’s a button to delete the entry from the database .
Simple and elegant ( in my opinion ) .
The nice thing is that when I misspell one of the UI constructs , I get an error :
So the error is found at compile time , which is nice .
However , are these errors very helpful ?
value buton ?
Is a buton supposed to be a value ?
In our domain - speak we ’re attempting to define a page element here , not a value .
The good thing about error messages as you compile is that you see that something is wrong early , and typically can see clearly where the error is .
The error messages , however , are not always very helpful , and hardly ever domain specific ( “ No such page element : buton ” would have been a great error message ) .
But there ’s another error in the code I just showed and the compiler did n’t catch it at all .
The thing is that listitems cannot appear just anywhere , they have to appear within lists !
The list construct was left out .
That ’s easily fixed :
What this example shows is that although we can catch many errors by creating an embedded DSL in Scala , there are definitely limits .
Additionally , there is no way to give domain specific error messages at compile time ( unless we extend the compiler ) , error messages typically expose the underlying implementation .
Yes I admit it , the code to construct a button and define its logic is actually a method call .
So although internal DSLs in a statically typed language help you to find certain types of error faster , the error reporting is far from perfect .
This is one of the strong points of external DSLs as we will see in a future post .

Rachel Pike :
The science behind a climate headline
In 4 minutes , atmospheric chemist Rachel Pike provides a glimpse of the massive scientific effort behind the bold headlines on climate change , with her team — one of thousands who contributed .
Many of the more idiotic climate change Denier Fables grossly misrepresent the vast scale and scope of the science and scientific evidence underlying what we know about climate change .
Let ’s have a look at some of those fables and how they compare to reality .
“ The IPCC scientists blah blah … ”
If ever there were a confession that the person making this claim knows absolutely nothing about climate science :
“ The IPCC does not itself commission or conduct research , but analyzes and weighs findings by scientists in many nations .
The IPCC : A Guide For Journalists
… Doh !
IPCC report has only blah blah authors
Actually it was
450 lead authors from 130 countries 800 contributing authors ( links to their work ) 2500 expert reviewers
Scientists blah blah FUNDING blah blah
This claim is idiotic in so many ways that it will take multiple posts to expose all of the false assumptions and ignorance that would allow someone to believe it , but some of them include :
There are relatively few scientists involved ;
The scientists are from the US or only a few agencies / countries ;
The science is new ( since climate change started getting funding as a field ) ;
Of course reality is somewhat different .
Thanks to Jim Prall we have is a list of the 2907 most frequently cited authors of climate research with links to their work ( 10s of thousands of papers ) .
That ’s just the work with direct relevance to climate change .
Grumbine describes 6 tiers of scientific endeavour that support climate reserch
from
What fields are relevant ?
Brave New Climate also discusses the breadth of climate studies ; here is a partial list which Barry gives :
To get a sense of the scope , have a look at part of of Buchdahl ’s excellent Global Warming Student Guide .
Below is the table of contents for just Section 3 of the Guide .
Global warming blah blah just based on computer models
I think that one ’s been dealt with , no ?
Global warming blah blah in the ’70s blah blah
The basic global warming science is almost 200 yrs old .
The greenhouse effect was discovered by Joseph Fourier in 1824 , CO2 identified as one of the gases causing it by John Tyndall in 1859 , and it was first investigated quantitatively by Svante Arrhenius in 1896 .
See also these timelines for other notable discoveries and events in the long history of climate change science :
and this wonderful series from Doc Snow
or some popular press stories about the evolving science :
1958 – Global Warming
Related , see Google Timeline reveals triumph of denialism for analysis of climate in the popular press over the decades .
New study blah blah
As discussed before , one of the favourite recurring Denier memes is that ‘ New Study disproves / overturns / undermines global warming / climate change science / models / theory ! “
( New study , climate Deniers are “ fundamentally wrong ” )
Never mind that :
they repeat this meme every few weeks with a completely different study ;
none of the Deniers seem to even remotely understand the study they refer to ;
none of the studies ever turn out to say what the Deniers believe / claim ;
the fact that it is “ new ” means it should be treated with caution since review by the entire scientific community can lead to : discovery of subtle errors that the authors and reviewers missed ; a way of understanding the data different from how the authors had ;
the probability that a single study could overturn the thousands upon thousands of studies that support our understanding of climate change is remote in the extreme
This one has been discussed in more detail :
The idea that this incredible mass of scientific evidence would be somehow overthrown by a single study , much less the Three Stooges misunderstanding their own work , a Potty Peer ranting about delusional conspiracies , or Anthony Watts doodling on a climate plot , simply defies belief .

Louis Riel 's conviction for treason should be overturned , says a Manitoba MP , who adds that the hero of Metis across the Prairies should be recognized as a Father of Confederation more than 100 years after his death .
NDP MP Pat Martin has introduced a private members ' bill in the House of Commons , calling for Riel 's 1885 conviction to be reversed and to recognize him both as the founder of Manitoba and for his work in defence of Canada 's Metis population .
" On the Prairies there 's a very strong movement that wants to recognize him not only as the founder of Manitoba but one of the founders of Confederation , and he should be considered one of the Fathers of Confederation because it was he who brought Manitoba into Confederation in 1870 as our fifth province , " Martin told CTV's Power Play on Monday , the 124th anniversary of Riel 's death .
" So my bill is simply stating that it 's overdue that we reverse the conviction of Louis Riel .
Not just pardon him -- because pardon says that you 're guilty of something but we 're going to forgive it somehow .
To reverse the conviction is to exonerate Louis Riel and state that he was never guilty of treason . "
In 1869 , Riel led the Red River Rebellion to assert Metis rights in what was to become Manitoba .
Later that year , he was elected head of a provisional government in Red River and in 1870 , helped usher Manitoba into Confederation .
While Riel was elected to the House of Commons three times , he did not take his seat in Ottawa .
Instead , he left Canada , but returned to lead the Metis in the Northwest Rebellion .
The federal government convicted Riel of high treason and executed him on Nov. 16 , 1885 , for his role in the rebellion .
Martin has been trying for years to rehabilitate Riel 's image in Canada .
His latest bill to exonerate Riel , C - 258 , went through its first reading in January , and will likely not come up for debate until next year .
According to Martin , the Canadian government did not have the authority to charge Riel .
" These events took place outside of the realm of the Crown , and he was charged with treason as it pertains to the realm of the Crown .
Any good lawyer should be able to drive a truck through a loophole like that but he did n't have a good legal defence , " Martin said .
" ( The government ) had made up their minds early on that they were going to get rid of this nuisance agitator who was fighting for the rights of the Metis , and more and more as the history comes to the surface , we see that the government of Canada wanted Louis Riel out of the way and they worked backwards from that conclusion .
Really , it 's safe to say he was murdered by the Crown . "
Today , DHS 's Napolitano 's response to the crotchbomber : " We 're looking to make sure that this sort of incident cannot recur . "
But the TSA 's response to Abdulmutalib 's attempt makes one thing clear :
We must stop pretending the TSA is making us safer .

Security expert Bruce Schneier nails the core incompetency : " For years I 've been saying ' Only two things have made flying safer [ since 9/11 ] : the reinforcement of cockpit doors , and the fact that passengers know now to resist hijackers . ' "
So what has the TSA done in response to the attempted attack ?
They 've told airlines to make passengers stay in their seats during the last hour of flight .
They 've made it verboten for passengers to hold anything in their laps , again only during the last hour of flight .
Perhaps most hilariously telling , they 've forbidden pilots from announcing when a plane is flying over certain cities and landmarks .

There is no other way to interpret it :
The TSA is saying clearly that they can't prevent terrorists from getting explosives on airplanes , but by god , they 'll make sure those planes explode only when the TSA says it 's okay .

I want our government to prevent terrorism and to make flights safer .
But we are spending billions of dollars and man-hours to fight a threat that is less likely to kill a traveler than being struck by lightning .
In the last decade , according to statistician Nate Silver , there has been " one terrorist incident per 11,569,297,667 miles flown [ the ] equivalent to 1,459,664 trips around the diameter of the Earth , 24,218 round trips to the Moon , or two round trips to Neptune . "
( Sadly , this does mean that in the future we can expect one out of every two round - trip flights to Neptune to be hijacked . )
The TSA is n't saving lives .
We , the passengers , are saving our own .
Since its inception , the TSA has been structured in such a way as to prevent specific terror scenarios , attempting to disrupt a handful of insanely specific tactics , while continuing to disenfranchise and demoralize the citizens who are actually doing the work that a billion - dollar government agency — an agency that received an additional $ 128 million just this year for new checkpoint explosive screening technology — has failed to do .

We just had the first legitimate attempted attack in years , and the TSA changes the threat level from orange ... to orange .
This goes far beyond simple customer satisfaction issues like " Take Back Takeoff . "
( Although they are of a kind . )
It has to do with wildly irrationally response of a government agency in the face of failure .
An agency whose leader , Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano , said at first blush that the attempted attack showed that — here comes the Katrina - class foot - in - mouth — " the system worked . "
( She shoveled shit in her mouth this morning , while still talking up the asinine new measures that the TSA will be taking to respond to this isolated threat . )

I do n't want to die on an airplane .
I do n't want to die in my home while eating an organic bagel infested with parasites that lay eggs on my liver .
I do n't want to die from starvation or bad water or a thousand other things that I pay our government to monitor and regulate .

But I also do n't expect the government to protect from the literally endless possibilities and threats that could occur at any point to end my life or the life of the few I love .
It 's been nearly a decade since terrorists used airplanes to attack our country , and last week 's attempt makes it clear that the lack of terrorist attacks have nothing to do with the increasing gauntlet of whirring machines , friskings , and arbitrary bureaucratic provisions , but simply that for the most part , there just are n't that many terrorists trying to blow up planes .
Because god knows if there were , the TSA is n't capable of stopping them .
We 're just one bad burrito away from the TSA forcing passengers to choke back an Imodium and a Xanax before being hogtied to our seats .
President Obama , do n't let this attack — this one attack that was thankfully stopped by smart , fearless passengers and airline staff — take us further in the wrong direction .
I do n't think I 'm alone in feeling this way .
Americans of all stripes and affiliation standing up to say , " This is n't working .
We gave you our money .
You 're not making us safer . "
We appreciate the attempt to make us safer and acknowledge that it came from an honest attempt to protect American ( and the rest of the world 's ) lives .

But it 's a failure .
It 's wrongheaded .
It 's a farce .
Tear it down .
Put the money towards the sort of actions at which our government excels , like intelligence .
The failure of the TSA leaves us no choice , but it 's okay .
The American people are ready to take back the responsibility for our own safety .
Really , we already have .

Over the weekend the brutalized body of gay teen George Steven Lopez Mercado was found by the side of a road in Puerto Rico .
The police investigator suggested that he deserved what he got because of the " type of lifestyle " he was leading .
According to an iReport by Chrisopher Pagan : " On November 14 the body of a gay 19 year old was found a few miles away from the town in which he was residing in called Caguas .
He was a very well known person in the gay community of Puerto Rico , and very loved .
He was found on the site of an isolated road in the city of Cayey , he was partially burned , decapitated , and dismembered , both arms , both legs , and the torso .
This has caused a huge reaction from the gay community here , but its a difficult situation .
Never in the history of Puerto Rico has a murder been classified as a hate crime .
Even though we have to follow federal mandates and laws , many of the laws in which are passed in the USA such as Obama ’s new bill , do not always directly get practiced in Puerto Rico .
The police agent that is handling this case said on a public televised statement that ' people who lead this type of lifestyle need to be aware that this will happen ' .
As If the boy murdered Jorge Steven Lopez was asking to get killed … "
Here 's a report on the murder ( in Spanish ) from PrimeraHora.com .
Said activist Pedro Julio Serrano :
" It is inconceivable that the investigating officer suggests that the victim deserved his fate , like a woman deserves rape for wearing a short skirt .
We demand condemnation of this investigator and demand that Superintendente Figueroa Sancha replace him with someone capable of investigating this case without prejudice . " ( my translation , please suggest a better one if you can ) .

Scientists have developed a number of quantum computing systems that use ions or electrons as bits of data ; mathematical " operations " can be performed on them with beams of light or electrical pulses .
Until recently , however , these systems could only perform the specific tasks they were designed to do .
But a group of NIST scientists have published a description of a quantum processor that can receive virtually any set of instructions and perform them on a set of inputs — in short , they 've made the first programmable quantum processor .
In order to do general calculations , a computer must be able to perform an arbitrary number of unitary transformations , operations that change the state while preserving the structure of the system .
Unlike a regular computer , a quantum computer stores information in " qubits , " or quantum bits .
A regular bit may hold only one piece of data ( 0 or 1 ) , but a qubit can hold a superposition of 0 and 1 ; it only adopts a definite value when measured .
That 's just one of a number of important differences between quantum and regular computers .
Standard computers use logic gates , such as Boolean operators ( and , or , not , and so on ) .
Quantum computers use quantum gates , which are always reversible operators , unlike many logic gates .
Finally , qubits can undergo entanglement .
" Entanglement " in quantum mechanics means the properties of the qubits can be dependent on each other , even if they are physically separated .
For example , in a system where two qubits may only be 0 at the same time or 1 at the same time , measuring one of them as 0 will ensure that the other is 0 as well .
In the case of quantum information science , developing a system that can perform any arbitrary transformation on qubits is actually just as hard as it sounds .
To get there , the NIST scientists created a system that has two quantum gates , one that deals with a single qubit at a time , and another entangled two - qubit gate .
The physical incarnation of the system used two beryllium ions trapped in a finite region , with the gate operations , or transformations on the states of the ions , performed by stimulating them with ultraviolet lasers .
The experiment used the ions to represent 15 classical inputs using all the possible combinations of 0 and 1 that can be stored in two qubits .
Using these starting states , they performed 160 randomly chosen operations .
These were analyzed using 100 experimental sequences with nine different analysis settings , for a total of 900 trials for each of the 160 transformations .
Each trial run on the qubits took about 37 milliseconds .
Once the sequence of transformations was performed , the scientist compared the output of the operations to the ideal result and found that their operations produced an accurate result about 79 percent of the time .
So , the system is by no means perfectly reliable , but the results are enough to demonstrate that the processor is capable of applying all possible combinations of unitary operations to the two qubits .
While previous quantum computing systems could perform certain operations using two - qubit quantum gates , these systems were only suited to performing a limited number of operations ; to do anything beyond those , an entirely new system had to be designed .
This experiment shows that the combination of a single - qubit and two - qubit gate can simulate all possible unitary operations .
This means that we can create a universally programmable quantum computer that can do whatever its users want .
The authors of the article assert that larger - scale problems that deal with more pieces of data will need more qubits , and therefore more gates to represent all of the potential operations .
They also concede that the reliability of the calculations will need to improve significantly for such a system to enter regular use .

This content is part of the series : Java development 2.0 Stay tuned for additional content in this series .
So far , this column series has explored cloud computing with both Google 's and Amazon 's platforms .
Though they differ in implementation and structure , both platforms enable rapid and scalable deployment .
They make it possible , as never before , to assemble , test , run , and maintain Java applications quickly and inexpensively .
But the cloud is n't the only factor affecting the speed of Java development today .
Open source solutions also enable you to assemble software applications quickly , because you do n't need to write as much code anymore .
Gone are the days of writing your own object - relational mapping ( ORM ) , logging , or testing framework .
Those problems have been solved time and again in the open source world and — face it — those solutions are almost always better than yours .
About this series
The Java development landscape has changed radically since Java technology first emerged .
Thanks to mature open source frameworks and reliable for - rent deployment infrastructures , it 's now possible to assemble , test , run , and maintain Java applications quickly and inexpensively .
In this series , Andrew Glover explores the spectrum of technologies and tools that make this new Java development paradigm possible .
Across the entire spectrum of Java development , open source innovation is making applications easier to assemble .
Apache CouchDB , a new ( at release 0.10.0 as of this writing ) open source database , is no exception .
It 's easy to get going with Couch DB once you have it up and running .
And all you need to work with it is an HTTP connection ; no JDBC driver is required , nor do you need a third - party administrative - management platform .
In this article , I 'll introduce you to CouchDB and show you how you can rapidly get up to speed with using it .
For ease of installation , you 'll take advantage of Amazon 's EC2 platform .
And you 'll communicate with CouchDB via a handy Groovy module .
A document - oriented database
Relational databases essentially rule the database market .
But other types of databases — including object - orienteed and document - oriented databases , which both differ vastly from the relational - oriented world — make a lot of sense from time to time .
CouchDB is a document - oriented database .
It 's schema-less and allows you to store documents in the form of a JavaScript Object Notation ( JSON ) string .
JSON JSON is a lightweight data - interchange format and an alternate format for Web applications .
It is similar to XML but much less verbose .
It is becoming the lingua franeca of the Web , thanks to its lightweight nature .
See Related topics to learn more about JSON .
Think of a parking ticket .
This piece of paper contains a number of items including :
The date of the infraction
The time
The location
Your vehicle 's description
Your license - plate information
The offense
The format and the data gathered on a ticket can vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction .
Even with a standard parking - ticket form within a single jurisdiction , what is or is n't captured on the ticket most likely varies .
For example , the officer issuing the citation might not fill in the time , or might omit the vehicle make and model , opting to enter just the license - plate details .
The location might be the combination of two streets ( such as the intersection of Fourth and Lexington ) or just a fixed address ( such as 19993 Main Street ) .
But the rough semantics of what 's gathered are similar .
A ticket 's data points can be modeled in a relational database , but the details get a bit hairy .
For example , how do you capture an intersection effectively in a relational database ?
And in cases where no cross street exists , does the database then have a blank field for the second address ( assuming you modeled it in such as way as to capture distinct street names in individual columns ) ?
In these cases , the abstractness of a relational database might be a bit much .
The information required is already there in the form of a document ( the ticket ) .
Why not just model the data as a document , which does n't necessarily fit into a rigid relational model but roughly follows the semantics of a high - level model ?
That 's where CouchDB comes into play .
It allows you to model these types of domains in a flexible manner — as a self - contained document that contains no schema but , instead , a roughly similar blueprint to other documents .
MapReduce MapReduce , which was pioneered by Google , is a conceptual framework for processing huge data sets ( see Related topics ) .
It is highly optimized for distributable problem solving using a large number of computers .
MapReduce is the combination of two functions : map and reduce .
The map function is designed to take a large input and divide into smaller pieces ( and hand that data off to other processes that can do something with the data ) .
The reduce function is intended to bring all the individual answers from map into one final output .
With CouchDB , you can search for documents , properties of documents , and even relate documents just as in the relational world .
You do this using views , not SQL .
Views are essentially functions that you write ( in JavaScript ) in the style of MapReduce ; that is , you end up writing a map function and a reduce function .
These functions work together to filter or extract data from your documents or exploit relationships among them quite efficiently .
In fact , CouchDB is smart enough to run these functions only once , provided the underlying documents do n't change , which makes views quite fast .
What 's particularly interesting about CouchDB is its design .
CouchDB embodies the basic ( and highly successful ) concepts of the Web itself .
It exposes a completely RESTful API that permits the creation , querying , updating , and removal of documents , views , and databases .
This makes CouchDB quite easy to pick up and work with .
You do n't need drivers or other platforms to jump - start development : a browser is essentially it .
That being said , a host of libraries are available that make working with CouchDB even easier — but under the covers , they simply exploit RESTful concepts via HTTP .
CouchDB , much like the Web itself , was built to be scalable .
It 's written in Erlang , a concurrent programming language that supports building distributed , fault - tolerant , nonstop applications ( see Related topics ) .
The language ( now available as open source ) was developed by Ericsson and has been widely leveraged in telecommunications environments .
Installing CouchDB , cloud style
Installation of CouchDB varies depending on your operating system .
If you are on Windows® , you need to install Cygwin , the Microsoft C compiler , and a slew of other related dependencies .
If you are on a Mac , you need to use Macports .
If , however , you are running on a Linux ® platform , such as Ubuntu , the installation could n't be easier .
But not everyone has an Ubuntu instance handy .
Or do you ?
Of course you have an Ubuntu instance handy !
Amazon 's EC2 is a relatively inexpensive way to use Ubuntu on demand .
Thus , with a bit of EC2 magic , you 'll have CouchDB up and running in no time ; when you 're done , you can power it down , so to speak .
First , you 'll need to find an EC2 AMI that 'll work as a base instance .
I ended up using AMI ami-ccf615 a5 , an instance of Ubuntu 9.04 , which was the latest version available at the time of this writing .
( By the time you read this , 9.10 will be available along with , most likely , a newer AMI . )
Using either Eclipse or the AWS Management Console , launch an instance of ami -ccf615 a5 .
Be sure to set a security policy that permits access via SSH .
( Although CouchDB uses HTTP , you 'll communicate with it through an SSH tunnel for simplicity 's sake . )
You 'll also need to use a key pair .
( If you need guidance , refer to the previous two articles in this series , " You can borrow EC2 " and " Easy EC2 . " )
Once you 've launched an EC2 instance of Ubuntu 9.04 , you need to ssh to it .
( Remember the instance might take a minute or so to boot up fully , so be patient . )
For example , I can open up a terminal and ssh to the newly created instance like so :
aglover # > ssh -i .ec2/agkey.pem root@ec2-174-129-157-167.compute-1.amazonaws.com
The DNS name of my AMI was ec2-174-129-157-167.compute-1.amazonaws.com , and I 'm referencing a key pair named agkey .
Your DNS name and key pair will undoubtedly be different .
At the command prompt on the clouded Ubuntu instance , type :
apt - get update
Then type :
aptitude install couchdb
These commands automatically install CouchDB .
However , note that they wo n't install the latest version .
You need to install CouchDB from source if you want the very latest version ( see Related topics ) .
Once the commands finish executing , you can check to see if CouchDB is running by issuing a ps - eaf command .
Look for a few processes running with couchdb in their path by piping the ps output to egrep .
You should see something along the lines of the output shown in Listing 1 :
Listing 1 . CouchDB is running ( lines broken to fit article page width )
couchdb 1820 1 0 00:54 ?
00:00:00 / bin/sh -e /usr/bin/couchdb -c /etc/couchdb/couch.ini - b -r 5 -p /var/run/couchdb.pid -o / couchdb 1827 1820 0 00:54 ?
00:00:00 / bin/sh -e /usr/bin/couchdb -c /etc/couchdb/couch.ini - b -r 5 -p /var/run/couchdb.pid -o / couchdb 1828 1827 0 00:54 ?
00:00:00 /usr/lib/erlang/erts-5.6.5/bin/beam
- Bd -- -root /usr / lib/ erlang - progname erl -- - home /v couchdb 1836 1828 0 00:54 ?
00:00:00 heart - pid 1828 -ht 11
Next , back on your local machine , you 'll set up an SSH tunnel that lets you access the CouchDB instance running on the cloud , as if it were residing on your own machine .
To do so , open up a new terminal session on your local machine and type :
ssh - i your key - L 5498:localhost:5984 root@your AMI DNS
Finally , open up a browser on your local machine .
In the location bar , type http://127.0.0.1:5498/ .
You should see a nice welcome message in JSON , like this one :
{ " couchdb " : " Welcome " , " version " : " 0.8.0 - incubating " }
Now that it appears things are working , you 're ready to put Couch DB through its paces .
Working RESTfully with Groovy 's RESTClient
REST Representational state transfer ( REST ) is a style of designing loosely coupled Web applications that rely on named resources — in the form of Uniform Resource Locators ( URLs ) , Uniform Resource Identifiers ( URIs ) , and Uniform Resource Names ( URNs ) , for instance — rather than messages .
Ingeniously , REST piggybacks on the already validated and successful infrastructure of the Web — HTTP .
That is , REST leverages aspects of the HTTP protocol such as GET and POST requests .
These requests map quite nicely to standard business - application needs such as create , read , update , and delete ( CRUD ) .
Because CouchDB exposes data via a RESTful HTTP interface , working with CouchDB ( as you 've already seen via your browser ) is quite easy .
Pretty much everything you want to do can be done via HTTP .
You can choose among plenty of tools for interacting with HTTP .
When working with RESTful interfaces , one of my favorites is the RESTClient extension to Groovy 's HTTPBuilder ( see Related topics ) .
HTTPBuilder — a wrapper for the Apache Commons Project 's popular HTTPClient — adds some slick Groovy - ness to the syntax of HTTP POSTs , GETs , PUTs , and DELETEs .
Because HTTPBuilder is built with and leverages Groovy , writing scripts that leverage RESTful concepts ( such as communicating with CouchDB ) could n't be easier .
Grape makes easy even quicker
In keeping with the general themes of Java development 2.0 — quick , easy , and free ( or cheap ) — Groovy 's handy Grape ( Groovy Advanced Packaging Engine or Groovy Adaptable Packaging Engine ) feature is particularly relevant when it comes to interacting with a library like HTTPBuilder ( see Related topics ) .
Grape is a dependency manager that allows Groovy scripts and classes to autoconfigure their particular dependencies at run tieme .
This makes using various open source libraries a breeze , because you do n't need to download a series of JAR files just to start coding .
For example , with Grape , you can write a Groovy script to use HTTPBuilder without having HTTPBuilder 's required JARs beforehand .
With Grape , they 'll be downloaded ( via Apache Ivy ) at run time ( or compile time ) .
You leverage Grape via annotations and method calls .
You can , for example , decorate a method or class declaration with a @ Grab annotation .
In this annotation , you specify some relevant metadata regarding the main dependency .
( Through the magic of Ivy , all transitive dependencies will be figured out too ) .
At run time or compile time ( whichever is first ) , Grape downloads these dependencies and ensures they 're in your classpath .
If the dependencies are already downloaded ( from a previous run , for instance ) , Grape nevertheless still ensures the proper JAR files are in your classpath .
RESTing easy on CouchDB with Groovy
Before you can create any documents in CouchDB , you must create a database .
To create a parking - tickets database , issue an HTTP PUT via HTTPBuilder 's slick domain - specific language ( DSL ) using its RESTClient , as shown in Listing 2 .
( All the Groovy code for this article 's examples is available for download . )
Listing 2 . Creating a CouchDB database
import static groovyx.net.http.ContentType.JSON
import groovyx.net.http.RESTClient @ Grab(group='org.codehaus.groovy.modules.http-builder ' , module= ' http - builder ' , version = ' 0.5.0 - RC2 ' ) def getRESTClient ( ) { return new RESTClient ( " http://localhost:5498 / " ) } def client = getRESTClient ( ) def response = client.
put ( path : " parking_tickets " , requestContentType : JSON , contentType : JSON ) assert response.data.ok == true : " response from server was n't ok "
CouchCB should return the response { " ok " : true} .
As you can see in Listing 2 , in HTTPBuilder it 's simple to parse JSON and ensure that the ok element 's value is indeed true .
Next , it 's time to create some documents in keeping with the parking - tickets theme .
To model a parking ticket , remember that a number of aspects are associated with a ticket .
Also keep in mind that because these are actual forms that officers complete , some fields might not be filled out or even follow a prescribed pattern — think intersection vs. exact location .
Using HTTPBuilder , you can create a document in CouchDB via an HTTP PUT ( just as I did in Listing 2 to create the database ) .
Because CouchDB works with JSON documents , you must follow JSON 's name - value format .
You do this by creating a map - like data structure in Groovy ( which HTTPBuilder will transform into valid JSON ) .
Listing 3 shows how :
Listing 3 . Creating a CouchDB document via RESTClient
response = client.put( path : " parking_tickets/1234334325 " , contentType : JSON , requestContentType : JSON , body : [ officer : " Kristen Ree " , location : " 199 Baldwin Dr " , vehicle_plate : " Maryland 77777 " , offense : " Parked in no parking zone " , date : " 2009/01/31 " ] ) assert response.data.ok == true : " response from server was n't ok " assert response.data.id == " 1234334325 " : " the returned ID did n't match "
A few things are going on in Listing 3 .
First , when issuing a PUT for a CouchDB document , you must assign a UUID .
CouchDB can assign these for you , or you can manage them yourself .
In Listing 3 , I 've just made one up ( 1234334325 ) ; this UUID is consequently appended to the URL .
If that UUID is available , CouchDB will assign the PUTed document to it .
In the body aspect of my put call , note how each name has an associated value , almost like a normal map .
For instance , the assigning officer 's name is Kristen Ree , and the location of the ticket is 199 Baldwin Dr .
Listing 4 creates another parking ticket in CouchDB via the same technique :
Listing 4 .
Another parking ticket
def id = new Date ( ) .
time response = client.
put ( path : " parking_tickets / ${id} " , contentType : JSON , requestContentType : JSON , body : [ officer : " Anthony Richards " , location : " Walmart Parking lot " , vehicle_plate : " Delaware 4433 - OP " , offense : " Parked in non-parking space " , date : " 2009/02/01 " ] ) assert response.data.ok == true : " response from server was n't ok " assert response.data.id == " $ {id} " : " the returned ID did n't match "
Every time I issue a PUT via RESTClient , I assert that the JSON response contains a true value for ok , and I verify that my intended id value is present .
Note how in Listing 4 , rather than making up the UUID , I 'm now using the current time — not a foolproof technique , but it 'll suffice for simple interactions .
When you successfully create a new document in CouchDB , it responds with JSON containing the UUID and a revision ID .
For example , this response represents the JSON that I 'm validating in Listing 4 :
{ " ok " : true , " id " : " 12339892938945 " , " rev " : " 12351463 " }
Your id and rev values will undoubtedly be different .
Note that I can grab the id value by issuing a call such as response.data.id .
In CouchDB , documents are tracked via revisions , so you can go back to a previous document version ( via the revision ID ) , much as you can in CVS or Subversion .
Views in CouchDB
Now that I 've created a few parking tickets ( or documents in CouchDB speak ) , it 's time to create a view in CouchDB .
Remember , views are just MapReduce functions in action ; thus , you must define them .
In many cases , you do n't need the reduce function ; the map function can handle most things for you .
It does just what it sounds like .
You can essentially map what " things " or aspects you 'd like to filter or find , for example .
I 've defined two tickets : one issued by Officer Ree and another issued by Officer Richards .
To find all the tickets issued by Officer Ree , for example , you write a map function that filters the officer property accordingly .
You then pass the results to CouchDB 's emit function .
Using CouchDB 's admin interface : Futon
You can define views via CouchDB 's RESTful API or via CouchDB 's administrative interface , dubbed Futon .
Futon is just a Web application available at http://localhost:5498/_utils/.
Go there now , and ( assuming you 've created the database and documents along with me ) you should see a simple interface for the parking_tickets database , as shown in Figure 1 :
Figure 1 . The Futon interface
If you select the parking_tickets database , you can then see a drop - down list on the far right ( dubbed Select view : ) .
You start defining a custom view by selecting the Custom query ... , as shown in Figure 2 :
Figure 2 . Futon 's view - selection interface
Now Futon presents an interface that allows you to define both a map function and a reduce function .
( You might need to click the View code link ) .
In the Map text box , define the simple map function shown in Listing 5 :
Listing 5 . A simple map function in CouchDB
function ( doc ) { if ( doc.officer == " Kristen Ree " ) { emit ( null , doc ) ; } }
As you can see , the map function in Listing 5 is defined in JavaScript .
All it does is filter the documents in the CouchDB database by a document 's officer property .
Specifically , the function passes a document to the emit only if the officer 's name is Kristen Ree .
Figure 3 shows where I 've defined this function in Futon :
Figure 3 . Creating a MapReduce function
Next , you 're asked to provide a design document name ( enter by_name ) and a view name ( enter officer_ree ) .
These names will serve as a means to build a URL for invoking this view later ( that is , http://localhost:5498/parking_tickets/_view/by_name/officer_ree ) .
You can now use this view via HTTPBuilder , as shown in Listing 6 :
Listing 6 . Invoking your new view
response = client.get ( path : " parking_tickets/_view/by_name/officer_ree " , contentType : JSON , requestContentType : JSON ) assert response.data.total_rows == 1 response.data.rows.each{ assert it.value.officer == " Kristen Ree " }
This view correctly returns a JSON response containing only one document : the ticket issued by Officer Ree on January 31 .
The response object in Listing 6 hides the raw HTTP response by parsing the JSON accordingly .
You can view the raw JSON response by calling the toString method on the data property of the response object .
The raw response looks like Listing 7 :
Listing 7 .
The view 's raw result
{ " total_rows " : 1 , " offset " : 0 , " rows " : [ { " id " : " 1234334325 " , " key " : null , " value " : {" _id " : " 1234334325 " , " _rev " : " 4205717256 " , " officer " : " Kristen Ree " , " location " : " 199 Baldwin Dr " , " vehicle_plate " : " Maryland 77777 " , " offense " : " Parked in no parking zone " , " date " : " 2009/01/31" }} ] }
As you can see from the raw JSON document returned , HTTPBuilder 's ability to parse JSON effortlessly is quite handy , because it enables an object graph - like mechanism for assessing various attributes and their corresponding values .
For demonstration purposes , I 'll add some more documents to the database .
In order to keep working through the examples , you should do the same using the code download .
CouchDB 's emit function works as an organizer of sorts .
If you do n't put a restriction in your map function ( as I did in Listing 5 ) , then the emit will essentially sort the passed - in documents .
For example , if you want to obtain all tickets by date ( think SQL's ORDER BY clause here ) you can just emit by the document 's date fields , as shown in Listing 8 :
Listing 8 . A simpler map function
function ( doc ) { emit( doc.date , doc ) ; }
Listing 9 issues an HTTP GET against this view ( which I 've given a design document name of dates and a view name of by_date ) .
Listing 9 .
Another view invoked
response = client.get ( path : " parking_tickets/_view/dates/by_date " , contentType : JSON , requestContentType : JSON ) assert response.data.total_rows == 4
The query in Listing 9 returns all the documents in the parking_tickets database sorted by date .
The assert statement simply verifies that the total_rows property is equal to 4 .
This is a key point .
Views return results as well as a bit of metadata ( such as the number of returned documents ) ; thus , it helps to see the raw response before you start parsing away .
Listing 10 shows the raw results :
Listing 10 .
Raw JSON documents sorted by date
{ " total_rows " : 4 , " offset " : 0 , " rows " : [ { " id " : " 85d4dbf45747e45406e5695b4b5796fe " , " key " : " 2009/01/30 " , " value " : { " _id " : " 85d4dbf45747e45406e5695b4b5796fe " , " _rev " : " 1318766781 " , " officer " : " Anthony Richards " , " location " : " 54th and Main " , " vehicle_plate " : " Virginia FCD - 4444 " , " offense " : " Parked in no parking zone " , " date " : " 2009/01/30 " }} , { " id " : " 1234334325 " , " key " : " 2009/01/31 " , " value " : { " _id " : " 1234334325 " , " _rev " : " 4205717256 " , " officer " : " Kristen Ree " , " location " : " 199 Baldwin Dr " , " vehicle_plate " : " Maryland 77777 " , " offense " : " Parked in no parking zone " , " date " : " 2009/01/31 " }} , { " id " : " 12345 " , " key " : " 2009/01/31 " , " value " : { " _id " : " 12345 " , " _rev " : " 1479261876 " , " officer " : " Anthony Richards " , " location " : " 1893 Main St " , " vehicle_plate " : " Maryland 4433 - OP " , " offense " : " Parked in no parking zone " , " date " : " 2009/01/31 " }} , { " id " : " 12339892938945 " , " key " : " 2009/02/01 " , " value " : { " _id " : " 12339892938945 " , " _rev " : " 12351463 " , " officer " : " Anthony Richards " , " location " : " Walmart Parking lot " , " vehicle_plate " : " Maine 4433 - OP " , " offense " : " Parke d in non-parking space " , " date " : " 2009/02/01 " }} ] }
What 's interesting about defining views like this is that you can then pass in a key — that is , what you 'd like the emit function 's first value essentially to represent .
For example , the view defined in Listing 8 essentially sorts by date .
If you 'd like to sort it by a specifeic date , then pass that date into the view query .
For instance , just for fun , enter this URL in your browser 's location box :
http://localhost:5498/parking_tickets/_view/dates/by_date?key=" 2009/01/31
"
This view then returns only the tickets issued on January 31 .
You should see a bunch of JSON - looking text in your browser window similar to what you can see in Listing 11 .
Notice that using your browser as your query tool is an especially easy way to view the raw JSON response of an HTTP request .
Listing 11 .
Only two tickets issued on January 31
{ " total_rows " : 4 , " offset " : 1 , " rows " : [ { " id " : " 1234334325 " , " key " : " 2009/01/31 " , " value " : { " _id " : " 1234334325 " , " _rev " : " 4205717256 " , " officer " : " Kristen Ree " , " location " : " 199 Baldwin Dr " , " vehicle_plate " : " Maryland 77777 " , " offense " : " Parked in no parking zone " , " date " : " 2009/01/31 " }} , { " id " : " 12345 " , " key " : " 2009/01/31 " , " value " : { " _id " : " 12345 " , " _rev " : " 1479261876 " , " officer " : " Anthony Richards " , " location " : " 1893 Main St " , " vehicle_plate " : " Maryland 4433 - OP " , " offense " : " Parked in handicap zone without permit " , " date " : " 2009/01/31" }} ] }
Views can be as specific as you 'd like .
For instance , with a little JavaScript string manipulation , I can write one that finds tickets issued anywhere on Main Street , as shown in Listing 12 :
Listing 12 .
Another view with some string magic
function ( doc ) { if(doc.location.toLowerCase().indexOf ( ' main ' ) > 0 ) { emit( doc.location , doc ) ; } }
As you can see from Listing 12 , if the location element of any document contains main , then the document is passed to the emit function .
Keep in mind that this search is rather wide .
If a document 's location contains a string such as Germaine Street , it 'll be returned too .
For the small population of tickets I 've defined , the view would return the results shown in Listing 13 :

Note that the JSON response contains a key element , which describes why a particular document was emitted .
This level of information is quite helpful .
Also note how all along , the data found in the various tickets I 've defined is somewhat inconsistent : some locations are precise , others are n't .
Although this data could be stored in a relational database , it fits well with the documented - oriented model too , do n't you think ?
Plus , with the power of Groovy and HTTPBuilder 's ability to parse JSON effortlessly , it 's quite easy to get at the data ( much easier than with raw JDBC ) .
CouchDB as the database for the Web
CouchDB is especially interesting because it 's so easy to get going with it .
Relational databases are easy too , but what 's nice about this database is how you can embrace its API if you already have some familiarity with , say , using a Web browser .
What 's more , because of CouchDB 's RESTful API , you can communicate with it via cool frameworks like HTTPBuilder 's RESTClient .
You are n't limited to HTTPBuilder either ; a number of Java libraries try to make working with CouchDB easier .
One that is especially promising is jcouchdb ( see Related topics ) , which shields you from the RESTful - ness and JSON - ness of it all and allows you to work programmatically in the Java language with documents and views .
Stay tuned for next month 's column , where I 'll return to Google App Engine .
True to the spirit of open innovation , new frameworks are popping up that facilitate Google App Engine development and deployment .
You 'll see how one of them makes Java development 2.0 on Google 's cloud platform even easier .

Conservative climate change sceptics are " eccentrics " who will not be allowed to influence the party 's environmental policy , an ally of David Cameron insisted yesterday .
Tim Yeo , the former environment minister , criticised David Davis for writing that targets for cutting carbon emissions were “ destined to collapse ” , and dismissed the former shadow Home Secretary as having “ no authority on this subject ” .
Mr Yeo , who now chairs the Commons Environmental Audit Committee , hit back at Tory critics of Mr Cameron ’s stance on green issues and predicted that climate change sceptics will have disappeared in five years .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Mr Yeo said : “ A significant number of core Conservative voters – mostly among older people – are reluctant to accept the [ climate change ] evidence .
I do n’t think they [ doubting Tory MPs ] will be a significant influence in the next parliament and will gradually diminish in the population .
“ The dying gasps of the deniers will be put to bed .
In five years time , no one will argue about [ there being ] a man-made contribution to climate change . ”
He declared that Mr Cameron would head a “ green ” government after the general election and would not water down his commitment to the environment .
Mr Davis yesterday called for a new “ middle way ” approach to global warming in an article in The Independent which highlighted Tory divisions ahead of next week ’s crucial Copenhagen summit .
In the Commons , Gordon Brown made a thinly - veiled attack on Mr Davis .
He said intermediate targets that major countries were set to propose should be “ sufficiently ambitious ” to achieve at least a 50 per cent cut in global carbon emissions by 2050 .
He added : “ I hope that despite doubts expressed from some parts of the Opposition , that there will be all - party support for that deal . ”
Labour challenged
Tory sceptics to reveal whether they had financial links to the oil industry .
It claimed that two of the most prominent Tory doubters , the former Cabinet ministers Lord Lawson of Blaby and Peter Lilley , had such links .
Lord Lawson has “ significant shareholdings ” in the Central Europe Trust , whose clients include Total Fina Elf , Royal Dutch / Shell Group , Texaco , and BP Amaco .
He is also chairman of the Global Warming Policy Foundation , whose “ primary purpose is to help restore balance and trust in the climate debate that is frequently distorted by prejudice and exaggeration ” .
The group shares a London office with the Institute of Materials , Minerals and Mining .

Mr Lilley is a non-executive director of Tethys Petroleum Limited , an oil and gas exploration company .
There is no suggestion that their actions in Parliament were influenced by their business interest and Tory sources said the two former ministers had a long track record of questioning the science of climate change .
Labour MP Emily Thornberry MP said : “ Behind David Cameron ’s photo - ops on the arctic ice , the Tory Party has n’t changed – climate change deniers , big oil men and non-doms can still happily take high profile positions .
“ Nigel Lawson and Peter Lilley have vocally denied the danger posed by climate change ; both appear to have lucrative links to the oil industry .
I am writing to both Lord Lawson and Peter Lilley to ask them to clarify whether their connections to the oil industry have any bearing on their statements in Parliament and the media . ”
Mr Yeo said : “ David Davis is not an authority on this subject .
If he says something about immigration or policing , we might need to pay some attention to that . ”
He added : “ We need some sort of spur for action .
Although targets are far from perfect , they are a necessary part of that .
We also need emissions and trading and performance standards for power stations and car engines .
But without them [ targets ] there would not be enough pressure on governments , businesses and individuals . ”
In a report yesterday , the all - party committee said the emissions cuts to be discussed in Copenhagen still only give the world a 50 - 50 chance of avoiding dangerous levels of climate change .
Negotiators should aim for more stringent cuts , it said .
Ed Miliband MP , the Energy and Climate Change Secretary , said : “ The true face of the Tory party is on show .
No amount of riding around with huskies can conceal the fact that the Conservative Party has closed its ears to the science .
David Cameron might cycle for the cameras – but his party is chugging off in the other direction in a fleet of gas guzzlers . ”

BBC News , Venezuela
The Yanomami live in the border region between Venezuela and Brazil Swine flu has killed seven members of an endangered Amazonian tribe , an indigenous rights organisation says .
Survival International said several hundred members of the Yanomami tribe in Venezuela could be infected .
The Venezuelan government has yet to confirm the deaths but said that a team was in the region to investigate .
An outbreak among the isolated tribes of the Amazon could spread among the indigenous population very quickly and kill many , campaigners fear .
Survival International , a London - based organisation , says it may already be happening among the Yanomami in the border region between Venezuela and Brazil .
The organisation 's director , Stephen Corry , says the situation is " critical " and is calling for Venezuela and Brazil to take immediate action to halt the epidemic .
YANOMAMI INDIANS Estimated 32,000 remain Live in communities up to 400 Venezuelan Yanomami live in a 8.2 million hectare ( 20.2 million acre ) forest reserve Thousands of illegal gold miners have infiltrated the reserve Source : survivalinternational.org
They also needed to radically improve the Yanomami 's access to healthcare , he said .
A member of the regional government 's medical team told the BBC swine flu was the suspected cause of the deaths of a pregnant woman and three small children .
The Yanomami have been hurt by epidemics in the past , particularly when influenza and malaria were brought by miners in the 1980s .
Survival International estimate that as much as a fifth of the community was killed during that period and that the Yanomami population has fallen to about 32,000 .

" Daala has no political motives — she just wants to destroy things . "
― Han Solo [ src ]
Natasi Daala was a Human female who became the first woman to reach the rank of admiral in the Imperial Navy , and later was named Chief of State of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances .
Born on Irmenu but raised on Botajef , Daala enlisted in the Imperial Navy on Carida , but was discriminated against due to her gender .
However , she achieved success thanks to Moff Wilhuff Tarkin , who discovered her after she defeated many skilled Imperial opponents in simulated battles , using an alias to hide her true identity .
Tarkin took her under his wing , and as he rose in the ranks , so did she .
She became his lover and was eventually promoted to admiral by him .
Shortly after , she was sent to oversee the top- secret Imperial research facility known as the Maw Installation .
There , some of the best scientists in the galaxy worked on new concepts , designing superweapons for the Empire .
She resided there with four Imperial I - class Star Destroyers for eleven years , unaware of what was happening in the galaxy .
In 11 ABY , Kyp Durron , Han Solo , and Chewbacca stumbled upon the facility after making an emergency escape from Kessel .
She interrogated them , and was stunned to learn that Tarkin and Emperor Palpatine were dead and the Empire was on the verge of collapse , having been defeated by the Rebel Alliance .
She decided to launch her campaign to wreak havoc on the galaxy and gain revenge for Tarkin 's death , with her four Star Destroyers and the Sun Crusher superweapon .
However , the Sun Crusher was stolen from her by Solo and his two companions , who were also able to warn the New Republic of Daala 's existence .
Ultimately , Daala accomplished little , and with three of her Star Destroyers destroyed , headed back to the Maw to try to protect it from the New Republic .
There , she found New Republic forces , who attacked her fleet .
Though she managed to destroy the Installation , preventing the New Republic from gaining new weapons , her Star Destroyer was damaged and she made an emergency hyperspace jump .
In 12 ABY , Daala attempted to unify the Imperial warlords , but found little success .
She executed them , then took command of their forces .
She once again attempted to destroy the New Republic , this time with the aid of Vice Admiral Gilad Pellaeon .
However , she was defeated , and relinquished command to Pellaeon , resigning from the military .
A year later , she re-appeared to aid the New Republic against the corrupt Moff Tol Getelles , then disappeared , swearing she was done with military service .
It was at this time that Daala was reunited with her former lover Liegeus Vorn ; the two married and later had a son .
In 17 ABY she once again attacked the New Republic , but was defeated .
The New Republic believed she was dead , but Daala stunned them when , in 40 ABY , she revealed herself to the galaxy once more .
Commander of the Maw Irregular Fleet , she split from the Imperial Remnant to join the Mandalorians and fight against Darth Caedus , the despotic leader of the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances .
Following the death of Caedus , she became the new Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance .
After attempting to fix what Caedus had done , she displayed a strong anti-Jedi sentiment , exiling Luke Skywalker as part of a backlash against the Jedi .
However , after she ordered a siege of the Jedi Temple and entered a severe dispute with the acting Grand Master , Kenth Hamner , her actions caused her to be perceived more negatively by the public and viewed as a tyrant by the Jedi .
Unable to handle her increasingly extreme policies , a group of Jedi led a coup to depose her .
Sent to prison , Daala was able to escape from confinement with the help of the bounty hunter Boba Fett and began to plan her revenge on those who had removed her from power .
Thanks to Boba Fett 's intelligence , Daala blackmailed several members of the Council of Moffs to join her in overthrowing Head of State Jagged Fel and taking control of the Imperial Remnant .
However , the betrayal of Moff Tol Getelles and the arrival of Empire of the Hand ships to support Fel forced Daala into a siege at Exodo II .
As Daala and Fel faced off , political instability erupted in the Remnant and , under the advice of Lieutenant Lydea Pagorski , Daala offered to compete with Fel in a general election for Head of State .
Daala campaigned against Fel and Admiral Vitor Reige .
Despite Fel 's withdrawal , Reige defeated Daala , ending her ambitions .

Biography Edit
Early life and career Edit
" They always said that Daala tore up the strategy books . "
― Admiral Cha Niathal [ src ]
Born to Human parents on Irmenu , a feudal , oceanic planet located in the Belsmuth sector of the Outer Rim Territories , Natasi Daala hailed from a princely family .
When she was still an infant , rivals of Daala 's family managed to overrun and seize their holdings .
While the rest of Daala 's family was put to death , a younger son of the rival family took pity on Natasi and smuggled her offworld .
Daala's benefactor left her on Botajef at an orphanage [ 11 ] owned by COMPNOR and run by Renatasian nuns , where she was then raised .
[ 1 ]
When she was young , Daala fell in love with the holo faker Liegeus Vorn .
However , feeling a need for a sense of duty , she enrolled in the Academy of Carida to serve the Empire , and so left Vorn . [ 7 ]
In 3 BBY , Daala was accepted into the Academy of Carida due to her skill in competitive sports and unarmed combat .
Her violent performance in shockball often left her opponents in need of bacta treatment and was perceived as a trait that could be channeled into close combat training .
She was initially selected for training as a stormtrooper , and her instructor , Visk , believed that Daala could serve as an ideal clone template if he could break her will through discipline .
However , simulator tests during Daala 's basic training showed that her approach to contact sports was also effective when applied to simulations of capital ship combat .
[ 1 ]
While she was a talented student and officer at the Imperial Academy , she was continually passed over for promotion due to her gender , though accounts by Imperial military officers said that she argued too much .
To take out her frustrations toward the male - dominated military , she made herself a false computer identity . [ 12 ]
With her false identity , Daala remotely played simulations on the Caridan computer networks , defeating the best opponents repeatedly .
Her tactics included variations on the zero- gravity fighting routines and space maneuvers developed by General Jan Dodonna .
Even though her identity remained a mystery , copies of her battle simulations were distributed to starships throughout the Imperial Navy for study . [ 13 ]
Chief Instructor Massimo
Tagge eventually investigated Daala 's work and , upon discovering her identity , promptly transferred her from Visk to his own naval officer cadet program .
[ 1 ]
As a cadet , Daala pushed herself to her physical and mental limits and excelled in every curriculum , destroying entire navies in war games . [ 14 ]
Daala thrived under Tagge 's guidance , heading the fleet simulation rankings for her year and producing a number of well - received tactical papers in which she analyzed the Tarkin Doctrine .
However , other instructors –including , but not limited to , friends of Visk–raised complaints , warning that Daala always achieved her simulated victories with brute force and heavy losses and that she relied too heavily on logistical superiority .
Tagge attempted to place Daala in the command class , but was overruled in her final semester .
Daala was reassigned as a datapad assistant [ 1 ] and then as a galley yeoman . [ 6 ]
She graduated from the Academy , but ended up a non-commissioned officer in the Imperial Army [ 12 ] tasked with rudimentary administrative assignments [ 2 ] and became convinced that she would remain in the position permanently . [ 6 ]
Protégée of Wilhuff Tarkin Edit
" My skills came to the attention of Moff Tarkin , who journeyed to Carida so that he could meet the mysterious individual who had developed such innovative tactics . [… ]
Tarkin was astonished to learn I was a woman and even more astonished to see that I was a lowly corporal working in the kitchen . "
― Natasi Daala , to Vice - Admiral Pellaeon [ src ]
Massimo Tagge had forwarded Daala 's analysis of the Tarkin Doctrine to his cousin Cassio , who in turn sent it to Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin himself . [ 6 ]
Daala 's radical ideas and strategies captured Tarkin 's attention , [ 14 ] and he traveled to Carida with the intention of meeting whoever was responsible for her exploits .
Over a period of several months , he employed two black - market slicers who eventually uncovered the network hiding place Daala had used . [ 13 ]
He was pleasantly surprised to discover her true identity .
At the time , Daala held the rank of corporal and had first been a computer clerk , then a member of the kitchen staff preparing food for Star Destroyers . [ 4 ]
The Caridan officials reacted with outrage and embarrassment to the news of Daala 's exposure and planned to assign her to an isolated meteorological station on the world 's southern polar ice cap , but Tarkin became aware of their disregard for Daala 's talents and took her offworld . [ 13 ]
Tarkin reassigned Daala to his personal staff in the Outer Rim , and under his supervision , she became a commander , then a captain .
She absorbed all that Tarkin taught her and came to analyze every situation in terms of how Tarkin might respond to it . [ 14 ]
Tarkin eventually promoted Daala to the rank of admiral in an unofficial act outside of Coruscant 's naval hierarchy that was nevertheless legitimate among Tarkin 's forces in the Outer Rim , [ 2 ] making her one of the only females to reach the rank in the Imperial Navy ; [ 14 ] in later years , her rank badge would come to represent the rank of Grand Moff . [ 15 ]
Many quietly complained that Daala was sleeping her way to the top .
When one of those remarks made its way back to Tarkin , he searched out the officer who had made it .
He had the officer sealed inside an environmental suit and ejected him into the space over a planet as punishment .
Tarkin had the suit 's radio left on so that others could hear the man over the course of 24 hours as his orbit decayed .
The officer 's orbit decayed to the point where he finally entered the planet 's atmosphere and burned up upon reentry .
However , the allegations were in fact partly accurate , as Daala did have an affair with Tarkin . [ 12 ]
The initiative in the relationship , which began while Daala and Tarkin were still on Carida , was usually attributed to Tarkin , but Tarkin 's own fragmented memoirs suggested that Daala , still a teenager at the time , took the lead . [ 6 ]
Command of Maw Installation Edit
" I am Admiral Daala , in charge of the fleet guarding Maw Installation .
You three are in a lot of trouble . "
― Natasi Daala , to Han Solo following the capture of Endor [ src ]
To keep Daala hidden from other Imperial leaders , [ 14 ]
Tarkin entrusted her with overseeing and protecting the Maw Installation , the birthplace of the Death Stars , World Devastators , and the Sun Crusher .
This facility was hidden away even from the rest of the Empire , and a fleet of four Imperial - class Star Destroyers — the Basilisk , Gorgon , Hydra , and Manticore — was stationed there .
Daala herself received the Gorgon as her flagship , with Commander Kratas as her senior subordinate .
She was to protect the facility in the unexpected event of attack , keeping the top - secret designs , as well as the scientists such as Qwi Xux and Tol Sivron , safe .
[ 5 ]
Very few , save for Emperor Palpatine , knew about this facility , [ 16 ] though Daala believed that even Palpatine was unaware of the Maw .
After having her promoted to admiral , Tarkin ordered Daala never to abandon her post or break communication silence unless he returned , as she had no authority outside Tarkin 's command .
[ 5 ]
However , Tarkin did recall her from the Maw on several occasions , and she was present with Tarkin on the planet Alderaan around 7 BBY when he had a meeting with the planet 's senator , Bail Organa . [ 17 ] [ 18 ]
Around 0 BBY Daala was stationed at the Maw while Tarkin was on board the Death Star , a massive superweapon being constructed above the planet Despayre .
Tarkin had ordered Daala to never leave , but he found himself breaking his own rule when he summoned her from the installation .
Tarkin contacted her via holocomm , and informed her that he wished she join him on the station .
Daala eagerly agreed and hurried to fly to Despayre .
When she arrived , she met Tarkin in the docking bay and the two headed to her quarters .
Daala later witnessed Tarkin question Admiral Motti after the Undauntable , a Star Destroyer under the command of the respected Admiral Jaim Helaw , exploded seemingly at random .
Tarkin was clueless as to who the guilty party was . [ 16 ]
Daala later showed Tarkin a video she had obtained from the security cameras after hacking into Tarkin 's files .
This video showed an unidentified being planting an explosive in a cargo container at the Gall Imperial Regional Naval Supply Area .
As this facility had a reputation for extreme security , the two of them began to believe it was an inside job .
However , they still did not know the identity of the bomber .
Tarkin gave her the task of determining who had set the bomb , although Daala was unable to learn anything and headed back to the Maw , with plans to return soon . [ 16 ]
When she returned a short time afterward , her Star Destroyer entered in a battle zone .
A Rebel Lucrehulk - class battleship named the Fortressa had appeared and released 500 X - wings .
The Death Star 's superlaser made short work of the ship , and the station 's TIE pilots easily defeated the fighters .
However , during the battle Daala was injured , suffering a head injury when her Star Destroyer was hit .
She was taken to the Death Star , where she was operated on by doctors Kornell Divini , Abu Banu and Roa.
Daala survived , but she had memory loss , forgetting the events of the past year .
Tarkin sent her back to the Maw after carefully erasing all records of her presence .
Unknown to Daala , after Divini experienced a change of heart about the Empire and decided to defect , he used her for his cover , claiming that the shuttle he was on was going to pick up Daala , whom he said had been wounded in battle . [ 16 ]
Immediately prior to his departure to the completed Death Star , Tarkin ordered Daala to maintain communications silence within the Maw and await his return .
[ 2 ]
The Death Star was destroyed at the Battle of Yavin not long afterward , killing Tarkin .
However , Daala remained unaware of this .
For eleven more years she waited patiently to hear from Tarkin , while the scientists continued research and development on a variety of weapons .
Daala kept her crew battle ready with many drills , ensuring that when Tarkin finally did contact her , she and her soldiers would be ready . [ 5 ]
Revealed to the galaxy Edit
" If Solo is telling the truth , then my fleet could be the most powerful remnant of the Imperial Navy .
We can't just wait here any longer .
Now it 's our turn to show them what we can do . "
― Natasi Daala , to Tol Sivron [ src ]
In 11 ABY , Han Solo , Chewbacca , and Kyp Durron escaped from the prison planet Kessel and accidentally discovered the Maw Installation .
Since they were in an Imperial shuttle , which they called the Endor , Daala 's crew assumed they were an emissary sent by Tarkin , who had not communicated with them in over a decade .
However , when they provided an incorrect code , Daala captured and imprisoned them .
Daala then proceeded to torture Han Solo in a torture chair to learn what had happened to the Empire , Solo then informed her of the events of the Galactic Civil War .
Daala learned for the first time about the destruction of the Death Stars and the deaths of Emperor Palpatine , Darth Vader , and Grand Moff Tarkin .
She also learned that the Empire had fragmented into numerous squabbling warlords .
With no true high command in place , and with Tarkin dead , Daala decided that her orders were obsolete and planned to leave the Maw to wage her own personal guerrilla war against the Rebels .
As vengeance to the three who had informed her of this dire situation , Daala planned to execute Durron and keep Solo and Chewbacca as prisoners .
Having drilled her troops ceaselessly over the past decade , Daala knew that her forces were ready and fit for such a war , and prepared to leave the Maw .
However , her plans were set back when her prisoners , aided by disillusioned Maw researcher Qwi Xux , escaped with the Sun Crusher . [ 5 ]
Though she attempted to suppress the Sun Crusher with sheer numbers , the near - indestructible superweapon was too durable and Daala was unable to damage it .
In order to escape Daala , Han Solo piloted the Sun Crusher towards the Hydra , and plowed straight through its command bridge .
The Sun Crusher then entered hyperspace , as the Hydra plummeted into a black hole .
[ 5 ]
Enraged by the loss of one of her Star Destroyers , Daala pursued the diminutive superweapon out of the Maw , and ran into Kessel administrator Moruth Doole 's small mercenary fleet .
Doole 's fleet panicked and fired on Daala 's ships .
Daala soundly defeated them with minor losses , yet the pain of the Hydra 's loss still lingered with her . [ 5 ]
Nevertheless , Daala continued on , undaunted , and began raiding New Republic shipping .
Daala intercepted a CR90 corvette on its way to a colony on Dantooine .
After interrogating the ship 's Sullustan captain , Daala 's crew found heavy weaponry and equipment for starfighter hangars .
Daala determined that the colony was probably a Rebel base , and then released the corvette long enough for it to make an emergency transmission to the New Republic .
This way , the New Republic would be aware of her , and , Daala hoped , the knowledge of her attacks would incite chaos and panic .
After the transmission was made , she destroyed the corvette and proceeded on to Dantooine .
There , Daala sent six AT - ATs to deal with the colony , which was quickly destroyed . [ 19 ]
After the attack on Dantooine , Daala 's fleet received intelligence from an old Imperial probe droid .
This information relayed to Daala the existence of the Mon Calamari shipyards that were important to the New Republic 's navy .
To Daala , Mon Calamari was as good of a target as any .
If the shipyards were destroyed , it would be detrimental to the New Republic .
With this new information , Daala decided to attack Mon Calamari .
Using one of Tarkin's old strategies , Daala sent the Gorgon and the Basilisk in to fire on the surface of the planet , while the Manticore sat in the darkness of Mon Calamari 's moon .
In this way , Daala thought she could divert forces away from the shipyards and give the Manticore a clear run at them .
Although she was initially successful , a former Mon Calamari admiral in the New Republic fleet , Ackbar , recognized Daala 's tactic immediately , having been Tarkin 's personal slave .
Using a partially finished Mon Cal cruiser , Ackbar sent the ship on a collision with the Manticore , resulting in a second ship from Daala 's dwindling fleet being destroyed .
Enraged , Daala ordered a full - scale assault on the planet 's surface , destroying several of its floating cities .
She then fled before New Republic reinforcements could arrive . [ 19 ]
Following her defeat at Mon Calamari , Daala retreated to the Cauldron Nebula .
She planned to go down fighting , striking a fatal blow against the New Republic by evacuating one of her two remaining Star Destroyers of personnel and equipment , and sending it crashing down onto the surface of Coruscant .
This last desperate plan was again met with defeat when rogue Jedi Kyp Durron , piloting the Sun Crusher , delayed Daala 's operation by attacking her ship .
Daala realized it was just a distraction , and that Durron had already ignited the stars in the nebula with the Sun Crusher 's resonance torpedos .
She ordered all ships to immediately jump into hyperspace , hoping they could get out before the stars exploded .
However , only the Gorgon escaped , as the Basilisk was incinerated by the explosion . [ 19 ]
Weary of her continuous failed efforts , Daala realized that her selfish and petty desire to do harm to the Rebels had caused the death of the thousands she had been entrusted to lead and protect .
She decided to return with the Gorgon to the Maw Installation , vowing to return to Tarkin 's assigned mission , and defend it to the death . [ 20 ]
Return to the Maw Edit
" Redouble our efforts against the Installation .
Let us show Tol Sivron how it must be done .
It 's time to destroy Maw Installation once and for all .
Open fire ! " ― Natasi Daala , to Commander Kratas [ src ]
What she found there , however , was total chaos .
The New Republic had already moved to seize Maw Installation , while Tol Sivron and the remaining scientists had sabotaged the facility and absconded with the prototype Death Star , a test version of the battlestation Tarkin had commanded .
Both Daala and Sivron decided to attack the occupied facility , though Sivron struggled to get the Death Star 's superlaser online .
With her crew still faithfully following her lead despite her many defeats , Daala joined the fray , deciding that she would rather destroy the Maw Installation than see it in Rebel hands .
She was able to use Sivron 's outdated codes to gain access to and download the contents of Maw Installation 's mainframe , which contained an abundance of designs and schematics of advanced weaponry [ 20 ] that Daala would later use during the Second Galactic Civil War . [ 21 ]
With the Maw Installation 's secrets safely in her possession , Daala and her battered Star Destroyer moved to destroy the facility once and for all .
During her attack , Daala 's crew noticed that the facility had an unstable reactor core and , determining that it was the best way to dispatch the facility , fired upon it .
As the facility exploded with tremendous force , Daala made a hasty jump into hyperspace and narrowly escaped the Maw .
Bearing nearly irreparable scars from the battle , the Gorgon set course for the splintered Empire in the Deep Core . [ 20 ]
The reunification of the Empire Edit
" I did n't want to rule .
I had no intention of becoming a political leader — but you have given me no choice .
I cannot leave the Empire in the hands of fools like you . "
― Natasi Daala to other Galactic Imperial warlords at Tsoss Beacon [ src ]
The remnants of the Imperial command dismantled the Gorgon and distributed her surviving crew among the various commanders .
Daala chose not to join with anyone , instead serving as a roaming ambassador amongst the warlords in an attempt to unify them .
During a meeting with the self - proclaimed Supreme Warlord Blitzer Harrsk in 12 ABY , High Admiral Treuten Teradoc attacked Harrsk 's orbiting fleet of twelve Star Destroyers .
Teradoc 's fleet of Victory - class Star Destroyers destroyed Harrsk 's flagship , the Shockwave .
Daala 's second - in - command , Commander Kratas , was on board the Shockwave inspecting its bridge at the time of its destruction .
His death caused Daala great emotional pain and led her to resolve to stop the senseless , inter - warlord feuding at all costs . [ 12 ]
However , desperate to avenge his lost flagship , Harrsk wanted an immediate reprisal against Teradoc and pressed Daala into service on the threat of death .
Daala reluctantly took control of the Imperial II - class Star Destroyer Firestorm .
Harrsk , in the Whirlwind , insisted that Daala lead the attack against Teradoc .
When they arrived at Teradoc 's stronghold , which was hidden among the asteroids in the ring of a gas giant , they were set upon by Teradoc 's fleet .
Daala , however , personally took command of her ship 's weapon systems and fired a concentrated ion bolt at the Whirlwind , paralyzing it and preventing Harrsk from continuing his assault against Teradoc .
With a blaster aimed at a shocked and angry bridge crew , Daala pulled the Firestorm closer to the Whirlwind and activated the time - delayed self destruct system of the Firestorm .
Daala told Harrsk that she would destroy her ship and his if he did not order a cessation of hostilities , wishing to force the two warlords to cooperate .
As the countdown continued , Daala was contacted by the head of the Crimson Command , Vice Admiral Gilad Pellaeon , who desired to speak to Daala in person .
Daala accepted and allowed Pellaeon onto her ship .
Shortly after , Harrsk ordered a cessation of hostilities , as he was convinced that Daala was not bluffing . [ 12 ]
The Firestorm , escorted by two of Pellaeon 's red Star Destroyers , jumped to a secluded spot in space so that Daala and Pellaeon could have an uninterrupted discussion .
Like Daala , Pellaeon believed that the warlords were tearing the Empire apart , and he and Daala agreed to force the 13 most powerful warlords to a negotiating table in order to discuss the future of the Empire and plan a combined attack against the New Republic .
They finally were able to get the warlords to congregate at Tsoss Beacon , an asteroid containing an Imperial base .
Daala made the warlords leave their fleets behind , much to their displeasure .
Though she attempted to motivate the Imperial warlords to fight together and crush the New Republic , they spent hours arguing instead , refusing to agree on anything .
It became clear that none of them would ally with each other , and so , after hours of petty squabbling , Daala decided that the negotiations were a failure .
She sealed the room and filled the chamber with gas , a contingency plan she had developed earlier .
Only Daala and Pellaeon survived the poisonous gas , utilizing gas mask - like membranes that Daala had taken into the meeting in case she decided to use her plan to execute the warlords . [ 12 ]
With the warlords out of the way , Daala set about uniting their now - leaderless forces .
Last of all , Daala visited the fortress of Delvardus .
Delvardus ' second - in - command , Colonel Ivan Cronus , agreed to join Daala , handing her control of Delvardus ' latest creation , the Super Star Destroyer Night Hammer .
With the Night Hammer under her command , Daala quickly rallied the scattered remnants of the Empire , making her in the eyes of many the founder of the modern Imperial Remnant .
She then named herself the Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet , with Pellaeon as her second - in - command .
Daala began to prepare a full - on assault against the New Republic . [ 12 ]
Assault on the Jedi Praxeum Edit
" In light of this disaster , I - I hereby resign my rank … and hand over command of all Imperial forces to you .
I will be happy to follow your orders and assist with rebuilding the Empire in any way possible , but I feel that I am no longer capable of commanding so many worthy soldiers .
They can not be asked to lay their lives on the line , to swear allegiance to someone who has been beaten so many times . "
― Natasi Daala , to Vice Admiral Pellaeon [ src ]
Daala instituted societal reforms in the Imperial military , ending decades of prejudice against women and nonhumans , but moreover vitalizing the decaying fleet with new recruits .
She created a massive buildup in preparation for a planned strike at the New Republic .
With her fleet ready , Daala and Pellaeon planned an attack on a planet they knew they could win , Yavin 4 , the home of the Jedi Praxeum .
Knowing she would be fighting the Jedi Knights , Daala added a " k " to her flagship 's name , making it the Knight Hammer , as a pun .
Daala 's preparations were interrupted when two Jedi , Kyp Durron and Dorsk 81 , were discovered in a crowd of Imperials during one of Daala 's speeches .
The Jedi fought their way out of the crowd and escaped before Daala could marshal her forces against them .
Furious , Daala had their escape vector traced to a planet called Khomm in the Deep Core . [ 12 ]
Daala sent Pellaeon and a group of Imperial Star Destroyers to Yavin 4 for an attack on the Jedi Praxeum .
She planned to follow shortly after Pellaeon , while Cronus , in command of a fleet of Victory - class Star Destroyers , including Pellaeon 's previous flagship , the 13X , struck at Khomm and several other strategic targets .
Cronus ravaged Khomm , and after bombarding the other planets , headed for Yavin IV . [ 12 ]
Then , according to plan Daala arrived in - system after the enemy had been weakened .
However , when the Knight Hammer arrived at Yavin 4 , Pellaeon 's fleet was nowhere to be found , despite sensor readings showing that troops had already been deployed by his fleet .
Enraged , Daala launched a vicious bombardment against the jungle moon .
Soon after , a YT - 1300 light freighter , the Millennium Falcon , arrived at Yavin and landed on the moon despite Daala 's attempt to stop it .
It then returned to space after picking up several passengers , with its captain , none other than Han Solo from the Maw debacle , boldly taunting her .
Daala sent out several TIE squadrons against the Falcon , and with such odds arrayed against Solo , death seemed inevitable .
However , another unforeseen event occurred : Ackbar , the admiral who defeated her at Mon Calamari a year before , arrived in - system with the Mon Calamari cruiser Galactic Voyager and four Corellian corvettes .
Suddenly , Colonel Cronus arrived in system with a portion of his Victory - class Star Destroyer fleet .
Both Daala and Cronus attacked the New Republic fleet .
Daala eventually destroyed the corvettes and damaged the Voyager , but once again , Daala 's luck changed for the worse .
A damaged corvette crashed into the 13X , destroying the ship and killing Cronus .
Angered , Daala continued firing on the Voyager , destroying its shields .
The New Republic was aided by the sudden appearance of several Victory - class Star Destroyers , but was still outnumbered .
Daala then received news that Pellaeon 's fleet had been located on the outskirts of the system .
The Vice Admiral claimed that Jedi sorcery was responsible for him not being present at the battle .
Nonetheless , Daala was still confident her forces would win .
Suddenly , several explosions were set off on the Knight Hammer , destroying the engine units .
The immobile Star Destroyer then began to drift towards the gas giant Yavin , pulled in by its immense gravitational field .
Accepting defeat , Daala ordered an immediate evacuation of the ship .
Before Daala managed to get to her executive escape pod , she was intercepted by Jedi Knight Callista Ming , who was responsible for the crippling of the Knight Hammer .
Daala and Callista engaged in a short fire - fight before Daala shot her opponent with a stun blast .
She then left Callista for dead and escaped from the dying wake of the Knight Hammer .
By the time Daala 's pod was recovered by Pellaeon , she had realized that her quest for vengeance against the New Republic had put too many loyal Imperials in danger .
Daala promoted Pellaeon to the rank of Admiral and relinquished her title of Supreme Commander to him , apparently resigning from Imperial service for good . [ 12 ]
Later life Edit
In 13 ABY , the droids C - 3PO and R2 - D2 encountered Daala on Cybloc XII .
Following her retirement from Imperial service , Daala had become the leader of a group of settlers .
She had made a deal with an Imperial Moff to settle down on Pedducis Chorios along with the thousands of colonists .
However , when she arrived she found the planet virtually abandoned .
Daala tortured the droids , who revealed that the Death Seed plague had struck the planet , wiping out all beings there .
The droids also told her that the plague had been released as part of a plan by the Loronar Corporation , ex-Senator Seti Ashgad — who had been exiled to Nam Chorios decades ago by Palpatine — and the corrupt Moff Tol Getelles . [ 7 ]
After learning this , she decided to fight against Getelles and Loronar , even though it meant aiding the New Republic .
And so , fighting alongside the government she had once hated , Daala went to battle .
The New Republic succeeded in defeating Getelles and containing the Death Seed , thanks in part to Daala .
Daala was prepared to negotiate a peace treaty with the New Republic .
Shortly before negotiations could begin , she encountered her old flame Liegeus Vorn .
Following a negotiation , Daala and Vorn returned to Peduccis Chorios together . [ 7 ]
Allowed to leave in peace by the New Republic , Daala returned to the Deep Core , assumed leadership of the " replacement warlords " who succeeded those she had killed a year earlier , and built up the military forces of the region 's warlords , receiving a significant boost after the conclusion of the Yevetha crisis in the form of defectors from the Imperial Black Fleet . [ 22 ]
Daala united the squabbling factions under warlords including Foga Brill and Moff Jmanuel Tethys and prepared to strike once more at the New Republic .
The forces of the Imperial Remnant were preparing for a grand pincer campaign , with Admiral Pellaeon moving coreward from the Outer Rim , and Daala and the new Deep Core warlords moving out from the Deep Core .
Daala 's campaign was unfocused as each warlord headed his own attacks against the New Republic .
Because of the unfocused nature of her campaign , Daala did not have much success against the New Republic .
In 17 ABY , she attacked the New Republic in the Deep Core .
Her ships were trapped by General Garm Bel Iblis in a pair of CC - 7000 gravity well frigates .
Desperate , she had one of her ships ram one of the enemy CC - 7000s , destroying it .
Daala then made a blind hyperspace jump .
Despite being presumed killed , New Republic Intelligence consistently refused to remove her name from the list of potential threats . [ 23 ]
Though many believed she was dead , New Republic Intelligence was right in their worst - case scenario assumption that she had survived .
Daala had fled the Deep Core and returned to the Maw .
The Maw Installation was rebuilt and Daala established a small colony to live there under her command .
Daala and her lover Vorn had a son , who would later have a daughter .
Daala also built up a small fleet , named the Maw Irregular , which was armed with a variety of weapons designed by the Maw scientists themselves .
During the Yuuzhan Vong War , in which extra-galactic aliens waged war on the galaxy , she helped out planets in need of aid , although word of this never spread to the New Republic 's ears .
Sometime after the Battle of Bastion in 28 ABY , Daala acquired the Chimaera , an Imperial Star Destroyer that had served as the flagship of the legendary Grand Admiral Thrawn 20 years earlier .
In 35 ABY , Vorn was killed by the Moffs in an attempt to assassinate Daala .
Though Daala survived , she lost one eye in the incident and swore revenge for the death of her love . [ 21 ]
Second Galactic Civil War Edit
" You called .
I promised you I 'd always come if you used that code , just like Darakaer . "
― Natasi Daala to Gilad Pellaeon [ src ]
In 40 ABY , the Second Galactic Civil War broke out .
The Galactic Alliance , which had replaced the New Republic following the Yuuzhan Vong War , was in conflict with a group of rebel planets known as the Confederation .
The Jedi Order had left the Galactic Alliance in protest of Chief of State Jacen Solo , now the Sith Lord Darth Caedus .
Gilad Pellaeon , leader of the Imperial Remnant , which had signed a peace treaty with the Alliance decades earlier , was contacted by Caedus , who was seeking an alliance with the Imperials , who still possessed a formidable fleet .
Pellaeon , who did not approve of Caedus ' actions , declined his offer .
However , he was troubled , and so decided to contact Daala , whom he had not seen in over 25 years . [ 21 ]
Using a code known as the Darakaer code after an old Irmenu folk hero , Pellaeon sent a message to Daala , who received his message , and came to his aid .
She met him on board his new flagship , the Bloodfin .
Daala informed Pellaeon of how she had survived and what she had been doing , and more while the two talked about Caedus ' offer and the current situation in the galaxy .
Both believed Caedus had no business in politics and needed to be knocked down a peg . [ 21 ]
Following her discussion with Pellaeon , Daala contacted the famed bounty hunter Boba Fett , who was not surprised to learn that she had survived .
Daala offered him a bounty , this one aimed at Caedus .
Fett mulled over the offer , promising to get back to her .
A short time later , Pellaeon took his fleet to Fondor , prepared to aid Caedus in the upcoming battle , where the Alliance was attempting to conquer the shipbuilding world .
However , when Caedus and forces loyal to him attacked co-Chief of State Cha Niathal 's ships in an attempt to gain sole control of the government , Pellaeon decided to support Niathal .
He never had the chance .
Tahiri Veila , Caedus ' apprentice , aided by several traitorous Moffs , killed Pellaeon .
Most of the Imperial fleet was now under the control of Darth Caedus . [ 21 ]
It was then that Admiral Daala arrived .
Her fleet , the Maw Irregular , jumped out of hyperspace , surprising Caedus .
The fleet was composed of many " ancient " ships , such as a Venator - class Star Destroyer and Assassin - class corvettes .
The lead ship was the Chimaera . [ 21 ]
Swearing revenge for Pellaeon and Vorn , Daala moved into the battle .
The Chimaera turned towards the Anakin Solo , Caedus ' flagship .
Prior to the battle , Daala had contacted Fett again , asking him to steal a Star Destroyer for her .
Now , as Fett and his Mandalorian warriors put their plan into action , Daala 's forces engaged the Alliance .
The Chimaera blasted apart the Alliance vessels in her way , using Metal - Crystal Phase Shifters , a weapon that altered the molecular composition of the ships .
This weapon had been developed at the Maw , and believed lost when the installation was damaged decades earlier , although Daala had kept the plans for it .
Now , it made Daala 's older ships a match for Caedus ' newer fleet . [ 21 ]
Thanks to Daala and her fleet , Caedus 's forces lost the battle .
Following the capture of the Bloodfin and slaughter of several Moffs by the Mandalorians , Daala headed to the ship to inspect it and speak with Fett .
After identifying the Moffs and regretting the fact that one of the ones killed by the Mandalorians had been responsible for Vorn 's death , meaning she could n't kill him herself , Daala had a conversation with Fett .
Both expressed the opinion that they were tired of Force - users reigning supreme , and that it only led to turmoil with Caedus turning to politics as the perfect example .
Daala also told Boba
Fett that she had a son and a granddaughter , something that came as a surprise to him .
The two ended their conversation with a toast to Pellaeon , a man who Daala admired for his steadfast loyalty and determination .
Daala later met with Fett in Keldabe , the capital of the planet Mandalore .
The two spoke once more , discussing their personal lives , in which Daala revealed her first name , Natasi . [ 21 ]
Galactic Alliance Chief of State Edit
Early regime ( 41 ABY — 43 ABY ) Edit
" My friends , it is my promise to you here today that sometime in the not - too - distant future , we will live in a galaxy where our space navies exist to better our societies , not defend them — where we wo n't need Jedi to sort out our differences and mete out justice , because we will be living under a government that is just . "
― Newly - appointed Galactic Alliance Chief of State Natasi Daala at the peace ceremony doubling as the end of the Second Galactic Civil War and her inauguration [ src ]
Daala and the Maw Irregular Fleet later took part in such crucial final battles of the war such as the Second Battle of Roche .
There , the fleet was soundly defeated by the Alliance 's Admiral Nek Bwua'tu .
Jacen Solo was soon after killed in a lightsaber duel , and the Alliance joined forces with the Imperial Remnant and the Jedi Coalition .
The Confederation surrendered to the combined strength of its enemies , and the war was brought to a close . [ 9 ]
With Solo dead , Daala was nominated by Bwua 'tu for the position of Galactic Alliance Chief of State , as he did not wish to enter politics .
In lieu of Cha Niathal , Daala was appointed as the only universally accepted choice .
She had some changes to make to the Moff Council as well .
The new council would be composed of an equal amount of females as males , something still unheard of decades after Emperor Palpatine 's death .
In her inaugural address , she promised to do everything she could for peace , with hopes that one day war would not exist , and implied that the Alliance might no longer need the Jedi . [ 9 ]
Daala 's early regime was one of peace , although she was quick to punish law - breakers .
This led to heightened surveillance across the galaxy , even on notorious crime worlds such as Nar Shaddaa .
However , not all was good .
The Mon Calamari were particularly resentful of her being elevated to Chief of State and wanted to try her for war crimes , particularly her attack on their planet .
Daala was also distrustful of the New Jedi Order and had a tense working relationship with Jedi Grand Master Luke Skywalker .
Daala believed that a just and fair government would not need the Jedi Order to police it , and feared that more Jedi would turn to the dark side like Caedus , preventing the galaxy from ever having a lasting peace .
She also increased the role and reach of the Mandalorians , whom she brought into the Galactic Alliance as elite security operatives and intelligence specialists .
Luke Skywalker feared that she wanted to increase the power and resources of the Mandalorians in case she needed to use them against the Jedi , such as when she dispatched a team of Mandalorians to track down the rogue Jedi Seff Hellin — much to the dismay and concern of Skywalker , who was having trouble getting her to accept that the Jedi were self - policing .
She later ordered that Luke Skywalker be arrested for dereliction of duty after he called all Jedi back to the Jedi Temple . [ 24 ]
A career officer herself , Daala restored strength and responsiveness to a military devastated by a destructive civil war that saw many a promising career ruined .
Indeed , within the first two years of her administration Daala 's improvements to the military had exceeded analyst expectations . [ 25 ]
With the dissolution of Darth Caedus 's Galactic Alliance Guard following the end of the war , Daala created a replacement security force known as Galactic Alliance Security .
In 43 ABY , Daala invited Imperial and Confederation leaders to Coruscant to negotiate the terms of unification .
The Senate Unification Preparations Committee , led by Bothan Senator Tiurrg Drey'lye , was set up by the Chief of State to prepare for the summit .
During the summit , it was noted that the three leaders , Daala , Imperial Head of State Jagged Fel and Confederation Supreme Commander Turr Phennir , all had ties to the Galactic Empire . [ 26 ] [ 26 ]
Tensions with the Jedi Order ( 43 ABY — ) Edit
" Daala will come for us , will she not ? "
" Oh yeah .
One way or another , she 'll be coming .
After the ruckus she made about the Jedi being a danger to the government , she can't let us win .
If she does , she 's done as Chief of State . "
" Then she is done either way , because the Jedi are not going to lose this fight . "
― Saba Sebatyne , and Corran Horn [ src ]
After Luke 's trial and exile , Daala started a massive campaign against the Jedi Order , so as to take control over them .
Her first move was when Valin Horn was revealed to be infected with an enigmatic madness .
She had him arrested and frozen in carbonite .
She later sent Galactic Alliance Security troops and her special - missions force to arrest Seff Hellin when he tried to release Horn .
They failed to get him and he was captured by Darkmeld , a Jedi organization that was fighting Daala 's policies against them .
After Natua
Wan developed the psychosis , journalist Javis Tyrr discovered Darkmeld 's existence and the fact that they were hiding Hellin and Wan in the Jedi Temple .
She met with acting Grand Master Kenth Hamner as to gain custody of the mad Jedi .
Hamner refused and agreed to let Daala 's man access them if they were left in Jedi custody .
Also , all the Darkmeld Jedi were forced to publicly apologize for their actions .
Sometime later , Daala 's assistant , Wynn Dorvan , told Jagged Fel that she was planning to hire Mandalorian bounty hunters to take on the Jedi .
Despite at first refusing to accept to tell the Jedi , he finally did .
Also , Fel met with Daala to tell her that Moff Drikl Lecersen was plotting behind his back and was probably trying to overthrow them both .
He also asked Daala to abandon her agenda against the Jedi .
She refused and dismissed him .
Later , the Jedi formulated a plan to attack Daala in the media .
Using the signature of the head of the Court of Jedi Affairs , Arabelle Lorteli , to gain access to a secret Galactic Alliance Security blockhouse where the Horn siblings were being held in carbonite .
When Mirax Terrik Horn attacked Colonel Wruq Retk for hanging them up as trophies , Daala arrived and told the crowd of journalists that Mirax would n't be charged .
She also ordered the siblings brought down and placed in proper custody .
This situation also led to Daala 's public humiliation and a wave of sympathy for the Jedi erupted in the public due to her manipulation of the courts in her favor .
When General Merratt Jaxton , the Chief of Starfighter Command , claimed that ex-Chief of State Cha Niathal was partially to blame for the rise of Darth Caedus and that it would give a good public image , Daala summoned Niathal to Coruscant so that she would stand trial for dereliction of duty .
After Daala 's emissary , Elyas Caran , arrived on Mon Calamari , Niathal , outraged by Daala 's actions , committed suicide .
The Chief of State , who had felt sympathetic towards the former Admiral as she was just a victim of politics , was greatly saddened by Niathal 's death .
Her body was brought back to Coruscant for a funeral with full honors .
Despite his chief 's wishes , Dorvan told her that , due to the public 's opposition to her on Niathal 's trial , she was at risk for an assassination .
Daala watched the funeral from her office .
After the Mandalorians attacked the Jedi Temple on Daala 's order , she issued a warrant for the arrest of several high - profile Jedi like acting Grand Master Hamner .
When the Solos returned to Coruscant after their trip to Dathomir , Daala met with them and said that she wanted to ease the tension between her and the Jedi and that , to that end , she wanted Han and Leia to act as ambassadors between her and the Jedi Council .
The Council accepted this but only to see the true extent of Daala 's good will .
Daala asked that the Jedi turn in the recently apprehended Sothais Saar over to the Galactic Alliance .
The Jedi agreed but only if they were allowed full access to the prisoner .
Having no choice , she agreed .
At the same time , Moff Drikl Lecersen , Kuati Senator Haydnat Treen , Senator Fost Bramsin and General Jaxton were plotting to remove Daala and Fel , replacing them with Treen and Lecersen respectively before uniting the Galactic Alliance and the Imperial Remnant into a new Galactic Empire with them as the Emperor and Empress .
To depose Daala , Treen planned for the Chief of State to invoke the Emergency Powers
Act if the situation with the Jedi got out of hand .
Therefore , public opinion would force Daala out of office , paving the way for Treen to take her place .
Also , the conspirators attempted assassinations on Fel to fool the Jedi into thinking Daala masterminded them .
Later , when the Jedi refused to turn over the psychotic Jedi Saar and Turi Altamik to Galactic Alliance custody , Daala ordered the Jedi Temple to be sieged by Mandalorians under the command of Belok Rhal .
During this time , Daala 's lover , Admiral Nek Bwua'tu , went behind her back and pledged to Kenth Hamner the service of the Galactic Alliance Navy to the Jedi ; also , public opinion of Daala became more negative , as they were beginning to view her as a second Palpatine .
However , Luke Skywalker , meanwhile , successfully defeated the being causing the psychosis , and the afflicted Jedi were all instantly cured .
This resulted in the psychotic Jedi returning to sanity .
Daala later appeared at the Temple when she heard the Jedi wished to turn the psychotic Jedi over to her .
Daala enlisted the help of the Bith Thalleus Tharn , a doctor of xenopsychiatry , to check the condition of the insane Jedi .
Han Solo and the Order publicly embarrassed her when it was revealed to the public that the Jedi were no longer psychotic .
However , she still refused to release the Horn siblings so she could have hostages to keep the Order in line while her Mandalorian mercenaries tried to put down a slave uprising on Blaudu Sextus .
However , the Jedi managed to stop the Mandalorians , launch their StealthX starfighters to aid the Skywalkers against the Sith and successfully retrieve the Horn siblings from her custody .
Daala later contacted the Jedi Temple and demanded to speak with Hamner , unaware that he had died after a failed attempt to stop the Stealth X Wings .
Saba Sebatyne spoke to Daala instead , and Daala told her , Corran Horn and Cilghal that they left her no choice but to resort to destroying the Jedi on Coruscant .
Jedi coup Edit
" So. Death . "
" You first .
Comm me and let me know what it 's like . "
― Daala and Tahiri , meeting in prison [ src ]
Shortly afterward , the Jedi Council now under the leadership of acting Grand Master Saba Sebatyne , formulated a plan to launch a coup against Daala .
The Council put their plan into action at the same time as Senator Treen and her allies launched their bid to remove the Chief of State .
One of the conspirators , Admiral Sallinor Parova , attempted to have her Fleet Security detail arrest Daala but was interrupted by the Jedi attack .
Only aware of the Jedi attack , Daala attempted to access her secret escape route , only to be stunned from behind .
She was subsequently deposed and imprisoned .
Daala saw Tahiri Veila , who had been sentenced to death for Pellaeon 's murder , in the cell beside hers . [ 27 ]
Sebatyne subsequently addressed the Senate , informing them of the Chief 's arrest and that the Jedi would take control of the Alliance in the transition until new elections could take place .
The Jedi formed a constitutional replacement for the position of Chief of State ; rather than one person having control of the Alliance , a Triumvirate was formed between Sebatyne , Jaxton and Treen , with a two - thirds majority needed between the three to make executive decisions .
In the meantime , Daala contacted the bounty hunter Boba Fett to help her break out of prison .
In the ensuing chaos , both Daala and Veila were able to escape from the prison , and Daala enlisted Fett 's help in helping her get revenge against those who had deposed her . [ 27 ]
In the aftermath of her escape , Fett told Daala that he and his Mandalorians had discovered from their missions in putting out slave riots throughout the galaxy that Moff Drikl Lecersen and a secret circle of conspirators had been responsible for the Freedom Flight in the first place ; the intention of Lecersen in this venture was to purposely overburden Daala in her duties in the Galactic Alliance , which would eventually lead to the coup that the Jedi enacted against her .
Following this , Daala enlisted the help of all the Moffs , including Lecersen after blackmailing him , so that she could have Head of State Jagged Fel killed and then she would rule the Galactic Empire once more ; and this time , with the intention of properly ruling the galaxy again .
However , thanks to the treachery of Moff Tol Getelles , Fel declared open war on Daala . [ 28 ]
The position of Chief of State would be indefinitely suspended and its constitutional authority would be redirected to a newly - formed ruling Triumvirate , composed of Jedi Grand Master Saba Sebatyne , Senator Haydnat Treen and General Merratt Jaxton until new elections could be held .
To ensure that no single individual could possess direct control over the Armed Forces or the Intelligence Service , a two - thirds majority vote was required within the Triumvirate in order to make executive decisions . [ 28 ]
Personality and traits Edit
" Natasi Daala has been an erratic officer , a laser cannon with a malfunctioning actuator if you will , since she was an ensign in the Imperial Navy , and her recent actions bear out this diagnosis .
Of course she is a hero — she has fought all her enemies , real and imagined , with bravery and ferocity .
But she needs to be held , and cured , before ever being allowed to take up any sort of command again .
The Alliance was foolish to elevate her to a position of power . "
― Moff Getelles [ src ]
Daala was an aggressive commander who harbored much frustration at being so poorly treated in the Imperial command structure .
She was considered to be remarkably charismatic , but due to her gender and suspect manner of promotion this was often ignored .
[ 12 ]
She also could be ruthless , ordering the bombardment of colonies , the destruction of merchant vessels , [ 19 ] the torture of prisoners , [ 5 ] and the destruction of worlds with seemingly no remorse .
Daala was often prone to great fury which she found difficult to constrain , but found that attacking a target during battle was the best way to release her anger .
She felt that outbursts of one 's anger were unprofessional , and restrained herself mostly to serve as an example to her crewmen . [ 19 ]
She was also mistrustful of Force- users , both light and dark - side , and in a private conference with Boba Fett agreed that the galaxy would be better off without them . [ 21 ]
Daala was also devoted to the cause of the Empire almost to the point of irrationalism [ 5 ] — at least in the eyes of the post - Endor warlords [ 12 ] — and to following orders , remaining at the Maw installation for years without any outside contact .
[ 5 ]
She felt that the Empire provided order , a thing greatly needed , and something the New Republic did not have . [ 12 ]
She also was willing to go to great lengths to further that cause , including killing other Imperial leaders , [ 12 ] wanting to sacrifice a Star Destroyer to destroy Coruscant , and sacrificing her own life for the Empire . [ 19 ]
Often before making a decision or when contemplating failure , Daala would think of Tarkin , imagining his rage in the case of the latter . [ 19 ]
Beneath the carefully calculated façade used to inspire loyalty in her crew , however , Daala did have a soft side , which she displayed very rarely to those she led or fought against , since she strived to not show any weakness .
Daala felt that being a woman caused others to be naturally biased against her , and she worked to keep her emotions in , as she felt that emotion was often a sign of weakness .
She did occasionally reveal an emotional side towards those she respected and trusted , such as her long time second - in - command and her former lover .
Daala also displayed a high degree of emotion toward her own people , particularly when she thought she had let them down .
When the Hydra plunged into the Maw , she was overwhelmed with the thought of all the crewmen losing their lives , and because she had been charged with leading and training them , she felt that their deaths were her fault .
[ 5 ]
She had several other similar reactions to death , such as when her long time second - in - command , Kratas , was killed during an inter - warlord skirmish .
Daala blamed herself for getting him involved in what she viewed as a petty feud , and had to fight back the surge of emotion that resulted from his death . [ 12 ]
These deaths also played to Daala 's own vindictiveness , and she would go to great lengths to avenge her losses , personal and otherwise .
For instance , when the Hydra crashed into the Maw , [ 5 ] she obliterated a practically unarmed colony on Dantooine in order to sate her appetite for vengeance . [ 19 ]
Despite her vindictiveness , her compassion for those who served under her was what led her to believe that her constant string of failures put too many lives in jeopardy , to which she reacted by handing Gilad Pellaeon the reins of the Empire . [ 12 ]
Despite her hatred of the New Republic and its heroes like Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa Solo , Daala decided to fight alongside them to defeat Darth Caedus in 41 ABY .
As she had explained to Pellaeon , she was tired of Force - users taking control , as she felt they had done nothing to deserve political power .
Daala also wanted vengeance for Vorn 's death at the hands of the Moffs , and hoped to kill the Imperial Moffs who were responsible . [ 21 ]
Caedus was defeated with the aid of Daala 's fleet , after which she was elected head of the Galactic Alliance , successor to the New Republic she had once despised .
She promised to restore peace to the galaxy , [ 9 ] and worked hard to make her vision of a peaceful future a reality .
However , Daala still harbored resentment towards Luke Skywalker , and distrusted his Jedi Order . [ 24 ]
This anti-Jedi sentiment was exacerbated by the rise of the Force psychosis among Jedi Knights , which led to very tense relations between her and the Order . [ 29 ]
Relationships Edit
Liegeus Vorn Edit
Daala first met Vorn before enrolling in the Imperial Academy , and fell in love with him .
However , the two were forced to part when Daala entered the Imperial Academy on Carida prior to 0 BBY , although she would meet him again in 13 ABY .
They discovered that their feelings had never gone away , [ 7 ] and they later had at least one son .
The duo's love was very strong , and they stayed together until Vorn was killed in 35 ABY by the Moffs in a failed attempt to assassinate Daala .
Daala swore revenge on the Moffs for this , and refused to get a replacement for the eye she had lost in the attack . [ 21 ]
Wilhuff Tarkin Edit
Tarkin discovered Daala after learning of a mysterious individual who constantly beat all their opponents in simulated battles at Carida 's Imperial Academy .
After finding out that she was a woman , and being discriminated against because of it , he took her under his wing , and the two became lovers , despite the fact that he was married .
Daala found Tarkin to be everything she wanted — a man with power , ambition , and who was a great lover . [ 12 ]
She greatly admired Tarkin , and studied his strategies .
Tarkin meanwhile promoted her to admiral , and placed her in charge of the Maw Installation .
After learning of Tarkin 's death at Yavin IV , Daala was stunned , and promised to avenge her former lover and mentor . [ 5 ]
Nek Bwua'tu Edit
When Han and Leia Solo told Jaina Solo that Daala had become the new Chief of State of the Galactic Alliance , Han remarked that he suspected that Admiral Bwua 'tu , who had turned down the job , had ' always had a thing ' for Daala .
It was implied , in 43 ABY during a conversation between Daala and Bwua 'tu that they were having an affair . [ 25 ]
Later , Daala and Bwu'atu began to spend more time together , with the Bothan visiting Daala in her private quarters . [ 29 ]
Behind the scenes Edit
Admiral Daala was created by Kevin J. Anderson for The Jedi Academy Trilogy . [ 5 ]
Throughout her many appearances , Daala is a feared antagonist , despite her many defeats . [ 20 ]
Though Anderson had planned on her dying in the climactic Cauldron Nebula explosion of Dark Apprentice , [ 30 ] he decided to revive her for Champions of the Force , and after her appearance in the Jedi Academy series , she appeared in Anderson 's Darksaber , where she was again one of the antagonists , with a desire to unite the Empire .
She was also in Planet of Twilight , written just a year later , where she was in charge of her own private fleet , and then disappeared yet again .
Aside from a brief mention which stated she was believed to be dead in The New Essential Chronology , Daala would only appear in the form of several mentions during The New Jedi Order series until 2008 , when Daala re-appeared in Death Star , a novel detailing the history and events surrounding the Death Star 's construction .
It gave deeper insights into Daala 's relationship with Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin .
Daala would later appear in the eighth book in the Legacy of the Force series , Legacy of the Force : Revelation , this time fighting alongside her former enemies as the head of yet another private fleet , created under relatively unknown circumstances .
It was in this book that she finally received a first name , Natasi , over fourteen years after Daala was introduced to the Expanded Universe . [ 21 ]
Describing the character , Anderson noted that in contrast to Thrawn , " [ Daala 's ] a loose cannon , shoots first asks questions later , " later indicating she could have very well been capable of controlling the Galactic Alliance decades later , comparing her to real - life hotheaded politicians .

Notes and references Edit
My analysis of three indicators shows that within 12 months the annualized number of personal bankruptcies will roar past 1.5 million .
I believe this is a conservative estimate .
The actual number may top the 2005 record of 2 million U.S. filings , which was set in the rush to beat the implementation of the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act .
To make this forecast I looked at three sets of data : historic bankruptcy filing numbers , provided by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts , and historic unemployment rates and the personal debt service ratio ( DSR ) both provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
The graph below tells the story of how these trends interact .
( Image by Unknown Owner ) Details DMCA
After the 1983 recession , when unemployment flirted with 10 % , families increase their debt ratio from 10.5 % to just over 12 % .
Bankruptcies soon increased , but with improving employment over the next 10 years , the debt ratio plummets .
From 1995 , bankruptcies skyrocket , and in spite of the debt write - offs , so too does the debt ratio , from 11 % to nearly 14 % .
Loose lending , exuberant spending and slack real income gains all contribute to raising debt .
The record numbers of bankruptcies between 1996 and 2005 do nothing to stem the tide of red ink .
In 2008 , the distortion of the situation becomes apparent .
High personal debt and high unemployment , the double engine bankruptcy freight train is on the tracks .
Fuel for this train is increasing with credit card companies currently doubling interest rates from 15 % to 30 % , which more than doubles actual interest accumulation .
This analysis forces many questions upon us , including : When and how will Main Street emerge from the Great Recession ?
Will the Bankruptcy Freight shunt the economy back on track ?
Or , will it be a head - on , lights - out collision ?
Everyone knows that space is big .
The thing about calling the Universe massive and what not is that no one can get a clear image of precisely what type of distances we 're talking about .
The closest star to our location would take the equivalent of 50 million Earth - Moon journeys to get too , or roughly 4.2 light - years .
Other stars are thousands , millions , and billions of light - years away , so you do the math .
For instance , Voyager 1 , traveling at about 17 kilometers per second – the fastest speed of a human - built space probe , would take 74,000 years to get to Proxima Centauri , our closest stellar neighbor .
So , how do we go about shortening these awfully - long times ?
The common sense answer is fly faster , much faster .
In fact , experts say , we should develop the technology to fly at close to the speed of light before we even think about leaving the solar system .
According to our understanding of basic physics , nothing can travel faster than the speed of light , which is a constant .
Other interpretation says otherwise but , for practical applications , this constant needs to be used .
Proposals on how these massive speeds can be achieved include ships propelled by repeated hydrogen bomb explosions , or by vast , laser - powered reflective sails , or even by the annihilation of matter and antimatter .
Naturally , we would have to develop an antimatter drive first .
Experts at the Kansas State University even proposed spacecrafts that would be powered by artificial black holes .
Some say that warping time is the way to go , as in construct a ship that is able to create a bubble of sorts around it , in which time would pass slower than on the outside of the bubble .
This would allow for massively - long trips to take only a few human years .
But all these ideas are not what puzzle physicists .
What 's really disconcerting is the fact that there is absolutely nothing in our understanding of physics to prevent us from building such machines .
In other words , they are not sci- fi , NewScientist reports .
Some experts even propose a dark matter - fueled spaceship .
The idea behind this proposal is based on solid astronomical knowledge .
Dark matter makes up most of the contents of the Universe , and so the experts are proposing the construction of a vessel that would be able to collect dark matter as it moves , thus eliminating the need to carry the fuel it needs with it .
The same type of design applies to a construct which plans to steal hydrogen from the interstellar medium , and force it into nuclear fusion aboard a spacecraft .
The ship would then exhaust the by - products and obtain thrust .
Sadly , in the matter of space exploration , only time will show which design works , and which is doomed to failure .
London , England ( CNN ) --
A secret document that appears to show that Iran was working on building nuclear weapons as recently as 2007 is " alarming " and " part of a body of evidence backing up deep concerns over Iran 's nuclear program , " a Western diplomatic source with knowledge of the papers told CNN on Monday .
The International Atomic Energy Agency , the United Nations nuclear watchdog , has a copy of the secret papers , which were also obtained by the Times of London , the source said .
IAEA officials confirm they are investigating the document but said they have not formally asked Iran for more information about it .
A top international nuclear expert said it seemed to point to Iranian efforts to build a bomb .
" The only realistic use of this is in a nuclear weapon , " said David Albright , the president of the Institute for Science and International Security .
" It shows that either Iran is developing the capability [ to build nuclear weapons ] or it is moving to implement a bomb program -- and either one is bad , " said Albright , who reviewed the document for the Times before the newspaper published its report Sunday .
But Albright warned that the document is edited and has no date on it .
The source who gave it to the Times said it was from 2007 , but neither the Times nor the ISIS was able to date it definitively , Albright said .
In Iran , Foreign Ministry spokesman Ramin Mehmanparast said the Times ' " claim that Iran is working on the final and important component of a nuclear bomb is false and not worth paying any attention to , " the semi-official Fars news agency reported .
" This type of statement is made in the media to put political and psychological pressure [ on Iran ] by the officials of various countries , " Mehmanparast said , according to the Fars report .
United States intelligence concluded in 2007 that Iran had suspended work on its nuclear weapons program in 2003 .
In the National Intelligence Estimate released in December 2007 , the U.S. intelligence community dramatically reversed course from its 2005 evaluation .
It expressed " high confidence " in 2005 that the Islamic Republic was working toward nuclear weapons , then two years later said -- also with " high confidence " -- that Iran had stopped its weapons program in 2003 .
Iran denies seeking to build nuclear weapons , saying its nuclear program is to produce civilian energy and medical research .
But it is under intense pressure from the international community , with Britain and France saying last week they would push for stronger U.N. sanctions on Tehran .
U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would n't comment on the secret document Monday , but told reporters that concerns about Iran 's nuclear program " have been heightened already " in recent months after revelations of a once - secret nuclear enrichment facility near the Iranian city of Qom , and Iran 's Cabinet authorizing the construction of at least 10 new nuclear production facilities .
She said the Obama administration has taken a " dual - track " approach to Iran , including the offer of engagement and taking part in nuclear talks .
" We 've been at the table .
But I do n't think anyone can doubt that our outreach has produced very little in terms of any kind of positive response from the Iranians , " Clinton said , adding that the second approach -- the international pressure -- is key to pushing Iranian officials to change " their actions and decisions concerning the nuclear program . "
Mehrdad Khonsari , a former Iranian diplomat , says the revelation about the document " means , essentially ... that the Iranians have been lying to everybody " when they said they were not seeking to build nuclear weapons .
Khonsari said it was no accident that this document appeared when it did .
" The fact that the document comes out at this time makes it very difficult for Russia and China not to go along with more sanctions , " he said .
It would also make it easier for " Israel to go ahead with a unilateral strike " on Iran 's nuclear facilities , he added .
" The agenda will change as a result of the publication of this document unless the document is proven to be false by the Iranian authorities , " said Khonsari , who is now a senior research consultant at the Center for Arab and Iranian Studies .
Khonsari -- who left Iran after the Islamic Revolution in 1979 -- has not seen the original document but said the material published by the Times " is what an authentic document would look like . "
" It places pressure on the Iranian government to try to use what time remains to get out of this situation , " he said .
According to a report dated Monday on the Web site of Albright 's group , a neutron initiator is a critical component of a nuclear weapon .
The ISIS report said the device " would most likely be placed at the center of a fission bomb made from weapon - grade uranium " and " works by the high explosives compressing the nuclear core and the initiator " to produce a " spurt of neutrons " as a result of fusion .
" The neutrons flood the core of weapon - grade uranium and initiate the chain reaction , " the ISIS report said .
Albright said the document described efforts to " research and test a neutron initiator , " a nuclear component for which he could not see " any civil use . "
" They appear to be doing the right things , " he said .
" But you do n't know how it fits into a nuclear weapons program . "
He also said the public had failed to understand a key part of the debate about Iran 's nuclear program .
" It 's not whether there is something or nothing , but whether there is a capabilities focus or an actual decision to build nuclear weapons , " he said .
" It 's not like an on - off switch , it 's like a dimmer control . "
CNN Senior International Correspondent Matthew Chance and Richard Allen Greene contributed to this report .
Howard Zinn's Biased History
tags : Howard Zinn
Mr. Flynn is the executive director of Accuracy in Academia and author of the newly released , : Why the Left Hates America : Exposing the Lies That Have Obscured Our Nation ’s Greatness . "
Who is the most influential historian in America ?
Could it be Pulitzer Prize winners Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. or Joseph Ellis or David McCullough , whose scholarly works have reached a broad literary public ?
The answer is none of the above .
The accolade belongs instead to the unreconstructed , anti-American Marxist Howard Zinn , whose cartoon anti-history of the United States is still selling 128,000 copies a year twenty years after its original publication .
Many of those copies are assigned readings for courses in colleges and high schools taught by leftist disciples of their radical mentor .
“ Objectivity is impossible , ” Zinn once remarked , “ and it is also undesirable .
That is , if it were possible it would be undesirable , because if you have any kind of a social aim , if you think history should serve society in some way ; should serve the progress of the human race ; should serve justice in some way , then it requires that you make your selection on the basis of what you think will advance causes of humanity . ”
History serving “ a social aim ” other than the preservation or interpretation of a historical record is precisely what we get in A People ’s History of the United States .
Howard Zinn ’s 776 page tome , which after selling more than a million copies , has been recently re-released in a hardback edition .
What accounts for the massive sales figures ?
One odd answer for a work by a university professor is that A People ’s History of the United States has been the beneficiary of fawning celebrities , who are not normally associated with .
Zinn has discussed politics with Pearl Jam ’s Eddie Vedder and was on Rage Against the Machine ’s reading list ( note : beware of rock bands that issue reading lists ) .
In Good Will Hunting , Matt Damon ’s “ Will Hunting ” tells his psychiatrist that A People ’s History of the United States will “ knock you on your ass . ”
Damon and co-star Ben Affleck , who grew up near Zinn outside of Harvard Square , are said to be producing a miniseries based on their neighbor ’s magnum opus .
Zinn repaid the actors ’ youthful infatuation by including them in an inconsequential paragraph in the book ’s new edition .
The New York Times ’s reviewer ( no doubt a cousin of Jayson Blair ) declared that the book should be “ required reading ” for students .
Professors have heeded this counsel .
Courses at the University of Colorado - Boulder , UMass - Amherst , Penn State , and Indiana University are among dozens of classes nationwide that require the book .
The book is so popular that it can be found on the class syllabus in such fields as economics , political science , literature , and women ’s studies , in addition to its more understandable inclusion in history .
Amazon.com reports in the site ’s “ popular in ” section that the book is currently # 7 at Emory University , # 4 at the University of New Mexico , # 9 at Brown University , and # 7 at the University of Washington .
In fact , 16 of the 40 locations listed in A People ’s History ’s “ popular in ” section are academic institutions , with the remainder of the list dominated by college towns like Binghamton ( NY ) , State College ( PA ) , East Lansing ( MI ) , and Athens ( GA ) .
Based on this , it is reasonable to wonder if most of the million or so copies sold have been done so via coercion , i.e. , college professors and high school teachers requiring the book .
The book is deemed to be so crucial to the development of young minds by some academics that a course at Evergreen State decreed : “ This is an advanced class and all students should have read Howard Zinn ’s A People ’s History of the United States before the first day of class , to give us a common background to begin the class . ”
And what “ common background ” might that be ?
Through Zinn ’s looking - glass , Maoist China , site of history ’s bloodiest state - sponsored killings , becomes “ the closest thing , in the long history of that ancient country , to a people ’s government , independent of outside control . ”
The authoritarian Nicaraguan Sandinistas were “ welcomed ” by their own people , while the opposition Contras , who backed the candidate that triumphed when free elections were finally held , were a “ terrorist group ” that “ seemed to have no popular support inside Nicaragua . ”
Castro ’s Cuba , readers learn , “ had no bloody record of suppression . ”
The recently released updated edition continues to be plagued with inaccuracies and poor judgment .
The added sections on the Clinton years , the 2000 election , and 9/11 bear little resemblance to the reality his current readers have lived through .
In an effort to bolster his arguments against putting criminals in jail , aggressive law enforcement tactics , and President Clinton ’s crime bill , Zinn contends that in spite of all this “ violent crime continues to increase . ”
It does n’t .
Like much of Zinn ’s rhetoric , if you believe the opposite of what he says in this instance you would be correct .
According to a Department of Justice report released in September of 2002 , the violent crime rate has been cut in half since 1993 .
According to Zinn , it was Mumia Abu - Jamal ’s “ race and radicalism , ” as well as his “ persistent criticism of the Philadelphia police ” that landed him on death row in the early 1980s .
Nothing about Abu - Jamal ’s gun being found at the scene ; nothing about the testimony of numerous witnesses pointing to him as the triggerman ; nothing about additional witnesses reporting a confession by Abu - Jamal — it was Abu - Jamal ’s dissenting voice that caused a jury of twelve to unanimously sentence him to death .
Predictably , Zinn draws a moral equivalence between America and the 9/11 terrorists .
He writes , “ It seemed that the United States was reacting to the horrors perpetrated by the terrorists against innocent people in New York by killing other innocent people in Afghanistan . ”
Scare quotes adorn Bush ’s “ war on terrorism , ” post - 9/11 “ patriotism , ” and other words and phrases Zinn dislikes .
Readers of A People ’s History of the United States learn very little about history .
They do learn quite a bit , however , about Howard Zinn .
In fact , the book is perhaps best thought of as a massive Rorschach Test , with the author ’s familiar reaction to every major event in American history proving that his is a captive mind long closed by ideology .
Theory First , Facts Second
If you ’ve read Marx , there ’s really no reason to read Howard Zinn .
The first line of The Communist Manifesto provides the single - bullet theory of history that provides Zinn with his narrative thread —
“ The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle . ”
It is the all - purpose explanation of every subject that Zinn covers .
On other hand , why study history when theory has all the answers ?
Thumb through A People ’s History of the United States and you will find greed as the motivating factor behind every act of those who do n’t qualify as “ the people ” in Zinn ’s book .
According to Zinn , the separation from Great Britain , the Civil War , and both World Wars all were the result of base motives of the “ ruling class ” -- rich men to get richer at the expense of others .
Zinn ’s Marxist explanation of the New World begins with Columbus who like every other settler in the New World was driven by the ( evil ) profit motive .
“ Behind the English invasion of North America , behind their massacre of Indians , their deception , their brutality , was that special powerful drive born in civilizations based on private profit . ”
This malicious view of people who often came to the New World to escape persecution in the old , who sometimes championed the rights of indigenous peoples and who mostly attempted to live peacefully alongside them is characteristic of the extreme anti-European , anti-white , any American prejudice of this book .
The idea that the Indians who themselves were “ invaders ” by Zinn ’s standards ( they came on a land bridge from Asia and exterminated the then native peoples ) somehow owned the continent is a much a fantasy as the idea that they were simply passive victims of the settlers .
Zinn ’s account omits the unprovoked aggressions of the Indians on each other and on the settlers .
But then doing so , would spoil his leftist melodrama .
Case Study : The Pequot War
This melodrama depends on simplistically dividing mankind into two groups – and only two : oppressors and oppressed .
This is how Zinn describes and utterly distorts the early settlement of North America .
The Pequot War serves as his example , as it will ours .
The war was climaxed when the Pequot stronghold in Fort Mystic was burned in battle and all its inhabitants incinerated in May of 1637 .
Finding themselves severely outnumbered the attackers had set fire to the Pequot compound .
This is a tragic enough story , but Zinn wo n’t be satisfied until it becomes a story of native American innocence and victimhood versus rapacious and evil white settlers .
Thus the Pequot violence against whites that led to the war is almost entirely absent from the text .
The most Zinn can bring himself to admit is that “ Massacres took place on both sides . ”
In fact , the author details only the atrocities committed by one side : the Puritans .
While graphic descriptions of Puritan violence are highlighted , Pequot atrocities are brushed aside .
Here are some examples not to be found in Zinn : : “ [ T ] hey took two men out of a boat , and murdered them with ingenious barbarity , cutting off first the hands of one of them , then his feet , ” writes 19th century historian John Gorham Palfrey about the Pequots ’ assaults upon settlers .
“ Soon after , two men sailing down the river were stopped and horribly mutilated and mangled ; their bodies were cut in two , lengthwise , and the parts hung up by the river ’s bank .
A man who had been carried off from Wethersfield was roasted alive .
All doubt as to the necessity of vigorous action was over , when a band of a hundred Pequots attacked that place , killed seven men , a woman , and a child , and carried off two girls . ”
It does n’t take a rocket scientist to figure out why the settlers might have decided to resort to violent means to deal with the Pequots .
But it does take someone more honest than Zinn .
The author mentions only briefly the atrocity the precipitated the war , which was the killing of a settler named John Oldham .
Zinn morally justifies the murder by labeling the victim a “ trader , Indian - kidnapper , and troublemaker . ”
This loaded account helps Zinn persuade his readers that it was the white man ’s greed that led to the Pequot War .
The settlers , writes Zinn , “ wanted [ the Pequots ] out of the way ; they wanted their land . ”
Also absent from Zinn ’s devious narrative are the atrocities that the Pequots committed against other Indians of the Connecticut Valley .
The Pequots not only waged war on whites , but on their fellow native Americans as well .
They were a belligerent people feared by weaker tribes .
Consequently , while Zinn portrays the Pequot War as a Puritan - versus - Indian conflict , the fact is that both Puritans and Indians fought against the Pequots , nothing could be further from the truth .
Indian tribes — for example , the Narragansett — repeatedly urged the English newcomers to attack their enemies , namely the Pequots .
Zinn writes that “ Indian tribes were used against one another ” by the Puritans when , in fact , the reverse was true .
Indian tribes used the Puritans and their superior firepower to eradicate their fellow Indians who posed a threat to them .
In fact Indians were the majority in the attacking force at Fort Mystic , and by a vast margin .
Whites comprised less than 15 percent of the 500 - plus men who attacked the Pequot stronghold and burned it to the ground .
After the horrific conflagration ended , it was the Mohegans who executed the Pequots ’ captured chief .
Zinn ’s account of the Pequot war is a microcosm of his book as a whole which is little more than an 800 - page libel against his country .
The Founding “ Around 1776 , ” A People ’s History informs readers , “ certain important people in the English colonies made a discovery that would prove enormously useful for the next two hundred years .
They found that by creating a nation , a symbol , a legal unity called the United States , they could take over land , profits , and political power from the favorites of the British Empire .
In the process , they could hold back a number of potential rebellions and create a consensus of popular support for the rule of a new , privileged leadership . ”
Forget about all men are created equal , forget about liberty and the pursuit of happiness , America ’s founding can be reduced to the pursuit of exploitation and profit .
Well maybe for academics with lifetime subsidies and rock stars with drug - fried brains .
Zinn continues ( without irony ) : “ When we look at the American Revolution this way , it was a work of genius , and the Founding Fathers deserve the awed tribute they have received over the centuries .
They created the most effective system of national control devised in modern times , and showed future generations of leaders the advantages of combining paternalism with command . ”
Rather than an event that inspired movements for freedom and self - government throughout the world through the present , the American Founding is portrayed as a virtually totalitarian system of oppression .
If the Founders wanted a society they could direct , why did n’t they establish a dictatorship or a monarchy and model their rule on what was the universal form of government at the time ?
Why go through the trouble of devising a Constitution departing from a repressive status quote and guaranteeing individual rights , mass political participation , jury trials , and checks on governmental power ?
Apparently inhabiting an alternate reality , Zinn does n’t feel the need to account for this and merely explains it away as a charade designed to prevent class revolution .
This is conspiracy theory with a vengeance .
As his fictional narrative gathers steam , Zinn paints antebellum America as a uniquely cruel slaveholding society subjugating human beings for profit .
The fact that America was half free and the site of an anti-slavery crusade that put an end to a 3,000 year old institution goes unnoticed or so severely discounted as to be of no account .
The civil war that ended slavery becomes in Zinn ’s malicious deconstruction a campaign to change the form of oppression and make it more profitable .
“ It is money and profit , not the movement against slavery , that was uppermost in the priorities of the men who ran the country . ”
Rather than welcoming emancipation , Zinn is depressed by it .
“ Class consciousness was overwhelmed during the Civil War , ” the Marxist laments .
The efficiency of the Zinn formula is impressive to behold .
Both slavery and emancipation , are explained by the same factor : greed .
Whether the U.S. tolerates or eradicates slavery , its evil motives remains the same .
To Zinn the important thing about the emancipation of the slaves and the Civil War that brought that about is that they served as distractions from the impending socialist revolution .
This is history as religious fantasy .
Here we come to the real secret of the commercial success of A People ’s History .
It is a case of simple ideas for simple minds – a broken record for the tone deaf .
When we come to World War I , it sounds very much like the Civil War .
“ American capitalism needed international rivalry — and periodic war — to create an artificial community of interest between rich and poor , … supplanting the genuine community of interest among the poor that showed itself in sporadic movements . ”
Yet another conspiracy to distract the proletariat from its destined revolution .
The account of World War II made slightly more interesting by author ’s preposterous account of its origins .
According to Zinn , suggests that America , not Japan , was to blame for Pearl Harbor , provoking the Empire of the Sun and forcing it to attack us .
It ’s the devil made them do it theory of history , which is great fallback position of the left when confronted with the imperialistic aggressions of “ people of color . ”
Like the war to end slavery , the fight against fascism was an optical illusion .
It was really a struggle by American capitalists to rule the world .
Regarding America ’s neutrality in the Spanish Civil War , which preceded World War II , Zinn asks : “ Was it the logical policy of a government whose main interest was not stopping Fascism but advancing the imperial interests of the United States ?
For those interests , in the thirties , an anti-Soviet policy seemed best .
Later , when Japan and Germany threatened U.S. world interests , a pro-Soviet , anti-Nazi policy became preferable . ”
Thus is reality inverted or more accurately twisted .
Zinn – a pro-Communist supported Stalin ’s monster regime at the time , elides the fact that it was the Soviet Union that pretended to be anti-fascist in Spain , then signed a pact with Hitler and then – when Hitler double - crossed his Communist ally and invaded the Soviet Union became anti-fascist again .
The United States was isolationist in 1936 and until Pearl Harbor .
But it was always anti-fascist .
Zinn projects the Soviet Union ’s schizophrenic policies ( and his own schizophrenic allegiances ) onto America .
While the Hitler - Stalin Pact is awkwardly excused , Zinn all but invents a Hitler - Roosevelt Pact to serve his social aims .
But this deceptive ingenuity is fleeting and the text returns to its state of terminal boredom as Zinn tells his readers that the Second World War was really about money .
“ Quietly , behind the headlines in battles and bombings , American diplomats and businessmen worked hard to make sure that when the war ended , American economic power would be second to none in the world .
United States business would penetrate areas that up to this time had been dominated by England .
The Open Door Policy of equal access would be extended from Asia to Europe , meaning that the United States intended to push England aside and move in . ”
Zinn does not explain if it was America ’s agenda to create a global empire why Americans helped to rebuild Japan and Germany and thereby create its chief economic rivals in the postwar world .
It is not that economics does not influence events .
It is just that Marx ’s simplistic reduction of all historical motives to profit motives has been discredited – not least by the 100 million people whom Marxists killed in the 20th Century to make their theories work .
There is no reason to resurrect them now , despite what Eddie Vedder and Matt Damon think .
Uncooperative Facts & Convenient Omissions
When fact and theory clash , the ideologue chooses theory .
Time and again , A People ’s History of the United States distorts or simply ignores the truth to make the facts , or the alleged facts , or the invented facts , fit the theory that justifies his “ social aims . ”
Zinn claims that “ George Washington was the richest man in America . ”
He was n’t , but it makes for a good Marxist tale .
George Washington certainly rose to accumulate great wealth in his lifetime — even if he was chronically cash - poor .
( For example , he had to borrow money to travel to New York upon his election to the presidency . )
It is generally conceded that Robert Morris was the Founding era ’s wealthiest merchant , while Moses Brown , whose family ’s name graces an Ivy League university , was another Washington contemporary whose wealth exceeded his .
“ When the Scottsboro case unfolded in the 1930s in Alabama , ” Zinn writes in an even more egregious fit of historical amnesia , “ it was the Communist party that had become associated with the defense of these young black men imprisoned , in the early years of the Depression , by southern injustice . ”
Perhaps the Party had become “ associated ” with the defense of the Scottsboro Boys , but in reality the Communists merely used the embattled youngsters .
Richard Gid Powers points out in Not Without Honor that the Communists had raised $ 250,000 for the Scottsboro Boys ’ defense , but had put - up a scant $ 12,000 for two appeals .
At the time , a black columnist quoted a candid Party official who stated , “ we do n’t give a damn about the Scottsboro boys .
If they burn it does n’t make any difference .
We are only interested in one thing , how we can use the Scottsboro case to bring the Communist movement to the people and win them over to Communism . ”
As a fellow - traveler , Zinn has the identical view .
He is only interested in history so long as it serves as a weapon of socialist ideology .
“ Unemployment grew in the Reagan years , ” Zinn claims .
Statistics show otherwise .
Reagan inherited an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent in his first month in office .
By January of 1989 , the rate had declined to 5.4 percent .
Had the Reagan presidency ended in 1982 when unemployment rates exceeded 10 percent , Zinn would have a point .
But for the remainder of Reagan ’s presidency , unemployment declined precipitously .
Not surprisingly , Zinn ’s book contains not a single source citation ( perhaps footnotes would discourage his Pearl Jam fans ) .
More striking than Zinn ’s inaccuracies — intentional and otherwise — is what he leaves out .
Washington ’s Farewell Address , Lincoln ’s Gettysburg Address , and Reagan ’s speech at the Brandenburg Gate all fail to merit a mention .
Nowhere do we learn that Americans were first in flight , first to fly across the Atlantic , and first to walk on the moon .
Alexander Graham Bell , Jonas Salk , and the Wright Brothers are entirely absent .
Instead , the reader is treated to the exploits of Speckled Snake , Joan Baez , and the Berrigan brothers .
While Zinn sees fit to mention that immigrants often went into professions like ditch - digging and prostitution , American success stories like those of Alexander Hamilton , John Jacob Astor , and Louis B. Mayer — to name but a few — are off the Zinn radar screen .
Valley Forge rates a single fleeting reference , while D - Day ’s Normandy invasion , Gettysburg , and other important military battles are skipped over .
In their place , we get several pages on the My Lai massacre and colorful descriptions of U.S. bombs falling on hotels , air - raid shelters , and markets during the Gulf War of the early 1990s .
Conclusion Zinn utters perhaps the most honest words of A People ’s History of the United States in the conclusion of the book ’s 1995 edition , conceding that his work is “ a biased account . ”
“ I am not troubled by that , ” he adds , “ because the mountain of history books under which we all stand leans so heavily in the other direction — so tremblingly respectful of states and statesmen and so disrespectful , by inattention , to people ’s movements — that we need some counterforce to avoid being crushed into submission . ”
Perhaps the reason they lean so heavily in the other direction is that they are based on facts , not leftwing prejudice .
“ I wanted my writing of history and my teaching of history to be a part of social struggle , ” Zinn remarks in an interview conducted long after the release of A People ’s History of the United States .
“ I wanted to be a part of history and not just a recorder and teacher of history .
So that kind of attitude towards history , history itself as a political act , has always informed my writing and my teaching . ”
Indeed it has .
Only let ’s not call it history .
Howard Zinn is a master of cheap Marxist propaganda .
His book is a dagger aimed at the heart the country that has given him more freedom than most of the writers who have ever written and made him a millionaire in the process .
The anniversary volume of A People ’s History of the United States comes with an encomium from one of the academic profession ’s most honored figures , Eric Foner the DeWitt Clinton Professor of History at Columbia College .
A former president of the American Historical Assocation , Foner reviewed Zinn ’s book for the New York Times .
A quote from Foner ’s review is featured on the cover of the anniversary edition : “ Historians may well view it , ” writes Foner , “ as a step toward a coherent new vision of American history . ”
This makes a kind of sense because Foner himself is an unreconstructed leftist , whose judgments are evidently colored by his “ social aims ” as well .
This slanderous tome and its popular and academic success are monuments to human credulity and delusion , and to the disgraceful condition of American letters .

Peter N. Kirstein - 4/14/2011 Wow !
A student led me to this , a comment made eight years ago !
I stand by my correction of the article 's erroneous citation of the first line of the Manifesto .
A preamble is considered part of a document so I was right there : it does begin with " A spectre is haunting Europe ... "
I agree in part with Ms McMillin : People 's History is opinion and does not profess to be " objective . "
It has errors as do all works but it is " factual " enough to merit usage .
Yet most historical writing emanates from ideas and biases contained within the author .
I did write a HNN piece on Professor Zinn recently if you are interested :
The People 's Historian and the FBI Zinn Files .
Albrecht Kübler - 3/7/2011 Kyle :
" Since you acknowledge in your response Zinn is a biased writer , do you think it is appropriate to have biased content given to students ?
Is this not indoctrination ? "
It would only be indoctrination , if Zinn claimed that his statements are the only truth and condemn everybody who disagrees .
But he does not !
And if any teacher uses his book and makes this claim , that would be inappropriate .
I could imagine giving students a " traditional " , i.e. solely positive account of the time of the founding fathers to compare to Zinn 's account and have them research and discuss both sides .
The truth can probably be found somewhere in the middle .

Theresa McMillin - 2/21/2011 Hey Peter ... you 're comment : I have used Professor Zinn's , " A People 's History " for many years and students find it very provocative and readable .
In fact his teachings and writings were formative events in my life and I can assure Mr Flynn that opposing American militarism , racism and imperialism is in keeping with a democracy 's need for vital and sustained criticism of public and foreign policy .
Let 's get a couple of things straight .
Foreign policy should be about protecting our interests , not some PC crap that leftists love to sight at the expense of our own Nation .
We 're not here to hold hands and sign ' Kumbya ' when other countries are using terror and killing our own people .
Or entering our country illegally along with illegal drugs and killing innocents .
And if you 'use ' the book , I hope you also explain that the book is not based on fact , but opinion .
Let 's not get the two confused .
Theresa McMillin - 2/21/2011
And
I guess that Zinn 's own admission that the information in the book is his own OPINION and BIASED and not based in fact does n't leave you scratching your head wondering why any classroom would use this book as historical fact .
I 'm all for opposing opinions , but let 's label the book what it really is and not as the ' ethical '
Zinn would describe it as " A People 's History of the United States " .
Let 's instead label it " A Marxist 's View of History of the United States " .
DON'T teach my children this nonsense unless it 's accurately identified as someone 's opinion and fact .
Kylw Treadwell Svendsen - 2/3/2011 Mr. Bourbina ,
Since you acknowledge in your response Zinn is a biased writer , do you think it is appropriate to have biased content given to students ?
Is this not indoctrination ?
Also , you say that this is only one book who shows the peoples views and many other history texts show the " oppressors " view .
What good does making your own biased opinion public do ?
Two wrongs do not make a right .
Thanks for the help with my clarification .

It 's been a long time since the comment was posted , but in case Zinn 's protege Mr. Kirstein ventures here again , " A Spectre is Haunting Europe - - the spectre of Communism , " is actually the first line of the preamble .
The first line of the first section , " Bourgeois and Proletarians " is , indeed , " The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles . "
Robert Avant - 12/7/2009
I can assure you Mr. Kirstein that whatever Hitler 's failings were the Nazis were avowed socialists " in the mode of Mussolini .
I am sure your students whisper " tres tres amusant " when you show how close hitler was to Reagan and Thatcher .
Yes , the fruit of the Zinn tree falls not far away .
Hoisted on your own petard , sir !
Randll Reese Besch - 1/26/2009
The side normally hidden or glossed over so what is the problem ?
You certainly have n't studied the climate change question or you would n't have made the inflammatory statement , " I havent fully “ investigated ” Mr. Zinn and checked up on all that he represents , but I still think im entitled to my opinion just like global warming wakos that have no clue about the subject and use a movie ( an inconvenient truth ) ... " suggests a reason why you put quotes around " investigated " was a good idea .
But it must be understood that some of us have better more informed opinions ( of analysis ) than others .
We must use our intelligence to discern the difference .
Randll Reese Besch - 1/26/2009
Homer where do you get your point of view .
Marx had nothing to do with Russia , Germany or China in any way except those who appropriated some of his words to distort for themselves as they talked about ' helping the volk or ' common man ' as they helped themselves to absolute power .
Read some history some time , maybe Marx and Engles too would help .
Marx.com is one such place .
Just look at the results of Capitalism uncontrolled both here and abroad as too the death toll and slavery for that ?
Randll Reese Besch - 1/26/2009
Well
Homer if you do you need to have the crayon removed from your brain forth with !
Hitler was as far away from Marx ( who declared he was n't a ' Marxist ' ) but was a right winger who had no problem mixing church / state and corporation not to far from Reagan and Thatcher .
Corporations had free reign in Germany .
Marx was for the end of lassaize faire capitalism who he declaimed would " purchase the rope they would hang themselves with " when the people became tired of rampant unregulated businesses destroying everything around them .
Much like now .
The workers were to unite and take over the businesses and run them by themselves as the owners .
No Nazism / Bolshevism there .
Stalin and Hitler controlled the corporations in getting benefits from their labor .
Both suppressed labor unions and allowed corporate soveringty from labor but not from the gov't .
[ They wanted their cut too . ]
NH Teacher - 12/21/2008 " Howard Zinn is a master of cheap Marxist propaganda . "
I AGREE .
And the sad part is our kids may never learn the truth about the founding of this country or why they have been free , up to now .
NH Teacher - 12/21/2008
Not hardly .
Zinn scares me .
NH Teacher - 12/21/2008
This is what you get for American History in the International Baccalaureate program , a stealth program to indoctrinate children to the world government , created and controlled by the United Nations from Geneva , Switzerland .
All the good things you hear about this program are self - laudatory and inaccurate -- IBO.org is quite open about their social agenda .
TOK is a philosophy course that teaches students that one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter ... etc... and there are many pornographic books used in the literature part .
We will never be a free people if we allow the government to control our educational system .
The DOE must be stopped and dissolved .
Heriberto Tovar - 8/4/2008
When I took the second part of History this summer , my professor required the supplemental readings of “ A People ’s History of the United States ” by Howard Zinn .
I was perplexed as to why the supplement was necessary , however , after reading the first few chapters I soon realized Zinn ’s “ biased ” views of history .
The course consisted of the traditional objective textbook readings along with the corresponding chapter of “ A People ’s History ” .
Interestingly , reading both chapters added some depth and better interpretation to the events in history .
My professor is among the growing number of educators across the nation that believe that Zinn ’s works should be “ required reading for students ” .
I agree with my professor ’s decision to use Zinn as a supplemental reading , however , I do not believe it should be the single source of information for any history class .
I am in accord with Daniel J Flynn ’s critique that “ A People ’s History of the United States ” provides the “ author ’s familiar reaction to every major event in American history proving that his is a captive mind long closed by ideology ” .
Flynn believes that Zinn and Marx interpret society in much the same manner by incorporation class struggle and greed into every event in history .
Flynn critiques Zinn ’s work on two case studies ; The Pequot War and The Founding .
In the Pequot War incident , Flynn claims that Zinn summarizes the incident as “ a story of native American innocence versus rapacious and evil white settlers ” .
The facts of the incident are both the Native Americans and the white settlers each experienced horrible atrocities .
He argues that not all bloodshed was done by the settlers and they too had to defend themselves from the evils of the Native Americans .
Flynn graphically describes atrocities by the Native Americans where they mutilated and even roasted alive and rationalizes the settler ’s needs to defend themselves with any violent means necessary .
As stated above , Zinn justifies many of America ’s historic events with an ulterior motive ; greed .
Flynn points out in an excerpt for “ A People ’s History ” , that when “ certain important people ” were founding the English colonies , they found an ingenious way to create a country not for the pursuit of happiness but the pursuit of profit .
Slavery is another issue where Flynn tries point out irregular stance on an issue .
Zinn believes that profit is at the heart of slavery and profit too is at the heart of the emancipation of slaves .
Whatever the US did either to tolerate or eradicate slavery , profit was the motive .
Flynn claims that not all information found in Zinn ’s chapters are factual .
Zinn claims that George Washington was the richest man in America however , Flynn discredits that by the anecdote that George Washington had to borrow money to pay for his travel to New York when elected to the presidency .
Again during the Reagan years , Zinn claims that unemployment grew in the Reagan years , however , Flynn points out that unemployment had fallen 2.1 percent at the time he left office .
Flynn argues a very important point that “ A People ’s History ” omits important events in history such as important presidential addresses like the Washington ’s farewell address and milestone events like the first walk on the moon and even successes in America like Alexander Hamilton .
Zinn admits that his work is of a “ biased account ” and justifies his work by “ … wanting to be a part of history and not just a recorder and teacher of history ” .
Zinn ’s biased views and Marxist tone provide just that .
As I mentioned before , I enjoy his work , however , I sometimes feel depressed and disgusted at the actions America has taken to be what we are today .
Chelsea Ann Handy - 8/3/2008 Critic on Howard Zinn
There is a man whom is remembered in his thought on history of the America ’s , one I might say is “ A People ’s History of the United States ” , Howard Zinn .
My opinion is a negative one for Howard zinn because of his “ cruelidity and disillusion ” as Daniel J. Flynn once said opinion on all history .
An author named Daniel J.Flynn was an inspiration to me , he showed the negative side on all Howard Zinn ’s point of views and things he would mention in history books .
He saw Howard zinc a pro-communist , is a man that “ plagued with inaccuracies and poor judgment ” he does not have the will nor should he be a famous writer whom critics are American history .
Much of his opinions amongst history in the United Sates are never well back up .
As he mentions the Clinton Year in the 2000 election and the 9/11 had no kind of resemblance to the reality his current readers have lived through .
We young readers who are pushed to read and remember to learn about Howard Zinn , have a difficult time to understand him , since much of his things he talks about do not relate to much of the things we in the year 2008 are living through .
There is also Zinn ’s un- researched opinion on violent crimes , “ violent crime continues to increase . ”
As to the Department of Justice report released in September of 2002 , the violent crime rate has actually been cut in half since 1993 .
Howard Zinn divided the mankind into oppressors and the oppressed .
Describes and utterly distorts the early settlement of North America .
The Pequot War serves as his example , as it will ours . .
Here are some examples not to be found in Zinn : : “ [ T ] hey took two men out of a boat , and murdered them with ingenious barbarity , cutting off first the hands of one of them , then his feet , ” writes 19th century historian John Gorham Palfrey about the Pequot ’s ’ assaults upon settlers .
There is a much needed writer who has the courage to actually put out the truth and mention every little aspect of the things we went through in the past times .
Daniel J. Flynn said “ Forget about all men are created equal , forget about liberty and the pursuit of happiness , America ’s founding can be reduced to the pursuit of exploitation and profit .
Well maybe for academics with lifetime subsidies and rock stars with drug - fried brains . ”
It is not just self minded but also very true .
It something like this man who should be replaced and very much remembered for are sake to learn the truth about are history .
Zinn was later killed because of his opinions upon the Mumia abu - Jamal ’s and his criticism against the Philadelphia police .
He was sentenced to death row in 1980 .
Zinn ’s book contains not a single source citation .
Howard Zinn is a master of cheap Marxist propaganda .
His book is a stab to the back on his “ country that has given him more freedom than most of the writers who have ever written and made him a millionaire in the process ” .
Where is all that American history that mentions the “ first in flight , first to fly across the Atlantic , and first to walk on the moon ? ”
Are necessity to learn are history of the United States is crucial to understand why we have government established and regulations ?
Howard Zinn is a powerful man “ This slanderous tome and its popular and academic success are monuments to human credulity and delusion , and to the disgraceful condition of American letters ” think about it , do you want learn not well backed up evidence ?
christina quinter - 8/3/2008 Howard Zinn as a historian who is still selling 128,000 for twenty years .
Zinn ’s articles are taught in colleges and high schools around the world .
Daniel J. Flynn is the executive director of Accuracy in Academia and is also an author for Why the Left Hates America : Exposing the Lies That Have Obscured Our Nation ’s Greatness .
Daniel Flynn thinks of Howard Zinn as a man who ca n’t really back his evidence up on what he ’s publishing .
Daniel thinks that since Zinn discussed politics with Pearl Jam and Rage Against The Machine had Zinn on their reading list that people should be beware of rock bands that issue reading lists .
Flynn emphasizes that the New York Times reviewer declared Zinn ’s book to be “ required reading , ” only because Jayson Blair , the New York Times reviewer , is Zinn ’s cousin .
Flynn believes that Howard Zinn ’s book is so crucial and seems to mess up the minds of developing young students .
Flynn thinks that Howard Zinn always wants people to believe him and his rhetoric is always opposite of what he says .
Howard Zinn had an equivalence towards the 911 terrorist attacks and uses phrases that he dislikes , according to Daniel J. Flynn .
Howard Zinn does not seem to have a good impression on Daniel at all because Daniel believes that Zinn only tries to make his stories sound clear and tries to put in evidence that has nothing to do with what Zinn is publishing just to make it sound better .
For example , Zinn suggests that “ George Washington was the richest man in American , ” he really was n’t the richest man but the idea of it made the story for the Marxist sounds better .
Also , Reagan did not have an impact on unemployment according to Zinn , statistics show otherwise .
Daniel Flynn points out these small things out because he thinks that it is not fair for Howard Zinn to put these ideas into people ’s minds without any true evidence to back it up .
I definitely agree with Daniel J Flynn because I would n’t want to read about somebody ’s publishing that is not backed up with true evidence .
I agree with Flynn because of the fact that he points out that Howard Zinn did not have any single sources of citations .
That proves to me that if you ca n’t put at least a citation then you are obviously make things up .
Also , according to Zinn , the Pequot violence had two massacres on both sizes , but in the book he only talks about one side , the Puritans .
If I was reading a book and read this information I would want to know about the both sides , not only the side that the author wants to tell me about .
Kimberly Cantergiani - 8/3/2008
Howard Zinn , Professor Emeritus at Boston University , and author of the widely read and notoriously challenged volume , A People ’s History of the United States , has been hailed , according to Daniel J. Flynn as “ the most influential historian in America ” .
However , according to Mr. Flynn , Zinn is nothing more than an “ unreconstructed , anti-American Marxist ” whose “ captive mind long closed by ideology ” is rooted in “ conspiracy theory with a vengeance ” .
Flynn begins his critique with his disturbance that Zinn ’s work has reached such “ massive sales figures ” which he believes is based on the skewed requirements of liberal - minded college educators and journalists , who all share the “ social aim ” of indoctrinating America ’s youth against capitalist business and foreign profiteering .
Flynn postulates if “ the million or so copies sold have been done so via coercion ” and that “ the commercial success of A People ’s History …is a case of simple ideas for simple minds .
It is intriguing that a well - read historian of the 21st century such as Flynn would have such vehement opposition to the possibility of revisionist history .
Surely , it must be conceded that tremendous substantiation for many historical accounts , both domestic and abroad , are unearthed on an on - going basis , providing a more well rounded and balanced perspective of what truly occurred throughout American history .
It is a shallow and narrow - minded view to assume that the traditional view posed by academia is in any way complete and to ignore the possibility that it in fact , it was entirely constructed with the very same intent for which Flynn accuses Zinn - that of slanting and tainting the minds of the youth of America .
Further , Flynn attributes some of the work ’s notoriety to that of endorsement and affiliation of Hollywood celebrities and musicians .
In his mention of Pearl Jam and Rage Against the Machine , Flynn advises the reader to “ beware of rock bands that issue reading lists ” and to remember that they are “ rock stars with drug - fried brains ” .
It is the height of condescension to imply that due to one ’s employment , affiliation , or artistic capability they are precluded from forming thoughtful , introspective and intelligent opinions regarding weighty political issues or that they must participate in the use of recreational or mind - altering drugs .
To the contrary , for Flynn to resort to such infantile , and humorous , accusations it reduces his credibility as a mature and logical professional .
One must speculate on the possibility that Flynn is jealous of Zinn ’s accomplishment ’s and , barring any original proposition of his own , is condemned to the deprecation of others .
Flynn also resorts to the use of government issued statistics for the purpose of countering Zinn ’s contentions .
For example , in response to Zinn ’s statement that despite the initiation of President Clinton ’s crime bill “ violent crime continued to increase ” , Flynn offers that “ according to a Department of Justice report … the violent crime rate has been cut in half since 1993 ” .
This is a weak argument attempting to validate information as provided by the government , which naturally would like the public to believe that its programs are effective .
It is preposterous to assume biased figures as facts and also naïve to overlook the likelihood that the manner in which statistics are compiled and reported is inconsistent .
What may have been considered a “ violent crime ” in one year may have been redirected to another data group in another .
Additionally , it was not necessary for Zinn to quote specific numbers , as even a casual observer of the news and human events can see that crime and corruption continue to escalate , despite supposed government intervention .
Moving on Flynn utilizes a “ case study ” of the Pequot War , attempting to discredit Zinn as “ brushing aside ” the “ Pequot atrocities ” and focusing solely on that of the Puritans .
From the limited review by Mr. Flynn it would appear that Zinn has “ simplistically divided mankind into two groups : oppressors and oppressed ” when it should be immediately evident from the most superficial reading of Zinn that he is a humanist with compassion , integrity and ethics at his core , which provide the foundation for his passion regarding the obstacles of class in the struggle for equality .
With the existing body of traditional history recounting the detail of barbarism among the Pequot ’s , the relevance of delineating again is eliminated .
Flynn does not seem to consider the actions of both groups within the context of societal and cultural structure either .
Natives had long depended upon what might be considered primal tactics today for the mere process of survival as compared to the Puritan ’s whose civilized , God-fearing beliefs and values should have easily conveyed into a more sophisticated mechanism for problem solving .
With absolutely no regard , compassion or intelligent thought for the merciless persecution and carnal savagery endured for generations by black America , Flynn states that “ the fact that America was half free and the site of an anti-slavery crusade … goes unnoticed ” and that “ rather than welcoming emancipation , Zinn is depressed by it ” .
Flynn dismisses slavery and black issues as minor challenges in the history of mankind and eliminates the consideration that race and class issues are as ever present as they once were , but wrapped in a different package .
The explanation as offered by Zinn , Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. , and many other notable historians and political spectators is clear that efforts at national growth and expansion have always come through the oppression of minority groups and divisions along class lines .
It has occurred both through the use and exploitation of laborers and through the use of diversionary tactics designed to draw the focus away from genuine issues , which might actually encourage a colossal revolution in America that would overthrow the government and bring true and lasting change .
On the subject of the Communist movements ’ collaboration in the case of the young , black Scottsboro boys in Alabama , Flynn charges that although they were “ associated with the defense … in reality the Communists merely used the embattled youngsters ” to “ bring the Communist movement to the people and win them over to Communism ” .
While this utterance was intended to tarnish Zinn ’s account of the matter , in fact , Zinn has already noted that the Communists and blacks had different agenda ’s and the blacks were very aware of them , choosing regardless to align themselves for the strength which the party provided .
Flynn ’s critique of Howard Zinn is at best a wildly speculative and a far reaching attempt to disparage both his reputation and his account of history .
Zinn boldly proclaims that A People ’s History is a “ biased account ” indicating that he has no “ trouble with that because the mountain of history books under which we all stand leans so heavily in the other direction ” .
As an intellectual scholar , Mr. Flynn should be capable of considering alternate viewpoints and be able to follow the rational position that Mr. Zinn represents .
His claims to prove otherwise are lacking credulity in every sense of the word .
jose alberto lopez - 12/6/2007
This is my interpretation of the Howard Zinn being biased article .
First off … the writer did point out certain key areas that really do put Zinn on the spot , and makes a former ( even if it were the first time ) reader of Zinn question and doubt all of his statements .
Certainly every writer , reporter , news organization , teacher , or professor for that matter , has a certain agenda and / or point of view that changes the teaching or preaching style of that individual .
I most certainly agree with Daniel Flynn that a major reason for the huge sales figures is the requirment by the instructors to purchase the book .
I havent fully “ investigated ” Mr. Zinn and checked up on all that he represents , but I still think im entitled to my opinion just like global warming wakos that have no clue about the subject and use a movie ( an inconvenient truth ) and celebrities ( sheryl crow for example , with her proposition to use one square of toilet paper tissue to wipe your ass in an effort to save trees ) to back up theyre claims .
But back to the subject at hand .
After reading the Zinn materials that were assigned to us in class , its obvious that Zinn does have a built in mentality of how America is / was .
His vocabulary offends in now way , and the way he illlustrates the topics are done very well to the point where it makes you want to read more , but …
It isnt my nature to believe anyone or anything that continuosly shows one side .
Zinns sounding to be as regarding as America as nothing but Bad .
Another anti american , living in america .
Seems a bit contradictory considering how if someone really disagrees with how america is or is disgusted by its history , then why stay here ?

I wonder if anyone would consider our forefathers Marxists , or unpatriotic .
Thomas Jefferson ?
James Madison , perhaps ?
I think not .
Nor do I believe that they were puppets on a string , blowing in the wind to all atrocities those in power commmited .
Govermental powers are not absolute , but are given to them by those they govern ...
If you have any doubts , might I remind everyone what they stated in the Declaration of Independence ( and also why Madison wrote the Bill of Rights for our rights and protections from those in power ) :
" WHEN in the Course of human Events , it becomes necessary for one People to dissolve the Political Bands which have connected them with another , and to assume among the Powers of the Earth , the separate and equal Station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature ’s God entitle them , a decent Respect to the Opinions of Mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the Separation .
WE hold these Truths to be self - evident , that all Men are created equal , that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights , that among these are Life , Liberty , and the Pursuit of Happiness — That to secure these Rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just Powers from the Consent of the Governed , that whenever any form of Government becomes destructive of these Ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its Foundation on such Principles , and organizing its Powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient Causes ; and accordingly all Experience hath shewn , that Mankind are more disposed to suffer , while Evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long Train of Abuses and Usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object , evinces a Design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their Right , it is their Duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future Security . "
Hmm ... not only were they not unpatriotic , they stated it IS OUR RIGHT , IT IS OUR DUTY !!!!!!!!!!

Joseph Caramello - 8/3/2005 Zinn did fight in World War II in the U.S. Army Air Corps .
After all , the Soviet Union was our ally in that war so why should he have not fought the Nazis .
The question is who was he really fighting for us or the Soviets .
John Brent Hiller - 5/18/2005
What are you talking about ???
You have missed the point in such a dangerously ignorant way that I can't believe you 're literate .
You compare Zinn 's book with traditional history and call one fact , and the other biased fiction ?
I challenge you to disprove one sentence in Zinn 's book .
The premise of the book ( and you do n't have to read beyond the title to know this ) is to report history through the eyes of THE PEOPLE .
NOT the traditional approach that tells history by stating for example " in 1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue . "
Is this the sort of FACT that you cherish as so valuable .
Is this the sort of fact that inspires people .
Is this as far as our history teachings should probe into the past .
This is a glossed over biased report through the eyes of rich white men , and leaves out anything controversial ( and controversial does not mean fiction as you seem to indicate ) .
We have been lied to about these rich white men .
They are not the heroes our traditional history teachers have made them out to be .
Traditional history books are government approved loads of propaganda written to create narrow minded good little patriots .
But , I suppose you 're a better citizen than I am .
You tell it like it is .
You 're a real patriot with unblemished love for our heroes .
Well , God bless you , because you , unlike most of us , are worthy of God 's blessing .
Michael A. Bourbina Jr. - 1/6/2004
This is to Daniel J. Flynn :
I read some of what you wrote about Howard Zinn .
Basically what you did was say he did n't tell the whole story .
He never claimed to tell the whole story .
He even admits that the whole story can never be told .
He even offers to tell you that he is only telling you the history of the United States from the voices that do n't usually get heard .
I think he 's done it .
And I think all you 've done is call him names , progoganda writer and biased .
He admits to bias .
I read a few of his books .
I can't remember thinking that he thought Fidel Castro was a great guy or anything like you quickly joted down there .
What I remember about Cuba I mostly learned from a Venezuelan , who admitted to Cuba 's faults , but also told of how terrible -- how much worse in fact -- it was before Fidel Castro when the United States ' rich buddies and citizens were allowed to rape the country or its natural resources , while the majority of Cubans were terribly poor , great numbers of them dying from poor medication , from diseases that were nothing to our country .
Ernesto " Che " Guevara and Fidel Castro at least took it upon themselves to improve the overall state of health there and to help the people there get food and jobs .
I agree that it was a terrible thing the way they killed homosexuals and dissenters , but were there more dissenters against them or against Cuba before 1959 -- this is the underlying question to what you were talking about , and I think you misrepresent the truth about that country -- and about Howard Zinn in this case .
Really what I have to say has little weight on you , on Howard Zinn , on the world we live in .
But I just wanted you to know that I 've read Zinn 's books .
I think he 's a wonderful writer .
I think I 've learned a good deal from him .
And I think he makes a good case that the world is in the hands of the rich , the powerful , always has been , and still is , but should not be .
You fail to mention Howard Zinn 's take on violence , however .
While you like to do all but call him a communist -- you fail to mention that he is non-violent , that he was a part of the Civil Rights Movement in the South , that he was a soldier in WWII before he changed his mind about the way the world was .
Howard Zinn is a great man .
He is not God and he does n't claim to be .
He only asks his readers and students to see what power is -- who has it -- how do they use it -- how do they get away with using it to destructive ends ?
That is what Howard Zinn does .
We could all use a little more Zinn in our lives .
. - 1/5/2004
What makes you say that Howard Zinn has a " virulent hatred for this country " ?
From reading the book , I gained a completely different perspective :
That Zinn actually cares about his country , its people , and the directions it 's heading in .
The reason he is pointing out the misdeeds of the U.S. government is to present an alternative view of the glorified history we have been commonly led to accept .
While the book is guided by certain biases and ommission of certain facts while selecting certain others , he is not writing the book simply to express hatred towards America .
He obviously cares greatly about America and its people to take such pains to write the book .
Just because he attacks the government does n't mean he 's Anti-American .
It is evident that he cares about the well - being of the PEOPLE of this country , that is why it is called a PEOPLE 's history .
Jerry Ku - 12/8/2003
Zinn fought as a US bomber gunner in World War 2 , and did so proudly .
Part of his radicalisation even came from a fellow gunner who talked about radical politics , who was a Communist .
That Communist gunner was later killed on a mission ...
Zinn might not like the concept of patriotism in the same way most do .
And that Communist probably did n't like it either .
Afterall , Communists oppose the very concept of nation - states .
Still , Zinn fought for America at one point .... that 's gotta be worth somethin .
Davis D. Joyce - 10/31/2003
I 'm new to HNN .
I 'm surprised by the ranting and raving going on here , including by Flynn .
All of you interested in this will , I hope , read my book , HOWARD ZINN : A RADICAL AMERICAN VISION , just published by Prometheus Books .
Somehow Flynn 's characterization of Zinn as " anti-American " bothers me most .
See my sub -title .
I argue that Zinn 's vision is radical in the sense that it calls for fundamental change in the political / economic order ( see your dictionary ) , American in the sense that it is based on the very ideals the country itself was based upon ( see the Declaration of Independence ) , and a vision because it is not yet reality ( look around you ) .
Howard Zinn 's PEOPLE'S HISTORY obviously continues to resonate with increasing numbers of people almost 25 years after its publication ; maybe it can contribute to the on - going struggle to live up to our best American ideals .
If Flynn is correct that Zinn is " the most influential historian in America , " I find that very encouraging indeed !
J.Caramello - 10/21/2003
On the day after the 9/11 attack I read a piece in the San Diego Union that was written by Mr Zinn .
As usual he bashed this country for what had happened .
To say that his timing was a little insensitive is probably the understatement of all time .
Mr Zinn certainly has his right to his opinions but so do the rest of us .
The people that died on that day will probably be remembered in a future Zinn " history " as oppressors of the Middle East .
John - 10/21/2003
First of all , Daniel J. Flynn , misses the point of Zinn 's book and this makes his so - called review misleading an not worth the time it took to read it .
Zinn himself repeats several times in lectures and in his book that oppressed individuals often become the oppressors and vice versa .
This point , although a major point in Zinn 's book is ignored by most of the posts on here as well as the so called review .
Furthermore , many people will claim Zinn is exaggerating the truth or just plain lying .
However , in almost every argument that claims this they base it on what the dominant culture has recorded as our history .
Many of us not only see this as misleading , but realize that the recent history has already been recorded in a misleading way especially concerning 9/11 and the actions of an incompetent president .
I have not verified every case in Zinn 's book .
The ones I have chosen to have shown that there is at the very least evidence that what Zinn says is the truth or a version of one of the many possible truths .
To openly accept everything in the book is absurd but to reject it entirely is just plain closeminded .
J. Caramello - 10/17/2003
Yes he may be a " patriot " but in whose country ?
It 's certainly not this one .
Incidently I have researched some of the more strident claims he makes in his screed and found for the most part that his versions are gross exaggerations of actual events .
All have an obvious slant showing that the United States is the most evil , vicious and contemptible nation on earth .
Mr Zinn is a former Communist Party member and is now a Socialist .
Mr Zinn should take his books and emigrate to the former workers paradise and try to pull some of his stunts in that environment .
William Goldberg - 10/14/2003
I assigned sections of Zinn to a class on Peace and Justice in America .
We are focusing on " what makes a patriot " and if it is possible to be a patriot and disagree with your country .
Zinn may not have all of his facts perfect , and I do n't like per chapter bibliographies with no internal citation , but it definitely gives a different history than I learned in high school .
It is worth reading just because it sometimes makes you say " that could n't have really happened " . . . and then you go and research that topic .
Perhaps you find that it did happen , perhaps you find that it mostly happened like that .
All in all , I would say that Zinn is needed to counter some of the skewed history we teach our children in high school , all of the niceness of history written by those victorious in a war .
As for patriotism , As for patriot , http://www.m-w.com defines patriot as " one who loves his or her country and supports its authority and interests " .
I have taught my students that loving your country so much that you question its policies and how it treats its people and its history make them patriots , even if society currently disagrees .
Zinn is a patriot to me .
Joe Caramello - 9/15/2003
I had to read Zinn 's Peoples History as part of a history class .
After finishing the book , I came to the conclusion that Mr Zinn has a virulent hatred for this country .
This was the most biased book purporting to be history that I have ever had the misfortune to read .
This man literally despises the United States and everything that it stands for .
If it were up to him the country would have never been founded .
This person more than most personifies the " Loony Left " at its most extreme .
Steven Malcolm Anderson - 8/17/2003
You are right .
I am lucky to have been born in the United States of America .
I am proud to be a loyal supporter of my country and her Constitution , including _all_ of the Bill of Rights .
I am proud to have as my countrymen those two heroic men John Geddes Lawrence and Tyron Garner , who stood up for their freedom and mine .
I am lucky to have had a man like Justice Anthony Kennedy on my country 's Supreme Court .
Now we can all enjoy the unalienable right to privacy in our own homes , along with other vital freedoms such as free speech and the right of the people to keep and bear arms .
Barrie Bracken - 8/15/2003
Howard
Zinn is idolized by the general population of readers because the facts are boring compared to the fantasy that belittles the good effect the existence of the U. S. has had on the world .
Howard Zinn as an historian is equal to the " journalists " who compose the tabloids found at the supermarket check - outs .
As a young man I was as left as Zinn , maybe , to my stand , he was on the right , but maturity has left me with a deeper understanding of the workings of history .
History is , after all , the interpretation , not just the telling , of the past of humanity .
An historian viewing the revolutionary era in this country and the world today must see the time in the eyes of the participants , not in the eyes of some 19th century philosopher alone .
Should the ideas of Marx be considered ?
Certainly .
But in their proper context .
Zinn would take us back in religion to say the Judeo - Christian philosophy must consider only the admonision to take an eye for an eye .
Is it the job of the historian to point out the errors of our past and warn of the errors being repeated in the future ?
Yes .
Is the job of the historian to present the world as nihilist ?
No .
Whatever worth Zinn has to civilization is minimal , at best .
Joshua Chernin - 6/27/2003
Ok , last time I checked , history occured in a political context .
In other words , yes , history is political , and pretending that it is not is doing it injustice , as Zinn so himself put it , becasue the purpose of looking at the past in the first place is to learn from what we have done wrong and to prevent similar mistakes in the future .
Of course Zinn focuses on the parts of our history we 're ashamed of , that 's the point .
So we can learn from it .
Ignoring it , and just saying our country 's great is like randomly waving a flag and saying THAT makes you patriotic when you do n't even have a clue what this country is about ...
NYGuy - 6/20/2003 LAGuy ,
I appreciate your comments .
Issues have to be in context , be balanced , benchmarked and have a frame of reference .
Please tell all your friends .
We may have done somethings wrong , but we are lucky for those who made this the great country it is .
Cheers and good luck .
LAGuy - 6/20/2003
That comment about Babe Ruth was excellent .
I will tell everyone who tries to defame this great nation that analogy .
Also well put about the Japanese internment camps of World War II .
I too think this policy was wrong ; however , I never thought about it the way you put it .
Thanks
James Lambert - 6/19/2003
You obviously have no real criticism of Daniel Flynn to offer , nor do you seem to have a good grasp of the English language .
1 ) The fact that “ slander ” has a legal definition , which is different from common usage is neither here nor there .
Everyone , including you , knew what Mr. Flynn meant .
2 ) Your closing sentence is simply pathetic :
>> But else beside rank stupidity can anyone expect from a Reed Irvine apparatchik ?
But know you bad communicator .
Jamie
Josh Greenland - 6/18/2003
" This slanderous tome and its popular and academic success are monuments to human credulity and delusion , and to the disgraceful condition of American letters . "
How can a tome be slanderous .
Is n't slander spoken and libel written ?
But else beside rank stupidity can anyone expect from a Reed Irvine apparatchik ?
Horatio - 6/17/2003
When are we going to get a smear piece on Paul Johnson ?
Do n't let Daniel Pipes be the only one spewing invective .
NYGuy - 6/16/2003 Josh ,
The problem is not the history , its the predjudices of the history teachers who should have been trained better .
Unless of course they were trained to twist the facts to their own political philosophy .
But , then , that is what history has become .
After reading about Babe Ruth 's strikeouts I have now lost another hero .
Josh Greenland - 6/16/2003
Could you recommend any histories that do the things you describe ?
This is a separate question : are there any you could recommend written by authors whose politics you strongly disagree with ?
NYGuy - 6/16/2003 Hepatitus
No one said the U. S. was perfect .
But , what is so " goofy " about the analysis of Babe Ruth ?
As a trained historian you should be able to give a better answer to this analysis than it is " Goofy ” Yet you accept Zinn at face value .
What is factually wrong in the Babe Ruth comments ?
As you say we have to look at the bad with the good .
You are not suggesting that your ” Goofy ” remark means that you are subjective and believe and teach only what you want others to believe and this is what you teach your students ?
You say :
1. ” The extermination of Indians . ”
Indians are still a part of our population and were heroes in defending our country in the Second World War .
2 . “ The lynchings , averaging two a week , of African Americans starting in the 1890s . ”
I do n’t want to sound callous about this statement but that is 104 deaths a year , which in the total scheme of the U. S. and world History is very small .
In Russia alone the Pogroms killed more people .
The Jews had no place to turn but to the U. S. and there was a large immigration of East Europeans into this country around the turn of the century .
Meanwhile slavery was still a part of the world and vicious crimes were being perpetrated against citizens of just about all countries .
3 . “ The end of immigration in the 20s on eugenecist grounds . ”
The U.S. was in a deep depression , veteran ’s marched on Washington for jobs , farmers had the dust bowl and college graduates sold apples on the street .
Your solution , bring in more mouths to feed and put more American ’s out of work .
4. The internment of the Japanese Americans . ”
I will not defend this policy but we were at war and many civil liberties were curtailed .
Do you also teach about the Bataan death march , the rape of Nanking , the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor , the Bund meeting in NYC and elsewhere by those who supported Hitler ?
Do you tell your students that Canada had the same fears as the U. S. during this time of war and had similar policies to the U. S ?
Do you also tell your students that we were at war ?
That there were spies in this country trying to help the enemy and supplying them with information that got people killed .
Do you know why they used the phase , “ A slip of the lip can sink ships . ”
Meanwhile the civil liberties of all Americans were suspended during WWII when people could not buy gas , meat and other products at will .
They had to cover their windows at night , or shut their lights off so submarines off shore could not use cities as a guide for navigation .
Some citizens were prevented from continuing their schooling and put into the Army or Navy with all its restrictions .
My grandmother had to register since she was not born in this country .
The list goes on .
The widows of those KIA for putting their lives on the line probably got a lot less than the settlements received by those interned .
And , as far as I know , all those interned remained in the U. S. after many American ’s were killed defending these people and saving the world .
I understand many Japanese families were separated .
Do you tell your students that many more American families were separated during this war and many were killed .
The reason the Babe Ruth story bothers you is because you understand the key defect which is , as Heretous says , this is not a balanced report .
It is not benchmarked against anything and has no frame of reference .
When we accept such analyses without these considerations we get very biased teaching and propaganda .
Herodotus - 6/15/2003
" I 'm serious -- what sort of history do you people think it 's ok to teach ? "
That 's easy : balanced history .
One free from bias and as objective as possible .
One that distances the problems of the present from the analysis of the past .
One that is dispassionate , but still engaging .
That 's so hard ?
Hepatitus - 6/14/2003
Look you two -- be as proud as you want .
There 's lots to celebrate .
But you two are supposed to be historians .
Should historians just ignore things that are n't pleasing ?
There are some nasty aspects to American history -- the extermination of indians , the lynchings , averaging two a week , of African Americans starting in the 1890s , the end of immigration in the 20s on eugenecist grounds , the internment of the Japanese Americans -- there are many nasty aspects to Us history just as there are many nasty aspects to all countries ' histories .
What are we supposed to do -- just ignore these facts ?
Should i teach course on the 1890s , and pretend that the JimCrow laws were never passed ?
I 'm serious -- what sort of history do you people think it 's ok to teach ?
Les Milton - 6/13/2003
Why do you assume I 'm a leftist ( let a alone a Marxist ) ?
Do only leftists criticize U.S. foreign policy ?
I 'm getting the feeling you 're actually some kind of primitive computer program , capable of issuing only rote , meaningless phrases .
Addressing a specific question in a rational manner would help convince me that you are , in fact , a human being .
Homer Simpson - 6/13/2003
This guy makes sense .
This rarely happens here .
I applaud .
God bless America .
Somebody tell me why , in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union , Marxism has infected the supposedly intellectual class of America ?
What happened to make so many who consider themselves so bright so damned stupid .
God did n't did .
Marxism did .
Homer Simpson - 6/13/2003
You see it on this board all the time .
Judging from the tortured responses , you 'd never understand that the past 40 years has been a landslide of comment denouncing the U.S. for the crimes of imperialism , racism , etc .
This point of view is hackneyed .
It 's been said a million times .
The era of every citizen holding his or her own foreign policy is over .
I 'm calling the people one this board who think this hate the U.S. rhetoric novel " morons " because they are .
The leftists who dominate this board keep insisting that this analysis is fresh and courageous .
It 's just the same old drivel .
Here 's the problem the left needs to confront .
God did n't die .
Marxism did .
This has gutted the left .
NYGuy - 6/13/2003 Babe Ruth struck out many times .
The actual number which I do n't remember is a fact .
I was just reading a book about the " Babe " , titled , " Babe Ruth was a loser . "
The author focuses on his number of strikeouts and concludes that the " Babe " was not really a good player and has no place in the Hall of Fame .
The author points out the many times when the babe had men on base and he struck out .
He even struck out with no men on base , one man on base and two men on base .
He never struck out with women on base because they were not permitted to play at time .
Still the Babe was a chauvanist and never fought for women 's rights .
He was also a racist who never played against teams that had non-whites on it .
Many other examples are given to show the " Babe " was self centered and only played to make money and get rich , for his own pleasure and amusement and really if ever did anything to improve the plight of the poor and downtrodden .
He also cheated the management and bosses of the Yankees with all his strikeouts .
The fans in the stands were cheated when this happened , as well as the man in street who worshipped the Babe .
These strike outs happened thousands of times and the Babe did nothing about them , but continued on with his sloppy way .
This book reminded me of Zinn 's portrayal of America .
No wonder we can't be proud , particularly when we can't even have a hero in baseball .
Les Milton - 6/12/2003 Calling critics of the U.S. " morons " implies you have no intellectual response to their criticisms .
You would n't want people to think that , would you ?
How is it against one 's self - interest to take responsibility for one 's mistakes ?
The president is also a representative of our country and to say that there are no circumstances which merit an apology from us , is to admit to such arrogance and absence of honor as to tarnish the moral land intellectual reputation of the U.S. .
You have to be pretty defensive to take criticisms of the U.S. as saying how " awful " the country is .
Is it impossible to criticize your parents and still love them ?
Does pointing out a flaw in your spouse mean you think he / she is absolutely worthless ?
Of course , not .
Try to relax .
Les Milton - 6/12/2003
I do n't think I ever implied that George Bush Sr. was less credible a historian than Zinn , because he 's not .
He was our president , our leader , and our representative to the world .
One only has to look objectively at U.S. foreign policy over the last 50 years to see that there are many mistakes made by the U.S. government that cost innocents their lives .
Anyone with any honor whatsoever knows that when one makes a mistake that hurts others , one apologizes .
And what 's worse , Bush Sr. 's comment implies that there are NO circumstances which merit apology .
This is a position devoid of honor or courage .
I 've never heard Zinn or any other leftist say that the U.S. is the " worst country in the world " .
Only that it has yet to take responsibility for its mistakes .
And it 's rather silly to be proud to be an American , unless you 're an immigrant .
I feel lucky to be an American , but I had nothing to do with being born here .
One might as well be proud to have a certain eye color .
David Salmanson - 6/12/2003 Thanks Caroline .
I remember reading several book reviews on recent work on the Pequot war but could n't locate which titles were the better ones .
Although a typical " leftist academic " I do not think of Zinn as a particularly good historian .
He is , however , an extremely talented polemicist and that is why his writing teaches so well .
Whether they agree with him or not , students are forced to confront their own assumptions and construct coherent responses .
This results in better thinking by all students .
Caroline Ward - 6/11/2003
For anyone reading these exchanges interested in the most recent scholarship on the Pequot War ( which accords fully with neither Howard Zinn - - not an expert on colonial history by any measure -- nor Mr. Flynn 's tirade [ good grief !
could n't he find a better , more accurate , and less biased source on the war than John G. Palfrey , who has all the racist prejudices of other 19th c. authors ] ) , I suggest Alfred Cave 's recent eponymous and probably definitive book , The Pequot War .
It is far more even handed than either Flynn or Zinn .
Yes , the Pequots were aggressors vs. other tribes ; yes , they initially attacked the settlers ( but the first English men to die , it is now believed , were NOT killed by Pequots ) ; but yes , also , the burning of the Mystic fort , with hundreds of women & children ( not warriors ) inside , was a great atrocity , one so terrible it horrified the Narragansett allies of the English .
Nicholas Freedman - 6/11/2003
Why is HNN printing this kind of rhetorical nonsense ?
There are many rightist academics who could supply a counterbalance to the arguments of Professor Zinn .
While I probably would n't agree with many of them , it would further the historical discourse that this site is supposed to be about .
Come on , HNN , you can do better .
And you are trying to fundraise ?
There is plenty of genuine scholarship from across the politcal and ideological spectrum .
Why go to the pseudo - intellectual punditry that passes itself off as scholarship in the popular media ?
Homer Simpson - 6/11/2003
No , he 's the president and commander - in - chief .
His job is to represent the self - interest of our nation to the best of his ability .
You morons can gas about how awful the U.S. is .
Evidently some of you get paid to make a nuisance of yourselves in this fashion .
And , it 's not like this gassing has been in short supply .
We 've been fed a nauseating diet of it for four decades .
No , Prez Bush is absolutely right .
He should n't apologize for anything .
He should fight for the self - interest of the U.S .
That 's his job .
Homer Simpson - 6/11/2003
Why wo n't leftists worship the real god ?
The false god of Marxism continues to tempt our moral betters .
Even after the 100 million executions .
And , then the morons want to lecture the rest of us .
Astonishing !
The Marxists used the social movements you 've mentioned in the hope that they could spread chaos , hatred and violence in the U.S.
That those movements had value has nothing to do with the Marxist attempt to subvert the U.S.
This has always been the Marxist ruse , and here we have another bunch of morons falling for it .
Useful idiots of the world , keep belching out the fumes !
Arnold , why do n't you get some real religion , instead of the fake Marxist religion ?
Well , that would entail revealing your motives .
Marxism is n't called the politics of envy for nothing .
Marxism is Nazism .
Marxists are Nazis .
The result is what counts .
How does this idiocy continue ?
Homer Simpson - 6/11/2003
I 'm glad he finally admitted it .
God did n't die , Kirstein .
Marx did .
Marxism is Nazism .
There is no difference .
Kirstein is a worshipper of the False God .
He missed the primary moral lesson of the 20th century .
How 's that arm , Peter ?
The patting yourself on the back has got to be painful .
I knew you were completely ignorant .
Was n't aware that you are without any moral compass as well .
Arnold A. Offner - 6/11/2003 Sorry Mr. Flynn , but the truth is that if Howard Zinn did not exist , it would be necessary -- and my pleasure - - to invent him .
Since the 1940s he has has served as one of this nation 's moral consciences in addressing the great issues of our life time : civil rights , the dreadful war in Vietnam , and all the social welfare issues you might care to list .
We are all the richer for his contributions to our society .
May they continue ....
dan - 6/11/2003
“ Objectivity is impossible , ” Zinn once remarked , “ and it is also undesirable . "
In that one sentence , Zinn has proven himself infinitely more capable of holding a reasoned discourse ( AND more objective ) than ANY of the current wave of hate - America - first right wing pundits pandering to the ignorant masses in our country today .
No wonder they fear this guy so much !
NYGuy - 6/11/2003 Les ,
What is the difference between these two statements ?
GW Said : " The promise of our Constitution and our ideals are doomed if we adopt the attitude of George H.W. Bush when he said , " I 'll never apologize for the United States .
I do n't care what the facts are . "
I agree with him .
Facts have to be weighted to reach a good conclusion .
I do n't believe the negative facts overwhelm GW 's observation .
What period in history was the US a less worthy country than others in the world .
Every country experienced fighting , violence and many supported slavery , particularly in Africa .
This is what you said about Zinn : " Obviously , his ideology does interfere with his objectivity . "
What makes him more creditable than GW .
And when you weigh his statements about our problems or weaknesses , do you come out with an opinion that the US is the worst country in the world and therefore we have no right to feel proud ?
Hepatitus - 6/11/2003
Everyone is -- " bias " is the reason we provide footnotes .
The great thing about zinn 's book is it has a strong argument and makes a provocative point .
I use it in class , and even the most conservative students like its anti elite , egaltarian focus .
There are any number of texts which teach history as cheerleading , and students find them tedious , as they have hear dit all before .
zinn 's book provokes -- it provokes conservative students into strengthening their arguments , among other things .
I do n't agree with everything in it , but then I do n't agree with everything in ANY book
This is a dumb piece , but sadly , it 's well calculated to ride the wave of cheerleading books by Hannity , Savage et. al .
The authors pat themsleves on the back for being bold and contrary , but as is often observed , it takes no particular courage to tell people they are great .
People like to here that .
Getting them to understand that greatness is mixed with baseness , virtue with venality , success with failure , is harder , but it would be easier if dumb books like this were n't out there .
Herodotus - 6/10/2003 to have phrases like this :
" The New York Times ? s reviewer ( no doubt a cousin of Jayson Blair ) declared that the book should be ? required reading ? for students "
if you 're trying to encourage accuracy in recounting events .
Is the review a cousin of Jayson Blair ?
Is he not ?
Is it just a cheap shot ( clearly it is ) and does it weaken the importance of the sentence ( absolutely ) .
Peter N Kirstein - 6/10/2003
Actually the first line of Marx and Engels 's Communist Manifesto is , " A Spectre is Haunting Europe - - the spectre of Communism , " and not “ The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle . ”
Perhaps had Mr Flynn been as fortunate as I was to matriculate in Professor Zinn 's Marxism course at Boston University , he would have avoided the error .
I have used Professor Zinn's , " A People 's History " for many years and students find it very provocative and readable .
In fact his teachings and writings were formative events in my life and I can assure Mr Flynn that opposing American militarism , racism and imperialism is in keeping with a democracy 's need for vital and sustained criticism of public and foreign policy .
Paul - 6/10/2003 Mr. Flynn 's writing takes a cluster bomb approach to argumentations : spray enough bad stuff around and hope it hits something worth hitting .
It is this essay that is a monument to credulity and delusion .
What a pathetic diatribe .
Federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald famously declared in the Valerie Plame affair that “ there is a cloud over the vice president . ”
Last week ’s release of an FBI interview summary of Dick Cheney ’s answers in the criminal investigation underscores why Fitzgerald felt that way .
On 72 occasions , according to the 28 - page FBI summary , Cheney equivocated to the FBI during his lengthy May 2004 interview , saying he could not be certain in his answers to questions about matters large and small in the Plame controversy .
ADVERTISEMENT
The Cheney interview reflects a team of prosecutors and FBI agents trying to find out whether the leaks of Plame ’s CIA identity were orchestrated at the highest level of the White House and carried out by , among others , I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby , Cheney ’s chief of staff .
Among the most basic questions for Cheney in the Plame probe : How did Libby find out that the wife of Bush administration war critic Joseph Wilson worked at the CIA ?
Libby ’s own handwritten notes suggest Libby found out from Cheney .
When Libby discovered Cheney ’s reference to Plame and the CIA in his notes — notes that Libby knew he would soon have to turn over to the FBI — the chief of staff went to the vice president , probably in late September or early October 2003 .
Sharing the information with Cheney was in itself an unusual step at the outset of a criminal investigation in which potential White House witnesses were being ordered by their superiors not to talk to each other about the Plame matter .
“ It turns out that I have a note that I had heard about ” Plame ’s CIA identity “ from you , ” Libby says he told the vice president .
ADVERTISEMENT
And what did Cheney say in response ?
Fitzgerald asked Libby in front of a federal grand jury six months later .
“ He did n’t say much , ” Libby replied .
“ You know , he said something about ‘ From me ? ’ something like that , and tilted his head , something he does commonly , and that was that . ”
LOS ANGELES ( Reuters ) - “ American Idol ” runner - up Adam Lambert on Wednesday admitted he got carried away during his racy American Music Awards performance , as furor over his singing and dancing stoked a wider controversy in the U.S. gay community .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
More than 14 million people watched the gay , glam rocker close the live AMA telecast on Sunday with a performance that included Lambert kissing a male keyboard player and pushing the head of another performer into his crotch .
Complaints poured in to the ABC TV network that aired the show , and it canceled the Lambert ’s appearance on its “ Good Morning America ” news and chat show set for Wednesday .
Yet rival network CBS put him on its “ The Early Show ” program , where Lambert claimed he had not intended to provoke audiences but declined to apologize , saying : “ I ’m not a baby - sitter .
I ’m a performer . ”
“ I admit I did get carried away , but I do n’t see anything wrong with it .
I do see how people got offended , and that was not my intention , ” he said .
“ If it had been a female pop performer doing the moves that were on the stage , I do n’t think there ’d be nearly as much of an outrage at all , ” Lambert added .
“ I think it ’s because I ’m a gay male . ”
The “ Early Show ” also ran video footage that blurred Lambert ’s male kiss , and doing so caused the network its own problem .
Gay rights groups accused CBS of hypocrisy by also playing unedited video of a kiss between Madonna and Britney Spears at 2003 ’s MTV Video Music Awards .
The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) said the CBS decision “ reinforces an unfortunate double standard that is applied to openly gay performers . ”
CBS said it had thought hard about the issue .
“ The Madonna image is very familiar and has appeared countless times including many times on morning television .
The Adam Lambert image is a subject of great current controversy , has not been nearly as widely disseminated , and for all we know , may still lead to legal consequences , ” a CBS News spokesperson said .
The broadcast of material deemed obscene or indecent can leave U.S. TV networks open to fines .
Some members of the gay community also scorned Lambert .
Jennifer Vanasco , editor in chief of website 365 gay.com , said his performance hurt the cause of gay marriage in the eyes of mainstream Americans “ who think gay life is exactly what ( he ) portrayed on the American Music Awards . ”
Lambert , 27 , took a flair for showmanship , powerful vocals and sexual ambivalence all the way to the finals of top-rated U.S. TV show “ American Idol ” in May .
But his weekend performance at the AMAs has drawn mixed results .
ABC received more than 1,500 complaints , but sales of Lambert ’s debut album “ For Your Entertainment ” are strong .
Released on Monday through Sony Music Entertainment , “ For Your Entertainment ” was No. 3 on the iTunes U.S. album chart by Wednesday night .
Music industry sources told Billboard magazine it is outperforming expectations and could sell about 225,000 units in its first week .
This is Sunday , so this is a " tech talk " about getting fossil fuel out of the ground .
While some previous posts have dealt with sandstone and carbonate deposits I ’m going to be talking about getting gas out of shale for a couple of weeks , and so , before I started talking about Horizontal Wells , we ’d better chat for a minute or so about shale .
And when I do n’t give an alternate reference for the information , I am likely quoting from the Primer on Natural Gas in Shale , from the Department of Energy .
Folk who live near rivers , or along their outlet to the sea are familiar with the large mud flats that can develop around the outlet .
These flats , which extend out into the sea , can cover large areas .
When I was in school at Lancaster in the UK , we went to Morecambe Bay when my parents came to visit , and the large areas exposed when the tide ebbed remain a lasting memory .
Through geological time these beds of mud have lain under large stretches of water , and so , as the algae that floated in the water died , they fell , and were caught in the mud .
The mud is largely made up of clays , which in very small sizes are shaped a bit like a plate , and so as they settle , capturing and covering the algae remains , they tend to create layers ( which can later tell us some of the conditions at the time they were deposited ) .
When conditions are right – generally with a relatively warm sea containing a lot of nutrients – the sea can host vast colonies of algae , and over geological time the death of these algae built up considerable organic matter in the mud on the sea bed .
The main gas shale deposits in North America are in the Barnett shale , the Fayetteville , the Woodford , the Haynesville , and the Marcellus while , in Canada , the large fields are in the Horn River and Montney deposits .
Not that there are not others , but these are the ones that the Oil and Gas Journal calls “ The Magnificent Seven . ”
As an example the Barnett shale was deposited during the Mississippian Epoch , itself part of the Carboniferous Era , between 315 and 350 million years ago .
At that time the map of the Earth looked at bit like this ) .
Shape of the Land and Seas at the time of the Mississippean Epoch
However not all the shales were deposited at that time .
The Haynesville , for example is much younger , having been laid down in Jurassic Era , ( remember the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park ? ) which was some140 to 200 million years or so ago , and when the globe looked a bit more familiar .
The map of the earth some 195 million years ago during the Jurassic
The mud that was deposited grew to be very thick – even after it was compressed by the weight of overlying additional sediments that turned into rock , the Barnett shale still can measure between 50 and 600 ft thick .
The individual particles that made up the mud were quite small , so that , as the material was compressed , the resulting rock became relatively impervious .
Thus if the gas - generating algal remains were trapped , they were held in the shale , but dispersed throughout it , rather than concentrated in larger pore spaces , such as are found in sandstones .
And , to be economic , there still needs to be a significant amount trapped within the pore space , which needs to be at least in the 5 – 12 % range to hold enough gas to be worthwhile .
Putting this into a different context , the Barnett , for example , is estimated to hold about 325 scf ( cubic feet at a standard defined temperature and atmospheric pressure ) of natural gas per ton of rock – or in about 13 cubic feet of rock .
( Needless to say deep in the ground the gas is very compressed ) .
As the rock was buried deeper , so the temperature and the pressure also rose , gradually “ cooking ” the organic material over time .
Depending on how deep the rock was buried , and the temperature , the material either turned into an oil , or if it were buried deeper and at a hotter temperature , it would turn into a gas .
The relative conditions that set these bounds are sometimes referred to as the oil and gas windows for rock , and can be illustrated with a graph .
Geothermal gradients defining the oil and gas windows as a function of depth and temperature .
( From WVU )
The current reservoir depths at which the different shales are now found can differ quite significantly from those at which the gas or oil was first formed , with depths for the Fayetteville being as little as 3,000 ft ( 0.9 km ) to the Haynesville which can be at more than 14,000 ft. ( 4.3 km ) .
The Barnett is around 6 - 8,000 ft ( 2.4 km ) .
Permeability , or the ease with which gas , oil or water can flow through a rock is measured in a unit called a Darcy , but it is sufficiently large that most rock permeabilities are measured in thousandths of a Darcy , or millidarcies ( Md ) .
As a point of reference for a rock with a good permeability such as the Ghawar oilfield in Saudi Arabia , Greg Croft quotes values in the 600 Md range .
A microdarcy is one thousandth of the value of a millidarcy , and it is this unit that the permeability of gas shales are often measured .
Thus the permeability of the Marcellus shale can be around 20 microdarcy and the Barnett around 10 microdarcy .
The density of the rock can be seen from the sample pieces shown at the Chesapeake Web site .
Illustration of gas shales from the Chesapeake web site .
These fine - grained rocks with low permeabilities mean that the producer has to rely on other paths within the rock to allow the gas to escape .
Originally this was just the natural fractures that can be found in the rock .
As the rock compresses vertical fractures often generate within the rock .
These fractures can be quite consistent , though in contrast to the bedding , they normally occur vertically .
Shale fractures from Geology.com
The problem is that conventional vertical wells do n’t intersect a lot of these fractures , and thus , when the gas shales were first drilled the production was very low , and often uneconomic .
However when horizontal wells were developed it became easier to intersect a lot of these fractures as the well moved along the reservoir , and so it is time to introduce horizontal wells in the next post .
As usual this has been a very short description of a relatively complex topic , and so questions , and comments are appreciated .
A Wish Tree is an individual tree , usually distinguished by species , position or appearance , which is used as an object of wishes and offerings .
Such trees are identified as possessing a special religious or spiritual value .
By tradition , believers make votive offerings in order to gain from that nature spirit , saint or goddess fulfillment of a wish .
The High Force Waterfall has a coin only wish tree in the grounds of the waterfall .
In Hindu mythology , the banyan tree is also called kalpavriksha , meaning “ wish - fulfilling tree ” , as it represents eternal life because of its seemingly ever - expanding branches .
The Wishing Tree or Kissing Tree was made at Christmas or Yuletide before pine trees were introduced by Prince Albert of Saxe - Coburg and Gotha in 1840 .
An evergreen bough was hung with apples , sweetmeats , and candles and decked with ribbons representing wishes .
At the summit of the Fereneze Braes in Neilston , Renfrewshire , Scotland , there was an old hawthorn , well known locally as “ The Kissing Tree ” .
The story goes that if a young man could drive a nail fully into the thorn tree with a single blow , then he would be entitled to “ ae fond kiss ” on the spot from his sweetheart .
Success in the task was considered proof of his suitability as a good suitor for the young lady .
The original tree fell in around 1860 , but in 1910 , a replacement was said to exist .
Driving a nail into the tree may link the custom with that of driving coins into trees as noted above .
In parts of Yorkshire , a tree with two spreading branches which also formed a bower over the point of branching , was known as a Wish Tree by children who would climb onto the junction and make a wish .
All news here with some spices and freshness .
The video game clone has been around since the dawn of the medium , as developers attempted to build on the ideas of others ... or maybe they were just ripping them off .
It 's a sticky situation .
Most developers understandably do n't want to discuss it , but the subject keeps coming up .
This is thanks in no small part part to the popularity of platforms like the iPhone , Facebook , and other digital delivery outlets where being first to the market is often a primary factor in success .
The result is a proliferation of games that both look and play very similarly , if not identically , and plenty of titles that have been forced to change or else be taken off the market .
But what exactly defines a clone ?
Is there a fine line that separates theft from inspiration ?
Ars investigates , and thatgamecompany 's Jenova Chen provides his own take on the issue .
" I think the fine line between a clone and a product influenced by others is very similar to our college essay standard , " Jenova Chen , cofounder and creative director of thatgamecompany told Ars .
Chen is the main visionary behind games like Flower and flOw .
" You can reference some one 's work by quoting and giving credit to them or digesting their material and summarizing it in your own words .
It wo n't count as plagiarism as long as you do n't directly copy and paste other people 's work without adding your own . "
Of course , it 's not always that simple .
" Miss one element , whether it's the visual or the story , [ and ] the whole gameplay will be very different , " he said .
" A platforming game without Mario wo n't have the Mario experience . "
Chen became tangled up in the messy world of game clones when he spotted a free iPhone game called Aquatica , which looked nearly identical to TGC's flOw and initially did not reference the original creator .
" The whole event regarding to Aquatica is unfortunate , " Chen explained .
" The developer really loved flOw and wanted to create something just like that on iPhone .
It could be a wonderful thing for both parties if presented properly .
He recreated the entire game by himself thinking it would n't be plagiarism .
However , just like a college essay , if you write down all the sentences yourself but the use of the words within these sentences are from other people 's work , we consider it plagiarism .
It just does n't feel right , when there is almost nothing significant changed in Aquatica compared to flOw .
Even a different background color could have made the difference .
" What bothers me the most is that because of my own overreaction , I might have created a lot of inconvenience to the creator of Aquatica and interrupted his game making , " he added .
" He is clearly talented , and certainly a fan of flOw .
I hope he can continue creating video games , but with his own design . "
The developer has since made the game unavailable , saying on its website : " Because the game seemed to be upsetting so many , we have decided to remove it completely .
We will also make sure nothing like this ever happens in the future — we understand our mistake , and will be working very hard to correct it and make amends . "
Tthe iPhone has become notorious for this sort of thing .
Games like Peggie — a game that not only has a similar title to PopCap 's addictive puzzle game Peggle , but plays similarly , as well — have been forced to change or run the risk of being pulled from the app store .
Meanwhile , The Tetris Company seems to be constantly rooting out games that could be confused with the legendary falling block puzzle game .
We contacted both PopCap and The Tetris Company to discuss the matter , but both declined to comment .
What 's interesting about these two examples is the double - standard that seems to be in place .
Peggie was n't forced to change the way it plays in any way — despite the similarities to Peggle — just its name .
The same goes for a game like Bejeweled , which popularized the match - three puzzle formula , which can now be seen in numerous other games including the Puzzle Quest series .
These forms of gameplay appear to be fair game , yet the Tetris formula is not .
Lining up rows of blocks is just a game mechanic , but those now - iconic shapes ?
Off the market .
Things are just as bad on one of the fastest growing gaming platforms , Facebook .
The social network features numerous , near - identical games in different genres , like farming or restaurant management .
Being the first developer to release a new type of the game on the service is very important to garner an audience , so companies race to get titles out as fast as possible .
Just look at these two images from Zynga 's Cafe World and Playfish 's Restaurant City , the two most popular restaurant sims on Facebook .
Cafe World by Zynga .
Restaurant City by Playfish .
Everything from the menus to the graphics to the on - screen display is nearly identical , this despite the fact that Cafe World was released nearly six months after Restaurant City .
Playfish , which was recently purchased by Electronic Arts , is one of the few developers on the platform that does n't seem to take this approach , instead focusing on quality games that actually bring something new to the table .
The company 's farming title Country Story , for example , is an objective - based game that differs greatly from competing games like FarmVille , Farm Town , and Island Paradise .
" We do have a hands - off stance on the subject since it just would n't be appropriate for Playfish to comment on competitors ' games , " Playfish director of global communications Tom Sarris told Ars .
" It really all simply boils down to a philosophical difference in the approach to development , and we do n't feel there 's necessarily a right or wrong way at this point .
The marketplace will ultimately be the judge . "
And the marketplace has judged .
According to AllFacebook.com , while Playfish and Zynga are the top two developers on the platform , Zynga has nearly four times the market share of Playfish , with approximately 214 million monthly active users across all of its games , showing that consumers are n't necessarily all that concerned with originality .
But , of course , just because developers can do something , does n't mean they should .
" I do n't like plagiarism , because it 's a product of laziness , " Chen told Ars .
" It does no good but waste the time of people who have seen similar things before .
However , ' standing on the giant 's shoulder ' is about creating something new on top of what 's good from the past .
And that kind of reference and inspiration are always welcomed . "
A fusion between my binary and actual self , this blog is a digital snapshot of my ephemeral thoughts .
