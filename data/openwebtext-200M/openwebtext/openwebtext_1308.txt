Sarah Palin 's highly anticipated memoir , Going Rogue : An American Life , will hit the bookshelves November 17 .
In the book , Palin traces her experiences from small town Alaskan girl to being on the national stage as the GOP vice presidential nominee .
Besides addressing her views on the McCain campaign and the media , Palin , a passionate Alaskan hunter , takes aim at vegetarians .
Palin states , " If any vegans came over for dinner , I could whip them up a salad , then explain my philosophy on being a carnivore :
If God had not intended for us to eat animals , how come He made them out of meat ? "
The accommodating host went on to explain , " I love meat .
I eat pork chops , thick bacon burgers , and the seared fatty edges of a medium - well - done steak .
But I especially love moose and caribou .
I always remind people from outside our state that there 's plenty of room for all Alaska 's animals -- right next to the mashed potatoes . "
Unfortunately Palin's viewpoints on vegetarianism is not only narrow minded but is also widely shared .
The cliché portrait of a vegetarian meal predominately includes a huge bowl of salad flanked only by a glass of water and carrot wedges .
The plethora of food options available to those who have forgone meat is endless but mostly ignored by the masses .

The e-mails were posted on the internet last month The UN 's official panel on climate change has hit back at sceptics ' claims that the case for human influence on global warming has been exaggerated .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) said it was " firmly " standing by findings that a rise in the use of greenhouse gases was a factor .
It was responding to a row over the reliability of data from East Anglia University 's Climatic Research Unit Leaked e-mail exchanges prompted claims that data had been manipulated .
Last month , hundreds of messages between scientists at the unit and their peers around the world were put on the internet along with other documents .
Some observers alleged one of the e-mails suggested head of the unit Professor Phil Jones wanted certain papers excluded from the UN 's next major assessment of climate science .
The body of evidence is the result of the careful and painstaking work of hundreds of scientists worldwide
Professor Thomas Stocker and Professor Qin Dahe , IPCC Professor Jones , who denies this was his intention , has stood down from his post while an independent inquiry takes place .
In a statement , Professor Thomas Stocker and Professor Qin Dahe , co-chairmen of the IPCC 's working group 1 , condemned the act of posting the private e-mails on the internet , but avoided commenting on their content .
They went on to point to a key finding that states : " The warming in the climate system is unequivocal .
" [ It ] is based on measurements made by many independent institutions worldwide that demonstrate significant changes on land , in the atmosphere , the ocean and in the ice - covered areas of the Earth .
" Through further independent scientific work involving statistical methods and a range of different climate models , these changes have been detected as significant deviations from natural climate variability and have been attributed to the increase of greenhouse gases . "
They added : " The body of evidence is the result of the careful and painstaking work of hundreds of scientists worldwide .
There is an anti-science group , there is a flat Earth group , if I may say so , over the scientific evidence for climate change
Gordon Brown , Prime Minister
" The internal consistency from multiple lines of evidence strongly supports the work of the scientific community , including those individuals singled out in these e-mail exchanges . "
The row comes ahead of the Copenhagen climate summit which starts on Monday .
Professor Jean - Pascal van Ypersele , vice - chairman of the IPCC , said it was no coincidence the information was released in the run-up to the summit .
He claimed unnamed conspirators could have paid for Russian hackers to break into the university computers to steal the e-mails .
He said the theft was a scandal and was " probably ordered " to disrupt the confidence negotiators have in the science .
Earlier , Climate Change Secretary Ed Miliband told the BBC he would be " very surprised " if there had been any wrongdoing on the part of the East Anglia University scientists .
" We 're in a moment when the world is about to make some big political decisions , " he said .
" And there will be people who do n't want the world to make those big decisions and they are trying to use this in part to say somehow this is all in doubt and perhaps we should put the whole thing off .
" Well , I just think they 're wrong about that . "
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said the scientific evidence was " very clear " and called doubters a " flat Earth group " .
He said : " There is an anti-change group .
There is an anti-reform group .
There is an anti-science group , there is a flat Earth group , if I may say so , over the scientific evidence for climate change . "
' Open and transparent '
Meanwhile , the Met Office said it would publish all the data from weather stations worldwide , which it said proved climate change was caused by humans .
Its database is a main source of analysis for the IPCC .
It has written to 188 countries for permission to publish the material , dating back 160 years from more than 1,000 weather stations .
John Mitchell , head of climate science at the Met Office , said the evidence for man-made global warming was overwhelming - and the data would show that .
" So this is not an issue of whether we are confident or not in the figures for the trend in global warming , it 's more about being open and transparent , " he told the BBC .
The Met Office said it had already planned to publish the material long before the row and denied reports that government ministers had tried to block the publication .

PC strategy / puzzle / weird game Darwinia has been teetering on the brink of an XBLA release for over a year .
Now , finally , the game has finally pass certification and is now confirmed for an XBLA release .
Phew !
Darwinia + will bundle the four - year - old PC title with its multiplayer counterpart Multiwinia , and although no release date has been set , Introversion states it will appear " in the coming months . "
It was originally due to launch in 2008 , but the developer assures fans that the delay was well spent .
" Darwinia + on the Xbox is the best version of Darwinia we 've ever made , " claims Introversion , " the Director 's Cut , the game as it would have been the first time around if only we'd had another two years to spend on it and were able to realize every single ambition we had for the project .

While veganism has become much more well known in recent years , it is still often very misunderstood by many people .
Some of those misconceptions involve the idea that vegan diets are too limited and that without animal products it is n't possible to create a wide variety of high quality , good tasting meals .
Other concerns revolve around the perception that certain vitamins and proteins the body needs are not provided by a strictly vegetable based diet .
However , both these concerns are unfounded and someone who familiarizes themselves with the many different options available within a vegan diet will soon find that they can make vegetarian based alternatives to most any recipe that are both easy to make and delicious .
In addition , those vegan recipes are much healthier than those using animal byproducts and with a little planning can easily provide all the essential nutrients required by the body .
Another advantage to veganism is that vegetable based products do not go bad as soon as animal byproducts and do not present as serious a health risk as meat even when they do .
One area in which vegan recipes easily surpass animal - based recipes both on ease of preparation and taste is baked goods .
Part of the reason for that is that baked products do n't contain a lot of animal products to begin with , provided that you use quality ingredients without artificial fillers , sweeteners , or flavorings .
For instance , the only major difference between this vegan banana bread recipe and regular banana bread recipes is that it does n't contain butter and eggs .
Besides eliminating the inherent messiness of melting butter and cracking eggs , the canola oil and apple sauce that replace them are much healthier and less fattening .
Plus you will never even notice the difference .
In fact , this recipe creates a very moist vegan banana bread that tastes as good if not better than any non-vegan banana bread recipe .
Finally , vegan food is n't just for vegans anymore .
Once you know how to properly prepare vegan alternatives , you can use them to provide healthy , delicious variety to your meal choices even if you do n't want to completely abstain from animal based foods .
You will soon discover that vegan food is much more than tofu and soy masquerading as meat .

Matt Gross for The New York Times
The past year has been a busy one for this Frugal Traveler .
Trips to Taiwan , Japan , Vietnam , Canada , the Caribbean , Italy , France and Oregon have taken me away from home for almost a full quarter of 2009 , and I do n’t expect 2010 to be much different .
Well , maybe a little different .
Though I imagine I ’ll keep up the same pace , I hope to travel better and smarter in the new year , and so I ’m setting out a few resolutions that I hope will help me ( and maybe you ) to do so .
1 . Put down the iPhone .
I love technology — phones , cameras , computers , gadgets — and especially how electronics and the Internet can make travel easier and cheaper .
Need to find a good , affordable restaurant in a new town ?
Check out Yelp !
on your smartphone , find a foodie friend through CouchSurfing.org , hit up Twitter for strangers ’ favorites , or just trawl the posts on Chowhound.com .
So easy !
I ’ve done this dozens of times , from Portland , Oregon , to Paris , France .
Indeed , it ’s part of my job to seek out new ways of seeking things out .
Matt Gross for The New York Times
At the same time , I wonder if I ’m not missing out on something .
There are , of course , usually loads of locals to talk to — who may be experts on their terrain or may not know a darn thing — and even when there are n’t , there is the place itself .
In the past , I trusted myself and my luck to put me on the right path , and most of the time , it worked .
I hitched that ride to the beach on Cyprus , or met the French - speaking Vietnamese teacher who showed me to the tomb of Marguerite Duras ’s Lover .
Serendipity , spontaneity and improvisation won out .
Now it ’s time to remove that pixelated barrier I ’ve erected between myself and the world and see what I can find with my own two eyes .
I will , however , bring my glasses , one piece of technology I can’t do without .
2. Travel lighter .
A corollary to Resolution No. 1 .
Leaving my electronic gear at home will go a long way toward lightening my load , but other things will be harder to abandon .
Because my trips often encompass multiple types of adventure — say , hiking British Columbia and eating Asian - fusion cuisine in Vancouver — I ca n’t just throw a single pair of pants and a T - shirt in a small backpack and hope to be all right .
Or can I ?
I own shoes that will get me through most anything , and jeans that can dress up or down , and a lightweight waterproof shell that rolls into a tiny ball .
What else do I need to do this job besides a notepad and pen ?
3. Learn to love buses .
Buses , I wrote recently , can be a frugal traveler ’s best friend or worst enemy .
Well , I have a confession to make : for me , they are almost always the latter .
I hate them .
My most miserable travel experiences have been on buses — lost luggage , missed stops , inexplicable routes — and for years I ’ve done everything I can to avoid taking them .
I ’ve walked miles across Tirana , Albania , in the midday heat of summer rather than take a bus .
I ’ve crossed nighttime Paris on foot in December rather than figure out the route map .
I will make triple transfers in the New York City subways rather than accept that a bus might take me into Queens from Brooklyn more directly .
This is not , of course , the buses ’ fault .
( Okay , maybe just a little . )
I need to be more patient , really to look at route maps and schedules and break them down into understandable chunks instead of dismissing them out of hand .
I need to build more time into my day , to allow not just for traffic complications but for the appreciation of the ride itself , whether through the urban jungle of Chicago or down a cliffside highway on the Adriatic Sea .
I need to , and I will !
Oliver Hartung for The New York Times
An upscale hostel in Berlin , featured in the article “ In Europe , Hostels Grow Up . ” Oliver Hartung for The New York Times
4. Learn to like hostels .
As with buses , I ’ve never really seen the appeal of hostels , which all other frugal travelers seem to love .
Sure , I ’ve stayed in a few — in Newport , R.I. , Barcelona and Chicago — and while no experience was truly horrific ( apart from the overflowing shower stalls in Barcelona and the naked German roommate in Chicago ) , I ’ve never had that transformative moment that so many others have had , in which they discover hostels as special places of friendship and adventure , as places to return to again and again .
Me , I usually just feel old and out of place .
But maybe I ’ve just had bad luck .
Maybe out there is the perfect hostel for this married 35 - year - old father who truly does like to meet interesting new people to have adventures with .
And maybe one of you readers can tell me where it is .
5. Really learn Spanish .
And Chinese .
In the last few years , I ’ve spent a serious amount of time in Latin America and greater China , and while I can get by in Spanish and Mandarin Chinese , I speak both pretty poorly .
Or , you could say , pretty well , considering I ’ve never really studied either one in a classroom setting .
All my Spanish I ’ve learned by triangulation — that is , by comparing the words with similar ones in French and Italian , which I actually did study .
And Chinese ?
All I know I learned from my wife , who ’s Taiwanese .
After 12 years with her , you ’d think I ’d be fluent by now .
But I ’m not .
I could — and should — do better .
But how ?
Should I enroll in real courses ?
( If you know of good , affordable ones in New York , please tell me in the comments . )
Or should I continue to pick them up from the streets ?
That is doable , I know , but it takes a serious , concerted effort to learn new words and grammatical structures .
Are there effective strategies that would help me do so ?
I want to learn , but I want to be frugal ; how can I do both ?
6 . See more , spend less .
Actually , this one ’s the easiest resolution of all .
I just have to put down my electronics , learn to like buses and hostels , pack lighter and practice my Spanish and Chinese , and I ’ll achieve it in no time !
If you ’ve been up late , then As Seen On TV infomercials are nothing new , but there are some funny gems that slipped through the cracks , and we ’ve got six of our favorites for you after the break .
1. WhiteLight
Teeth whitening has been around for a while , but who knew the same process could be accomplished with the WhiteLight system .
It uses “ light technology ” and a special gel to remove surface and embedded stains .
2. Foot Aligner Socks
Do n’t you just hate when your feet have a mind of their own and just walk off course ?
Well , these Foot Aligner Socks keep your toes pointing in the proper direction and most likely wo n’t do a thing for your feet .
3. Gas Transfer Pump
We have a feeling that the Gas Transfer Pump will be used for more than transferring one ’s own fuel , when placed in the wrong hands , but at least it ’s a real product .
4. Tater Mitts
This wacky gadget supposedly lets anyone peel a potato in just 8 - seconds , thanks to its abrasive coating .
And there ’s more , you get a “ bonus ” vegetable slicer , just in case the mitts do n’t do their job .
5. Tiddy Bear
The colorful Tiddy Bear snaps on to any seatbelt and is claimed to relieve pressure from shoulder straps .
Unfortunately , you ’ll have to shell out $ 14.99 for this gadget or just grab a hand towel and some duct tape to create your own Tiddy Bear .
6. Touch -n- Brush
For children and adults alike , who have no idea how to squeeze a toothpaste tube , the Touch - n - Brush is for you .
This contraption can fit any size tube and allows you to easily squeeze every last bit of toothpaste out .
Twenty minutes into our interview , at the Downtown Crossing headquarters of the Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , Richard Stallman learns that I own an iPhone .
" That 's a shame , " he says , leaning back in his chair , fixing me with a stern gaze , and fiddling , as he 'll do for much of the next hour and a half , with his beard .
Stallman founded the FSF in 1985 , two years after he'd launched the still - ongoing mass - collaboration GNU software project at MIT — which provided the fundamentals for the hugely popular GNU / Linux operating system that 's in millions of computers today .
He has no truck with the " iMoan . "
Nor with the " iScrod . "
And certainly not with " MS - DOG , " as he derisively dubs Microsoft 's MS - DOS operating system .
Such proprietary technology , trussed up with " malicious features " designed " specifically for the restriction of the user , " says Stallman , " impose control to an unusual degree " and represent " forms of subjugation . "
And here you thought you were just checking your e-mail .
But Stallman — a legend in the programmer community for more than a quarter century — considers it his life 's work to proselytize the free - software gospel , educating the lay people who'd otherwise assume that Microsoft or Apple are exclusively synonymous with computing .
" They think it 's natural that the software developers will have power over them , " he says .
" My mission is to point out to them that that is n't natural .
It 's wrong .
It 's an injustice .
And they should n't stand for it . "
Some in the open - source community ( a note about semantics anon ) have griped that Stallman is a stubborn utopian , whose Manichean worldview and rhetoric are counterproductive to the larger cause .
Others hail him as a principled and pugnacious advocate for freedom and cooperation , waging war against any and all outside interference with the way we engage with technology — which , of course , is these days tantamount to the way we live .
" Richard has written some of the most important software , and has changed the very way we make software forever , " says open - source advocate Bruce Perens .
" He has contributed equally to technology , economics , and freedom . "
In that Stallman is such a renowned programmer , if he'd chosen to travel that route , it 's not inconceivable that he could be a billionaire like his co-generationists Bill Gates and Steve Jobs .
Instead , he 's never owned a home .
Or a car .
Or even a cell phone .
He admits , " I think my main expense literally is food . "
His lifestyle is a pointed rejoinder to this mediated consumer culture of litigiously enforced copyrights , trackable GPS - equipped cell phones , radio - frequency identification chips , and omnipresent surveillance cameras .
And his pronouncements — on matters technological , but also geopolitical and environmental — mean to stir us to join his fight .
The tricky part : far fewer people than he'd wish share the courage of his convictions .
Stallman may sometimes sound like a voice in the technological wilderness .
( And , with his tangled hair and bramble of beard , may look the part , too . )
But that does n't necessarily make what he says less true .
" What we need , " he says , " is enough people not to be outright cowards , and we can win .
I really care about freedom and I 'm willing to make some sacrifices for it .
There are such strong forces arrayed to take away our freedom , and it 's vanishing so fast that , without sacrifices , we 're sure to lose it . "
Senate Dems Protect Big Pharma
Created : December 15 , 2009 19:41 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
In a big win for the pharmaceutical industry , the Senate on Tuesday killed legislation that would have made it easier for Americans to buy their prescription drugs from abroad , where prices are generally much cheaper .
The count was 51 to 48 , nine shy of the supporters needed to overcome a filibuster .
Thirty Democrats and Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman ( Conn. ) voted to kill the provision .
The amendment , sponsored by Sens. Byron Dorgan ( D - N.D. ) and Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) , has been a week - long thorn in the side to Democratic leaders — not because they opposed the provision , but because it threatened to undermine a deal cut earlier in the year between the White House and the nation ’s pharmaceutical companies .
Under that agreement , the drug makers pledged up to $ 80 billion toward health - care reform over the next decade if Democratic leaders would withhold their support for several proposals that would cut further into the companies ’ profits , including the drug re-importation provision .
As a result , White House officials in recent days had urged Democrats to oppose the Dorgan - Snowe amendment , with the FDA writing a letter to senators warning that the agency “ does not have clear authority over foreign supply chains . ”
Under the provision , Americans would be allowed to buy FDA - approved drugs from certain countries with well - established drug - safety regimes , such as Canada , Australia Japan and those in Europe .
Supporters say it will save U.S. consumers roughly $ 80 billion over the next decade .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the federal government would save an additional $ 20 billion over the same span , the result of savings to federally funded programs like Medicare .
The reason is clear : Americans pay more for pharmaceuticals than any other country in the world .
Dorgan pointed out that the same Nexium prescription that costs $ 424 in the U.S. would cost just $ 67 in France , $ 40 in the United Kingdom , $ 37 in Germany and $ 36 in Spain .
“ We should n’t be paying the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs , ” Dorgan said .
“ I think it ’s flat - out unfair . ”
Aside from Snowe , the provision attracted the support of such influential Republicans as Sens. John McCain ( Ariz ) and Charles Grassley ( Iowa ) , the ranking member of the Finance Committee .
Opponents of drug re-importation argue ( 1 ) that there ’s no good way to ensure that imported drugs are safe for American consumers , and ( 2 ) that the resulting loss in drug - maker revenues would curb the research conducted by those companies , leading to the discovery and development of fewer new innovative drugs .
Critics of the latter are quick to point out that the pharmaceutical industry is perennially among the most profitable .
Indeed , last year it ranked third among all industries , reaping 19.3 cents in profits for every $ 1 in revenues , according to Fortune Magazine .
Senate lawmakers on Tuesday also killed a weaker substitute to the Dorgan - Snowe amendment , sponsored by Sens. Frank Lautenberg ( D - N.J. ) and Robert Menendez ( D - N.J. ) .
Both argued on Tuesday that the Dorgan amendment simply would n’t guarantee that the imported drugs were safe .
( Strangely enough , both also voted in 2007 in favor of proceeding to a similar Dorgan - Snowe bill . )
“ It ’s regressive , ” Menendez said Tuesday .
“ It hearkens back to a time when the lack of sufficient drug regulation allowed people to sell snake oil and magic elixirs that promised everything and did nothing . ”
Critics in and out of the Capitol , however , say the substitute was so stringent that it will effectively prohibit drug importation .
The AARP , which for years , has endorsed the Dorgan - Snowe amendment , argued that the Lautenberg - Menendez provision represents “ a thinly veiled effort to undermine importation and preserve the status quo of high drug prices . ”
The substitute amendment was shot down by a count of 56 to 43 .
The debate proved a pickle for President Obama , who had endorsed reimportation on the campaign trail but was forced to change his tune this year for fear of losing the pharmaceutical lobby ’s support for the underlying health - care reform bill .
“ When you become president , you realize that the sound bites do n’t always work in reality , ” Ken Johnson , senior vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America , told The Washington Post this week .
The money that the drug makers have pumped into Congress in recent months could n’t have hurt their case .
Indeed , the industry has contributed roughly $ 7.5 million to lawmakers this year , with 57 percent going to Democrats — up from 33 percent in the 2006 cycle , and 50 percent in the 2008 cycle – according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
In terms of lobbying , the dollar figures are even higher .
PhRMA , representing the brand - name drug makers , has spent more than $ 20 million lobbying Congress this year alone , CRP says .
“ It ’s really regrettable that the special interests prevail , and the power of the pharmaceutical lobby , ” McCain said Tuesday .
“ It ’s not one of the most admirable chapters in the history of the United States Senate . ”
Martin Angelov shared his funky concept for a new urban way of transportation dubbed “ Kolelinia ” with us .
Kolelinia proposes that we ride our bicycles on a steel wire as a new type of bicycle lane .
The idea was awarded first for the international “ Line of Site ” competition .
More about Kolelinia after the break .
“ The first crazy idea which came to my mind was to make flying bicycle - lanes , using steel wire , something like ski lift but working on the opposite principle in which the wire is static and it does n’t need electricity , ” explained Angelov , who presented a more developed version of Kolelinia on Sofia ’s TEDX conference a few days ago .
Working off the idea that transportation has to “ not only be a transport , it has to be an experience , ” Angelov has turned an initial idea into a developed possibility ( especially with the addition of his safety features ) .
Angelov ’s ideas make us question whether it is possible to achieve a completely new level of transportation with minimum resources .

The Calabasas middle school that was shaken this month by attacks on redheads was jolted again Monday when news spread that two 12 - year - olds and a 13 - year - old had been arrested in the bizarre incident .
Apparently spurred by a Facebook site and inspired by the animated “ South Park ” television show , “ Kick a Ginger Day ” brought notoriety to A.E. Wright Middle School , an ordinarily peaceful campus that sponsored a tolerance assembly for students Monday in the wake of the attacks .
The “ South Park ” episode , first shown in 2005 , was itself supposed to be a lesson in tolerance but misfired , with harassment of red - haired students taking place at schools across the U.S. and Canada over the last few years .
In Calabasas , an affluent community northwest of Los Angeles , school officials have identified nine children believed to be responsible for the assaults but their investigation is continuing .
Eleven victims have come forward .
All the injuries were minor , officials said .
Two 12 - year - old boys are suspected of battery .
A 13 - year - old boy was detained on suspicion of cyber - bullying -- making a threat via the Internet -- because of his written response to a Facebook invitation to the Nov. 20 spree , according to Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Lt. John Benedict .
The boys , who face possible criminal charges , were released to their parents .
Samara Kleinfinger , 12 , said she and other red-haired students were summoned to the principal ’s office on Nov. 20 .
There already had been at least one attack and administrators , alerted by students to the possibility of more , wanted to warn Samara and others to be careful .
Samara said she was punched and kicked by six students on her way to the office .
“ They seemed to think it was a big , funny joke , ” she said .
The rest of the day , a knot of friends protected her as she made her way from class to class .
On the first school day after Thanksgiving break , principal Kimmarie Taylor cautioned students on the public address system to be mindful of their responses to reporters and news crews who had gathered on campus .
At an assembly earlier , she attempted to demonstrate the irreversible consequences of ill - thought - out actions by having students try to put toothpaste back into a tube using toothpicks .
Later , they wrote essays about making the school a better place .
“ This was out of left field for us , ” said Taylor , pointing out that the students under investigation had not been in trouble before .
Some were given five - day suspensions -- the maximum allowed under state education rules -- and had already written letters of apology to the victims , she said .
“ They ’re all good kids , ” she said .
“ They just made a very bad choice . ”
In the show ’s Ginger Kids segment , foul - mouthed Eric Cartman spreads word at school that “ gingers ” are genetically defective , evil , and out to get non -ginger students .
But when classmates dye his hair red as he sleeps , Cartman rallies other red-haired students with chants of “ Red power ! ”
Only after inciting the red - haired kids to round up non-gingers for “ extermination ” does he learn that he ’s been the victim of a prank .
At the end , all the students sing about brotherhood .
Intended to be satirical , the show played off virally - spread events aimed at Jews , homosexuals and other minorities .
But satire can be lost on the young , some experts said .
“ The irony of this is , the episode that has been linked to this was in fact underscoring how hurtful , destructive and horrible bigotry is , ” said Donald Zimring , superintendent of the Las Virgenes Unified School District .
“ That kind of lesson is a fairly complex lesson .
It ’s going to get lost on a 10 - , 11 - , or 12 - year - old . . . .
They do n’t understand the deeper meaning . ”
South Park ’s writers were unavailable for comment , said a representative from the show .
But the show is rated for “ Mature Audiences Only . ”
Shows with such ratings may have content “ unsuitable for children under 17 , ” according to Federal Communications Commission guidelines .
“ Sometimes TV producers , even those wanting to represent peaceful outcomes , do negative modeling , ” said Ron Slaby , senior scientist at the Education Development Center and the Center on Media and Child Health .
“ When you show hateful adversarial behavior or even concepts , the effect may be most pronounced with those who have the least resilience against it . ”
The annual kick - a- ginger event has brought angry criticism from people who feel the show ’s producers should have known better .
A judge in Calgary , Canada , where 13 high school students swarmed a red - haired boy in a locker room , called the show “ a vulgar , socially irreverent program that contributes nothing to society . ”
In Calabasas , a parent said she knew one of the boys who was detained and described him as shy and quiet .
Alexandra Townsend said the boy was recently bullied himself , tied to a basketball pole by other students .
Townsend said she ’s considering private school for her daughter , Jasmine .
While students had mixed opinions about the significance of the incident , parents who spoke to The Times Monday were not at all ambivalent .
“ They should be very , very harsh with the punishment , ” said Ruthie Stockfish , who was dropping off her daughter Ella ’s clarinet .
“ My daughter has light - brown hair .
She ’s cute .
Is tomorrow going to be cute - kid - hitting day ? ”

COPENHAGEN -- Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has promised the United States will help raise $ 100 billion annually by 2020 to assist poor countries in coping with climate change as long as America 's demands for a global warming pledge are met .
Clinton 's announcement , made during a packed news conference , represents a major breakthrough in the U.N. - led talks , which had all but ground to a halt last night .
But Clinton emphasized that the money is only on the table so long as fast - growing nations like China and India accept binding commitments that are open to international inspection and verification .
If other countries do n't bend , she warned , the poorest countries will suffer .
" In the absence of an operational agreement that meets the requirements that I outlined , there will not be that financial agreement , at least from the United States , " Clinton warned .
And , she added : " Without that accord , there wo n't be the kind of joint global action from all of the major economies we all want to see , and the effects in the developing world could be catastrophic . "
The pledged amount is less than what the European Union had laid out as necessary to help the poorest countries in Africa , Asia and Latin America prepare for climate disasters and develop low - fossil - fuel economies .
Clinton said the funding would come from a mix of public and private financing , including revenue raised from the auctioning of emission allowances under a possible U.S. cap - and - trade system still under development on Capitol Hill .
Clinton did not go into many other details , leaving it unclear precisely what the U.S. share of the $ 100 billion would be .
U.N. climate chief Yvo de Boer said he is " looking keenly forward " to learning what that contribution will be .
De Boer and others said Clinton 's announcement has helped get the lurching and sputtering train of international climate talks back on track .
After a long stall , some movement
" Hold tight and mind the doors .
The cable car is moving again , " a smiling de Boer said moments after Clinton 's announcement .
Added Danish Prime Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen , " There 's a feeling among negotiators that now we have to go into business , and now we have to be flexible , and now we have to try as hard as we can to make real compromises . "
U.S. environmental groups and House Democrats heaped praise on the announcement , while Republican staffers warned of the political difficulties back home in selling such a vast contribution as the economy reels .
" I think it 's very essential to the success of how we go forward , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) told E&E as she arrived at the Bella Center .
" We 'll see what the participation will be of other nations , what 's certainly appropriate for us to play a leading role in it .
So I salute her . "
Pelosi is in Copenhagen with 20 other House members , including Majority Leader Steny Hoyer ( D - Md. ) , Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman ( D - Calif . ) , Ways and Means Committee Chairman Charles Rangel ( D - N.Y. ) and Energy and Commerce Committee ranking member Joe Barton ( R - Texas ) .
Oxfam , which has been among the groups on the front lines pressing for adaptation funding , said it was " heartened " by the proposed fund .
But the group pressed for money to come from public sources in industrialized countries , and insisted on assurances that the money be in addition to existing financial aid .
" Private financing is no substitute for public investment in the resilience of the poorest and most vulnerable communities , " said Oxfam climate change director David Waskow .
Clinton did not specify from what exact sources the money would be broken down , where it would go or how it would get there .
She made a point of emphasizing that the money would go to " the poorest and most vulnerable among us . "
That underscores comments State Department climate envoy Todd Stern has made that China in particular would not be eligible for climate finance .
Moreover , the United States has pushed for major developing countries like China to be contributors to any international climate fund .
Pressure on China to respond
Ailun Yang , climate director for Greenpeace in Beijing , noted that China does n't want or expect money .
" I think China 's made it clear that the priority of this money indeed should go to the most vulnerable countries , which is a fair point , " she said .
In addition to adaptation , Clinton said the fund will have a significant focus on forests .
Andrew Deutz of the Nature Conservancy issued a statement saying that in 15 years of following climate talks , he had never seen the United States commit to this level of long - term financing .
" This is the type of high - level political offer that we 've been looking for world leaders to bring to Copenhagen to reach a global deal , " he said .
International reaction was cautiously optimistic .
" I think that we need yet to know what about China ? " said Portuguese environmental minister Dulce Pássaro .
" With this improvement of the United States , I think we are waiting for China 's position . "
Yang said she believes there is a compromise to be had between the United States and China on transparency , America 's No. 1 issue .
" China does n't want to give the impression that the negotiations are just about China and the U.S. , " she said .
" I do n't think they want to make it look like a China - U.S. battle here .
Obviously , there are a lot of other players here . "
Maria de Fatima Monteiro Jardim , environment minister of Angola , noted that African countries suffer dire poverty .
Angola in south - central Africa , for example , suffers some of the lowest life expectancy and highest infant mortality rates in the world .
" The rich countries could give more , it 's my opinion , " Jardin said .
" More , more , more , more . "
Looking ahead to 2010 , Mexican President Felipe Calderón said he hoped the annual U.N. conference next November in Mexico City was only to deal with implementation issues following success in Copenhagen .
" Let 's seize this opportunity , " Calderon said about an hour before Clinton 's press conference .
" Mexico awaits you with open arms . "

I can hardly believe the banana wars are over .
The dispute started back in 1993 when the European Union set quotas favoring banana imports from Ivory Coast , the Windward Islands and other former colonies at the expense of imports from Latin America .
American banana companies and the Latin American countries where they grow their bananas sued the E.U. , accusing it of rigging an unfair trade deal , first under the GATT and then under the W.T.O .
The suit dragged on for years , and at several points threatened to spark an all - out trade war between Washington and Europe .
In 1999 , after a meeting on Kosovo was hijacked by the banana crisis , the secretary of state then , Madeleine Albright , declared in exasperation : “ I never in my life thought I would spend so much time on bananas . ”
It finally ended this month when the E.U. said it would continue to grant tariff - free access to its former colonies but would reduce tariffs on Latin American bananas by 35 percent over seven years .
The United States and Latin American producers agreed to drop their case .
After all the roiling , what strikes me now is how little people seem to care .
That says a lot about how attitudes toward trade have changed .
When this started , trade was trumpeted as the single most important tool for development .
Europe insisted that its special treatment of its former colonies was central to its post - imperial responsibilities .
The United States and Latin American countries vowed to hold the line for free trade  over bananas at least  to make it a tool of development for all .
OTTAWA - CSIS has recruited some Defence Department technical wizardry to sidestep legal limits on its ability to spy on Canadians travelling abroad .
Details of a Federal Court ruling released Tuesday provide a glimpse of the highly advanced tools used by spies in the fight against terrorism and espionage .
A groundbreaking decision by Justice Richard Mosley reveals the Canadian Security Intelligence Service obtained a warrant to monitor two suspects considered threats to Canada late last year .
When it got wind the pair were leaving the country , CSIS won court approval to employ the secretive Communications Security Establishment , a wing of National Defence , to ensure the interceptions could continue .
An earlier court ruling had made it clear that CSIS could not legally carry out foreign eavesdropping without approval from the country in which the spying takes place .
However , with the help of CSE 's extraordinary technical means , the interceptions would be " controlled from within Canada , " Mosley said , making the operation legal .
" Information which may be crucial to prevent or disrupt the threats may be unavailable to the security agencies of this country if they lack the means to follow those lines of communication , " Mosley wrote .
The Ottawa - based CSE collects and processes telephone , fax and computer communications of foreign states , corporations and individuals .
The federal government uses intelligence gleaned from the interceptions to support troops abroad , catch terrorists and further Canada 's economic goals .
CSE is generally prohibited from spying on Canadians , but it can assist CSIS and police agencies acting under judicial warrants .
Although CSIS enlisted CSE in intercepting the telephone calls of Canadians travelling outside the country , the actual eavesdropping would legally take place " at the locations within Canada where the calls will be acquired , listened to and recorded , " said Mosley 's reasons , made public Tuesday .
It is unclear what other kinds of intelligence - gathering might have been involved , but Mosley 's decision makes it clear CSIS also hoped to benefit from CSE 's ability to collect information though other electronic means .
" Information found . . . would only be `seized ' where it would be first read , in Canada , " says the judge 's heavily censored reasons .
Bill Robinson , a longtime observer of CSE , said the operation could include infiltrating foreign computers remotely to " poke around inside " and pull out information of interest , much the way criminal hackers do .
" I think that involves essentially making intrusions into computers . "
In January , CSIS filed an application on " urgent grounds " in light of the two Canadians ' travel plans .
Mosley approved a three - month warrant after a Saturday court session , where he heard from CSIS and a CSE expert who described the electronic spy agency 's interception capabilities .
In April , the judge extended the warrant for an additional nine months .
CSIS spokeswoman Manon Berube said the decision recognizes that security threats move easily from one country to another , and that countering those threats required a new approach .
" This ruling is important because it recognizes that security threats are global and highly mobile .
CSIS can now use this tool to defend Canada 's security . "
Berube declined to elaborate on the nature of the operation for which CSIS obtained warrants .
But she said the techniques approved by the court could apply to all kinds of security investigations .
" I can't go into any operational detail , but I would n't limit that to counter - terrorism .
I would say it applies to all threats , " including spies or terrorists .
CSE spokesman Adrian Simpson also refused to discuss specifics of how and when the agency assists CSIS .
He rejected any suggestion the ruling allows CSE to do things it otherwise cannot do under the law .
" We 're simply providing technical assistance to CSIS . "
Intelligence historian Wesley Wark said the court decision could help Canadian spy agencies resist " some temptations and potential abuses . "
In the past , Canadian spies , lacking a legal mandate to eavesdrop on citizens abroad , might have simply handed the chore to the spy service of another country -- a move that could have opened the door to dodgy practices , he said
Wark noted CSIS has evolved into a very different agency over its 25 - year lifespan , now fighting terrorism and international criminals as well as traditional spooks .
But the law governing CSIS has n't been updated , leaving the courts to clarify what the agency can and cannot do .
" It 's not entirely clear what the intention of Parliament is anymore . "

It ’s become a pretty popular subject of late to find several of the animals with which we share the planet and display them as horrific and terrifying , and , well , this little ditty is certainly no different .
What is different is the simple fact that new species of mammals , reptiles , amphibians , birds , insects , and fish get discovered every day .
Sadly , just as we begin to locate pockets of entirely new types of critters , hundreds fall into extinction .
Mostly because humans , as a whole , are careless dickheads .
Now , I ’m not here to get all preachy , in fact , I ’m a pretty big purveyor of ‘ survival of the fittest ’ as well as Mother Earth ’s ability to fix itself , but what I am going to do is scare the shit out of you with a few of Nature ’s more unattractive beasties straight out of a Clive Barker sketchbook .
Pleasant dreams !
Longnose Chimera or The Devourer of Dreams
Just as with any sea creature of the order Chimerae , these guys are threatened by habitat loss thanks in part to human interaction .
However , when you see this thing up close , it ’s almost worth it to rid the planet of something so revolting .
These are the types of creatures that lazily swim through the dreams of psychopathic mental patients telling their human hosts where to bury the bodies .
It looks as though it was built out of excess dolphin parts and a huge penis !
Good Lord !
Sea Pig or The Host of Doom
Living deep within the abyssal plain roam the sea pigs , a type of plump , pinkish sea cucumber .
What they look like is a nasty , movable booger that spends its existence searching for its owner ’s nose with which to reclaim the brain and take over like an alien monster .
This particular creature is a relatively new discovery within the whole bizarre ‘ sea cucumber ’ family , and just goes to prove that diabolical space slugs inhabited Earth millions of years ago and are after our children .
Soft - shell Turtle or The Horrid
Wearing a carapace with the same basic structure as a fingernail comes the gag - inducing soft - shell turtle .
Often growing to the size of your basic man -hole cover , these sea turtles survive on primarily plants , little fish , and the filthy souls of Anti-Christian sinners .
Strangely - well , not so much , actually - the Chinese peoples truly enjoy consuming these giant swimming meat balls with chicken in a broth .
It ’s considered an initiation to C’thulhu .
I ’ll stipulate that these are n’t the oddest things around , but still kinda icky .
Yeti Crab or The Hairy Abomination
Discovered in 2005 , this furry demon is a decapod with exceptionally long and hirsute clawed arms that it uses to rend the life blood from unwary travelers .
No , not really .
It ’s only about six inches long and , presumably , completely blind .
It ’s a deep - sea dweller and only comes out into the light when it sheds its exoskeleton and morphs into its adult phase : politicians .
Naked Molerat or Fleshy Gothic Demon
For some God-awful reason , this walking be - toothed wiener is also called a ‘ sand puppy ’ , following the basic strategy that giving anything nauseating and gross a cute nickname automatically makes it that much better .
Another of this monstrosity ’s traits , besides being able to survive in harsh environments , is its lack of basic pain receptors !
That ’s right , trying to fend off a horde of these gnawing cocks is useless as it will feel no sting from your army ’s blades !
Oh , and they eat their own shit .
We need flamethrowers , people !
Giant Isopod or The Hell - spawn Flea
Picture one of those little sand crabs you find on the East Coast ( if you ’ve never been , picture a pill bug instead ) that ’s grown to the size of a house cat , and you ’ve got the idea of what this disgusting crustacean looks like .
Armored , multi-legged , and crawling up your leg , the giant isopod is primarily a solitary creature that is of little commercial use … unless you happen to be Chinese , who we ’ve established will pretty much consume anything , then it ’s lunch .
These things have got to be the basis for the Face Huggers .
I have to vomit now .
Vampire Squid or The Consumer of Souls
Discovered and incorrectly charted as an octopus in 1903 , this squid ( Vampyroteuthis infernalis , literally “ vampire squid from hell ” ) had to be re-categorized after it ate several of the scientists .
Looking eerily similar to Lovecraft ’s descriptions of what the ‘ Old Ones ’ might look like , the vampire squid is one of the few creatures on earth specifically brought here as a seed from Satan to repopulate the Earth it his image .
Well , it does have red and black spines on its arms , what more do you want as a sign ?
Dumbo Octopus or The False Prophet
Oh sure , it looks cute and unassuming , but this deep sea horror ( 3000 to 4000 meters , even ) can shed layers of skin at will !
Oh , that ’s not gag - inducing enough for you ?
Fine , despite it ’s ridiculously cute , round fins that look strikingly similar to the ears of a well - known pachyderm , this wretch can also … um , lay eggs constantly !
Eww !
Who wants to see… okay , never mind .
This thing is cute .
But do n’t come crying to me when it devours your children .
Nephila Komaci or The Gibbering Squamous Spider
This 2007 giant spider discovery is without a doubt the single most disgusting eight - legged monstrosity on the planet .
First of all , the female ’s leg - span from tip - to - tip is almost two feet .
Secondly , this lady ’s body length is about eight inches , making it the largest Nephila spider ever .
There ’s nightmare number one .
This thing makes one of the largest webs of any spider as well , often reaching six feet around !
And if that was n’t enough to make you want to hire John Goodman on retainer , it also absorbs its mate into itself just for the use of its sperm , thereby killing him .
( Drops everything and runs )
Coconut Crab or Not Your Dinner
The Coconut Crab ( literally : Big Ass Crab ) is the largest land crab on earth as well as the scariest damn thing I have personally ever seen .
So scary , in fact , that in the tiny nation of the Marianas , this crab is associated with souls who have returned to the mortal plane using the crabs as vessels .
Ugh !
Growing upwards of sixteen inches to 2 - feet with a weight of nine to fifteen pounds , these beasts prefer to climb trees to gather nuts rather than swim , which , as it turns out , kills them .
It is said children enjoy playing with them as they are relatively slow .
And yes , I mean the kids as well as the crabs .
Rim shot .
The Horror Frog or The Bringer of The Apocalypse
Read this from Newscientist.com and be ready to cower in palpable terror : “ Amphibian horror ” is n’t a movie genre , but on this evidence perhaps it should be .
Harvard biologists have described a bizarre , hairy frog with cat - like extendable claws .
Trichobatrachus robustus actively breaks its own bones to produce claws that puncture their way out of the frog ’s toe pads , probably when it is threatened . ”
Yep , like Wolverine , this frog can eject bony points from it ’s feet and shred your ass to ribbons !
And since it ’s a frog , it ’ll likely hop all over your face and remove your eyeballs in one swift stroke !
What the HELL !
Frogs , too ?
Where ’s my gun ?

Data recently made public by the Social Security Administration confirm that in October , 2009 , the program reached a grim milestone : six consecutive months of operating cash deficits .
This is the first time Social Security has faced this situation over the entire time period , dating back through 1987 , for which SSA posts the monthly data online .
From May through October inclusive , Social Security ’s outgoing payments have exceeded incoming program revenue , generated mostly by the payroll tax ( with a smaller amount coming in via the taxation of benefits ) .
When a cash - deficit situation develops during a period that the program is still technically solvent , full benefits continue to be paid .
The operational deficit is effectively made up with general revenues , putting additional strain on a sagging federal budget .
The primary reason for the early arrival of Social Security ’s deficits is the recession , which is depressing payroll tax revenue .
The drop in employment , and its corollary effect on payroll taxes , is coinciding with a long - anticipated surge in benefit claims as the Baby Boomers begin to hit the retirement rolls .
These factors have combined to accelerate Social Security ’s financial difficulties relative to previous projections .
Social Security ’s May , 2009 , dip into the red can be seen on the following graph .
The January and April spikes in the program ’s monthly balances seen above are typical seasonal fluctuations , arising from the periodic crediting of benefit tax revenues to Social Security .
This can be readily seen by comparing Social Security ’s 2009 cash flows with those of 2008 , as on the graph below .
The graph above shows how the recession has caused Social Security ’s 2009 finances to be persistently weaker than in 2008 , with the gap generally growing worse in the latter part of the year as unemployment has risen .
From May through October , Social Security ’s incoming cash revenue has fallen short of payment obligations by a total of $ 17.7 billion .
In what might initially seem to be a paradox , the balance in the Social Security Trust Fund has nevertheless risen by nearly $ 42 billion over the same period , from $ 2.457 trillion to $ 2.499 trillion .
The significance of the Trust Fund ’s continuing rise should not be misunderstood or overstated .
The program ’s ongoing monthly deficits are placing a strain on the federal budget at the present time , despite the increasing balance of the Trust Fund .
The rising debt that the Trust Fund holds can perhaps best be understood by conceptualizing it as being like a mortgage owed by the federal government , albeit an unusual kind of mortgage in which no cash payments are made by the borrower ( the federal government ) until the lender ( Social Security ) needs money .
As long as Social Security ’s own incoming tax revenue is sufficient to fund its benefit payments , the government is not required make any payments on the mortgage .
When Social Security ’s incoming tax revenue falls short , however , the government needs to produce extra cash and start paying that mortgage off .
The mortgage debt will continue to grow , however , as long as the interest on the debt is greater than the monthly cash payments being made .
An individual analogy may help to make this clearer .
If an individual homeowner took out a mortgage and then paid only $ 1770 on it over six months , when the mortgage ’s interest costs alone over that period were $ 5930 , then at the end of those six months that person would owe a further $ 4160 on the mortgage despite having made several payments .
Paying down just a portion of the interest and none of the principal on a mortgage parallels what is happening here .
The money obligated to the Social Security Trust Fund continues to rise as the fund accrues interest ; but our cash - strapped government now has to deliver additional money to support benefit payments , and has had to do so for half a year .
History shows an extreme unlikelihood that the situation will have turned around when the November figures are available .
November is historically a weak month for Social Security operations , posting negative flows in 11 of the past 22 years , despite the fact that the program has consistently run large annual surpluses during that time .
Moreover , in the six instances since 1987 that October operations have been in the red , November has followed suit every time .
And in none of those previous Octobers were the deficits as large as in October , 2009 ; nor was unemployment as high as it is today .
It is too soon to tell whether the half - year of persistent monthly deficits will soon translate into full calendar years of net deficits .
If these annual deficits arrive by next year as predicted in the September baseline of the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , this will be significantly sooner than either they or the Social Security Trustees have previously projected .
In 2008 , CBO predicted that cash surpluses would persist through 2019 .
The Trustees ’ projections for the onset of cash deficits have since 1983 ranged from 2012 - 2021 .
Like those of other government forecasters , these projections failed to predict the depth of the recent recession .
Contrary to one of the strangely persistent myths of American politics , the Trustees ’ projections have never been unduly conservative .
They have generally been consistent and qualitatively accurate in light of subsequent data , with errors tending to be on the side of being slightly aggressive ( meaning optimistic from the perspective of system financing ) .
That Social Security ’s deficits may be arriving earlier than projected in any previous Trustees ’ report should at long last put an end to the urban myth of overly - conservative projections .
Seniors will continue to receive their Social Security benefit checks despite Social Security ’s grim half - year of operating in the red .
The early arrival of a half - year of consistent monthly deficits , however , should serve as a wake - up call that like other forms of retirement income , Social Security finances are being hit hard by the recession .
The necessity of repairs to the program ’s financial outlook is growing more urgent than previously supposed .

Shopping List 1 onion : $ 0.50 3 carrots : $ 0.75
Lentils : $ 1.25 Baguette : $ 2.00 Pantry items : Olive oil , garlic , dried thyme , tomato paste , salt , pepper , red wine vinegar .
Total cost ( for 4 portions ) : $ 4.50
After last week 's simple buttery pasta controversy , I hesitate to post my no -nonsense lentil soup .
Nevertheless , here it is , because as far as I 'm concerned it 's really perfect December eating : healthy ( unlike party food ) , flexible ( who knows what 's left in your larder ) , relatively fast ( you 're busy ) , perfect for making in advance ( ditto ) , and warmly sustaining ( weather outside possibly frightful , etc. ) .
And if you count lentils and onions as pantry items , this classic churchmouse supper costs practically nothing .
This recipe is liberally adapted from Everyday Food Great Food Fast , but I never make it the same way twice .
If there is bacon around , I start by cooking a few strips of bacon , chopped , and use that fat instead of olive oil .
We are cumin addicts and so usually use 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds in addition to thyme .
Celery often finds its way into the pot , as do other stray vegetables .
I have n't tried a Parmesan rind , but it occurs to me now that that would probably be tasty .
What are your lentil soup secrets ?
( To preempt the question in the air : yes , the Bellingers do sometimes eat nothing but bread and soup for dinner .
We are small and thrifty people .
If your appetite demands more , you 've got $ 2.50 left over to buy whatever you need to round out the meal : another vegetable , cheese , fruit for dessert , a bottle of plonk ? )

Radiohead will head back into the studio to record the follow - up to In Rainbows in January .
Writing on a blog on the band 's website , guitarist Ed O' Brien said the group were looking forward to being together again .
He said : " The vibe in the camp is fantastic at present , and we head off into the studio in January to continue on from the work we started last Summer .
" I am so genuinely excited about what we ’re doing , but for obvious reasons I can’t divulge anything more .
Anyway we all love surprises do n’t we ? "
' Hugely proud '
The guitarist said the good vibes during recording sessions now compared favourably to 10 years ago when Radiohead recorded fourth album , Kid A .
" Although hugely proud of that record , it was n’t a fun place to be , " he wrote .
" What ’s reassuring now , is that we are most definitely a different band , which should therefore mean that the music is different too and that is the aim of the game , keep it moving . "
I am so genuinely excited about what we 're doing , but for obvious reasons I can't divulge anything more Radiohead guitarist Ed O' Brien
Radiohead last appeared live in the UK , headlining 2009 's Reading and Leeds festivals .
Their last album , In Rainbows was released in 2007 .
The band allowed fans to download the record via their website and pay whatever they wanted for it .
Amid the blues bars and rescue missions of Pioneer Square , Seattle ’s storied intersection of sports and booze , art and vagrancy , the Elliott Bay Book Co. has stood as a symbol of comfortable , old - world erudition .
For years , it has been one of the West ’s few destination bookstores , a place tourists and locals alike visit for the sake of spending a couple of hours getting lost in its 140,000 - some neatly stacked titles .
When the last actual book downloads onto Kindle ( at Amazon.com on the other side of town ) , Elliott Bay , one feels sure , will still be selling its musty , hard - bound predecessors , perused with a tangy cup of espresso in the basement cafe .
So it is with no small degree of anguish that Seattle has reacted to the news that Elliott Bay is facing the likely choice of either moving across town or closing altogether when its lease is up Jan. 31 .
In some ways it is the familiar story of an independent bookstore getting hammered by book chains , online retailers and big - store discounters .
But there are peculiar Seattle wrinkles .
The city ’s two downtown sports stadiums are bringing crowds of often - tipsy revelers through Pioneer Square , scaring the tourists and competing with locals for the ever - dwindling supply of parking .
And during last year ’s holiday season , any shoppers who might have been willing to jack up their credit cards during the recession stayed home anyway when an unusually heavy snowstorm paralyzed the hilly downtown streets for days .
“ It ’s been a precarious existence the last four or five years , ” said owner Peter Aaron , adding that the store was put in the position “ where we just did not have the wherewithal to ride out any significant problems that came along , let alone the perfect storm that hit us last year . ”
Aaron , a former retailer at Bullock ’s in West Los Angeles , has appealed to 11 banks for loans to keep operating .
So far , the only light he sees is the prospect of moving out of downtown , possibly to Capitol Hill -- a funky , alternative neighborhood on the other side of the freeway near Seattle Central Community College and Seattle University .
( As it turns out , another well - known independent bookstore in Capitol Hill is closing . )
Unlike Pioneer Square , whose full - time residents seem to be primarily those who sleep on the streets , Capitol Hill has lovely old residential neighborhoods and a thriving student population .
But would Elliott Bay be able to retain its signature old - world ambience and bookish atmosphere in a modern new space , far from the historic heart of the city ?
Aaron says he has come to believe the store ’s location is “ the driving factor ” behind the sales slump .
“ Between the lack of parking , the adverse effect of sporting events . . . and the perception on the part of many people that this is not a desirable or safe area of the city to venture into , especially at night , it ’s really been a huge inhibitor of our business , ” he said .
Elliott Bay has always done more than sell books .
It has the most active reading program in the country , holding more than 500 readings a year in its intimate , book - filled gathering room downstairs .
Bill Clinton , Norman Mailer , Salman Rushdie , David Lynch and Richard Russo have all read and talked in the space that seems to invite lively , back - and - forth conversation .
The cozy , independently run cafe , also downstairs , is rumored to be the inspiration for Cafe Nervosa on the Seattle - based television series “ Frasier . ”
Upstairs , on the main floor , there is an entire wall of staff - recommended books , and the shelves throughout the store are flecked with handwritten cards from the store ’s knowledgeable staff .
Thom Chambliss , executive director of the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Assn. , said independent bookstores could survive competition from online retailers , but the killer blow is being struck by big - box retailers who are deeply discounting the easy - to - sell , big - name bestsellers that normally allow stores like Elliott Bay to also stock shelves with wild bird catalogs , biographies of obscure feminists , first novels of new regional authors , and treatises on the politics of climate change .
“ It ’s a problem for the country , not just the industry , if we do n’t have stores capable of making a profit while stocking all the ‘ backlist ’ books , ” he said .
“ That will really hurt the cultural opportunities for this country .
People ’s access to ideas will be seriously compromised .
And that discussion is not taking place in this country . ”
The banks are expected to weigh in soon on Aaron ’s appeal .
Another hope , he said , would be to lure a local billionaire into buying the store as “ a hobby . ”
But what does that say about the future of book retailing ?
Aaron shrugs .
It wo n’t be his problem anymore .

losing the governorship of New Jersey yesterday , it was yet another bad day for former heads of Goldman Sachs .
It 's worth running down the list , since the venerable pairing of John Weinberg and John Whitehead came to an end in 1990 . " data - share - img= " " data - share = " twitter , facebook , linkedin , reddit , google , mail " data - share - count = " false " >
With Jon Corzine losing the governorship of New Jersey yesterday , it was yet another bad day for former heads of Goldman Sachs .
It ’s worth running down the list , since the venerable pairing of John Weinberg and John Whitehead came to an end in 1990 .
First up there was the pairing of Robert Rubin and Stephen Friedman .
Both of them attempted to become venerable eminences grises , but neither succeeded , in the end .
Friedman became chairman of the New York Fed , where he helped to which put together the deal under which AIG ’s CDS counterparties , foremost among them Goldman Sachs , got paid out at 100 cents on the dollar , He was also involved in approving and which also approved Goldman ’s request to become a bank holding company .
He then inexplicably bought tens of thousands of shares Goldman shares in the open market — a clear conflict of interest given his position at the Fed — resulting in his resignation shortly afterwards .
Rubin , of course , looks even worse .
As arguably the most Wall Street - friendly Treasury secretary ever , he helped to inflate the deregulatory financial - services bubble on the basis that big banks were extremely sophisticated and more than capable of looking after their own risk books .
He then moved to the ultimate cushy job at Citigroup , where he got paid $ 10 million a year despite having no employees , no P&L , and no defined responsibilities .
In hindsight , his main contribution to the bank was to be the biggest internal cheerleader for the fixed - income group , which he encouraged to take on ever - greater amounts of risk despite the fact that no one in senior management ( including himself ) really had a clue what they were doing .
Result : disaster .
Rubin and Friedman were succeeded by Corzine , whose post - Goldman career has been spent almost entirely in politics .
He was pretty ineffective in the Senate , before moving to the governorship of New Jersey .
( In a classic case of the squid ’s tentacles being everywhere , he there helped oversee the incoherent mess at Ground Zero , due to New Jersey ’s 50 % stake in the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey .
The chairman of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation , charged with rebuilding at the site , was former Goldman senior partner John Whitehead . )
Never much of a natural politician , he basically bought both jobs , which at least meant that he was n’t corrupt .
But after he was almost killed in a 91 mile - an - hour car crash where he was n’t wearing a seatbelt , he lost a large chunk of whatever leadership ability he had formerly held .
His political demise yesterday , at the hands of an oafish opponent , comes as little surprise .
Corzine , in his turn , was replaced ( indeed , ousted ) by Hank Paulson .
Paulson ’s post - Goldman career , of course , was spent as the Treasury secretary who oversaw the biggest financial meltdown since the 1929 crash .
Reading Andrew Ross Sorkin ’s Too Big To Fail , which was clearly written with a lot of help from Paulson , he comes across as a man who was always at least one step behind the curve , someone who could never get ahead of the unfolding crisis , who was prone to inconsistent and ad hoc decisionmaking , and who went out of his way , even before getting a waiver allowing himself to talk to Goldman Sachs , to be as helpful to them as he possibly could .
Paulson seems to have spent a large amount of the crisis throwing up in his office bathroom , and even into Nancy Pelosi ’s wastebin .
Of course , he could n’t simply go see a doctor , like the rest of us , because he ’s a Christian Scientist .
Similarly , he hobbled his ability to communicate by refusing to ever touch email : instead , any time he wanted to say anything to anybody he ’d have to do so over the phone or in person .
No wonder he was semi- permanently hoarse , and his phone records are insane .
Paulson ’s biggest failure , of course , was that of Lehman Brothers : he set up an emergency weekend confab at the New York Fed in an attempt to save it , but refused steadfastly to ever consider any public help at all , and also failed to keep British regulators in the loop , despite the fact that their assent would be needed in the event that Barclays were to acquire Lehman .
In fact , when the fateful phone call to the Brits was made , it was the hapless Christopher Cox who made it , rather than Paulson .
In general , Paulson was more of a bully than a leader , and he managed to be equally unpopular both on Capitol Hill and at the White House .
Looking at the list , it seems to comprise men who are very long on hubris , and who have no doubt that if they can run Goldman Sachs , they can do anything else , with normal rules not really applying to them .
All of them , post - Goldman , have been tarnished .
If Lloyd Blankfein has any sense , he ’ll retire quietly .
Update : Goldman calls to say that Friedman , as chairman of the New York Fed , was not personally involved in the decisions that the Fed made involving Goldman .
I ’ve updated the post accordingly .
Google co-founder Sergey Brin , the son of persecuted Russian Jews , has been the driving force in the the company 's showdown with China , says Ken Auletta , New Yorker media columnist and author of the best selling book " Googled : The End of the World as We Know It . "
I spoke with Auletta earlier today at the offices of The New Yorker .
He recalls the 2008 shareholder meeting where a motion was presented to demand an end of doing business in China over censorship .
Brin abstained from the vote , while Larry Page and Eric Schmidt voted it down .
Jessica Vascellaro writes in the Wall Street Journal about the internal debate about the very pubic confrontation with the Chinese .
She reports that it was Brin who has pushed for getting out of China .

Karzai sets target for Afghanistan forces to take over
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Hamid Karzai has been sworn in as Afghan president for a second elected term , saying he wants Afghan forces in charge of the nation within five years .
In his inauguration speech , Mr Karzai announced a conference to tackle corruption and a national gathering to help bring peace to Afghanistan .
He also invited his defeated rivals to join him in working for peace .
Two US soldiers and 10 Afghan civilians were killed in separate blasts in the south as the ceremony took place .
' Dangerous problem ' Kabul 's streets were almost empty on Thursday as security forces set up numerous roadblocks ahead of the ceremony .
ANALYSIS Martin Patience
BBC News , Kabul Karzai's speech contained all the key phrases : corruption , national reconciliation and unity , and security .
The international community has demanded the Afghan leader do more to tackle rampant corruption .
Mr Karzai said he would host a conference on the issue in the coming months .
He promised to take a tougher line and sack officials found to be corrupt .
There would be close scrutiny of the individuals he appoints to his cabinet .
But perhaps most significant was his call for Afghan security forces to take over control in five years .
The US and other allies want Afghans to take the lead ( as do the Afghans ) .
While the Afghan army is improving , some experts say it will need continued support for decades to come in areas where the insurgency is at its strongest .
But the intention is there - and that will be important in Washington and European capitals .
The allies need to tell increasingly sceptical publics this is not a war without end .
Promise of a ' new season '
The international airport was closed , a holiday was called and people were advised to stay indoors as part of the security lockdown .
Dignitaries from about 40 countries were attending the ceremony , including US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari and UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband .
The international community - including the US and Nato - congratulated Mr Karzai on his inauguration , but warned that results were needed on tackling corruption and improving security .
In his speech , Mr Karzai said the strength of Afghan security forces had to be bolstered and the role of international forces reduced .
He said : " We hope that the Afghan forces will lead the task of security and stability throughout the country in the coming five years . "
Mr Karzai addressed corruption , saying that good governance came from good management and that he would take care to ensure his ministers were " competent and just " .
He said corruption was a " dangerous problem " , adding : " We will soon organise a conference in Kabul to organise new and effective ways to combat this problem . "
He added : " We have to learn from our mistakes and shortcomings of the last eight years . "
Mr Karzai also called for a loya jirga - or national gathering - to help bring peace .
He invited his main defeated rival Abdullah Abdullah to work with him " for the prosperity of Afghanistan " .
Mr Karzai also said he would step up the battle against the production and trafficking of drugs .
' No meaning ' Speaking to the BBC in Kabul after the ceremony , Mrs Clinton said Mr Karzai 's speech had set out a " very positive , comprehensive path forward " .

" It was clear today in the speech that the president has a vision of where he wants to lead the country , and it was reassuring to people , it was exciting because it was such a statement of resolve , " she said .
" But the proof is in the pudding .
Now we 've got to get to work and make it happen - he knows that , his ministers know that . "
Nato extended its " best wishes " to Mr Karzai but Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said there now needed to be " concrete progress " .
The Afghan government is determined to fight the trafficking and cultivation of drugs .
Government officials found to be involved in drugs will be fired

Karzai speech : Key excerpts Reaction to inauguration Inauguration : Afghan views Afghan MP Shinkai Karokhel said the people trusted Mr Karzai to deliver .
" This is the time that President Karzai should prove himself and fulfil his promises , " she said .
The Taliban , however , condemned the inauguration .
" Karzai 's call to the Taliban to come to the government has no meaning .
He became president through fraud and lies , " spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told the Associated Press in a telephone call .
" This is a government based on nothing because of the continuing presence of foreign troops in Afghanistan , " he said .
As Mr Karzai was sworn in , two US soldiers were killed by a suicide car bomber in southern Zabul province .
The bomber detonated his explosives near the gate of a Nato base , police said .
Ten civilians were also killed in a suicide blast in Uruzgan province by a bomber who detonated his explosive vest close to a convoy of Afghan troops , local police said .
Run-off abandoned
The BBC's Kim Ghattas reports from Kabul that for Washington , Mrs Clinton 's presence at the inauguration was a qualified endorsement of Mr Karzai .
HAVE YOUR SAY
This will lead to more mess , violence and instability in the country Asif Chaudhary , Lahore , Pakistan Both US President Barack Obama and Mrs Clinton have made very public statements about the need to fight corruption , and Mrs Clinton has also warned that civilian aid will not continue to flow to Afghanistan unless the issue is addressed .
The Obama administration is currently debating sending more troops to Afghanistan , with the president saying he is " very close " to a decision .
Mr Karzai was declared Afghan president after a second round run-off was called off when his sole remaining challenger pulled out , saying the vote could not be free and fair .
Widespread fraud in the 20 August first round led to Mr Karzai being stripped of the outright win he appeared to have secured .

At launch the network is only available on laptops
Swedish and Norwegian mobile users could be among the first to use a fourth - generation ( 4G ) mobile network .
Mobile phone firm TeliaSonera has completed work on two 4G networks in Oslo and Stockholm .
The company said that the first customers will be able to start using the networks in early 2010 .
Despite the launch of the network , no handsets can yet use 4G .
Initially customers will connect via a dongle and a laptop .
Fourth - generation , 4G , networks are based around the Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) technology and downlink data speeds can hit 100 megabits per second - about ten times quicker than the fastest 3G networks .
The technology has been designed to overlay existing 3G networks and most operators have committed to upgrading to the faster system .
TeliaSonera said it was recruiting customers to pilot the network during the first quarter of 2010 .
It has released no information about the cost of connecting to the high - speed network .
The dongles for connecting to the LTE network are made by Samsung .
Phone equipment maker Ericsson has put together the network in Stockholm , Sweden and Chinese firm Huawei is behind the one in Oslo , Norway .
Both networks cover the central regions of both cities .
TeliaSonera said it expected the boost in speed to drive many novel applications including gaming on the move and much greater viewing of video on laptops .
Handsets that can use LTE are expected in mid-late 2010 .
In fact , loyal Ticket readers will recall that one day last summer with no advance warning whatsoever Biden 's official White House schedule changed from listing frequent " private meetings " to listing frequent meetings that are " closed press . "
Was this dramatic and ....
But the VP 's public schedule today puts all those fears to rest .
After a recent public sighting , fears had mounted that the one - time , long - term senator might rebel against traditional White House strictures and start acting on all the administration 's oft - promised promises of government transparency and official openness running back into 2008 .
Unsubstantiated rumors that Vice President Joe Biden had suddenly gone a little loopy and ordered some of his official meetings opened to at least cursory public or media attention were just that -- unsubstantiated rumors .
Everybody should just relax and take it easy .
... little - noticed vocabulary change a sign of internal administration turmoil ?
What did it really mean ?
No , of course not .
And , nothing .
Announcing everyone the VP meets with , including sessions with unidentified senior staff , which consume much of the vice president 's listed time , and what subjects they talk about would have been a stark contrast to George W. Bush 's administration , whose notoriously secretive ways drew such criticism from Democrats in Congress during eight long years of really failed policies .
Instead , in the apparent interests of bipartisanship , the Delaware Democrat has adopted much the same sort of undetailed schedule as his Republican predecessor , Dick Cheney , who was not in the Senate when Obama was only 11 years old .
In fact , today 's Biden schedule highlight is a meeting with the chief of transparency for economic recovery .
But , unfortunately , the transparency meeting is non-transparent , closed to the press .
( See his full schedule below . )
Which makes it -- what ? -- secret openness ?
Open secrecy ?
In a joint report issued early this week a league of nonprofit groups including Common Cause gave the Democratic administration high marks for its openness , although it said the work was incomplete and did n't really go into the lack of open healthcare legislative hearings televised by C - SPAN , as promised by candidate Obama .
Under the category of good but not good enough , here 's another viewpoint from Tommy Christopher , including the Obama C- SPAN promise video .
Biden once described Cheney as the most dangerous VP in American history .
But since Biden will only turn 68 this year , he was probably overstating in his well - known , jolly way the dangerous vice presidents that he 's known whose devious backroom skills and ways earned them fame over the decades -- men with household names like William King , Henry Wilson and T.A. Hendricks .
Someday , who knows , Biden 's too may join them .
-- Andrew Malcolm
Here is the vice president 's official schedule for today .
Boldface was added in the interests of emphasis .
Note especially that the vice president 's meeting with the chairman of the Recovery Act Transparency and Accountability Board is closed , meaning non-transparent .
The " pool spray " mentioned has nothing to do with aquatics .
It 's a coded message to media that a few select members will be allowed in to take pictures briefly -- possibly for only a few seconds -- as Biden and his guest pretend to continue their previously private conversation as if the meeting was open .
DAILY GUIDANCE FOR THE VICE PRESIDENT , Thursday , January 14 , 2010 :
In the morning , the President and the Vice President will receive the Presidential Daily Briefing and the Economic Daily Briefing in the Oval Office .
At 11:30 AM , the Vice President will meet with Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood to discuss the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
Afterwards , the President and the Vice President will have lunch in the Private Dining Room .
At 1:00 PM , the Vice President will meet with Iraqi Vice President Adil Abd al - Mahdi in the Roosevelt Room .
There will be a pool spray at the bottom of this meeting ; gather time is 1:45 PM in the Brady Briefing Room .
( UPDATE 2:20 p.m. : The White House issued its own report on this closed meeting .
Both paragraphs are added below at the end of the VP 's schedule . )
Then , at 2:15 PM , the Vice President will meet with Earl Devaney , chairman of the Recovery Act Transparency and Accountability Board .
This meeting is closed press .
###
White House report on one of Biden 's closed meetings :
Today , Vice President Biden met with Iraqi Vice President Adil Abd al - Mahdi at the White House .
President Obama joined part of the discussion .
The leaders discussed preparations for the March parliamentary elections and ongoing efforts to resolve outstanding national unity issues .
Today ’s meeting was the latest in an ongoing series of high - level engagements between U.S. and Iraqi officials .
The U.S. government remains committed to a long - term partnership with the Iraqi government and people .

Instead of giving their own speeches to be entered into the record during recent House debates over health care reform , more than a dozen Republican and Democratic members got up and recited words that had been given to them by Pharmaceutical industry lobbyists .
They did n't even bother to alter the text that had been provided to them by a subsidiary of the Swiss corporation Roche .
They just said what they were told to say .
And they are n't embarrassed about it at all .
Here goes :
In the official record of the historic House debate on overhauling health care , the speeches of many lawmakers echo with similarities .
Often , that was no accident .
Statements by more than a dozen lawmakers were ghostwritten , in whole or in part , by Washington lobbyists working for Genentech , one of the world ’s largest biotechnology companies .
E-mail messages obtained by The New York Times show that the lobbyists drafted one statement for Democrats and another for Republicans .
Oh , joy .
That 's bipartisanship for you !
No reason to bring the concerns of your constituents to the table when your words are already being written for you by one of the biggest companies on the globe .
Both Republicans and Democrats .
If the Congress was an honorable institution , this would be a scandal .
The members involved would resign .
Do unto others as you would have others do unto you .
Everything else is commentary .
This seems to us to be one of the central threads that runs through every rational person , be they religious , atheist , or ' other ' . buy from etsy view on flickr wallpaper on imgur
Yemeni southerners hold regular anti-government protests
By Owen Bennett - Jones
BBC News , Sanaa
Faced with a civil war in the north , pro-independence protests in the south and al - Qaeda attacks throughout the country Yemen 's government has its work cut out .
But ministers insist the country has survived worse crises in the past and that the central authority will prevail .
" We have one Yemen and one state .
The government has not yet used all the forces at its disposal , " said Deputy Planning Minister Hisham Sharaf .
For western governments the most pressing issue is al - Qaeda .
The US is currently holding 94 Yemenis in Guantanamo , nearly half of the total number still in the camp .
But Washington is reluctant to let them go back home because it sees Yemen as an unstable al - Qaeda stronghold .
I fear we 'll have military insurgency in the south and then we 'll have people wearing explosive vests attacking government buildings .
That is close to happening now
Abdul Ghani al - Irayani , political analyst
Cold War roots of Yemen conflict Yemen faces new Jihad generation Yemen faces new Jihad generation
The government in Sanaa is more bothered by the civil war in the north .
The conflict has been going on since 2004 but has intensified in recent months .
About 175,000 people have fled the fighting .
The rebels demands are not entirely clear .
Some of the leaders want to establish an Islamic emirate based on their branch of Shia Islam .
But most of the fighters are tribesmen who would probably put down their arms if they were given rather more mundane concessions such as some roads and schools .
There is consensus in Sanaa that eventually the crisis in the north will have to be resolved by negotiation .
But for the moment the governments strategy is to force the rebels into a position of weakness so that they will accept a political settlement .
The situation has been complicated by the recent involvement of Saudi forces on the side of the Yemeni government which in turn accuses Iran of backing the rebels .
Secessionists
While the conflict rages in the north , there are also political divisions in the south .
Protestors , often carrying guns , take to the streets every few days demanding a reversal of the 1990 unification of North and South Yemen .
The conflict in the north has displaced hundreds of thousands " Our objectives are to gain our independence and to evict the occupiers from our country , " said the self - styled President of Southern Yemen , al - Salam al - Beid who now lives in Germany .
The government in Sanaa argues it can take the sting out of the secessionist movement by offering some political concessions .
But even those who agree with that view say that if the strategy is to work , the government needs to get on with it .
" I fear we 'll have military insurgency in the south and then we 'll have people wearing explosive vests attacking government buildings .
That is close to happening now , " said political analyst Abdul Ghani al - Irayani .
Water crisis
On top of all the security problems , Yemen is running out of two vital resources : oil and water .
Oil revenues are down 75 % this year although that drop is explained by lower global prices as well as decreasing production .
Yemen 's battle against Houthi rebels in the north has drawn in Saudi Arabia
The countries water supplies are diminishing so rapidly that a World Bank - financed project has predicted the capital Sanaa could run out by 2025 .
The country 's rapidly growing population means the underground water table is declining by between one and 12 metres each year .
" We are in serious trouble , " said water minister , Abdul Rahman al - Eryani .
With remarkable honesty for a government minister he openly accuses senior army officers , tribal sheikhs and even fellow ministers of making money through illegal drilling .
" We have passed the luxury of being diplomatic , the water crisis necessitates the most rude stating of facts , " Mr Eryani said .

Poor Fox .Â
Itâ€™s easy to take shots at them , but for a moment might we truly question what horrible force infects an entire television network that would force it to cancel top quality programming ?
Â
Nah , itâ€™s probably just easier to take shots at them .
President Czar seems to be desperate these days .
Â
I think this is how most executives functionâ€ ” in total fear .

Theyâ€™re always scared of someone figuring out that they donâ€™t have it all figured out .

Thatâ€™s why they parade in a steady stream of lackeys to blame their inadequacies upon .
So Issue 14 of the Monad Reader is out , which includes my paper “ Lloyd Allison ’s Corecursive Queues ” with a few significant revisions .
Compared to earlier versions mentioned on this blog , I moved a few sections around to improve the flow : the first 8 pages now contain an uninterrupted informal derivation of the queue operators .
I also demonstrated a new fixpoint operator on continuations , an implementation of the standard mfix fixpoint on the codensity monad , and argued that mapCont cannot be implemented in terms of callCC .
However , this post focuses on the section that I moved , entitled “ Monad Transformers ” from pages 51 to 56 .
It ’s basically a short rant about why I do n’t like monad transformers , an argument that later culminates in a mostly broken corecursive queue transformer .
In retrospect , it ’s somewhat unfortunate that I did not reread the classic paper Monad Transformers and Modular Interpreters sometime before Issue 14 came out .
I did read that paper approximately nine or ten years ago .
Although the paper was helpful in understanding how monads could be shaped to my own ends , now that I actually understand the contents of the paper , it feels rather crufty .
Section 8.1 defines correctness criteria for a monad transformer and associated lifted operations , which I quote as follows :
The basic requirement of lifting is that any program which does not use the added features should behave in the same way after a monad transformer is applied .
The thrust of my argument is that this requirement is indeed very basic ; one would hope that certain properties useful for reasoning inside a given monadic language would also be preserved .
This additional requirement seems rather hopeless .
However , the pièce de résistance of the argument is that the continuation transformer is incorrect by their own criteria , at least in the context of a lazy language such as Haskell or Gofer .
I demonstrate an expression that depends on the laziness of the lazy state monad , and fails to terminate after a continuation transformer is applied .
( As an aside , it does n’t matter if this is a ContT r ( StateT st Identity ) monad or StateT st ( ContT r Identity ) , they are the same monad with the same operations . )
In retrospect , this seems obvious : something written in the continuation passing style specifies an evaluation order independent of the host language , and applying the continuation transformer corresponds to a call - by - value CPS transformation of part of the program .
The example involves a definition that computes a right fold over a level - order traversal of a tree :
foldrByLevel :: ( MonadState ( Queue a ) m ) => ( a -> [ a ] ) -> ( a -> b -> b ) -> b -> [ a ] -> m b foldrByLevel childrenOf f b as = fold as where fold [ ] = deQ >>= maybe ( return b ) ( \a -> fold ( childrenOf a ) ) fold ( a: as ) = do enQ a b <- fold as return ( f a b )
If we use this definition to traverse an infinite tree , it will be productive when run with Control .
Monad .
State .
Lazy , but will get stuck in an infinite non-productive loop when combined with Control .
Monad .
Cont .
You can download a complete file that demonstrates this phenomenon .
There are “ simpler ” expressions that demonstrate this , but the example I gave is itself interesting because it is useful in other contexts .
As demonstrated in my paper , the laziness can be restored by tweaking the definition of foldrByLevel to use mapCont .
However , this is a leaky abstraction : in order to maintain the same behavior , we must modify existing code to make use of the “ added ” features in ways that are not backwards compatible .
I do not know how to write a lazy state monad using continuations , or a sensible way of writing a single definition of foldrByLevel that behaves the same on both the lazy state monad and the continuation state monad .
( I use the word “ sensible ” because one could provide a unfaithful definition of mapCont for the lazy state monad that happens to work in the case of foldrByLevel , but fails in other contexts . )
What impact does this have on the notion that continuations are the mother of all monads ?
Is there a monad that corresponds to a call - by - name CPS transformation ?
Is it even possible to express the lazy state monad using continuations ?
I do not yet have answers to these questions .
One thing is clear , however : its tricky to generalize Filinski ’s Representing Monads to lazy evaluation , if indeed it is possible to do so fully .
Ever since I first posted about the Gen 4 Glock pistols in June 2009 , I have been eagerly awaiting the new guns .
A lot of rumors , information and photos have floated around the Internet in the recent weeks .
The time for speculation is done ; the Gen 4 Glock pistols are now here .
The Gen 4 Glock pistols were alternately called the “ Next Generation of Perfection ” or “ too little , too late ” depending on who you talked to .
After handling and shooting a Gen 4 Glock 22 , I feel comfortable in stating the new guns are an evolutionary step in the Glock platform : nothing more , nothing less .
Gen 4 Glock Features
The Gen 4
Glock pistols have a variety of new features that I have discussed before .
They include :
interchangeable backstraps ( three sizes ) ;
reversible , enlarged magazine release ;
dual recoil spring assembly ; and a
rough textured frame ( RTF )
Interchangeable Backstraps
The Gen 4
Glock pistols have a “ multiple backstrap system , ” which allows the shooter to adjust the grip size of the frame between a small , medium and large .
The small size feels slightly smaller than the current third generation pistols .
The medium and large increase by 2 mm and 4 mm respectively .
For my hand , I really liked the smallest size best .
The large ( for me ) was just too big .
If you like the size of the standard Glock 20 and 21 pistols , the large backstrap will most likely make you happy .
The medium seemed too large , yet it is supposed to be the same size as the third generation guns .
Funny , I thought I liked the grip size of the Glock handguns .
Maybe I just found something better .
Reversible and Enlarged Magazine Release Reversible and Enlarged Magazine Release
This is a pretty straightforward change to the Glock pistols .
The magazine release can be set up on the left or right side of the gun .
The magazine release has also been significantly enlarged .
I found the enlarged mag release was easy to manipulate , but it did not get in the way of shooting .
Also , I did not experience any unintended magazine drops that would have happened if the release was too large .
Dual Recoil Spring Assembly
The dual recoil spring assembly looks like an elongated Glock 26 or 27 assembly .
According to the Glock staff I spoke with , the new spring assembly cannot be retrofitted into prior generation pistols .
The new spring assembly is supposed to absorb more of the recoil when the handgun is fired .
However , I did not notice any difference between the Gen 4 Glock 22 and a third generation Glock 22 .
The recoil in both felt about the same to me .
I suspect the real reason that Glock went to a dual recoil spring assembly was for enhanced reliability .
The Glock 22 sometimes had reliability problems when shooting certain types of ammunition with a light mounted on the pistol .
It is possible that the dual recoil spring alters slide velocity during recoil to enhance the gun ’s functioning with all ammo .
Rough Textured Frame ( RTF )
Oddly , Glock pistols with the RTF2 texture were introduced before the pistols with the RTF texture .
Regardless of the timeline and naming conventions , I liked the RTF texture …a lot .
The new RTF texture is fairly aggressive , providing a very positive grip on the handgun .
When I shot the Gen 4 Glock 22 , it was raining and cold .
Although miserable , this was a great environment to test the new texture .
Even though it was wet , the pistol did not shift in my hand .
It just stayed put .
The RTF finish was not as sharp as the RTF2 .
It enhanced reliability without creating discomfort .
Also , I think the RTF will be much easier on clothes than the RTF2 .
I believe the RTF texture will be very popular .
Shooting
The Gen 4 model 22 Glock shot just like any other Glock .
It was reasonably accurate , easy to shoot and was 100 % reliable .
Unlike the pistols of other manufacturers , the Glocks were covered in dirt from impromptu torture testing by various gunwriters .
Even so , the Gen 4 Glock performed like a champ .
Final Thoughts
The Gen 4 pistols from Glock offer some nice improvements .
Several of the enhancements may be worth enough to you to warrant the outlay of your money .
Personally , I did not find anything with the Gen 4 that will cause me to trade my second generation Glock 19 for the new model .
As I have talked about before , Smith & Wesson has seen a lot of recent success in capturing the law enforcement market .
This is largely due to the interchangeable backstraps that are available on the M&P line of handguns .
With the Gen 4 pistols , Glock has leveled the playing field , matching S&W on several important features and making the decisions more about cost and reputation than specs .
I think the Gen 4 Glock handguns are an evolutionary step forward for the company .
I did not find them to be revolutionary , but I think the feature enhancements were well thought - out and will be warmly received by the Glock community .
For someone who does not currently own a Glock , the Gen 4 is an excellent choice .
If you already own a Glock , you will have to determine if the additional features are worth the investment .
If you pick up a Glock 19 pistol , make sure you check out my huge list of G19 holsters here .
I give you my thoughts and opinions on them .

French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde says the tax is ' fully justified '
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde says France is to introduce a tax on bankers ' bonuses similar to the one introduced in the UK .
Any bonus above 27,000 euros ( $ 39,000 ; £ 24,000 ) will be taxed at a rate of 50 % on payments given out in 2010 .
Ms Lagarde told reporters that a bill would be brought before the French parliament in January .
Last week , UK Chancellor Alistair Darling announced a similar measure in his pre-Budget report .
French officials had said last week that a bonus tax was on the cards , but no details were given .
" This is a proposal that the President made in August and that we fought for on an international level " said Ms Lagarde .
The French Banking Federation said it regretted the decision and that it would " further damage Paris ' competitiveness " .
It said the French banking system had withstood the financial crisis relatively well and had not needed government bail - outs as in the UK .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she is sympathetic to the idea but that it might be against German law .
Taxes on bonuses are being brought in to quell public anger about the high level of bankers ' pay when many of the banks have received government support .

For all the uncertainty about the current state of the economy , everyone is sure of one thing : this recession has permanently remade American consumers , turning them from spendthrifts into tightwads .
From cover stories on “ The New Frugality ” to stories about cheapness as a new status symbol and pundits ’ repeated analogies to the lessons inculcated by the Great Depression , the message is the same : there has been a fundamental change in American consumer behavior , one that will endure after the recession ends , returning us , as one economist put it , to “ the days of ‘ Leave It to Beaver . ’ ”
Illustration by Christoph Niemann
The assumption that consumers have fundamentally changed is understandable .
Personal spending is down sharply from 2007 , while the national savings rate , which dipped below zero a few years ago , went above six per cent earlier this year .
But although analysts point to the numbers as proof of a new mind - set , you do n’t need psychology to explain what ’s happened : simply put , Americans have been spending less because they have less money to spend .
After all , in the past two years , nearly seven million jobs have been lost and wage growth for people who have kept their jobs has been anemic .
At the same time , the housing crash and the stock - market meltdown erased , conservatively speaking , about thirteen trillion dollars in household wealth .
Given the well - known wealth effect — people ’s tendency to spend more when they get richer , and vice versa — that alone would translate into an expected drop in personal spending of between five hundred and seven hundred billion dollars .
In fact , you could argue that consumption has actually fallen less than might have been expected .
Spending did drop off the proverbial cliff in the fall of 2008 , in the direst phase of the financial crisis , but it stabilized at the beginning of this year , and has now risen for four months in a row .
And much of the decrease in consumption since early 2008 can be traced to a drop in spending in just two categories : gasoline ( thanks to lower prices ) and cars .
The decline in new - car purchases has been so steep that the average life of a car on the road today is at a historic high .
This is just one example of how better product quality makes it possible for consumers to cut back without experiencing much decline in their standard of living .
We can delay buying a new car because the one we have can be driven hundreds of thousands of miles without problems — making the auto industry a victim of its own success .
Nonetheless , the response to the Cash for Clunkers program indicates a certain amount of pent - up demand out there .
Of course , none of this precludes the possibility that our frugal ways will endure even after the economy starts to recover .
But there are reasons to be skeptical .
Recessions regularly give rise to assertions that consumers will begin spending more responsibly .
Toward the end of the 1990 - 91 recession , for instance , Fortune reported forecasts of the “ death of conspicuous consumption . ”
Time ran a cover story on the return to the simple life , arguing that “ after a 10 - year bender of gaudy dreams and godless consumerism , Americans are starting to trade down . ”
Consumer - behavior experts predicted that people would be more frugal in the nineties , and consumers themselves said they planned to cut back on spending .
It did n’t happen .
A decade later , the bursting of the Internet bubble and the impact of 9/11 led many to predict that Americans would consume less — and we all know how that panned out .
This is a far more severe and traumatic recession — the worst downturn since the Great Depression .
So , just as the Depression , as the Times put it , “ imbued American life with an enduring spirit of thrift , ” wo n’t this recession make Americans thrifty again ?
Maybe .
But the current downturn , bad as it has been , is nothing like the Depression , which lasted a decade and saw unemployment hit twenty - five per cent .
What ’s more , the notion that the Depression turned Americans into tightwads is largely a myth .
In fact , it was after the Second World War that America really came into its own as a consumer society .
In the five years after the war ended , purchases of household furnishings and appliances climbed two hundred and forty per cent , while between 1940 and 1960 the rate of homeownership rose by almost fifty per cent .
If the Depression did n’t make Americans wary of the pleasures of consumption , it ’s unlikely that this downturn will .
This does n’t mean that we ’re going back to the days when the average American saved not a penny of his paycheck .
As people try to rebuild their nest eggs , the savings rate is bound to remain higher than it was a few years ago .
And what we spend our money on will change , too ; housing costs , which were the central cause of the rise in Americans ’ indebtedness in recent years , should eat up less of our budgets in the future .
But the evidence for a radical shift in the way we consume seems more like the product of wishful thinking ( there ’s a palpable longing among pundits for Americans to become more frugal ) than anything else .
In many categories , spending has dropped only slightly , if at all .
And , while these are very tough times for retailers who believed that spending could only go up , retail sales rose briskly in August .
Before we go proclaiming this the age of the American tightwad , a little perspective is in order .
Even after the worst recession of the past seventy years , retail sales this year will be about where they were in 2005 .
Does anyone really think that four years ago Americans were misers ? ♦
There are some indications that consumer spending is picking up The UK economy shrank by 0.2 % between July and September , figures show , an upward revision to the previous estimate of a 0.3 % contraction .
It means that officially the recession has not yet ended .
Analysts believe that fourth quarter figures will show the economy returning to growth .
The news disappointed those who had expected a contraction of 0.1 % .
The British Chambers of Commerce ( BCC ) said the latest figures raised concerns about the strength of the recovery .
BCC chief economist David Kern said : " While most analysts expect a return to positive growth in the next few months it is important to stress that recovery is not yet guaranteed . "
The UK recession began in the April - to - June quarter of 2008 .
Since then the economy has contracted by 6 % .
This is the second revision to the third quarter 's GDP figure .
The initial estimate , released in October , showed the economy shrank by 0.4 % .
It is customary for the first estimate of GDP to be revised twice at monthly intervals .
It can sometimes also be revised up to 18 months after the initial estimate .
Recovery concern
Anyone convinced that the recession ended between July and September will have to wait a bit longer for vindication .
If they get it at all
Stephanie Flanders , BBC economics editor
Read Stephanie 's blog Q&A : What is GDP ?
The fact the economy had shrunk during the third quarter of 2009 took many analysts by surprise when the initial figures were released in October .
Many had expected the UK economy to return to growth during that period , and are still scratching their heads that subsequent revisions show the economy still to be in recession .
" We still find it hard to believe fully that the economy was contracting in the third quarter , " said Investec 's Philip Shaw .
Others believe that they may yet be proven right .
" We are expecting this number to be revised upwards and this will eventually be seen as a growth quarter , " said Amit Kara from UBS .
" The big picture is that the economy is recovering ... we see growth at 1.8 % next year . "
The Office for National Statistics said the upward revision to the third - quarter figures was down to an improvement in construction output .
That was boosted by strong growth in public sector projects , while the decline in house building slowed .
However , services and industrial production were weaker .
Balancing act BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders said : " There is at least one piece of encouraging news in today 's release : the household savings ratio in the third quarter rose to 8.7 % of income , compared to 7.6 % in the previous three months . "
She said it was important for savings in the economy to go up to put the recovery on a more sustainable footing .
The household savings ratio is the percentage of disposable income that is saved .
Analysts say the high level of household debt in the UK must come down in order to make the economy more balanced .
However , while overspending was one of the factors contributing to the credit crunch , it is important for the recovery that consumers do not cut back their spending too sharply .

What are these ?

Did you know the Mac has a little file inspector tool that can be used in the Finder for quickly getting information about files , folders , and anything else selected in a Finder window ?
The File Inspector is basically a dynamic “ Get Info ” window on the Mac , as it adjusts depending on what you select in the Finder of Mac OS .
This is very useful for so many reasons , but particularly if you frequently use the “ Get Info ” command in Mac Finder to reveal details about finder items .
How to Access the File Inspector in Mac Finder
To access the File Inspector in the Mac Finder , with it ’s Quick Look style version of the Get Info command , simply start by highlighting any file or folder in the Finder .
Then , with a file or folder selected in Finder , hitting the Command + Option + i keys in combination to reveal the Get Info File Inspector tool .
The initial data is the same as what you see in the standard Get Info command ( which has the Command + i keystroke in Finder ) , but the exciting part is what happens when you click on another Finder item : the File Inspector changes the data shown to represent the newly selected file or folder , without having to open a new Get Info window !
This is very useful with navigating the Finder with a mouse , keyboard , trackpad , or however else , because it allows you to select other files and folders and pull up data about them upon click / selection rather than opening another Get Info window for each individual file .
If you ’re trying to check out information about many different files or folders , you ’ll quickly see why this is so helpful .
This tool behaves very much like Quick Look previews in Mac OS , and the window will close if you select the desktop rather than an icon , file , or folder , or it loses the focus .
Note : another way to access the File Inspector is by holding down the Option key and right - clicking on an icon , in place of “ Get Info ” will be “ Show Inspector . ”
Very useful , try it out !
This great feature exists in just about every version of Mac OS X to ever exist , so try it out yourself , see how great it is , make it part of your workflow , and enjoy the utility of such a delightful feature of the Mac Finder .
Die Mär von den " verlorenen Stimmen " Peter Mühlbauer
Wie ein Votum für kleine Parteien und unabhängige Kandidaten den politischen Willensbildungsprozess beeinflusst
Wer die Piratenpartei wähle , so Guido Westerwelle , der müsse sich damit abfinden , dass seine Stimme " verloren " sei .
Eine durchaus unrichtige Behauptung .
Denn trotz der Fünf - Prozent - Hürde , auf die der FDP - Chef offenbar anspielte , haben Stimmen für kleine Parteien in mehrerlei Hinsicht Einfluss .
Tatsächlich sind in einer deutlichen Mehrheit der Wahlkreise eher jene Stimmen " verloren " , welche große Teile der 40 bis 45 Prozent Nicht - Unions - und Nicht - SPD - Wähler den oft ohne fundierte Kenntnis angekreuzten Direktkandidaten des jeweils vermeintlich kleineren Übels unter den großen Parteien geben .
Rationaler als die " Wahl " zwischen Kandidaten mit praktisch identischem Abstimmungsverhalten wäre hier das bewusste Setzen von Anreizen :
Denn auch mit Stimmen für Bewerber und Parteien , die ohne Mandate bleiben , lassen sich Themen fördern .
Ein Effekt , der immer stärker ins Bewusstsein der Öffentlichkeit dringt und der auch dazu beitrug , dass sich die Zahl der unabhängigen Direktkandidaten in den insgesamt 299 Wahlkreisen seit der letzten
Wahl von 60 auf noch nie da gewesene 166 erhöht hat .
Viele davon treten für Volksabstimmungen ein , andere für ein bedingungsloses Grundeinkommen - und manche für Beides .
Den meisten ist bewusst , dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit eines Einzugs in den Bundestag ausgesprochen gering ist .
Allerdings haben sie durchaus Chancen , dem einen oder anderen Bewerber einer Volkspartei das Direktmandat zu kosten .
Und der ( oder dessen Nachfolger ) beschäftigt sich dann möglicherweise in Zukunft intensiver mit den Fragen , die seinen freien Herausforderern ein besonderes Anliegen sind .
Auch Parteien können durch solche Stimmwegnahme - Effekte Aufmerksamkeit auf Themen lenken .
So führten beispielsweise die ersten Prozente für die Grünen schon vor dem Einzug in den Bundestag zum Beginn einer Umweltdiskussion in der SPD und die Wahlerfolge der Republikaner in den späten 1980er und frühen 1990er Jahren trugen entscheidend zum bald darauf zwischen den Volksparteien geschlossenen " Asylkompromiss " bei .
Auch wenn etablierte Parteien von Schwerpunktparteien vertretene Positionen bereits einzunehmen scheinen , kann es sinnvoll sein , stattdessen die kleine Themenpartei oder den unabhängigen Direktkandidaten zu wählen .
Denn häufig handelt es sich um eine Art Scheinbefürwortung , die wahrscheinlich auch in Folge eines Wahlsieges keine entsprechende Umsetzung nach sich zieht .
So etwas zeigte sich beispielsweise im Bereich der Direkten Demokratie .
Sie wird zwar von der SPD seit Jahren offiziell begrüßt - ihre Bundestagsabgeordneten ließen entsprechende Anträge von Grünen , FDP und Linkspartei aber scheitern .
Andere Scheinbefürworter finden sich in der Frage freier Bildung : Dort locken etablierte Parteien auf dem Papier oder im Wahl - O - Maten Wähler mit Positionen an , die sich beim genaueren Hinsehen als ihr Gegenteil erweisen .
Ein Trick ist die Ablehnung von Studiengebühren auf der unzuständigen Bundes - und die Befürwortung auf der zuständigen Landesebene , ein anderer sind Einschränkungen wie jene auf ein Erststudium während einer sehr kurzen Regelstudienzeit oder der Deklarationsumweg über extrem hohe Verwaltungsgebühren .
" Könnte man den Aussagen zu den Wahl - O - Mat - Thesen glauben " , so Studentenfunktionär Florian Kaiser , " dürfte es in der BRD kein gebührenpflichtiges Studium geben , da hiernach nur die FDP und die Partei Bibeltreuer Christen das gebührenfreie Erststudium ablehnen .
Die Politik in den Ländern hat uns hier in den letzten Jahren aber ganz anderes offenbart . "
Darüber hinaus sorgt die Abgabe einer Stimme für eine der kleinen Parteien dafür , dass diese von den bereitgestellten Mitteln profitieren kann .
Das Parteiengesetz subventioniert nämlich nicht nur Spenden mit einem aus Steuergeldern finanzierten Zuschlag von stolzen 38 Prozent , sondern auch Wählerstimmen , die nach § 18 mit 85 Cent pro Stimme vergütet werden .
Für diese Ausschüttung gilt keine Fünf - Prozent - Hürde .
Stattdessen liegt die Schwelle hier bei 0,5 Prozent in der " jeweils letzten Europa - oder Bundestagswahl " .
Allerdings ist die Regelung mit einer gewichtigen Einschränkung versehen : Nach Absatz 5 dieses Paragrafen werden solche früher als Wahlkampfkostenerstattung bekannten Gelder nämlich nur in äquivalenter Höhe der Einnahmen aus Spenden , Mitgliedsbeiträgen , Zinsen und wirtschaftlichen Aktivitäten ausgeschüttet .
Dass sich die Auszahlung bei allen über vier Millionen liegenden Stimmen auf 70 Cent verringert , ist kein wirklicher Ausgleich für die Nachteile , die kleinen und weniger wirtschaftsnahen Parteien durch diese Regelung erwachsen .
Mit entsprechend besserer finanzieller Ausstattung können kleine Parteien auch die sehr hohen bürokratischen Anforderungen für eine Wahlteilnahme besser bewältigen und in mehr Bundesländern antreten .
Ein wichtiger Grund dafür , dass viele kleine Parteien so geringe Ergebnisse einfahren , ist nämlich die Tatsache , dass sie nur in einigen Bundesländern auf dem Wahlzettel stehen .
Tritt eine Partei dagegen in allen oder fast allen Bundesländern an , wie aktuell die Piratenpartei , dann stehen ihre Chancen schon wesentlich besser als beispielsweise die der Titanic - Partei , die 2005 nur auf verhältnismäßig wenigen Wahlzetteln angekreuzt werden konnte .
Die bürokratischen Hürden sind auch mit dafür verantwortlich , dass die ( nicht etwa in der Verfassung , sondern in § 6 Absatz 6 des Bundeswahlgesetzes festgeschriebene ) Fünf - Prozent - Hürde eher schrittweise übersprungen wird .
Steigende Ergebnisse steigern darüber hinaus nicht nur die Bekanntheit einer Partei , sondern überzeugen auch stetig mehr Wähler davon , dass sie den Einzug in ein Parlament schaffen kann .
Die Grünen etwa erzielten bei den Bundestagswahlen 1980 1,5 Prozent und gelangten von dieser Basis aus 1983 mit 5,6 Prozent erstmals ins Bonner Parlament .
Nicht nur aus all diesen Gründen scheint die Wahl eines freien Direktkandidaten und / oder einer kleinen Partei eine durchaus rationalere Alternative zum Wahlboykott .
Weil der Nichtwähleranteil nicht zu einem geringeren Mandatsanteil von für unwählbar befundenen Parteien führt , sondern proportional vereinnahmt wird , ist dieses Mittel zum Protest nur bedingt geeignet : Selbst Stimmenthaltungen von deutlich über 50 Prozent bei Europa - oder Kommunalwahlen erzeugten bisher nicht die von manchen Kritikern einer uneingeschränkten Parteienherrschaft propagierten Effekte .
Seit der Afghanistanwahl weiß man zumindest , ab welchem Nichtwähleranteil europäische Beobachter in Drittweltländern eine Wahl als " problematisch " einstufen - nämlich erst unterhalb einer Wahlbeteiligung von 30 Prozent .
Ein Ziel , das für die Bundestagswahl eher unrealistisch erscheint .

This has been a big year for JavaScript .
New , fast engines have tested their legs .
Libraries have matured .
With the ECMAScript 5 draft proposal , the language is growing .
However , the language remains largely in exile , to only be used in Web browsers .
This year has marked a resurgence of efforts to make JavaScript useful outside the browser .
This was patently obvious at this year 's first European JavaScript conference , jsconf.eu .
There have been a variety of JavaScript platforms for programming outside the browser since 1996 , starting with Netscape 's server - side offerings .
A system called Helma ( best known in Austria ) has been around almost as long .
In 2007 , AppJet provided a service ( now discontinued ) for creating and hosting server - side JavaScript applications .
Aptana offers an IDE for front - to - back JavaScript Web applications called Jaxer .
Through each generation of Web development , JavaScript did not measure up against Perl , PHP , Python , Ruby , Java , or other alternatives for general - purpose programming .
Several things have changed .
The creation , proliferation , and discovery of JavaScript - driven HTTP requests gave rise to highly interactive websites and applications .
This drove the need for faster JavaScript engines , which have since become available to every serious denizen of the Web and most of their unsuspecting extended family .
Furthermore , these highly - interactive applications usually require significant programming both on the client and the server , much of which now overlaps .
Particularly , the technique of Progressive Enhancement often requires a feature to be implemented both on the server — for initial rendering and the baseline user - experience — and on the client , for an enhanced experience .
JavaScript has a couple more things going for it .
JavaScript is the only programming language that has ever shipped on every consumer computer , and it has done so for the last 10 years .
In these post - QBasic times , HTML , CSS , and JavaScript have become for every ungainly , bespectacled troglodyte the gateway from social exile to deeper social exile .
More noteworthy is that a growing number of graphic designers who would never confess that they knew how to program will readily hack with jQuery .
There are a lot of JavaScript programmers .
Also , despite its deplorable shortcomings , JavaScript is cool and people like it .
So , what is holding JavaScript back from world domination ?
JavaScript has no module system .
To compose JavaScript scripts , they must be either managed in HTML , concatenated , injected , or manually fetched and evaluated .
There is no native facility for scope isolation or dependency management .
JavaScript has no standard library .
It has a browser API , dates , and math , but no file system API , much less an IO stream API or primordial types for binary data .
JavaScript has no standard interfaces for things like Web servers or databases .
JavaScript has no package management system that manages dependencies and automatically installs them , except JSAN ( not to be confused with JSON ) , which falls short for scope isolation .
CommonJS ( n�e ServerJS ) is an initiative that began in January with a post by Kevin Dangoor to his blog and the founding of a mailing list .
In his blog , Kevin outlined the above problems and called for server - side JavaScript aficionados to band together , write some specs , and support interoperability on their respective platforms .
" [ This ] is not a technical problem , " he wrote .
" It 's a matter of people getting together and making a decision to step forward and start building up something bigger and cooler together . "
The call was answered .
One week later , with 224 members , and 653 messages posted , we knew Kevin had struck a nerve .
It probably helped that Kevin was already known for creating the Python Turbo Gears framework , Paver , and is presently working on Mozilla 's Bespin .
The people behind Helma , Hannes Wallnofer and Chris Zumbrunn , showed up .
Kris Zyp , of JSON extension fame , showed up with his JavaScript persistent - object store project , Persevere .
Ondrej Zara brought v8cgi to the drawing board .
Ihab Awad brought Google 's Caja .
Wes Garland brought a Mozilla SpiderMonkey - based implementation to the table .
One month later , we had converged on a specification for module systems and interoperable modules .
Now , there are over a dozen compliant implementations of CommonJS module loaders , and hundreds of compliant modules .
CommonJS is a growing collection of standards , including
Modules
Binary strings and buffers
Charset encodings
Binary , buffered , and textual input and output ( io ) streams
System process arguments , environment , and streams
File system interface
Socket streams
Unit test assertions , running , and reporting
Web server gateway interface , JSGI
Local and remote packages and package management
So far , CommonJS has converged on specifications for modules ( 1.1 ) , a system module ( 1.0 ) , and a unit testing API ( 1.0 ) .
The intent is to drive for a binary API next ; both ECMA TC39 ( the technical committee responsible for ECMAScript ) and the W3C ( the standards body responsible for browser standards ) are considering a joint pursuit .
Modules are a big deal .
CommonJS modules represent the first time a JavaScript community has converged on a module system that is as good as ( if not better than ) the best of Python and Ruby 's — supporting not only dependency management , but also scope isolation and relative module identifiers .
Module systems supporting CommonJS can be written for servers , browsers , desktop applications , and secure sandboxes .
Browser deployments can vary from XHR+eval ( for easy debugging ) to script injection ( for production or debugging ) either with a build step or dynamic , server - side support .
This means that modules targeting CommonJS compliance are truly interoperable .
The CommonJS module standard separates the concern of how your module system works from how modules should be written .
And the best part is that it 's real .
At jsconf.eu , several the CommonJS founder projects showcased CommonJS compliant module systems , a couple projects announced they were using CommonJS , and many others expressed interest in bringing CommonJS to their platforms .
NodeJS , a server - side JavaScript platform built on Google 's lightening - fast V8 engine by Ryan Dahl , showcases purely asynchronous IO and event loop concurrency .
Dahl spoke passionately about the pitfalls of threading and synchronous IO .
" Threaded concurrency is a leaky abstraction , " he claimed , and further , " Doing the right thing should be easy ; doing the wrong thing should be hard . "
In most programming contexts , there are pervasive synchronous IO libraries and system routines .
It can be hard to know whether an API will block , which makes it impossible to reliably write non-blocking code .
Anyone who has tried to write a concurrent socket server knows that the road is littered with the bones of those who came before .
Dahl 's talk won him a standing ovation .
Node is targeting a degree of CommonJS interoperability and presently supports the CommonJS module system .
Narwhal is a cross-platform , multi-engine general purpose JavaScript platform brought to you by Tom Robinson and 280 North , the makers of Cappuccino , Objective - J , 280 Slides , and 280 Atlas .
Narwhal presently supports Mozilla 's Rhino , V8 , Apple 's JavaScriptCore , and desktop applications in Mozilla 's XULRunner .
Narwhal can also host its modules for use in webpages .
Narwhal supports CommonJS modules and has prototype implementations of IO , file - system support , and binary data .
Narwhal also comes with a wealth of standard library modules collected and ported from every end of the Web for everything from command line option parsing to secure hashing .
Narwhal works out of the box and includes a package manager , " tusk , " that gives you instant access to literally dozens of installable packages .
In all seriousness , the catalog is growing quickly because making a package is as simple as adding a package .
json file to the root of a project on Github and as flexible as putting a Zip archive with a package .
json anywhere on the Web .
Tom Robinson also ported Ruby 's Rack Web application gateway and middleware framework to Narwhal , dubbing it Jack .
Jack tracks the CommonJS JSGI specification .
Jack applications can be run locally on Rhino with the Java Simple framework or Jetty , on JavaScriptCore with Tom 's own Jill framework ( comes with the narwhal - jsc package ) , and can be deployed on Google 's AppEngine .
Francisco Tolmasky from 280 North also presented on 280 Atlas and Cappuccino , a Web application IDE and framework modeled after Apple 's developer tools .
280 Atlas and the Cappuccino build tools are built on Narwhal with its JavaScriptCore engine adapters .
Particularly , Francisco ported Ruby 's Rake to Narwhal , dubbing it Jake .
Jake can be installed by running tusk install jake .
Julian Viereck and Ajaxian 's very own Dion Almear gave a presentation on Bespin .
The experimental Web - based IDE is in the midst of a refactor that will make it much easier to develop plugins , and will include server - side JavaScript components built on SproutCore , a server - side JavaScript framework that supports CommonJS modules .
Wakanda is an " end - to - end " JavaScript platform based on the Squirrel Fish JavaScript engine that provides an impressive REST API for server - side JavaScript object persistence and a client - side object browser .
Alexandre Mogaut 's slides are on Slideshare .net .
Not everyone made it to jsconf.eu , and some that did make it did not present their projects .

Are you in the UK ?
Do you enjoy warfare of the Modern variety via Xbox Live ?
This weekend , the more you play Cod Mewtwo online , the more money Activision will donate to charity .
On December 5th and 6th , industry giant Activision and UK specialty retailer GAME are joining forces for GAME For Good , a promotion aimed to get gamers logging into Xbox Live to blast some fools in Modern Warfare 2 in order to help children in war - torn environments .
For every gamer in the UK that spends time playing MW2 this weekend , Activision will donate money to the War Child Charity , up to Â £ 250,000 ( $ 416,000 ) .
There are n't any signups required , you do n't have to pay an entrance fee or register - as long as you 're a UK gamer playing MW2 online on one of the two dates , you 'll be clocking hours that count toward donations .
The War Child Charity , as described by the site , is " an international charity that protects children living in the world 's most dangerous war zones . "
In other words , even if Modern Warfare 2 is a rip- roaring good time for grown - up gamers ( at least judging by the conversations Jordan Deam and Spinwhiz have every morning about their escapades ) , actual modern warfare really , really is n't .
Now , I know we have some diehard Activision - haters ( and Microsoft - haters ) in our audience ( and be honest , you know who you are ) who are ready to grab their torches and point out that since you need an Xbox Live Gold account to play online , this is clearly a ploy by MS and Activision to just drum up sales , but just calm down for a moment ( and really , dial back the cynicism detector for once ) .
Xbox Live Gold memberships are free all weekend , so even if you do n't have XBL Gold you can still get in on the charity action .
So there you go .
Play a great game online this weekend , and a company donates money to an extremely worthy cause .
Sounds good to me .
Enlarge By Jessica Brandi Lifland for USA TODAY Michael Fulkerson hoses down the area where food scraps arrive .
Behind him ground - up food solids are separated out onto a conveyor belt into bins which will be emptied into a truck .
OAKLAND 
While many see restaurant leftovers as trash , a San Francisco - area utility sees them as a source of energy .
The East Bay Municipal Utility District , which provides water and wastewater treatment in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area , is turning food scraps from 2,300 Bay Area restaurants and grocery stores into electricity to help it power its wastewater facility .
Every day , one or two 20 - ton trucks pull up to the plant here and dump food waste into giant tanks .
At the end of the process , the food scraps create methane gas .
It helps power the plant 's electricity - making generators .
The project is the first of its kind in the nation for a wastewater treatment plant , the Environmental Protection Agency says , and it's at the forefront of an almost untapped renewable energy resource .
HERE COMES THE SUN : Will plan for cheaper solar ignite profits ?
While a handful of utilities , companies and universities nationwide have attempted to recycle food scraps into energy , less than 3 % of those scraps are diverted from landfills , the EPA says .
Most often , food waste that does n't go to landfills is composted for use in fertilizers .
Every year , more than 30 million tons of food waste goes to landfills , the EPA says , accounting for about 20 % of landfill waste .
The San Francisco - area utility district powers its wastewater plant , which serves about 650,000 Bay Area homes , by capturing methane gas by processing many kinds of waste , starting with wastewater .
To take up excess capacity , the utility started collecting other waste in 2001 , including that from wineries , dairies and chicken processors , says David Williams , director of wastewater for the utility .
Food scraps from restaurants and hotels were added in 2004 .
The plant now processes 100 to 200 tons of food scraps a week .
The goal is to do 100 to 200 tons a day – enough to power the equivalent of 1,300 to 2,600 homes – and rapid expansion is now expected .
By the end of next year , the district expects to create so much power from non-traditional waste that it 'll be able to sell excess power to Pacific Gas & Electric , a local electricity supplier , Williams says .
If 50 % of the USA 's food waste went through a similar process as the one here , there 'd be enough power for 2.5 million homes a year , the EPA says .
Dinner plates to electricity
The food - scrap project " has n't been a cakewalk , " Williams says .
Waste haulers , who pay the utility district to take the waste , collect the food scraps from restaurants and hotels as part of their normal garbage pickups .
Some of the haulers weed out big items , such as cardboard boxes used for produce .
Other haulers have restaurants and grocers do more of the separation so that the waste is cleaner .
Upon arrival via truck at the plant , the food scraps look like mounds of wet dirt .
They 're dumped into 20,000 - gallon underground tanks .
There , grinders turn the scraps into a mud -like substance .
Bigger items , such as rocks and utensils , fall out .
On a recent morning , it took just minutes for a 20 - ton truck to unload .
Pressure pulls most of the odors into the tank .
Still , the smell of cheese was present .
" That all comes from last night 's dinner plates , " Williams said as he watched .
From the underground tanks , the waste is run through sieves that reject plastics , bottle caps and other small items .
Then , the waste goes into anaerobic " digesters , " 2 million - gallon tanks filled with bacteria .
The bacteria break down the solids in the waste to 10 % of their original volume .
Methane gas is released in the process , which takes several weeks .
Instead of being released into the atmosphere as a greenhouse gas – as can happen at landfills – the gas is sent via overhead pipe to the plant 's power room .
The gas is consumed to make electricity ; the leftover waste is composted for use as fertilizer .
" It 's a very green program and pretty cutting edge , " says Paul Morsen , executive director of the Central Contra Costa Solid Waste Authority .
The district , formed to handle garbage contracts for six Bay Area communities , works with a garbage hauler to send food scraps to the East Bay utility for recycling .
Forty - five restaurants in its service area signed up for the program , Morsen says .
That 'll double by early next year .
Response has been favorable to the year - old program , Morsen says .
Some restaurants have had to wait to be added .
" We ask restaurants to do their part to clean the environment , " he says .
Since the program is still in its pilot phase , Morsen says it 's unclear whether costs for participating restaurants will go up , down or stay the same .
If they go up , " We have confidence it wo n't be a huge increase , " he says .
Educating busy busboys
The biggest challenge for the East Bay utility district is keeping plastics and other contaminants out of the food scraps and preventing them from clogging pipes should they get to the plant .
To help with that , haulers educate restaurant and grocery store workers on the need to separate food scraps from other trash .
" You 're trying to educate a busy busboy who may only be on the job a couple of months and perhaps making minimum wage .
It 's difficult , " Williams says .
Waste separation is about to become more the norm , at least in San Francisco .
A city ordinance that took effect Oct. 21 requires almost every residence and business to have three color - coded bins for waste : blue for recycling , green for compost and black for trash .
The composting bins are supplied to residents at no extra cost .
On a voluntary basis , city businesses and residents have been able to have curbside collection for food scraps in a separate bin since 2001 .
By separating food scraps – most of which are then composted – the businesses may end up paying less than if they 'd sent the scraps to a landfill , says Robert Reed , a spokesman for Recology , San Francisco 's waste collection company .
Even if the East Bay utility district fulfills its plans to process 200 tons of food waste a day , it 'll tap less than 10 % of the available supply , Williams says .
If it got it all – 1,800 tons generated by commercial enterprises daily in the region – it could provide enough power for more than 25,000 homes .
" That 's a small city , " Williams says .

Sorting Algorithm Shootout
Since I did my Sort Optimization post , I ’ve been keeping an eye on things that happen in the sorting world .
Recently an article popped up on Reddit about someone wanting to replace the JDK sorting algorithm with a Dual Pivot Quick Sort .
This lead to the discovery that Tim Sort would be replacing Merge Sort in the JDK starting with version 7 .
This probably got some attention because of the OpenJDK project .
It ’s nice to see that allowing more developers to work on different areas of the JDK .
First I ’ll do a quick overview of the algorithms , then show some benchmarks .
All algorithms are written in Java .
JDK 6 Sort
The JDK6 implements a fairly standard Merge Sort .
It will switch to an insertion sort at a specific depth .
QSort
This is the implementation of quicksort I outlined in the earlier blog post .
It performed admirably at the time , but how will it hold up against tougher competition .
It ’s pretty much an iterative quicksort , that short - circuits to a shell sort if it ’s going too deep .
Original QSort Post :
Sort Optimization
Tim Sort
This is an optimized in place variation of a merge sort .
Tim Peters developed this sorting algorithm for the Python programming language .
It is in use by Python and will be used by Java starting with JDK 7 .
It takes advantage of partially sorted parts of the list .
Available here :
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6804124
http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/tl/jdk/rev/bfd7abda8f79
Dual Pivot Quick sort
This is a newcomer to the sorting table .
Developed by Vladimir Yaroslavskiy for the inclusion into the Java language .
The premise is the same as quick sort , only it will choose two pivot points rather than one .
He did a full writeup detailing the algorithm , and its benefits .
I did modify it to take the comparable interface , and Vladimir explicitly said this was not the intended target of the algorithm .
He has stated it is designed to work directly with primitive types .
I do n’t see how doing an int comparison vs a Integer.compareTo( ) would be different , as long as they are used uniformly between all algorithms .
Since my sorting algorithm works with comparable , as does Tim Sort , I chose to convert this algorithm to use the Comparable interface also .
Available here :
http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.java.openjdk.core-libs.devel/2628
Results
These tables show the speedup relative to JDK 6 with and without warm up .
Here is the original text data if you ’re interested in that .
These are in simple table format .
The columns store the runtime in seconds for each algorithm .
The number in parenthesis is the speedup relative to JDK 6 .
Without Warmup
With Warmup
Tim Sort is definitely the way to go if you ’re interested in a stable sorting algorithm .
I was pretty amazed when I first looked at the results with how well it actually it did .
It really takes advantage of any presorted parts of the lists .
Overall , I ’d say my optimized quicksort does fairly well , but maybe it could do better .
I may have to look into that again .
Five years ago , on Boxing Day , December 26th , 2004 , a magnitude 9.3 earthquake hit the seafloor of the Indian Ocean , causing tremendous waves of seawater to rush ashore as devastating tsunamis that left 230,000 people dead across 13 different countries - the fifth deadliest natural disaster in recorded history .
Over 45,000 of the dead were never found .
Five years later now , reconstruction moves apace , as multiple aid groups have built more than 140,000 homes , 1,700 schools , 3,800 houses of worship and 3,700 km of roads .
On this anniversary of the catastrophe , we have collected here photographs of survivors , some rebuilding , some remembering , and seven sets of " before and after " photos ( numbers 4 - 10 , be sure to click them to see the transition effect ) .
I 'd also like to direct your attention to a fantastic multimedia presentation on this subject from Thomson / Reuters called Surviving the Tsunami . ( 25 photos total
Is the " geeky " image of computer science turning women off to the field ?
A new scientific study thinks so - but are the forces creating the gender gap in technology really just the perception of comic books and video games ?
Advertisement
Wired summarizes the study , found in the December Journal of Personality and Social Psychology .
Lead author and research Sapna Cheryan had an interesting question - if people can base their perceptions of another person on the items found in their bedroom , would the same type of reasoning apply in a classroom setting ?
Cheryan and her team quickly set up an experiment :
Cheryan and colleagues tested this idea by alternately decorating a computer science classroom with objects that earlier surveys pegged as stereotypically geeky - Star Trek posters , videogames and comic books - or with objects that the surveys found to be neutral - coffee mugs , plants and art posters .
Thirty - nine college students spent a few minutes in the room , then filled out a questionnaire on their attitudes toward computer science .
Women who spent time in the geeky room reported less interest in computer science than women who saw the neutral room .
For male students , however , the room 's décor made no difference .
In follow - up tests , a total of 215 students were asked to imagine they were joining either a geekily decorated or a neutrally decorated company after graduation .
For every possible scenario , women preferred the non-geeky space .
" It 's a consistent effect , " Cheryan says .
" The environment can communicate a sense of belonging , but it also communicates a sense of exclusion , or a sense that this is not a place where I would fit in . "
Advertisement
Cheryan and co-researchers believe that by creating more neutral appearing spaces will help combat stereotypes and improve diversity in the computer science field .
Cheryan is correct in thinking perception matters in how people place themselves in different roles .
But as a geeky girl gamer , I think that focusing on the internal motivations for why women avoid stereotypical or gendered areas ( i.e. , " I just do n't think I belong " ) obscures the nature of societal norms to influence women away from engaging in the maths and sciences , especially as they are considered male dominated spaces .

Some of the most fascinating explorations of this dynamic are found in Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat : New Perspectives on Gender and Gaming .
The collection of research findings and games theory , published in 2008 , reveal a lot more than barriers to entry for women who want to play games or work in the industry - it reveals how gender norms often influence how " permitted " women are to access certain spaces , and how those limitations function to maintain the low numbers of women entering fields like computer science or game design .
Advertisement
Some of the research upholds Cheryan 's ideas .
In " Becoming a Player , " T.L. Taylor uses the marketing strategies and environments of gaming stores to illustrate the belonging dynamic :
Part of the work of any leisure activity is coming to understand - practically and symbolically - that this is something you can do , that it is not at odds with your sense of self or your social world .
The game industry ( and , I would argue , the larger game community ) knows this at some level and is constantly working to give players information about new games , where to get them , why they are fun , and how to play them .
Just as powerfully , it is always mirroring back to boys and men that " this is your and your friends ' play space " and " you belong here .
Rarely are women gamers given this kind of attention .
( p. 55 )

Two other studies explain how the idea that some people " belong " and some do not take shape and manifest themselves in physical space .
" Getting Girls into the Game , " a joint study by Tracy Fullerton , Janine Fron , Celia Pearce , and Jacki Morie , explored a variety of reasons why more women do n't pursue careers in gaming .
After concluding that early experiences with video games impact how girls perceive the space , they note :
These early experiences pave the way to an interest in game development , but male - dominated environments can limit girls ' involvement .
In fact , computer labs in schools or clubhouses are often dominated by boys , who tend to elbow out the girls and take control of the equipment .
( p. 168 )
Advertisement
In " Gender Identity , Play Style , and the Design of Games for Classroom Learning , " researchers Carrie Heeter and Brian Winn also talk about some of the gendered norms that come into play when there are limitations on availability of equipment :
When boys play games ( or use computers ) , when there are fewer machines than people , girls step aside .
It is difficult to determine whether it is the girls ' " stepping aside " from their opportunity … or the boys " crowding out " the girls … .
Nonetheless , this chemistry seems to exist between males and females pervasively when it comes to using gaming machines .
( p.282 )

The most comprehensive ( and damning ) research comes from Holin Lin , who invested countless hours into her research in Taiwan .
Seeking answers to women 's exclusion from the larger gaming world , Lin decides to look into home life , societal messaging , school and peer groups in her groundbreaking study " Body , Space , and Gendered Gaming Experiences : A Cultural Geography of Homes , Cybercafés and Dormitories . "
I devoted a substantial portion of my review of Beyond Barbie and Mortal Kombat to Lin 's research , because the connections drawn are mindblowing :
Deftly weaving connections between the threat of violence , gendered socialization , and the internalized expectations of the women themselves , Lin paints a scenario familiar to any woman who moves into a heavily gendered space .
Taiwanese youth frequent cybercafés to increase their skills , use upgraded machines , and hang out with their friends .
However , women gamers looking to participate in the fun have to contend with real - world harassment :
The layouts of some cybercafés serve as gender barriers : girls must pass through a room full of pool tables to access the back spaces that are reserved for computers .
Most girls are not willing to subject themselves to the scrutiny of and comments made by the pool players , and therefore only enter when accompanied by male friends .
This parallels one of Lin 's observations of cybercafés in Taiwan … most girls are unwilling to enter a cybercafé unless accompanied by a male friend .
Together , these stories imply that physical and social barriers to entry for women become misinterpreted as a lack of desire to play video games .
Despite the limits of online , virtual communities , however , they are often more appealing to female gamers than actual , physical cybercafés , as Lin points out : Women 's fear and perceptions of risk are deeply rooted in their bodies , and avoiding dangerous places is a common practice for managing the fear of male violence .
In contrast , no threat of physical harm exists for players wearing either female or male avatar bodies .
Advertisement
Outside of the dynamics of the cybercafe scene , Lin also looks at women at home , from growing up with their parents to their play dynamics in college dormitories .
Lin notes that college - aged male gamers tend to see gaming as a way to bond , while female gamers are often ostracized and made into a minority .
In addition , family pressures tend to place pressure on girls to do more help with household tasks , as well as to work on social relationships .
Males , however , were often left to their own devices when it came to interacting with technology .
This functions to increase discomfort with technologies as women are socialized to spend less time understanding and getting familiar with these types of systems .
Over time , this casual discouragement on so many fronts presents girls with a disincentive to continue working with or playing with game systems - and this dynamic is also evident with most other technologies , including computers .
Lin concludes that " [ c] ultural constructions of gender are ubiquitous and therefore hard to remove from any analytical interpretation of gender issues in computer gaming . "
And indeed , while Cheryan has the right idea with looking at how spaces can be perceived as hospitable and inhospitable , solving the issue of gender gaps in technology will require looking at encouragement to get into the maths and sciences plays strongly into societal idea of what girls are " supposed " to do and where they " belong . "
And I 'm afraid it will be a bit more complex than redesigning classrooms .

Searching for poly ( A ) tails
by Ketil Malde ; December 14 , 2009
I ’m currently involved in a project where we study , among other things , the 3 ’UTR and poly - A tails of certain genes .
For this , is of course important to accurately identify the poly - A tail in each transcript , but I could n’t find any program or tool to do just that .
Presumably the task is considered too trivial ?
So , like many other “ trivial ” tasks , it is performed by ad - hoc solutions that are likely to be suboptimal .
Here ’s a better method that identifies poly - A tails by finding an optimal , quality adjusted alignment in linear time .
A quick introduction
Although the definitions of what constitutes a gene vary considerably , we ’ll use the term to refer to a region of DNA that get transcribed , that is , copied from DNA into an mRNA molecule , which in turn will be used as a blueprint for assembling a protein .
After transcription , the mRNA molecule then undergoes polyadenylation , a process where a string of adenines ( the ‘ A ’ of the nucleotide alphabet ) gets appended to an mRNA molecule before it is exported from the nucleus .
Identifying poly - A tails are important for several reasons .
It positively identifies the end of the transcript .
If you do n’t have a poly - A in your sequence , you have no way to know how far the molecule extends beyond the end of the sequence .
You can also find alternatively terminated transcripts this way .
It positively identifies the end of the transcript .
Anything after the poly - A tail is linker or vector sequence , and can safely be trimmed off .
Even if , as is often the case , it is too low quality to be recognized by your average vector masking software .
It provides useful information about the transcript , as the poly - A tail is important for things like protecting the mRNA from degradation .
Unfortunately utilities often trim poly - A tails by default ( e.g. SeqClean ) , or just ignore it ( e.g. BLAST ’s low - complexity filter ) .
Quality based alignment
ϵ = 10-Q/10
When a molecule is sequenced , the analog output from the sequencing machine is stored as a chromatogram .
In order to be useful , the sequence is called , that is , translated to a string of letters from the familiar { A , C , G , T} nucleotides alphabet .
In addition , the base caller will associate each letter with a quality value .
This is derived from an estimate of the probability of the call being incorrect , and for quality value Q , the error probability estimate is
Traditionally sequence alignment simply aligns the string of characters using a fixed positive score ( reward ) for aligning similar characters , and fixed negative scores ( penalties ) for either substituting a different character , opening a gap , or extending a previous gap .
However , taking into account the quality value , we can do better , and instead of fixed scores , we can adjust the scores dynamically according to quality .
Using this method , the penalty for e.g. aligning two different characters will depend on the quality of the characters : high quality means a high penalty , low quality – lower penalty ( since there ’s a greater chance one of them was incorrectly called ) .
Scoring of alignments
When calculating the score of an alignment , we really want to answer the question : how likely is this sequence to be a real poly - A sequence , as opposed to just a random string ?
In other words , we are comparing our sequence against two models : the poly - A model , and the background model .
Our score will use the ratio of probabilities of the string being produced by the two models .
For the poly - A model , only As are allowed , so the probability of a character occurring is 1 for As and 0 for the others .
For the background model , we ’ll just take a uniform distribution of nucleotides , each getting a probability of 0.25 .
Using this scheme , the score for a string s is simply 1/0.25 = 4 for each A , and 0/0.25 = 0 for all others .
We usually work with the logarithm of these numbers to make them more manageable .
The optimal alignment is then simply the longest run of As , since as soon as you multiply with a zero ( or add - infinity , if you use log - scores ) , you lose the whole score .
Adding quality to the mix
Of course , the actual sequence is n’t perfect , and even the poly - A tail is likely to contain the odd G , C , or T .
To determine exactly how likely is where the quality value enters the picture .
Using the formula above , we can calculate the error estimate and decide what the penalty for a mismatch and reward for a match should be .
For the poly - A model , the probability for a match ( that is , an actual ‘ A ’ in the sequence ) is 1 -ϵ , the probability of a mismatch ( a non - A ) is ϵ/3 ( since only one of the three possible substititutions is an A , and for simplicity , we give them equal probability ) .
Using the formula for ϵ as a function of Q ( and hopefully not introducing any errors ) , I get the scores to be :
match q = log ( 4*( 1-1/10 **( q/10 ) ) ) mismatch q = log 4 - log 3 - q/10*log 10
Now , we can use this to do a standard Smith - Waterman alignment , calculating a dynamic programming matrix , and searching for an optimal local alignment .
However , since we ’re aligning against a repeated nucleotide , there ’s no real need for a second dimension , and we can use the following recurrence to calculate the “ polyA - score ” M for each position i :
M i = max(0 , S i + M i − 1 )
To implement this , we first define the list of scores by applying match and mismatch to the list of ( nucleotide , quality ) pairs .
We also define a scanl - based function to calculate a list of cumulative scores :
scores = map ( \( c , q ) -> if toUpper c== ' A ' then match q else mismatch q ) qd cumulative = scanl ( \a b -> let r = a + b in max 0 r )
The only remaining thing is to identify the maximal value which marks the end of the poly - A tail , and the corresponding 0 value that indicates the start .
I wrote a recursive function called findmax for this , but a better programmer will probably be able to do this with a fold .
Including the parts discussed briefly above , the whole thing looks like this :
findPolyA :: Sequence Nuc ->
Maybe ( Int , Int ) findPolyA ( Seq _ d mq ) = let qd = zip ( B.unpack d ) ( maybe ( repeat 15 ) BB.unpack mq ) scores = map ( \( c , q ) -> if toUpper c== ' A ' then match q else mismatch q ) qd match x ' = let x = fromIntegral x ' in log ( 4*( 1-1/10 **( x/10 ) ) ) mismatch x ' = let x = fromIntegral x ' in log 4 - log 3 - x/10 * log 10 cumulative = scanl ( \a b -> let r = a + b in max 0 r ) 0 ( zi , mi , maxscore ) = findmax $ cumulative scores in if maxscore > 12 then Just ( zi+1 , mi ) else Nothing -- arbitrary constant alert !
findmax :: [ Double ] ->
( Int , Int , Double ) findmax = go 0 ( 0,0,0 ) . zip [ 0 ..] where go _ cm [ ] = cm go _ cm ( ( i,0 ) : rest ) = go i cm rest go last_z ( cmz , cmi , cmx ) ( ( i , x ) : rest ) = if x > cmx then go last_z ( last_z , i , x ) rest else go last_z ( cmz , cmi , cmx ) rest
Availability
This method is implemented in a simple tool called “ trimpolya ” ( darcs repo ) , and also in the more general “ dephd ” ( darcs , hackage ) sequence analysis package .

Apple has placed mass orders for 10 - inch displays as well as strong glass panels and connectors to go with them , according to two separate reports out of the Far East that peg the components for the company 's much - anticipated tablet device .
According to DigiTimes , Foxconn 's panel - making subsidiary Innolux will serve as the primary supplier of 10 - inch panels for the forthcoming multi- touch device while Wintek — Apple 's primary iPhone display panel purveyor — will be tasked with filling many of the remaining orders .
Citing sources from the iPhone maker 's component suppliers , the Taiwanese rumor site also reports that the Cupertino - based company has been " seeking solutions to strengthen the glass of the 10 - inch panel for the " tablets , a move which contributed to delaying the device 's launch until the first - quarter 2010 .
Foxconn 's optical glass processing subsidiary G - Tech Optoelectronics will reportedly provide this unidentified glass strengthening process , while Taiwan - based optical film maker Wah Hong Industrial has also been tapped to supply components that will aid in the effort .
Based on an analysis of the shipping schedules of Apple 's upstream component suppliers , DigiTimes predicts that Apple could announce its new tablet device in January with volume shipments to follow by March .
Separately , Taiwan 's " Economic Daily " newspaper also reported Monday that Cheng Uei Precision has received large orders for new flat - panel Tablet PC connector parts , but oddly suggests the company is unlikely to start delivering those parts to Apple until the third quarter of 2010 .
Last Summer , AppleInsider was first to report that Apple would base its long - awaited tablet device around a 10 - inch display and that the device was bound to turn up no earlier than the first quarter of 2010 .
Our 1 Billionth Spam Message
PUBLISHED : DECEMBER 15 , 2009
On Wednesday , December 9 , 2009 at 06:20 ( GMT ) Project Honey
Pot received its billionth email spam message .
The message , a picture of which is displayed below , was a United States Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) phishing scam .
The spam email was sent by a bot running on a compromised machine in India ( 122.167.68.1 ) .
The spamtrap address to which the message was sent was originally harvested on November 4 , 2007 by a particularly nasty harvester ( 74.53.249.34 ) that is responsible for 53,022,293 other spam messages that have been received by Project Honey Pot .
Every time Project Honey
Pot receives a message we estimate that another 125,000 are sent to real victims .
Our billionth message represents approximately 125 trillion spam messages that have been sent since Project Honey Pot started in 2004 .
At this milestone , we wanted to take a second to report some of our findings .
Our goal is not to rehash the same old insights but instead to give a new picture that only looking at five years and a billion data points can produce .
Who Are These Spammers ?
Several organizations publish regular reports on the source countries for spam .
We have one of our own .
The problem is that these reports tell very little about the actual source of spam messages because of the nature of how spam is sent today .
Rather than sending spam directly , spammers primarily use " bot " machines in order to effectively launder their identities .
These bots are PCs that have been compromised by a virus and whose owner usually does not know they are being used to send spam .
The process is not unlike the stereotypical scene in a movie where the villain keeps his phone call from being traced by relaying it through a number of connections .
Similarly , spammers ' use of bots can make their messages look like they are coming from somewhere completely different than their actual location .
As a result , lists of spam origin countries tell you very little about where the spammers are actually located .
On the other hand , they can help provide insight into a country 's security policies because they give evidence on the number of bots operating within a country 's borders .
Since every country will have a different number of PCs , to make this number comparable we needed to create a ratio .
We decided to look at the number of compromised machines operating within the country divided by the number of security professionals operating in the country .
This gives us a relative IT security score .
As a proxy for the number of security professionals we used members in Project Honey Pot .
Here are the results :
Best IT Security # 1 Finland # 2 Canada # 3 Belgium # 4 Australia # 5 Netherlands # 6 United States # 7 Norway # 8 New Zeland # 9 Sweden # 10 Estonia Worst IT Security # 1 China # 2 Azerbaijan # 3 South Korea # 4 Colombia # 5 Macedonia # 6 Turkey # 7 Viet Nam # 8 Kazakhstan # 9 Macau # 10 Brazil
Because sending spam remains the primary use of bots , Project Honey Pot has a unique perspective on bot network activity .
Since 2004 , active bots have grown at a compound annual growth rate of more than 378 % .
In other words , the number of bots has nearly quadrupled ever year .
In 2009 , you could find nearly 400,000 active bots engaged in malicious activity on any given day with several million active over the course of any month .
Fortunately , Project Honey
Pot 's coverage of active botnets has grown over time at an even faster rate .
In 2006 , we saw less than 20 % of the active bots on any given day .
Today we see more than 80 % .
While tracking bots has become a critical aspect of Project Honey Pot , we remain curious where the spammers are actually located .
To get at this information it 's critical to look at spammer activities that are not laundered through bots .
While sending email spam can easily be done in parallel ( i.e. , 1 million machines can send one message each ) harvesting email addresses , which involves crawling web pages , cannot .
This makes sense : crawling without centralized command and control will result in a lot of crawling of the same popular pages over and over again .
Our research indicates that , unlike the bots used to send spam , the machines used for harvesting tend to be more permanent , stable , and closely connected to the actual spammer 's location .
So where are the spammers actually located ?
We think the list below gives the most accurate approximation .
Where Harvesters Are # 1 United States # 2 Spain # 3 Netherlands # 4 United Arab Emirates # 5 Hong Kong # 6 Romania # 7 Great Britain # 8 China # 9 South Africa # 10 Germany
How Do They Operate ?
On average , spammers today are faster than they 've ever been before .
The chart below indicates the average time from harvesting an email address from a web page to when the spammer sends the first email to that address .
2004 49 days 18 hours 54 minutes 15 seconds 2005 32 days 15 hours 39 minutes 41 seconds 2006 29 days 29 hours 10 minutes 24 seconds 2007 23 days 11 hours 53 minutes 03 seconds 2008 22 days 12 hours 36 minutes 54 seconds 2009 21 days 17 hours 17 minutes 28 seconds
We have found that speed is tied to the content of the message .
" Product " spammers -- those selling an actual product of some kind , whether it be fake pharmaceuticals , college degrees , or mortgage loans -- tend to operate on a slower cycle , spending approximately a month gathering email addresses and then targeting those addresses with a set of spam campaigns .
Product spammers tend to hold on to email addresses longer and send on average several messages a week to each address on their list .
On the other hand " Fraud " spammers -- those committing phishing or so - called " 419 " advanced fee scams -- tend to send to and discard harvested addresses almost immediately .
The increased average speed of spammers appears to be mostly attributable to the rise in spam as a vehicle for fraud rather than an increasing efficiency among traditional product spammers .
One intriguing insight our data provides is that bad guys take vacations too .
For example , there is a 21 % decrease in spam on Christmas Day and a 32 % decrease on New Year 's Day .
Monday is the biggest day of the week for spam , while Saturday receives only about 60 % of the volume of Monday 's messages .
The chart below shows the time of day spammers are most likely to send their messages .
All times in the chart are set to the East Coast timezone of the United States ( GMT - 0500 ) .
Whom Do They Target ?
Spammers are a creative bunch and we have seen a wide variety of offers show up in the one billion messages we have received .
Among products sold through spam , pharmaceuticals remain the most popular .
To give you a sense , we 've seen the word " Viagra " spelled at least 956 different ways in order to try and trick spam filters ( e.g. , VIAGRA , V1AGRA , V1@GR@ , V!AGRA , VIA6RA , etc. ) .
While spammers will often alter their messages to look different , some are remarkably consistent .
The table below shows the top message FROM / SUBJECT line pairs over the last five years .
We have also included our estimate of how many of each message was sent Internet - wide .
RANK FROM SUBJECT EST .
INTERNET -WIDE VOLUME #1 Instant Booster Can you afford to lose 300,000 potential customers ?
100 billion # 2 Internal Revenue Service Notice of Underreported Income 91 billion # 3 Feed Blaster Receive hundreds of targeted hits to your website 65 billion # 4 Hit-Booster
How to get free quality visitors to your website ?
51 billion # 5 Feed Blaster Feed Blaster puts your ad right to the screens of millions 44 billion
To give you some sense , assuming an average message storage requirement of 4KB , over the last 5 years the total storage requirement imposed on the Internet by just the spammers sending the top - 20 spam campaigns was over 2.5 petabytes .
Beyond the product spam , fraudulent spam increasingly dominates our spam stream .
The chart below shows the relative distribution of the most phished organizations online .
While banks and financial institutions still make up a majority of the phishing scams circulated via spam , social networks are increasingly targeted .
In 2008 , there were virtually no Facebook phishing message .
Today Facebook is the second most phished organization online and , if current trends continue , is on track to take the top spot in 2010 .
The Future of Spam
The good news for email users is that filtering technologies have done a terrific job keeping most of the volume of spam messages out of their inboxes .
Behind the scenes , however , the volume of email spam continues to grow at a blistering pace .
While spam may strike the average user as a minor annoyance , the real risk it continues to pose is providing a viable business model to finance the construction of bot networks .
Our research indicates that these bots are increasingly multi-purposed into vectors for new types of attacks ranging from annoyances like comment spam to real threats like denial of service attacks ( DDoS ) .
For example , if you run a blog you are aware of the comment spam attacks your site faces every day .
This new breed of spammers uses the forms on websites to post advertisements and links to pages they are paid to promote .
Project Honey
Pot has been tracking their behavior for two years and has witnessed its gowth in volume and sophistication .
Where Comment Spammers Are # 1 United States # 2 China # 3 Brazil # 4 Japan # 5 Russia # 6 South Korea # 7 Ukraine # 8 Poland # 9 Germany # 10 Hong Kong
Looking at the data patterns , comment spam in 2009 resembles email spam when Project Honey Pot began in 2004 .
While comment spammers today are tending to use a relatively limited set of machines to post their messages , if this new breed of spammers follows the email spammers ' lead to massive adoption of bot networks then it will pose a significant threat to websites everywhere .
To counter these increasing threats , web administrators need to continue to share data about attacks they see on their own sites through efforts such as Project Honey Pot .
Over the next year , we will be launching a number of new initiatives to increase the protection we offer .
In the meantime , if you run a website , we encourage you to become a member of Project Honey Pot today and encourage others to do so as well .
Only by working together do we stand a chance to face the challenges that lie ahead .
Finally , thanks to all the current Project Honey
Pot members as well as the organizations that have helped us build our infrastructure .
A few days ago , we flamed Citigroup and Tim Geithner for once again screwing taxpayers with the bungled TARP exit .
A Wall Street friend writes to say that our scorn for Citi was actually misplaced , that it was all the Treasury 's fault :
Citi management has been responsible for countless prior sins , but this one belongs to Uncle Sam .
I 've been negative on the stock , in part because being that deep in hock to the government creates unpredictable , unquantifiable and open ended risk .
So professionally , this week 's debacle was great for me .
But as a taxpayer / shareholder of Citi I 'm totally outraged and this whole thing is an example of how this mindless popular outrage at " Wall Street " for all the world 's problems creates adverse consequences that hurt everyone .
Start with the simple fact that the most unusual and disagreeable fact about Citi versus all the other troubled banks out there was that the government owned a third of the shares .
I can't tell you how many people say " We wo n't buy it till they 're out . "
So in the fall , some 38 BILLION shares trade in the market at above $ 4 .
The Singapore government sells more than a billion shares for a $ 1.6B profit and the Kuwaiti government sells over a billion shares for a $ 1.1B profit .
Had our government sold our shares , we could have had a $ 5 - $ 6B profit .
All the hedge funds were eargerly awaiting a $ 5 - $ 10 billion block trade in the stock , thinking that it would be a positive catalyst .
We were all constantly wondering " Where is it ?
What are they waiting for ? "
Surely this would have been the rational thing to do .
The government would still have effective control because the TARP preferreds and the ring - fence agreement [ in which the government guaranteed some Citi asset losses ] were the mechanisms of control .
But selling the common would have been great for everyone .
The government could have said " See. Partial Victory .
We got most of our money back at a profit . "
Citi. could have said , " See , we 're making progress on our privatization . "
It had WIN / WIN written all over it and the market would have embraced it and made Citi 's access to capital to repay TARP a lot easier .
Well ...
Treasury did n't want to do it that way .
Instead , they insist on holding the stock until the preferreds are repaid .
This dramatically limits Citi 's universe of buyers .
Next , they do n't give them any break on the consideration for the ring fence .
Normally when you cancel an insurance policy you get a refund ....
Next , let 's make them do it the week before Christmas , oh yes and then -- just to put the cherry on top of the whole confection -- let 's pressure Wells Fargo into doing a $ 10 billion stock deal right as we 're trying to build the deal book ....
[ Citi was trying to sell an extraordinary amount of stock - - $ 17 billion -- so the news that another $ 10 billion of Wells Fargo would be sold made it harder to find buyers for the Citi stock . ]
Could the Treasury have made it any more difficult for Citigroup ?
Its like one of those old Westerns where the guy walks into a bar and the bad hombres there pummel him for the next 45 minutes until every stool and bottle has been broken over his body .
And the sad thing , aside from the fact that the taxpayers may never see $ 4.50 again , is that it makes capital harder to raise and therefore more expensive for everyone .
That it turn makes credit more constrained and expensive for all the borrowers .
This whole thing was an outrage .
I can't think of a single reason , other than maybe just dumb , blind anger at " Wall Street " for why one would have acted the way the government did .
The Anti-God Squad
Three years ago Wired magazine popularized the term " New Atheism " with a cover story about the " crusade against belief " launched by Richard Dawkins ( No. 18 ) , Daniel Dennett , and Sam Harris .
( Christopher Hitchens , No. 47 , filled out the roster later . )
Now the crusade is encountering powerful and possibly pivotal resistance .
It is n’t that the citadels of faith are rolling back the tide of unbelief .
Among intellectuals — a target audience of the New Atheists — professing traditional faith is no more common than it was three years ago , and may even be less common .
But the New Atheists ’ main short - term goal was n’t to turn believers into atheists , it was to turn atheists into New Atheists — fellow fire - breathing preachers of the anti-gospel .
The point was to make it not just uncool to believe , but cool to ridicule believers .
And this year doubts about that mission have taken root among the New Atheists ’ key demographic : intellectuals who are n’t religious and are n’t conservative .
Even on the secular left , the alarming implications of the " crusade against religion " are becoming apparent :
Though the New Atheists claim to be a progressive force , they often abet fundamentalists and reactionaries , from the heartland of America to the Middle East .
If you ’re a Midwestern American , fighting to keep Darwin in the public schools and intelligent design out , the case you make to conservative Christians is that teaching evolution wo n’t turn their children into atheists .
So the last thing you need is for the world ’s most famous teacher of evolution , Richard Dawkins , to be among the world ’s most zealously proselytizing atheists .
These atmospherics only empower your enemies .
So too with foreign policy : Making " Western " synonymous with " aggressively atheist " is n’t a recipe for quelling anti-Western Islamist radicalism .
And there ’s a subtle but potent sense in which New Atheism can steer foreign policy to the right .
Axiomatic to New Atheism is that religion is not just factually wrong , but the root of evil , which suggests that other proposed root causes of the sort typically stressed on the left are n’t really the problem .
Sam Harris , in discussing terrorism , wholly dismisses such contributing factors as " the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza , " " the collusion of Western powers with corrupt dictatorships , " and " the endemic poverty and lack of economic opportunity that now plague the Arab world . "
The problem , Harris states , is religion , period .
Most New Atheists are n’t expressly right wing , but even so their discounting of the material causes of Islamist radicalism can be " objectively " right wing ( as in George Orwell ’s assertion that pacifists were " objectively pro-fascist " regardless of their views about fascism ) .
Dawkins , for example , has written that if there were no religion then there would be " no Israeli / Palestinian wars . "
This view is wrong — the conflict started as an essentially secular argument over land — but it ’s popular among parts of the U.S. and Israeli right .
The reason is its suggestion that there ’s no point in , say , removing Israeli settlements so long as the toxin of religion is in the air .
All the great religions have shown time and again that they ’re capable of tolerance and civility when their adherents do n’t feel threatened or disrespected .
At the same time , as some New Atheists have now shown , you do n’t have to believe in God to exhibit intolerance and incivility .
Maybe this is the New Atheists ’ biggest problem :
As living proof that religion is n’t a prerequisite for divisive fundamentalism , they are walking rebuttals to their own ideology .

Democrats are setting their sights on 50 House Republicans they say voted against a measure to expand funding for national flu emergencies .
In a series of releases sent out on Monday , the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee faulted some GOP lawmakers -- including House Republican Leader John Boehner ( Ohio ) -- for voting against a supplemental appropriations bill in June that included about $ 2 billion in flu pandemic funding .
ADVERTISEMENT
Although the conference report they cite did ultimately pass , the DCCC still criticized those GOP lawmakers for voting against federal assistance at a time when states were already scrambling to brace for a possible H1N1 crisis .
" President Barack Obama ’s recent declaration that the H1N1 flu outbreak is a national emergency serves as another stark reminder of Representative John Boehner ’s reckless just - say - no approach to preparing for the pandemic , " the DCCC writes in one release , targeting Boehner 's district .
" Despite multiple warnings of this fall ’s H1N1 pandemic , Representative John Boehner joined 169 Republican colleagues this summer in opposing funds to help families , schools , and businesses prepare for the worst , " the DCCC added .
Democrats ' latest line of attack , however , is likely to anger Republicans , many of whom announced at the time they would not support that particular bill -- a war supplemental conference report -- because it included too many " extraneous , non-war related , funding proposals . "
" In terms of overall spending , the conference agreement provides $ 106 billion .
This is $ 16 billion more than the President ’s request , $ 9 billion more than the House - passed level , and $ 15 billion more than the Senate - passed level , " they said in a policy statement , published in June .
" However , the primary concern with the agreement is the significantly smaller increase in funding for defense compared to increases other federal agencies and programs will likely receive this year . "

What is self - publishing ?
So , you 've written a book ?
Your family and friends love it .
You think , " If only there was an easy , fast way to share it with the world . "
You decide to look into publishing your book and stumble upon the term " self - publishing . "
Things look bright .
You read the author reviews and discover that writers just like you are getting published every day .
You look up their books on Amazon and Barnes & Noble .
There they are : actual high - quality professional books for sale worldwide on all the major e-retailer websites .
Yes , there is a better way to self publish a book -- one that does not require learning all the ins and outs of ISBNs , barcodes , formatting , taxes , etc .
Welcome to Outskirts Press , the A+ rated and # 1 - rated self - publishing company according to the Better Business Bureau and Top Consumer Reviews , respectively .
We first noticed Marine Sgt. Charles Dyer , aka " July4 Patriot , " back in March , when we ran one of the first reports on the " Oath Keepers " bloc of the Tea Party movement -- an organization devoted to recruiting military and police - force veterans into a Patriot - movement belief system predicated on a series of paranoid conspiracy theories , especially the notion that the federal government intends to begin rounding up citizens and putting them in concentration camps .
Dyer played a prominent role in connecting the Oath Keepers to the Tea Party movement , speaking at a July 4 Tea Party rally in Broken Arrow , Oklahoma .
And he 's been involved in organizing militia " maneuvers " in Oklahoma .
Dyer cropped up again in the news -- this time in the police blotter for allegedly raping a 7 - year - old girl :
An ex-military man has been arrested on charges of rape of a child and forcible sodomy .
Charles Alan Dyer , 29 , of Marlow , was arrested Tuesday afternoon by Stephens County Sheriff ’s deputies , said Sheriff Wayne McKinney .
Dyer served in the United States Marines in Iraq .
Oh , and guess what police found when they searched his home :
During the search the sheriff ’s deputies noted several firearms and a device believed to be a Colt M - 203 , 40 - millimeter grenade launcher , a complaint filed in the United States District Court of Western Oklahoma by Alcohol , Firearms and Tobacco Special Agent Brett Williams said .
As the story from KAUZ - TV notes , Dyer had a history of making bizarre claims in his videos -- as well as violent fears of being arrested .
“ We come home and those bastards want to talk about how we ’re domestic terrorists and a threat to this country .
It makes me so angry , ” said Charles Dyer , who has been accused of committing rape .
...
More incriminating evidence against Dyer has surfaced in a YouTube video .
The video shows Dyer , a former U.S. Marine , talking proudly about domestic terrorism .
“ Join the military ? ” , said Dyer .
“ Depends on what you want to do with it .
Me ?
I 'm going to use my training and become one of those domestic terrorists that you ’re so afraid of from the DHS reports . ” ... “ I ’m certainly not going to be hiding from my command anymore .
I ’m not hiding from ATF .
Not hiding from FBI .
Any organization .
If they want to come get me I ’m not going to be afraid , ” Dyer said .
“ Patriots , we are not overpowered .
If we united under one banner and fight for our children ’s liberity and the constitution , our resolve is invincible to any standing army , ” Dyer said .
GossipBoy is reporting that the rape victim was a close family member .
They also report that Dyer had been in touch with a fellow militiaman linked to explosives dealing , and that when bomb - sniffing dogs searched Dyer 's home , they indicated explosives had been stored there recently .
Meanwhile , unsurprisingly , the folks at American Resistance Movement -- a group Dyer was also prominently involved in -- are claiming that Dyer was set up , and the girl who accused him was " programmed " to do so .
Accordingly , they 've set up a " Free July4 Patriot " fund , with a little button on their front page so you can donate .
Also , Dyer 's YouTube page remains active .
Every movement attracts its freaks .
But the Patriot movement attracts an inordinate number of them -- and particularly people with a pedophilia problem .
( I can list at least 10 different prominent figures in the Northwest 's Patriot movement in the 1990s who had a history of being charged with abusing and abducting children . )
Evidently , being a pedophile leads to resentment of the government -- probably for its desire to lock you away .
We 'll reserve judgment on Dyer 's guilt or innocence for after the trial .
But let 's just say that the predictable claims that he 's been arrested as part of a government plot to silence him are not exactly compelling in this case .

Vlad Putin , we 're sorry we ever made fun of you .
In an interview today with Voice of Russia radio , Russia 's space agency chief said discussions would begin soon over a plan to save the world from a collision with a massive asteroid .
It 's not clear how , exactly , the Russians plan to deflect Apophis , a chunk of rock the size of two and a half soccer fields that was first discovered by astronomers in 2004 .
Anatoly Perminov , the space agency head , promised that there would be " no nuclear explosions " and that everything would be done " on the basis of the laws of physics . "
Astronomers initially guessed that Apophis had a reasonably good chance of smashing into Earth on its first flyby ; NASA now reckons that the chances of that have gone from slim ( one - in - 45,000 ) to almost none ( four - in - a million ) .
But despite the lower NASA estimate , the Russians are n't so sure .
Perminov said the asteroid " will surely collide with the Earth in the 2030s . "
Of course , that gives the Russians plenty of time to recruit a telegenic team of cosmonauts to neutralize the threat from Apophis .
May we suggest an online contest , à la Miss Atom ?
In fairness , the Russians are n't the only ones thinking about saving the Earth from asteroids .
Alexis Madrigal of Wired Science has an excellent write - up of some of the options .
The first is the Armageddon approach , knocking the asteroid off course with a nuclear blast or a collision .
The second , Madrigal writes , is a “ shepherding ” operation that would slowly alter the asteroid ’s trajectory in space .
Either way , the reality is a bit less made - for - Hollywood : Asteroid - deflection would demand a lot of international cooperation .
And a lot of money .
Perminov 's take ?
It 's worth the investment .
'' People 's lives are at stake , " he said .
" We should pay several hundred million dollars and build a system that would allow to prevent a collision , rather than sit and wait for it to happen and kill hundreds of thousands of people . "
UPDATE : Former U.S. astronaut Rusty Schweickart writes in to Danger Room with a few words of praise for Russia 's space agency .
" Perminov is right that the capability to deflect an impact threatening asteroid needs to be developed and demonstrated , and that that work needs to be done cooperatively with other space agencies , " Schweickart e-mails .
" And he should be loudly applauded for that . "
But Perminov , Schweickart adds , is incorrect in assuming that Apophis seriously threatens to strike Earth .
From his reply :
It has ( based on current tracking data ) only a 1 in 233,000 chance of passing through a very narrow region in space ( a keyhole ) as it passes by the Earth in 2029 that would cause it to impact 7 years later in 2036 .
That is quite a low probability of impact !
And … with additional tracking coming available in 2012 - 2013 ( when it comes back into sight of our telescopes ) we are most likely to find that it , in fact , poses a zero risk of a 2036 impact .
And , on the slim chance that it does still pose an impact risk , we have plenty of time * after that * to mount an internationally coordinated deflection campaign … if , and only if , needed .
Schweickart is the chairman of the B612 Foundation , which has advocated its own approach to asteroid deflection .
For more information on that subject , you can also read up on the Association of Space Explorers website .
" Prove the capability by doing it , " Schweickart adds .
" But not on Apophis ! "

Ah , Triana .
Venture Bros may be a show about failure , but Orpheus 's daughter seems to be doing okay for herself .
Sure , her dad 's a dork and he has a tendency to wipe her memory if she gets too close to the portal to the other side that lives in her bedroom closet , but she 's basically cool .
Which means we do n't really know her that well .
While it 's not an across the board certainty , women in shows like this are usually sharper , more reasonable , and just much better put - together than their male counter - parts .
Because this is a playground for writers like Doc Hammer and Jackson Publick , and in the playground , the girls always seem to know something the boys do n't .
" The Better Man " had the return of Triana , as well as the Order of the Triad , and Orpheus 's shape - shifting occult boss .
Good to see all of them again , because of all the dysfunctional family groups on the show , the Order has always seemed the healthiest .
Orpheus is a bit of a stick in the mud , and he gets mocked for it ( to great effect , usually ) , but he's also the closest thing to a sane person we have now that Brock 's gone .
And even with Brock around , Orpheus is easily the most reasonable character .
He starts " Man " jealous of his wife 's current lover , but he gets over it quickly enough .
We 've had other characters behave suspiciously close to maturity in the past , but with Orpheus , it always seems like a return to form .
Basically , he 's just a different flavor of loser , a less dramatic and embarrassing kind that , minus the magic , probably is n't that rare in the real world .
With Triana back , Dean 's ready to make his move — eventually .
Hank points out it may be too late , and decides to take Dean to the mall to try and pick up some ladies .
This could 've been squirm - inducing , but was pretty low - key , apart from Hank 's creepily programmed strategies for mating .
( I think this is riffing on The Game , but I have n't actually read it .
Anybody ? )
They run into Dermott outside , and Dean even manages to have a good conversation ( that we do n't hear ) with one of the girls .
So far this season , the biggest fall - out of Dean and Hank losing their clones has been to take a few steps away from the parody - Hardy Boy personae they started the series with .
Obviously the two already had some depth before now , but what I 'm really enjoying is that we 're seeing them grow up in a way that manages to not completely lose sight of their essential spazziness .
It must be a difficult line to walk , as Hank and Dean can't ever just be normal kids .
The naivete is always there , but the comedy works best when they 're just smart enough to suspect they 're missing something , but not quite able to figure it out .
The Order got a lot of solid screen - time here too , with Jefferson Twilight dealing with his insecurities about his position on the team , and Al just being generally delightful .
The scene where they each describe the worst thing they can think of in order to move into Hell was a highlight , but in general , I dig the banter between the three team - members because , again , it 's weirdly wholesome , at least by comparison .
I 'm not complaining about any of the other characters , but seeing the Order every now and again helps to put in better light the clear affection the writing team has for everyone in this particular universe .
And then there 's Triana .
I 'm a little on the fence about her conversation with the Master ( who , as a grown - up Dean , looked like an animated Daniel Clowes character ) .
Not that it was n't a fine chat , but it was weird to bust out this sort of big emotional transition for a character we have n't really spent any time with .
I think it worked , but it 's one in the morning , so my standards are even easier than usual .
I 'm not sure I care , exactly , about Triana leaving , especially since I suspect we 're not going to see her training or have her be relevant to the plot for a while .
But it makes sense to have her get some forward progress in her life , since she really does n't belong with this gang of misfits .
The problem with having somebody sane in your game of make believe is that they keep pointing out things like " You can't really fly " and " Mud does n't taste good no matter how often you chew it . "
Triana might actually grow up someday , and we just can't have that around here .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) --
Stock markets outside the United States are recuperating much faster from the bear 's mauling .
Accordingly , many investors have been pouring money overseas , which is one reason why non-U.S. stocks have been advancing so strongly .
The Dow Jones Global Total Stock Market Index , which includes 11,745 stocks in 64 countries , jumped 29 % this year through Oct. 30 .
That advance reflected a 23.5 % decline from the beginning of the year through March 9 and a following lift - off rally of 68.7 % .
By contrast , the 10 - month gain for the U.S. market was 18.4 % .
( All performance figures are on a total return basis , which means dividends are included . )
The early - year decline was just a shade worse in the U.S. , and the subsequent jump trailed the global recovery by 12 percentage points .
" Global , " however , includes the United States .
By excluding that market , the discrepancy becomes even more pronounced : " Ex - U.S. " markets sank 22.7 % in the first part of the year -- two percentage points less than U.S. stocks -- and then rocketed 77.8 % to post a 10 - month increase of 37.4 % , or more than double that of U.S. stocks .
' Ex ' marks the spot
Investors do n't necessarily realize the effect their investments have had on these markets .
Ex -U.S. ( a.k.a. international ) markets are divided into two main types , developed and emerging .
The former are fewer in number ( 29 ) but bigger in market capitalization ( $ 14 trillion ) , while the latter are in exactly the opposite condition ( 35 countries with $ 2.8 trillion in market cap ) .
Emerging markets tend to be among the most volatile because investment capital surging in and out can move prices a lot , largely because liquidity is lower .
Despite that tendency , the DJ emerging market index fell just 15 % in the first couple months of the year , or roughly eight - to - 10 percentage points less than its counterparts .
Partly because of that resilience , perhaps , the next eight months brought a literal doubling of returns -- up 100.3 % .
The result : emerging markets logged a 10 - month return of 70.2 % , luring investors out of domestic tranquility to roam the globe .
Developed markets showed far less pep , but still beat U.S. performance .
They dropped a more - typical 23.8 % early in the year , and then jumped 74 % for a 10 - month gain of 32.5 % .
The biggest gainers among developed markets -- mostly because of large - stock outperformance -- were Cyprus ( 90.7 % higher ) , Norway ( up 79.8 % ) and Sweden ( a 71.1 % gain ) .
Bringing up the rear were Iceland ( slipping 0.3 % ) , Japan ( up 7.1 % ) and Malta ( 15 % higher ) .
Emerging markets leaders include Sri Lanka ( up 140.46 % , driven by big gains in all three size categories ) , Indonesia ( 116.98 % higher , propelled by surges in both large - and mid-sized stocks ) and Brazil ( a 111.57 % advance , mainly in large stocks ) .
On the back end were Slovakia ( down 24.7 % ) , Jordan ( 6.8 % lower ) , and Bahrain ( off 3.9 % ) .
Small scores big
Small stocks were the best performers in both developed and emerging markets by wide margins over mid-sized and large stocks .
That is a departure from the U.S. pattern in which mid-sized stocks did better than large or small .
On Oct. 30 , small stocks were 48 % higher than at the start of the year among developed countries and a stunning 87.7 % higher among emerging markets .
By contrast , mid-sized stocks were up 39.5 % ( developed ) and 72.9 % ( emerging ) , while large stocks gained 30.5 % ( developed ) and 67.5 % ( emerging ) .
Leading the small - stock surge among emerging markets were Russia ( a 193.4 % surge ) , the Philippines ( up 156.4 % ) and Sri Lanka ( 128.9 % higher ) .
Laggards were Jordan ( down 8.5 % ) , Kuwait ( 5 % lower ) and Morocco ( up 5.3 % ) .
In the developed - market camp , the best performers were Israel ( up 131 % ) , Hong Kong ( a 108.6 % gain ) and Austria ( 104.5 % higher ) .
The stragglers were Cyprus ( down 1.4 % ) , Malta ( off 1 % ) and Iceland .
Strong sectors
Basic Materials was the big winner among ex-U.S. industries , jumping 50.4 % in developed countries and 106.6 % in emerging markets .
Industrial metals and mining were the hottest sectors .
Utilities did the worst among the 10 industries in developed countries , edging up just 0.03 % in the 10 months .
Among emerging markets , Telecommunications took the hindmost with " only " a 27.81 % gain .
Looked at another way , though , Health Care was in the best position as of Oct. 30 because it was down only about 10 % from the market peak in 2007 .
In a near - tie for second and third by this measure were Oil & Gas ( roughly 18 % below peak ) and Consumer Goods ( about 19 % lower ) .
Beleaguered Financials , of course , remain farthest ( 40 % lower ) from the market 's 2007 high , followed by Industrials ( down 32 % ) and Technology ( off 31 % ) .
The remaining industries -- Basic Materials , Consumer Services , Telecommunications and Utilities -- are all 20 % to 28 % lower .
If capital continues to pour into ex-U.S. markets , it could flow to those countries and industries that have not risen as far or fast as the 10 - month winners .
If capital starts to pour out , the big gainers thus far are the most vulnerable .

So , I ’ve been watching the CONS meeting ( aka , the Muni crime meeting Supe Bevan Dufty made sure all online writers were all over ) , and it was pretty much what you ’d expect .
People told their stories of Muni terror and tragedy , and the cops did a powerpoint y’all nerds can view here .
But one thing did stand out for me : after a woman in a fairly rad horse sweatshirt asked “ Bicycle riders .
Where do they fit into this whole scheme ?
How we regulate them , protect them , criticize them , whatever ? ”
SFPD Deputy Chief John Murphy reclaimed the mic to respond , saying that “ that ’s been brought to my attention , so I ’ve been working on that also …specifically .
it ’s the Critical Mass event that ’s the most troubling of all events , when the group goes out en masse .
But I ’m hoping to meet with the group leaders and basically convey to the group leaders the concerns of the people that get stuck in traffic . ”
We reached out to our sources in the cycling community , who confirmed what we thought was common knowledge — that is , that Critical Mass has no leaders .
One of our sources went as far as to express surprise at Murphy ’s remarks , saying “ its clearly an anarchic , leaderless movement . ”
So , does SFPD know something neither we nor our more bikey friends do n’t , or is Deputy Chief Murphy in for a surprise ?
We suppose time will tell .

For this guide , we 're going to do a bit of assuming .
We 're assuming the relative with the busted computer is running a Windows system , and has an internet connection that works when the computer does .
We 're assuming all the physical pieces of the computer work — hard drive , memory , disc drives , and anything else that 's crucial .
We 'll also assume the computer 's in one of two states : Failing to boot and needing an OS re-installation , laden with unnecessary system tray / startup applications and / or spy / mal / ad - ware , or just needing a little optimization .
Computer wo n't boot , needs a re-install
The problem : Turning on the computer results in a message that states Windows can't boot because something is missing ( a boot loader , an important file , etc. ) or something is wrong .
There are many variations on this message , but they all say basically the same thing :

Back up the files :
Have your USB hard drive or blank DVDs handy , and remove the Windows CD / DVD from the computer if you tried to use that for a fix .
Stick your thumb drive with the Ubuntu ( or Knoppix ) image into a USB slot , then boot up the computer .
You may have to hit F12 or another key to boot from USB , or change a setting in the BIOS ( which you can access by hitting a key — written in that fast - disappearing text — at boot - up ) .
You 'll be asked to choose a language , then hit the option to " Try Ubuntu without any changes . "
After some loading , you 'll arrive at an Ubuntu desktop .
Move your cursor to the " Places " menu , and check to see that your USB drive ( MyBook , in my case ) or blank DVD is showing up .
You should also see the hard drive Windows is running from .
On an XP or Vista system , there 's usually just one , but on Windows 7 , there are two — a " System Reserved " ( fairly small ) and a larger , main drive .
Check to see that you can open and access those files as well .

Ask your relatives which files and documents are important to them .
When doing my own tech support work , I usually back up the entire " My Documents " folder ( with " My Music " and " My Pictures " included ) , their Outlook or ( yes , sometimes ) Outlook Express email data ( explained here ) , and their Firefox profile or , more likely , their " Favorites " folder for Internet Explorer ( C : \Documents and Settings \Username \ Favorites in XP , or C: \Users\Username \Favorites in Vista or 7 ) .
In any case , always ask , and make sure there is n't any software they can't locate a license for .

When you 're ready to back up , simply open your USB drive from the Places menu , then open your main Windows drive , and drag files to copy from your Windows system onto the backup medium .

If you 're burning to DVD , head to the Applications menu in your temporary Ubuntu system , mouse over the Accessories sub-menu , and select " CD / DVD Creator " when it pops up .
You 'll get a folder you can drag files you want to burn into , then hit " Write to Disc " to burn them .
When you 're all done backing up files , head to the menu with the power icon next to it ( labeled " Live user , " most likely ) and select " Shut Down . "
You 'll eventually be prompted to remove your live CD or USB stick — do so , and swap in the Windows installation CD or DVD .
Turn off the system , then turn it back on .
Follow the instructions to install Windows on the system , erasing whatever partitions or data exist on there at the moment ( assuming you 're sure the important stuff is backed up ) .

PARIS ( Reuters ) - James Cameron ’s long - awaited “ Avatar , ” one of the most expensive films ever made , takes off this week in an awe - inspiring display of Hollywood power that has revolutionized cinematic special effects .
Actors Sam Worthington ( L ) and Zoe Saldana as her digital character Neytiri are shown in a scene from the upcoming James Cameron film " Avatar " .
REUTERS / Twentieth Century Fox / Handout
At a cost of about $ 400 million ( 246 million pounds ) to make and market “ Avatar , ” the Oscar - winning director of “ Titanic ” has created a lush world of dense forest , floating mountains and tremendous creatures in a computer - generated spectacular that transforms much of the cast into giant , blue - skinned humanoids .
The movie , which premiered in London on Thursday and begins landing in theatres worldwide next week , represents a huge risk for the 20th Century Fox studio that backed it and is being watched closely in Hollywood for its impact on the future of movies , special effects and expansion of new 3D technology .
“ It ’s absolutely cinema , but I think cinema redefines itself every few years with new techniques , ” Cameron told reporters in Paris before the film ’s launch .
Beyond dazzling audiences with visual effects that plunge the viewer onto the planet Pandora 4.4 light years from Earth , “ Avatar ” provides a familiar mix of romance , action movie thrills and an old - fashioned battle between good and evil .
“ The more fantastic the subject ... the more recognizable and universal , the relationships and people need to be , ” Cameron said .
“ Avatar ” shows the forest - dwelling Na’vi fighting for survival against a rapacious colonial mining operation bent on moving them away and stripping their planet .
A crippled ex-Marine is chosen to make contact with the mysterious people as an avatar , a remotely controlled body , which allows him to move freely in the alien world where he falls in love with a Na’vi princess .

SCIENCE FICTION TECHNOLOGY
What makes “ Avatar ” stand out , however , is the appearance of its three - dimensional forest scenery and the seamless interaction of the human cast with the animated world .
Rigging his actors with specially developed cameras to register every gesture and facial expression as they moved about a bare stage , Cameron and his technical team blended their images into the computer - generated world of Pandora .
“ The science fiction of the technology was more science fiction than the story , ” said Sigourney Weaver , star of Cameron ’s film “ Aliens , ” who plays a scientist in “ Avatar . ”
“ You ’re aware that a lot of work is going on around you , but you , the actor , just have the responsibility of being in the moment and being in the world , ” she said .
Cameron , who created many of the special effects with “ Lord of The Rings ” director Peter Jackson ’s studio WETA Digital , said the most daunting problem was to ensure the effects did not overwhelm the film and disconnect audiences from the story .
But in Hollywood , performances matter less than results at the box office , and the film industry is closely watching “ Avatar ” for its impact on film costs and the expanding of 3D technology .
For Fox , a unit of News Corp , the movie represents a huge risk because typically big - budget movies have a fan base from books or other material , like the “ Harry Potter ” movies .
“ Avatar ” has no built - in audience , and its effects are costly .
A
Fox spokesman said it required $ 237 million to make and $ 150 million to promote .
When Cameron made “ Titanic ” for Fox , he drew sharp criticism for its high cost , but the 1997 film made $ 1.8 billion at global box offices and remains the highest - grossing film of all time .
Last month , Fox studio boss Jim Gianopulos told Reuters he had “ no doubt ” of making a profit .
If “ Avatar ” is a big success in 3D , industry watchers expect more theatres to install the new technology quickly and more directors to make movies in the medium .
Early reviews are strong .
Show business newspaper The Hollywood Reporter called it a “ jaw - dropping wonder . ”
The National Hockey League on Friday announced plans to sell the Phoenix Coyotes to an investor group that says it will keep the franchise in Glendale .
The league signed a letter of intent to sell the team to Ice Edge Holdings , a group that previously sought to buy the team in bankruptcy .
The group has said it plans to remain in Glendale but wants to be able to play five home games annually in Canada .
" While much remains to be done , the NHL looks forward to working closely with Ice Edge to bring the sale to a conclusion as expeditiously as possible , " Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly said in a statement .
The sale would cap a seven - month saga in which the previous owner threw the Coyotes into bankruptcy , leaving Glendale fearing the loss of its main tenant at Jobing.com Arena and Valley hockey fans worrying that the Coyotes could be taken to Canada .
Former owner Jerry Moyes backed a sale to a Canadian businessman who wanted to move the Coyotes to Hamilton , Ontario .
Jim Balsillie offered the most money to pay off the team 's debts , but the league did n't want the team to move .
The resulting battle had other major sports owners watching to see whether bankruptcy could end up trumping a professional league 's rules .
In the end , the league prevailed and bought the team in Bankruptcy Court in November for about $ 140 million .
It has spent the past month negotiating with suitors .
Ice Edge , which consists of Canadian and American investors , also bid on the team during bankruptcy but withdrew its bid by September .
Sources close to the new deal told The Republic that Ice Edge is expected to pay the league in the $ 140 million range , about the amount the NHL spent .
The buyers said they have an agreement in principle with Glendale , which owns the arena .
The team has more than two decades remaining on its lease , which Ice Edge has said it does not plan to break .
Details of the new agreement have not been announced .
Glendale Mayor Elaine Scruggs said the forthcoming sale was a relief .
" This thing has been in limbo for just too long , " she said .
" We did believe there would be a buyer for this team to keep it in Glendale even in the darkest days . "
Glendale spent $ 182 million to open Jobing.com Arena in 2003 .
The city depends on revenue from Coyotes games to help retire the debt .
Scruggs said she anticipates the deal will not include revenue concessions from the city .
Daryl Jones , an investor with Ice Edge , said that his group believes the metro Phoenix market is large enough to support professional hockey with a well - run and winning franchise .
" First and foremost , we are hockey fans , " said Jones , a former Yale hockey player .
" We think it 's a sport that can thrive anywhere . "
In the fall , Jones said retaining fan loyalty would be the key to securing the team 's future in the Valley .
What Coyotes fans needed most , he said , was to " really believe definitively that the team is not leaving , to be able to open up their hearts again . "
From the start , Ice Edge has said it would propose to play five home games in Saskatoon , Saskatchewan .
The games would be non-playoff games and a way to generate more revenue , the group says .
Coyotes season - ticket holder John Glenn of Laveen said Friday that if the arena is not sold out , he is comfortable with that plan .
" But if we prove to be viable , we should be entitled to those games , " he added .
Glenn said he has been impressed with Ice Edge 's statements that hockey can work anywhere .
Ice Edge would have five majority owners : Jones , Anthony LeBlanc , John Breslow , Keith McCullough and Todd Jordan .
Jones , McCullough and Jordan work together at Research Edge , a Connecticut - based investment - research firm .
Like Jones , McCullough was a hockey player at Yale .
LeBlanc grew up with McCullough in Thunder Bay , Canada .
Breslow was a minority owner of the Coyotes under the former ownership group headed by Moyes .
Moyes put the team into Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May .
He said he lost about $ 300 million during his ownership and has said recently that hockey cannot work in the Valley .
The NHL and Glendale fought the move , with Glendale saying it would suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in economic losses if the team left .
The NHL Board of Governors , which must approve franchise owners , is scheduled to meet Tuesday in Pebble Beach , Calif .
The Coyotes are among the discussion topics .
Jones , of Ice Edge , said he hoped to close the deal within the next few months .

When it was safe for Tzipi to zip over
ISRAELI bigwigs may not be visiting Britain much in the months ahead following the near arrest on December 13th of Tzipi Livni , the leader of the opposition , for alleged war crimes .
A London judge issued an arrest warrant for Ms Livni for her role as foreign minister in Israel 's “ Operation Cast Lead ” , the assault on the Gaza Strip earlier this year .
The order was withdrawn when the judge learned that Ms Livni would not be in Britain as planned .
It is the highest - profile case since Britain arrested General Augusto Pinochet more than a decade ago , and has understandably left the Israelis feeling as if they have been singled out .
It drew apoplectic protests from Israel and much abject apologising from the British government .
Both sides said it was inconceivable that Israeli officials might fear to set foot in England .
But the Israelis set little store by assurances that the British “ system ” would be changed to prevent such cavalier deployment of universal jurisdiction .
They said Britain had been promising to change it for years .
They were now being told informally that no change was likely before the general election , given Israel 's unpopularity in British public opinion .
Gordon Brown is said to be looking for some administrative stopgap , meanwhile .
Israelis have had narrow escapes in Britain before .
Doron Almog , a former general , would have faced a warrant when he landed in London in 2005 .
He stayed on the plane and headed back to Tel Aviv .
Shaul Mofaz , a former defence minister , and Moshe Yaalon , a minister and former army chief of staff , cancelled visits rather than risk arrest .
Ms Livni , as foreign minister , badgered the British government to change the law , at least by requiring consultation with the attorney - general before such arrest warrants can be issued .
Israeli lawyers say Britain is the only country exercising universal jurisdiction where no such government “ filter ” is in place .
There was speculation that the warrant for Ms Livni 's arrest might have been requested by Daniel Machover , possibly acting for other clients .
He is an Israeli - born , London - based lawyer and a founder - member of Lawyers for Palestinian Human Rights , a pressure group .
He has been involved in gathering evidence for possible war - crimes charges against Israeli army officers involved in the assault on the Gaza Strip .
But if he meant to pillory Israel 's hardline policies , going for Ms Livni missed the mark .
Today , she is the leader of the peace camp and has been strident in her attacks on the prime minister , Binyamin Netanyahu , for his partial settlement freeze and his failure to resume peace talks with the Palestinians .
Indeed , the incident forced Mr Netanyahu to show rare solidarity with his political foe .
It was “ absurd ” , he said , that she should be hounded so .
Despite the indignation , well - placed Israeli observers said Israel , like other countries , would have no choice but to take account of the growing internationalisation of criminal justice when they plan their campaigns and their travels .
A report by Richard Goldstone on the Gaza war for the UN Human Rights Council , published in September , and now Ms Livni 's brush with Britain 's legal system , were examples of a trend that Israelis could not ignore .
This is part of a series I started in March 2008 - you may want to go back and look at older parts if you 're new to this series .
Continuing down the rabbit hole : String
A couple of parts ago we established some of the problems with supporting even the seemingly simple attr_reader , attr_writer and attr_accessor .
To reiterate , a naive implementation looks like this :
def attr_accessor sym attr_reader sym attr_writer sym end def attr_reader sym define_method sym do % s ( ivar self sym ) end end def attr_writer sym define_method " #{sym.to_s}= " .
to_sym do |val| % s ( assign ( ivar self sym ) val ) end end
We resolved the issue of having a working sym.to_s , but that still leaves a number of things to address .
For example , we need at least the start of a " proper " String class that we can add # to_sym to .
That 's what we 'll look at this time .
The first bit is very similar to what we did for Symbol :
We wo n't type tag , and we 'll create String objects for literal strings by calling a low level function .
Quick sidebar : Hiding the low level implementation
MRI " hides " the gory details of String and other basic classes by not making them real Ruby objects per-se .
There 's data there that is simply not accessible without dipping into the C API .
We may eventually want to take a similar tack - add a mechanism for allocating space for , setting and retrieving low level variables via the s-expression syntax that are completely invisible for the higher level API .
Currently we do n't .
The " raw " string used for Symbol and for String objects is a normal instance variable , and it 's perfectly possible to expose it , and accessing it thinking it 's a real object will trivially easily cause nasty crashes .
In general , we would eventually benefit from creating a mechanism to " hide " the low level plumbing from accidental access by normal Ruby .
For now we 'll retain the ability to shoot ourselves in the foot easily .
The basics
The String class will for now contain just a pointer to a C - style string .
It will be immutable in it 's first incarnation .
This gets us a decent step further very easily - we can just keep the address to a C - style string constant .
As it turns out , this will be an easy foundation to build on :
MRI uses a number of flags for strings , for example to do " copy on write " .
Once we need to make strings mutable , we 'll do the same .
Strings created from constants will start out marked as " copy on write " , and when doing an update , the string buffer will be copied into freshly allocated space first .
The hope is that many string constants will never be updated .
We also need to implement String # to_sym .
This is thankfully also reasonably easy :
We need to access the low level function we added that will retrieve a symbol based on a " raw " c-style string .
The code
As the last couple of times , this was unfortunately committed a bit piecemeal , so the commits are n't easy to follow .
But lets go through this step by step .
First of all , we 're going to rewrite the tree , to alter a literal string into
%s( call __get_string ConstantReferringToTheRawString )
So , we alter compile to add a call to rewrite_strconst :
# # Re-write string constants outside %s ( ) t # %s ( call __get_string [ original string constant ] ) def rewrite_strconst ( exp ) exp.depth_first do |e| next : skip if e[ 0 ] == : sexp is_call = e [ 0 ] == : call e.each_with_index do |s , i| if s.is_a ?( String ) lab = @string_constants[s ] if ! lab lab = @e.get_local @string_constants[s ] = lab end e[i ] = [ : sexp , [ : call , :__get_string , lab.to_sym ] ]
# FIXME : This is a horrible workaround to deal # with a parser inconsistency that leaves calls # with a single argument with the argument " bare " # if it 's not an array , which breaks with this rewrite .
e[ i ] = [ e [ i ] ] if is_call && i > 1 end end end end
Effectively this visits all nodes that are not s-expressions , and if it finds a string , it will add a string constant .
It will then use the label that is allocated to rewrite the expression like this :
[ :sexp , [ : call , :__get_string , lab.to_sym ] ]
As the following line says , it 's a nasty workaround , and it will be torn out as soon as I get a parser , so just ignore that ... pretend it 's not even there ;)
Now , the reason we wrap the call to __get_string is that otherwise it will be rewritten to a method call because there really is no such thing as function calls in Ruby , but for some of our low - level plumbing we need actual C - style function calls ( such as for calling out to C code ) .
We 're also changing strconst , the method used to get the " value " of a string constant as follows :
- def strconst str - lab = @string_constants [str ] - return lab if lab - lab = @e.get_local - @string_constants[str ] = lab - return lab + def strconst ( a ) + lab = @string_constants [a ] + if !lab # For any constants in s-expressions + lab = @e.get_local + @string_constants [a ] = lab + end + return [ : addr , lab ] end
What 's left ?
Not much , really .
You can see the basi c String class
Here 's the important bit :
class String def __set_raw ( str ) @buffer = str end end def __get_string ( str ) s = String.new %s ( callm s __set_raw ( str ) ) s end
It 's worthwhile reading the comments in at the link above if you want to see more about where this is heading .
We 'll flesh out the String class in coming parts , but this groundwork now means we 're working on a " real " object instead of on a raw pointer to a c - style string , which means it 's mostly a runtime library issue instead of requiring much in terms of compiler changes .
One of the things worth mentioning that is covered in one of the comments in lib / core / string.rb is that the whole __get_string and __get_symbol thing is a bit ugly .
As I mentioned earlier in this part , hiding the low level implementation would be nice , and that includes preventing direct calls to __get_string and _get_symbol , and that can be done trivially by simply ensuring the Ruby code can't directly do function calls ( as opposed to method calls ) .
But that does n't solve String #__set_raw .
To fix that , I 'll need to either remove the need for the method , or by making it possible to " hide " certain methods entirely from the Ruby code ...
It 's not a priority now , though - first we get things working , then we make it pretty .
What about String #to_sym ?
Well , this ought to do the trick :
class String def to_sym __get_symbol( @buffer ) end end

Overall Rating : 2 out of 5
The Bottom Line :
Overall , Talk Android is a forum that has n’t yet reached its prime .
For instance , when it comes to getting your Droid questions answered , a quick browse through posts revealed far more post views than substantial replies .
The sub -category lists are thorough , but the forum is not as active as some of the other forums reviewed below .
Furthermore , you ca n’t just browse through the Talk Android posts without first becoming a registered user , which is slightly annoying if all you want is an answer to a quick question .
It seems that Talk Android is a forum that has not yet caught on amongst most Droid geeks , but has potential to be a good forum in the future .

The Reality of the Economic Crisis
Here ’s where we ’re at folks .
The end of the line .
“ The end of free - market capitalism ”
I ’ve heard it called .
“ The sub - prime mortgage crisis ”
Some blame it on .
“ A global economic meltdown ”
Time for some major change .
So , our entire way of life is exposed as a rickety , weak , hollow , card house that collapses in a heartbeat , so what do we do ?
We throw money at it !
We actually try and prop this mangled , pathetic card house back up with the exact cause of the collapse !
Kind of like tossing a bucket of water on a tsunami .
Kind of like throwing a candle at a forest fire .
Sort of the equivalent of hurling a snow ball at an avalanche .
Bail outs ?
Our solution is bail - outs ?!?!
And regulation ?
But please , do n’t get me wrong , the other side of the coin is just as , if not more retarded .
Tax breaks and the same freewheeling market that got us here ?
Those are the only two “ solutions ” on the table ?
Really ?
Let me give you a hint .
They are both wrong .
It ’s time for a new political ideology .
It ’s time for a complete and total re-assessment of the problems we ’re facing , and a whole truck load of new ideas on how to solve them .
It ’s time for all those really smart people who are currently calculating derivatives , investments and algorithms dedicated to stripping you of your money , to start working on how to get us out of this mess .
To start working on new , relevant , current philosophies and systems of governance .
It ’s time to re-think where we ’re at and where we need to be going and what we need to do to get there .
It ’s time to realize that money got us to where we are , and it was helpful in doing so .
The market , and current currency based political ideologies pushed us to produce and to innovate , and it kept us waking up on time in the morning .
It replaced an outdated and oppressive feudalist society and that was a good thing .
It served a purpose at a time , but that time has long passed .
And no government or bank or wall street finance expert or CEO will ever realize that .
They will fight with every fiber in their being to defend the only thing they know .
They will scratch and claw to keep themselves important .
They are all irrelevant .
Just as has been the case countless times in history it is up to regular people to figure that out and to do something about it .
Do n’t hold your breath for your senator and your congressman and your boss and your bank to get it .
They wo n’t .
Get it yourself , and then , here ’s the tough part … do something about it .
This will not likely happen until the situation is beyond bearable .
Or , as has also happened countless times in history , we can sit back and do nothing .
We can , if we chose , sit back and say nothing as we are cast backwards into complete and total oppression and subservience .
If the current general attitude , apathy , complacency and inertia continues , that ’s where we ’re headed folks , real soon … buckle up .
I can hear you shouting already in your trained , knee jerk reaction ” He ’s denouncing capitalism .
He ’s a Communist !
A Socialist ! ”
No dumbass , those are all outdated and irrelevant ideologies .
We need to start looking at ideas and solutions for this world , for now , for our current state of affairs … not for / from the 1800’s .
“ It ’s time to evolve ideas , you know evolution did n’t end with us growing thumbs , right ?
It did n’t end there .
We ’re at the point now that we ’re going to have to evolve ideas .
The reason the world ’s so fucked up is we ’re undergoing evolution , and the reason our institutions , our traditional religions are all crumbling is because … they ’re no longer relevant .
So it ’s time for us to create a new philosophy . ” – The Late Great Bill Hicks
The reality is this .
The housing market crashed because a house is built so that people can live in it .
Not so that real estate tycoons can buy and sell them like stocks and bonds pushing their ‘ value ’ into the stratosphere .
A home is a tangible structure which at one time was priced according to what working people could afford .
It was .
Until , like everything else in our society , they became merely another pawn in the profit game , and all the humanity was squeezed mercilessly out of the house .
They stopped being homes , and started being ‘ the housing market . ’
I work full - time and could n’t dream of ever owning a home .
It cost me more to attend one year of school than my parents paid for a 5 acre property with a house on it merely one generation ago .
That ’s not inflation , that ’s sucking the right to live in a real house out of an entire generation .
My boss , a professional of ten years , ca n’t dream of ever owning a home .
He lives with room - mates .
Your boss should n’t live with room - mates .
I do n’t know a single person within ten years of me who can aspire to do anything other than inherit their parents or grandparents property .
It ’s like we ’re all just sitting around waiting for them to die and hoping we were the good child .
The beneficiary lottery .
It ’s a sad , demoralizing and completely ridiculous way to live .
Why ?
Because houses are n’t built for people to live in any more .
There is no correlation between real , human wages , and the price of a home .
And you ’ll never see a piece of legislation introduced that keeps those two interdependent things in line with each other .
Ever .
Every year my rent increases , no questions asked .
That ’s just what happens .
Well that ’s just what ’s been happening for too long .
Now I ’m paying $ 1000 a month for a one bedroom apartment .
And not a very nice one either .
I know people paying close to $ 2000 .
Two people working full - time jobs in a one bedroom apartment should not be living in poverty and barely making rent every month .
How is a single mother supposed to survive in this world ?
We are all systematically being driven mercilessly into poverty where our only choice is to sign up for the credit being dangled at us .
This is not frivolous spending .
This is survival spending .
This is rent and food and getting to work every day .
That ’s all I do .
I do n’t drink , I do n’t party , I rarely leave my house .
I do n’t do anything .
Not because I do n’t want to .
Because I can’t .
Every single action costs money , and lots of it .
Every year the price goes up .
On everything .
And every pay - cheque we ’re going backwards .
The credit card interest piles up , adding on to the already extortionist cost of simply having a place to sleep .
This is the life that almost everyone I know in all walks of life is living right now .
Engineers , doctors , barely scraping by .
People who have done what they ’re ‘ supposed to do ’ – gone to good schools , gotten good jobs .
These are n’t deadbeats , so why are they forced to live like one and feel like one ?
You cannot sustain a society where every single person in it is perpetually plummeting further and further into debt .
You cannot fix that issue by propping up those same credit companies with taxes on those same people who are already drowning in debt .
We cannot tax , subsidize , credit and bail - out our way out of this .
We also ca n’t cut taxes , wage wars and let the free market run free to get out of this .
BOTH ARE EQUALLY STUPID AND OUTDATED SOLUTIONS .
They are not solutions , they are the cause of the problems .
“ We ca n’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them . ” – Albert Einstein
I see this quote thrown around a lot .
But I do n’t see it applied very often .
The economy collapsed because the same lack of forward thinking swallowed up our jobs too .
A job is not just something you do every day to keep the stock afloat so that a handful of gamblers can buy and trade shares in your company .
A job is a contribution to your society in which you are given a fair compensation , so that you can live in a home , eat food and purchase the goods produced by others in your society .
At least it was .
The extreme of this we are now witnessing .
We have highly trained , well - educated , useful people being forced to work menial , pointless positions at the fifteen mega chain stores that dominate every town and every city to pay off their ridiculously expensive education .
For what ?
For who ?
For Wall Street ?
For a couple of CEO’s ?
Humanity has become a machine .
There is no humanity left .
And there wo n’t be until human beings realize it , and demand more of themselves , for themselves and by themselves .
Stop defending a system that ritualistically fucks you in the ass on a daily basis , suppresses your potential and denies your ability to live a respectable and decent life .
Stop pretending all is well and all will be made well through legislation and banking .
Start taking some pride in your existence and your self worth .
Start caring .
Stop shrugging your shoulder and saying “ That ’s just the way it is . ”
It does n’t have to be .
And the only reason it is that way , is because you and me let it get that way , and continue to let it get worse .
Every day .
or you can leave it up to this guy to fix .
Because that ’s working so well for us is n’t it ?

Civil - Military Interoperability For GPS Assisted Aircraft Landings Demonstrated
The JPALS system is being developed to meet the Defense Department 's need for an anti-jam , secure , all weather Category II / III aircraft landing system that will be fully interoperable with planned civil systems utilizing the same technology .
Marlborough - Oct. 1 , 2001
A government - industry team accomplished the first precision approach by a civil aircraft using a military Global Positioning System ( GPS ) landing system Aug. 25 at Holloman AFB , N.M. , Raytheon Company announced today .
A FedEx Express 727-200 Aircraft equipped with a Rockwell - Collins GNLU - 930 Multi-Mode Receiver landed using a Raytheon - developed military ground station .
Raytheon designed and developed the differential GPS ground station under an Air Force contract for the Joint Precision Approach and Landings System ( JPALS ) program .
The JPALS system is being developed to meet the Defense Department 's need for an anti-jam , secure , all weather Category II / III aircraft landing system that will be fully interoperable with planned civil systems utilizing the same technology .
Raytheon and the U.S. Air Force have been conducting extensive flight testing for JPALS at Holloman over the last three months .
The FedEx Express 727-200 aircraft at Holloman successfully conducted a total of sixteen Category I approaches .
After completing a number of pilot flown approaches for reference the aircraft conducted six full autolands using the JPALS ground station .
" The consistency of the approaches allowed us to proceed to actual autolandings with very little delay , " said Steve Kuhar , Senior Technical Advisor Flight Department for FedEx Express .
The aircraft was guided by differential GPS corrections , integrity information , and precision approach path points transmitted from the Raytheon developed JPALS ground station .
Although the approaches were restricted to Category I , accuracies sufficient to meet Cat II / III requirements were observed .
Raytheon is the world leader in designing and building satellite - based navigation and landing solutions for civil and military applications .
In addition to developing JPALS for the Department of Defense , Raytheon is also developing both the Local Area Augmentation System ( LAAS ) and the Wide Area Augmentation System ( WAAS ) for the Federal Aviation Administration .
The JPALS and LAAS will provide an interoperable landing capability for military and civil applications .
" Raytheon is committed to developing and deploying satellite based navigation and landing systems for the military and the flying public , " said Bob Eckel , Raytheon vice president for Air Traffic Management .
" We understand the importance of this technology and are proud to be a part of the success achieved this summer during JPALS testing at Holloman . "

During the final days of the Bush administration , the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) scheduled a controversial auction of oil and gas leases on federal lands , including areas bordering national parks and monuments in Utah .
While environmental organizations launched a round of protests and lawsuits , Tim DeChristopher , a 27 - year - old econ major at the University of Utah , decided he had to try to stop the sale by himself .
Not knowing exactly how he ’d do it , DeChristopher walked into the auction in Salt Lake City on December 19 , 2008 , and had a sneaky idea handed to him in the form of a bidder ’s paddle .
Simply by raising it again and again and pretending to bid on the leases , he proceeded to drive up their prices and outbid the real speculators on 13 parcels covering more than 22,000 acres and worth $ 1.7 million dollars .
When it became clear that bidder No. 70 was an impostor with no intention of paying for his purchases , federal agents removed him from the auction .
But the damage was done .
DeChristopher ’s monkey - wrenching tainted the sale , forcing BLM to offer the other buyers the option of withdrawing their bids .
That effectively postponed any final decision on the leases until February 2009 , when the Obama administration would be in office .
Soon after taking office , Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar canceled the results of the chaotic auction and criticized the previous administration for allowing it in the first place .
Despite this reversal , DeChristopher was indicted in April on federal criminal charges of interfering with a government auction and making false representations .
He faces up to five years in prison on each of the two counts and as much as $ 750,000 in fines .
As his trial nears , DeChristopher and his lawyers hope to convince the judge to allow a “ necessity defense , ” an unusual tactic in which they would argue that his actions were justified because of the moral imperative of stopping catastrophic climate change — and because all legal means of stopping the auction had been blocked by the Bush administration due to its cozy relationship with the oil and gas industry .
DeChristopher , who has pleaded not guilty , tracks the progress of his case on his website , bidder70.org .
Recently , he spoke about how the Yes Men helped inspire his brief stint as an oil speculator and why the climate movement needs to stop having fun and start considering civil disobedience .
Mother Jones :
Were you inspired by the Yes Men at all ??
Tim DeChristopher : About a year before this auction , I was at a public hearing for a renewable energy standards bill at the state legislature , and the room was packed .
People were flowing into the hallway , and the chairman of the committee asked how many people were there to support this bill , and 50 hands went up .
Then he asked how many people were there to oppose this bill , and five lobbyists from the power companies raised their hands .
And so he said , “ Well , we do n’t have enough time for everyone and in the interest of fairness , let ’s take five people from each side . ”
So all the lobbyists got to get their points across and only a tenth of the people , the citizens , did .
The bill ended up getting shot down and I left really frustrated and upset .
The person I was riding home with asked , “ Have you ever heard of the Yes Men ? ” And I said no .
So I looked them up and watched some of their videos and thought they were brilliant .
Later that year I ended up walking into that auction and they said , “ Are you here to be a bidder ? ” and I said , “ Well , yes , I am , ” even though I had n’t planned that out at all .
Having the model of the Yes Men — to take every opportunity to be that influential person who gets that right to speak and to influence our country — set the right example for me .?
MJ : What ’s the current status of your case ?
? TD : September 25 was the first hearing and the judge gave us 30 days to basically make our entire case in writing about why we should be able to use the necessity defense .
I feel as though we have a very strong case with the necessity defense .
In a federal court they give four requirements that you have to answer in order to use that defense , and I think we have very strong evidence for each of those four points .
A lot of what it came down to in that first hearing was the fourth point , which is that there have to be no legal alternatives that would lead to the same effect and that would avoid that harm .
That was the thing that the prosecution really emphasized ; it said that I should have just worked within the system and filed an objection and let the system work .
The prosecutor actually said , “ The political process always works , ” which I thought was really funny since he was talking about issues of oil drilling during the Bush administration .??
MJ : Does the judge seem favorable to you ??
TD : I ’m told that he ’s a reasonable guy .
During the first hearing he compared what I did to car bombing and said , “ Well , if he thinks he can just do whatever he wants to stop climate change , what if he ’s concerned about emissions coming out of vehicles and he blows up a car with somebody in it ?
Is n’t that exactly the same thing ? ”
And we said , “ No .
That ’s not the same thing at all . ”
I ’m hoping that that did n’t come from a preestablished notion about the nature of what I was doing and that it was more of an off - the - cuff comment .
MJ : Does the fact that the Obama administration came out against the leasing process help you ?
? TD : I really doubt it ’s something they would spend any political capital on to avoid prosecuting me .
It ’s probably too far along in that process already .
But it was definitely odd because I did n’t get indicted until April and the new secretary of the interior , Ken Salazar , came out in February and announced that they were reversing as much of this auction as they could because it was illegitimate .
So they made the conscious choice to prosecute me for standing in the way of something they already said was a crime . ??
MJ : What first convinced you that nonviolent direct action was necessary to fight climate change ??
TD : One of the epiphany moments was early 2008 .
I was at a symposium and ended up having a conversation with one of the IPCC officers , a woman who had won the Nobel Prize for her work on climate change .
Privately she said to me , “ There were things we could have done in the ’ 80s , things we could have done in the ’90s , but now it looks like it ’s probably too late . ”
She said the IPCC could n’t come up with any politically feasible scenario in which we avoided all these worst - case consequences .
And she literally put her hand on my shoulder and said , “ I ’m sorry my generation failed yours . ”
That shattered me , and I went into a period of despair but also realized that if there ’s no politically feasible scenario that ’s going to get us there , then we have to change what ’s politically feasible .??
MJ : I ’ve heard you say that you do n’t think the environmental movement has been effective .
Why do you think that is ?
? TD : I think the environmental movement has been focused on this path of incrementalism .
I think part of that is because the climate movement grew out of the rest of the environmental movement , which focused on issues of wilderness preservation and wildlife preservation and more local issues .
The climate movement adopted a lot of those strategies and tactics that were n’t really appropriate for being translated into the goal of stopping climate change , where incrementalism is completely inappropriate because getting halfway to preventing the collapse of our civilization is n’t really any better than being a quarter of the way or not there at all .
MJ : While the International Day of Climate Action on October 24 was a huge day for the climate movement and the lead - up to Copenhagen , I have n’t heard much about direct action being planned .
It sounds like there were a lot more fun events .
Do you think there should be more of an element of risk , like the use of civil disobedience , at this point ??
TD : I ’ve had this discussion with Bill McKibben about how hard we should be pushing with this , and I know that what they were trying to accomplish with October 24 is bring more people into the movement and send one unified message to the negotiators at Copenhagen .
But I absolutely think we need to keep pushing it .
All of the new people that we bring into the movement with the fun things that are going on — we need to hang on to those people and continue to motivate those people and challenge them to start taking more actions and bigger actions .
Costing the fossil fuel industry money is the only thing that ’s going to change the way they ’re acting .
With our political leaders , costing them political capital or costing them the kind of social peace that comes when everyone follows along and participates in the system are the only things that are going to work .
Showing them that we ’re not going to participate in a system that threatens our survival .
That if they ’re not going to protect our future , we will .
There ’ll just be a social uprising and social chaos as people do whatever they can to shut down this system that threatens our destruction .
??
MJ : Should climate activists keep trying to grow the movement before considering escalating tactics ?
TD : I ’ve talked to a lot of people in the movement who think that we need to keep convincing more people of the reality of climate change and that the key to our success is getting every single person to understand the science of this .
I do n’t think that ’s a worthwhile pursuit .
Around 30 or 35 percent of population does n’t believe in climate change and that ’s pushing up against a limit in our society because that 30 to 35 percent is a number we see a lot .
That ’s about the number of people who do n’t believe in evolution .
In a couple of polls two and half weeks after Hurricane Katrina 35 percent said President Bush did an excellent job of dealing with that crisis .
We ’ve got this section of our population that lives on a different planet and experiences reality in a different way and I think it ’s a hopeless battle to bring those people to reality .
Historically that ’s not how change happens .
We did n’t get a civil rights act because the last redneck in Mississippi stopped being a racist .
The problem is not that 35 percent of population still does n’t get it ; the problem is that 65 percent do get it and are n’t fighting .??
MJ : What do you think it will take to get more people to take a stand ??
TD : It just takes some of us demonstrating that we ’re not helpless and that we do have power to effect change in our society .
The reason I was able to see my opportunity last December is that I went in believing that I could be an effective agent of change .
I remember riding down [ to the auction ] thinking of all the impotent protests we ’d been to before and decided that I was going to disrupt this auction one way or another .
I did n’t know what that would look like ; at that time I thought it would be standing up and making a speech or something like that .
I remember making the commitment that I would n’t be helpless .
That ’s what we need on a much larger scale .
We need to find ways to make people believe that they really are effective agents of change and that the people can change where this country ’s headed .

November 11 , 2009 ( Oakland , Calif . ) –
High levels of workplace exposure to Bisphenol - A may increase the risk of reduced sexual function in men , according to a Kaiser Permanente study appearing in the journal Human Reproduction , published by Oxford Journals . [ 1 ]
The five - year study examined 634 workers in factories in China , comparing workers in BPA manufacturing facilities with a control group of workers in factories where no BPA was present .
The study found that the workers in the BPA facilities had quadruple the risk of erectile dysfunction , and seven times more risk of ejaculation difficulty .
This is the first research study to look at the effect of BPA on the male reproductive system in humans .
Previous animal studies have shown that BPA has a detrimental effect on male reproductive system in mice and rats .
Funded by the U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health , this study adds to the body of evidence questioning the safety of BPA , a chemical made in the production of polycarbonated plastics and epoxy resins found in baby bottles , plastic containers , the lining of cans used for food and beverages , and in dental sealants .
The BPA levels experienced by the exposed factory workers in the study were 50 times higher than what the average American male faces in the United States , the researchers said .
" Because the BPA levels in this study were very high , more research needs to be done to see how low a level of BPA exposure may have effects on our reproductive system , " said the study 's lead author .
De-Kun Li , MD , Ph.D. , a reproductive and perinatal epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente 's Division of Research in Oakland , Calif .
" This study raises the question :
Is there a safe level for BPA exposure , and what is that level ?
More studies like this , which examine the effect of BPA on humans , are critically needed to help establish prevention strategies and regulatory policies . "
The researchers explained that BPA is believed by some to be a highly suspect human endocrine disrupter , likely affecting both male and female reproductive systems .
This first epidemiological study of BPA effects on the male reproductive system provides evidence that has been lacking as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , and various U.S. government panels have explored this controversial topic .
This study is the first of series of studies that examine the BPA effect in humans and are to be published by Dr. Li and his colleagues .
The study finding , Dr. Li also points out , may have implications of adverse BPA effects beyond male sexual dysfunction .
Male sexual dysfunction could be a more sensitive early indicator for adverse BPA effects than other disease endpoints that are more difficult to study , such as cancer or metabolic diseases .
For this study , researchers compared 230 workers exposed to high levels of BPA in their jobs as packagers , technical supervisors , laboratory technicians and maintenance workers in one BPA manufacturing facility and three facilities using BPA to manufacture epoxy resin , in several regions near Shanghai , to a control group of 404 workers in the same city from factories where no BPA exposure in the workplace was recorded .
The factories with no BPA exposure produced construction materials , water supplies , machinery , garments , textiles , and electronics .
The workers from the two groups were matched by age , education , gender , and employment history .
Researchers gauged BPA levels by conducting spot air sampling , personal air sample monitoring and walk - through evaluations , by reviewing factory records and interviewing factory leaders and workers about personal hygiene habits , use of protective equipment , and exposures to other chemicals .
A subset of workers also provided urine samples for assaying urine BPA level to confirm the higher BPA exposure level among the workers with occupational BPA exposure .
Researchers measured sexual function based on in - person interviews using a standard male sexual function inventory that measures four categories of male sexual function including erectile function , ejaculation capability , sexual desire , and overall satisfaction with sex life .
After adjusting for age , education , marital status , current smoking status , a history of chronic diseases and exposure to other chemicals , and employment history , the researchers found the BPA - exposed workers had a significantly higher risk of sexual dysfunction compared to the unexposed workers .
The BPA - exposed workers had a nearly four - fold increased risk of reduced sexual desire and overall satisfaction with their sex life , greater than four - fold increased risk of erection difficulty , and more than seven - fold increased risk of ejaculation difficulty .
A dose - response relationship was observed with an increasing level of cumulative BPA exposure associated with a higher risk of sexual dysfunction .
Furthermore , compared to the unexposed workers , BPA - exposed workers reported significantly higher frequencies of reduced sexual function within one year of employment in the BPA - exposed factories .

Editor 's Note :
This is Part 5 in 10 - part series LiveScience series on the origin , evolution and future of the human species and the mysteries that remain to be solved .
As scientists try and solve and mystery of how we originated , an invaluable source of clues is the chimpanzee .
Of course , humanity did not evolve from the chimpanzee , which has spent time evolving on its own path for millions of years from our last common ancestor , just as we have .
Still , chimps are our closest living relatives — we share 98.8 percent of their DNA — and new research is continuing to shed light on just how similar we remain , promising to yield insights into the roots we both stem from .
Close but not too close
Genetic evidence suggests the ancestors of humans and chimpanzees diverged roughly 4 million years ago .
The relative size of the chimp brain matches most of our extinct relatives , for a long time suggesting our ape cousin might be an ideal place to glimpse humanity 's origins .
New evidence suggests , however , that our last common ancestor may not have looked as chimp - like as before thought .
The fossil Ardipithecus ramidus , dating 4.4 million years old , which may very well be ancestral to both human and chimpanzee lineages , walked neither like us or chimps , possessing instead an intermediate form of walking .
In addition , Ardipithecus seemed to have possessed canines that are reduced in size , while male chimps have large tusk - like canines used as weapons for threatening and sometimes attacking other males .
This may suggest that chimpanzees behaved significantly differently from our last common ancestor .
Still close enough
Nevertheless , humans keep much in common with chimpanzees .
" Emotionally and socially , the psychology of chimps is very similar to humans , " said primatologist Frans de Waal at Emory University in Atlanta .
For instance , he noted , chimps have shown they can help unrelated chimps and human strangers at personal cost without apparent expectation of personal gain , a level of selfless behavior often claimed as unique to humans .
They also display what many scientists dub culture , with groups of chimpanzees socially passing on dozens of behaviors such as tool kits from generation to generation that are distinct from ones seen in other groups .
" The big difference I see going for us is language , " de Waal said .
" They can learn a few symbols in labs , but it 's not impressive in my opinion compared to what even a young child can do .
They do n't really symbolize like we do , and language is a big difference that influences everything else that you do — how you communicate , basic social interactions , all these become far more complex . "
Make love , not war ?
As gentle as our closest living relatives can be , chimps also can be quite violent in the wild , raping , killing and warring against their rivals .
" They do n't like cooperating with strangers , that 's for sure , " de Waal said .
Harvard biological anthropologist Richard Wrangham has suggested this pattern of violence may have been part of humanity 's legacy as well for millions of years .
However , de Waal noted that based what the canines of Ardipithecus suggest , " chimpanzees may be specialized in that regard .
It 's only with the special recent human conditions of settlement and agriculture that gave us the incentive to worry about wealth , leading us to become warriors that way . "
Instead , de Waal suggests looking at our other close relative , the bonobos , the chimpanzee - like great apes once dubbed " pygmy chimpanzees " that are more playful , often resolving conflicts with sex instead of violence .
" Other scientists have speculated that bonobos may be the more ancestral type , " he said .
Father figures
In the case of either chimpanzees or bonobos , humans are distinct in that fathers are often involved in child care .
" Gorilla males protect the females and offspring , but that 's pretty much it , " de Waal said .
" That 's what 's very special about human society — the males are involved in caring for offspring , " he added .
" It 's possible this is because we moved from the forests , where if a predator comes along , you can just climb a tree .
There 's more danger to deal with when we came down from the trees , and so that might have been the trigger for males to get involved . "
WELLINGTON , New Zealand — A New Zealand teen who was flashing her breasts at passing cars has been found guilty of disorderly behavior for the prank , which ended with her in a hospital after a distracted driver ran into her .
Cherelle May Dudfield , 18 , pleaded guilty to the charge when she appeared in Invercargill District Court , the Southland Times newspaper reported Wednesday .
Dudfield , egged on by her friends , was flashing passing motorists from a traffic island in the middle of a four - lane road in the southern city of Invercargill on Sept. 27 .
The alcohol - fueled prank went awry when one of the vehicles crashed into her as she tried to run to the side of the road , police Inspector Olaf Jensen said .
" She was extremely lucky as the vehicle had slowed because of her behavior , " he told The Associated Press .
" She rolled up onto the bonnet ( hood ) and cracked the windscreen before she came down with some minor injuries and was taken to hospital . "
The prank occurred in the city center , where a ban on alcohol use is in force , he noted .
Dudfield was fined $ 198 .

When Senators Tom Coburn and David Vitter decided to make fun of Democratic efforts to pass health reform , they probably did not see this coming .
By proposing an amendment that would require members of Congress to register for public health care if the so - called public option were to pass , the two Republicans hoped to further deter their colleagues from voting in favor .

The hitch in their plan : several Democrats took them seriously .
Speaking to MSNBC on Friday night , Sen. Sherrod Brown explained why he offered to co-sponsor the amendment .
“ [ With ] Sen .
Coburn , nine times we said we wanted to co-sponsor , ” he said .
“ Usually it takes once and they say yes .
I ’ve always accepted that ; so has everybody I know in the Senate .
Nine times we asked to co-sponsor and their office either just said we ’ll get back to you or ignored our calls and our emails because it was all a sham . …
They clearly do n’t like the public option .
They were making fun of it .
Their whole game is to delay and deceive and to play political games .
…
And so , it ’s just a little partisan game they ’re playing . ”
So far , Senators Dodd , Mikulski and Franken have also added their names as co-sponsors .

Hi ,
Few months ago , I started working on a neural network library , in Haskell .
The result was n’t that bad , but needed some additional work .
Past days , I ’ve worked a bit on that code again to get a releasable and usable 0.1 version of HNN up and working .
For example , the weights , inputs and outputs are of type UArr Double now ( they were of type [ Double ] before ) .
You can find the source code there : http://github.com/alpmestan/HNN.
Also , I ’ve built a minimal documentation .
You can find it here : http://mestan.fr/haskell/hnn/.
To get the current code and test it :
$ git clone git://github.com/alpmestan/HNN.git
$ cd HNN
$ cabal configure
$ cabal build
$ cabal install ( to add it in your ghc package list , etc )
$ cabal haddock ( to generate the documentation )
I plan to put this on Hackage soon , but I would like to get some feedback & reviews about it before .
Thank you !
Police forces across the country have been warned to stop using anti-terror laws to question and search innocent photographers after The Independent forced senior officers to admit that the controversial legislation is being widely misused .
The strongly worded warning was circulated by the Association of Chief Police Officers ( Acpo ) last night .
In an email sent to the chief constables of England and Wales 's 43 police forces , officers were advised that Section 44 powers should not be used unnecessarily against photographers .
The message says : " Officers and community support officers are reminded that we should not be stopping and searching people for taking photos .
Unnecessarily restricting photography , whether from the casual tourist or professional , is unacceptable . "
Chief Constable Andy Trotter , chairman of Acpo's media advisory group , took the decision to send the warning after growing criticism of the police 's treatment of photographers .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Writing in today 's Independent , he says : " Everyone ... has a right to take photographs and film in public places .
Taking photographs ... is not normally cause for suspicion and there are no powers prohibiting the taking of photographs , film or digital images in a public place . "
He added : " We need to make sure that our officers and Police Community Support Officers [ PCSOs ] are not unnecessarily targeting photographers just because they are going about their business .
The last thing in the world we want to do is give photographers a hard time or alienate the public .
We need the public to help us .
" Photographers should be left alone to get on with what they are doing .
If an officer is suspicious of them for some reason they can just go up to them and have a chat with them – use old - fashioned policing skills to be frank – rather than using these powers , which we do n't want to over - use at all . "
Section 44 of the Terrorism
Act allows the police to stop and search anyone they want , without need for suspicion , in a designated area .
The exact locations of many of these areas are kept secret from the public , but are thought to include every railway station in and well - known tourist landmarks thought to be at risk of terrorist attacks .
Many photographers have complained that officers are stopping them in the mistaken belief that the legislation prohibits photographs in those areas .
Forces who use Section 44 , most commonly London 's Metropolitan Police , have repeatedly briefed and guided frontline officers on how to use the powers without offending the public .
But privately senior officers are " exasperated , depressed and embarrassed " by the actions of junior officers and , particularly , PCSOs who routinely misuse the legislation .
One source said that an " internal urban myth " had built up around police officers who believe that photography in Section 44 areas is not allowed .
The aberrations have resulted in nearly 100 complaints to the police watchdog .
Since April 2008 every complaint made by a member of the public about the use of Section 44 powers , unlike other complaints , must be forwarded to the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
In the past 18 months there have been 94 complaints .
Eight of these specifically mentioned the fact that the issue arose around photography .
Acpo's communiqué has been welcomed by rank - and - file police officers and photographers alike .

Simon Reed , the chairman of the Police Federation , which represents England and Wales 's 140,000 rank - and - file officers , said : " I think some new guidance will be welcome . "
New orders :
The message to officers
This is the message circulated by Andy Trotter , of the Association of Chief Police Officers , to police forces in England and Wales .
" Officers and PCSOs are reminded that we should not be stopping and searching people for taking photos .
" There are very clear rules around how stop - and - search powers can be used .
However , there are no powers prohibiting the taking of photographs , film or digital images in a public place .
Therefore members of the public and press should not be prevented from doing so .
" We need to co-operate with the media and amateur photographers .
They play a vital role as their images help us identify criminals .
" We must acknowledge that citizen journalism is a feature of modern life and police officers are now photographed and filmed more than ever .
" However , unnecessarily restricting photography , whether from the casual tourist or professional is unacceptable and worse still , it undermines public confidence in the police service . "
A personal viewpoint : ' I was reminded why I left the police '
I spent 27 years as a PC in the Met , but it was during a trip to my old police station with a friend late last year that I was starkly reminded why I eventually decided to leave .
Since 2003
I have been living in France , where I coach a children 's rugby team not far from Toulouse .
But last December my sister needed to see a specialist in Harley Street so I went with her and a rugby friend of mine back to London for the week .
While my sister went to the doctors I suggested to my friend , Will , that we should go and take a look at Albany Street police station near Regent 's Park , which was where I spent my first eight years as a copper .
It 's the kind of station that looks like something out of Dixon of Dock Green , it has a lovely little blue police light outside the entrance and I asked Will whether he'd take a picture of me standing underneath it .
Within seconds we found ourselves approached by two PCSOs who told us that we were not allowed to take photographs of police stations .
I did n't want to be a sad old git by telling stories of my past and the nostalgia I felt for the place .
So instead I said : " We 're tourists .
We want a picture of that Blue lamp , it 's iconic and it represents London bobbies . "
But they did n't want any of it and ordered us to stop taking photographs .
The second PCSO started asking Will for his details which he began to give before I informed him that he was under no obligation to do so .
I 'd clearly failed what the police call " the attitude test " because they radioed for back - up from inside the police station and we were soon joined by a police constable .
Often during my time as a policeman I would hear this policy .
If someone was bolshy , argumentative or challenging in any manner , refusing to play by the police rules and not willing to show deference , then they had failed the " attitude test " .
I guess I hoped the PC would show more common sense but he repeated the same line , that the police station was in a " sensitive zone " and that we had to stop taking photographs .
Eventually we gave up and walked away .

All respect for elementary human rights and dignity have been thrown overboard as the governments of Australia , Indonesia and Malaysia refuse to accept the latest wave of Tamil asylum seekers fleeing war and oppression in Sri Lanka and instead treat them like criminals .
The Australian government is the only of these three governments to have signed the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees but it is refusing to carry out its obligations to asylum seekers under that convention .
For weeks , more than 250 Tamil - speaking people , including children , remain in dire conditions on a boat in Merak , Indonesia .
Another 68 Sri Lankan Tamil asylum seekers , including children , remain on the Australian customs ship Oceanic Viking off Tanjung Pinang , Indonesia .
Both groups are refusing to leave their boats for fear that Indonesia will lock them up in detention centres with a reputation for brutality and / or send them back to an uncertain future in Sri Lanka .
On November 1 , it was reported that a boat of asylum seekers had sunk near the Cocos Islands , an Australian territory in the Indian Ocean , and 12 are missing feared drowned .
Meanwhile , 207 Sri Lankan asylum - seekers are being held at the Immigration Detention Centre at Kuala Lumpar International Airport , and 108 Sri Lankan refugees are being detained at Pekan Nanas Immigration Detention Centre in Johor , Malaysia .
Malaysia is both a transit point and a country of permanent asylum for tens of thousands of refugees from countries such as Myanmar and Sri Lanka .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd claims his Labor government 's policy is " humane " but " tough " .
It is neither .
The Labor government of Australia is bribing the Indonesian government of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono to intercept the boats of asylum seekers on their way to Australia .
This " Indonesian solution " outsources Australia 's obligation to asylum seekers to Indonesia just as its predecessor did to Nauru and Papua New Guinea in the name of a " Pacific solution " .
Many of those seeking asylum in Australia come from Sri Lanka where the Tamils have suffered from decades of brutal oppression at the hands of various Sinhala national - chauvinist governments .
The government of Mahinda Rajapaksa unleashed an all - out terror campaign this year , killing some 20,000 Tamil people in the month of May .
Since the end of the military offensive , more than 300,000 Tamil people have been imprisoned in concentration camps and denied the right to return to their homes .
It is estimated that 31,000 children are among those incarcerated , without proper access to shelter , food and medicine .
The Australian government , like many governments in the West and across Asia , supported the Rajapaksa regime throughout its final onslaught preferring to maintain trade links , including selling arms , rather than stop the Tamil minority from being massacred .
We condemn the Australian , Indonesian and Malaysian governments for their lack of commitment to the humanitarian problems faced by the refugees and we demand :
That the governments of our countries withdraw financial and diplomatic support from the Sri Lankan government until it closes the concentration camps , and allows the Tamils trapped in camps to go back to their homes without fear of persecution .
That no refugee fleeing war and persecution should be forced to return to the country they fled .
That Australia , as a wealthy and developed country which has exploited its poorer neighbours , should immediately develop a program to settle tens of thousands of asylum seekers and take a leading role in helping reduce the misery of the world ’s millions of refugees , most of whom are trying to survive in desperate conditions in refugee camps in some of the world 's poorest countries .
That Australia allow the asylum seekers trapped in Indonesia to come to Australia to have their claims heard here and we condemn the Indonesian government for being a puppet for the Australian government in preventing refugees from going to Australia .
This cooperation between these two governments is a threat not only to the Tamil refugees but to human rights in the region .
That Australia must immediately close the Christmas Island refugee prison , close it down and allow those asylum seekers to live in freedom in Australia while their claims are processed .
That the Indonesian , Malaysian and Australian governments respect the human rights of the refugees , give protection , humanitarian aid and accomodation to the refugees as long as they are in Indonesian territory and place no limitation for their rights to seek an asylum .
That the Malaysian and Indonesian governments sign the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees , release the asylum seekers they have in detention and allow them full access to UNHCR and human rights groups .
We appeal to all democratic and progressive people in Indonesia , Malaysia and Australia , trade unions , human rights organisations and women ’s rights organisations to understand the plight of the asylum seekers and to support our demands .

Statement Bersama : Hormati Hak Asasi Manusia – Bebaskan Para Pengungsi !
Tolak “ Solusi Indonesia ” Buatan Australia !
Biarkan Para Pencari Suaka Datang !

5 November 2009 – Penghormatan terhadap Hak Asasi Manusia telah dibuang ke laut oleh pemerintah Australia , Indonesia dan Malaysia ketika mereka menolak gelombang baru pencari suaka Tamil yang melarikan diri menghindari perang dan penindasan di Sri Lanka dan malahan mengancam mereka seperti kriminal .
Pemerintah Australia adalah satu - satunya pemerintahan , dari ketiga pemerintahan diatas , yang telah menandatangani Konvensi PBB tahun 1951 berkaitan dengan Status Pengungsi namun menolak menjalankan kewajibannya untuk pencari suaka dibawah konvensi tersebut .
Telah berbulan - bulan , lebih dari 250 orang berbahasa Tamil , termasuk anak - anak berada dalam kondisi menyedihkan di sebuah kapal di Merak , Indonesia .
Sebanyak 68 orang pencari suaka Tamil lainnya , termasuk anak - anak berada dalam kapal bea cukai Australia Oceanic Viking di Tanjung Pinang , Indonesia .
Kedua kelompok tersebut menolak meninggalkan perahu mereka karena takut pemerintah Indonesia akan memenjarakan mereka di pusat penahanan yang memiliki reputasi atas brutalitasnya dan atau mengirim mereka kembali ke masa depan yang tidak jelas di Sri Lanka .
Pada tanggal 1 November dilaporkan bahwa perahu pencari suaka tenggalam didekat pula Cocos , teritori Australia di Samudra Hindia , dan 12 orang hilang dikhawatirkan tenggelam .
Sementara itu 207 pencari suaka dari Sri Lanka ditahan di Pusat Penahanan Imigrasi di Bandara Internasional Kuala Lumpur , serta 108 pengungsi Sri Lanka ditahan di Pusat Penahanan Imigrasi Pekan Nanas di Johor , Malaysia .
Malaysia adalah sebuah titik transit dan Negara dengan pencari suaka permanen dari puluhan ribu pengungsi dari Negara - negara seperti Burma dan Sri Lanka .
Perdana Menteri Australia Kevin Rudd menyatakan bahwa kebijakan pemerintahan Buruhnya adalah “ manusiawi ” namun “ tegas ” .
Nyatanya bukanlah kedua hal itu .
Pemerintahan Buruh Australia menyuap Pemerintahan Indonesia , Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono untuk mencegah perahu para pencari suaka ke Australia .
“ Solusi Indonesia ” ini mengoutsourching kan kewajiban Australia kepada para pencari suaka ke Indonesia seperti yang dilakukan oleh para pendahulunya kepada Nauru dan Papua New Guinea atas nama “ Solusi Pasifik ” .
Banyak dari mereka yang mencari suaka di Australia dating dari Sri Lanka dimana komunitas Tamil menderita berpuluh - puluh tahun karena penindasan brutal ditangan berbagai pemerintahan chauvinis - nasional Sinhala .
Pemerintahan Mahinda Rajapaksa melancarkan kampanye terror all - out pada tahun ini , yang mengakibatkan korban jiwa 20.000 Tamil pada bulan Mei .
Sejak akhir serangan militer , lebih dari 300.000 penduduk Tamil telah dipenjara dalam kamp konsentrasi dan ditolak haknya untuk kembali ke rumah mereka .
Diperkirakan sekitar 31.000 anak - anak termasuk diantara mereka yang dipenjarakan , tanpa akses layak kepada tempat tinggal , makanan dan obat - obatan .
Pemerintah Australia , seperti banyak pemerintahan di Barat dan di Asia , mendukung sepenuhnya rejim Rajapaksa sepanjang serangan besar - besarannya .
Mereka lebih menyukai menjaga hubungan perdagangan , termasuk perdagangan senjata , ketimbang menghentikan pembantaian terhadap minoritas Tamil .
Kami mengutuk Pemerintahan Australia , Indonesia dan Malaysia karena tidak adanya komitmen mereka kepada persoalan humanitarian yang dihadapi oleh para pengungsi dan kami menuntut :
a . Agar pemerintahan Negara kami menarik dukungan keuangan dan diplomatik dari pemerintah Sri Lanka hingga pemerintah Sri Lanka menutup kamp konsentrasinya dan mengijinkan penduduk Tamil yang terjebak didalam kamp - kamp untuk kembali ke rumah mereka tanpa rasa ketakutan akan represi .
b.
Agar tidak satupun pengungsi yang lari karena perang dan pengejaran dipaksa kembali ke Negara yang mereka tinggalkan .
c. Bahwa Australia , sebagai Negara yang kaya dan berkembang yang telah mengeksploitasi Negara tetangganya yang lebih miskin segera mengembangkan program untuk puluhan ribu pencari suaka dan memainkan peran memimpin dalam membantu mengurangi penderitaan jutaan pengungsi di dunia , yang kebanyakan darinya berusaha bertahan dalam kondisi menyedihkan dalam kamp - kamp pengungsi di beberapa Negara - negara yang termasuk Negara termiskin didunia .
d. Agar Australia mengijinkan pencari suaka yang terjebak di Indonesia datang ke Australia untuk agar klaim mereka didengar di Australia .
Dan kami mengutuk pemerintahan Indonesia yang menjadi boneka dari Pemerintahan Australia dalam mencegah para pengungsi pergi ke Australia .
Kerjasama dari kedua pemerintah ini adalah ancaman tidak hanya bagi para pengungsi Tamil namun untuk hak asasi manusia di region ini.
e. Bahwa Australia harus segera menutup penjara pengungsi di Pulau Christmas dan mengijinkan para pencari suaka untuk hidup dengan bebas di Australia sementara klaim mereka diproses .
f. Agar pemerintah Indonesia , Malaysia dan Australia menghormati hak asasi manusia dari para pengungsi , memberikan perlindungan , bantuan kemanusiaan dan akomodasi kepada para pengungsi selama mereka berada di teritori Indonesia dan tidak memberikan batasan bagi hak mereka untuk mencari suaka .
g. Agar pemerintah Malaysia dan Indonesia meratifikasi Konvensi PBB mengenai Status Pengungsi , membebaskan para pencari suaka di tahanan mereka dan memberikan akses penuh pada UNHCR dan kelompok - kelompok HAM .
Kami menyerukan kepada seluruh kelompok demokratik dan progresif di Indonesia , Malaysia dan Australia , serikat buruh , organisasi HAM dan organisasi hak perempuan untuk memahami seruan para pencari suaka dan untuk mendukung tuntutan kami .

Red , green , blue , yellow .
They are n't just four of the bestest shades in Roy G. Biv -- to anyone with a computer and a soul , that particular color combo is permanently etched in the brain as the unchanging constituents of the Windows logo in its many , many forms over the years ;
Google 's logo happens to use them , true , but so far , Android 's been green to the bone .
Anyhow , you may have already noticed that some of the shots of the Nexus One clearly show a boot screen with a cross pattern colored thusly , and it turns out there 's an Android 2.1 dump floating around that 's got the animation on board .
Of course , dumped ROMs have a tendency to get pulled apart like a turkey at Thanksgiving dinner in a matter of mere hours , and the animation 's already found its way onto YouTube .
Just because it's in a hacked Flan ROM does n't mean you should expect to see it on every Android phone under the sun next year -- the animation portrays a nexus , of sorts , which would fit in nicely with a phone of the same name .

The Obama administration is off to a slow start on judicial nominations , but the Senate , which has delayed in confirming the choices President Obama has made , also bears a good part of the blame .
The administration and the Senate leadership should pick up the pace of nominations and confirmations in order to restore some balance to a federal judiciary that was pushed sharply to the right by former President George W. Bush .
Appointing federal judges , who have enormous power and serve for life , is one of the most important presidential responsibilities .
President Bush , who was intent on leaving an ideological imprint on the judiciary , made his nominations quickly and pushed hard to have them confirmed .
By the end of his first year , according to a report by the liberal group Alliance for Justice , he had nominated 65 federal judges and 28 were confirmed .
By that measure  and those of the Clinton and Reagan years  Mr. Obama has moved slowly .
As of Nov. 4 , he had nominated just 26 appellate and district court judges , and only four of them had been confirmed .
Even considering that selecting Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court and getting her confirmed took time , the administration ’s pace has been disappointing .
On the confirmation side , the fault lies with the Senate .
Obama nominees who have been reported out of the Judiciary Committee have waited months for a vote from the full Senate , far longer than is necessary .

Want to know the solid facts ?
1/2 of us will die from heart disease ; about a 1/3 from cancer ; 2/ 3 of us will die obese ; and 1 / 4 of us will get diabetes .
All of this is because of our love of behaviors and products that eventually killed us .
I will not argue that genetics plays a part in medical propensities for certain diseases , but nothing in my family history could prepare use for a three Big Mac , 2 milkshakes and a diet soda consumer demand driven society .
Many people do not even know that the amount of food , and especially the types of food they eat , could be directly increasing their chances for ailment and actually robbing them of the very nutrients they were thought to be providing .
One huge , pseudo food market is the soda pop industry .
This liquid is manufactured , canned and bottled for distribution worldwide at a rate of 150 mg of high power fructose for every person on Earth daily .
Soda pop is liquid high fructose corn syrup and / or artificial sweetener mixed with water and carbonated soda , allowing for an immediate flood of simple , processed carbohydrates and sugars to overwhelm the bloodstream and insulin processing systems in crashing waves .
This can serious erode health and contribute to an imbalance in the body ’s ability to handle energy usage and storage management efficiency , leading to diabetic problems or the excess storage of fat .
Fat storage of the sugars contained in sodas is quite common as the body cannot possible utilize the amount of sugar rushing into its system during consumption , and thus is instead turned into fat and sent to all of your “ unsightly ” places .
A soda usually contains in excess of 150 empty calories each .
People who consume 2 sodas a week will gain ten pounds a year throughout their lifetime if these calories are not burned off .
Also exacerbating weight is the fact that the main sugar in soda , fructose , when processed by the liver , is often turned into fat and stored instead of burned off as energy calories .
Combined with the fact that fructose also has a tendency to create craving but leave little satisfaction for hunger makes for an equation for weight gain disaster .
Not only does soda ’s extra calories and lack of nutrients contribute to higher risk of obesity , these products have also been known to strip the body of much needed calcium , weakening or even causing the wasting away of bone mass .
The kamikaze style of entry and processing by the body can further complicate the risk of diabetes or other maladies associated with the body ’s resistance to insulin .
Some researchers have even contended that soft drink beverage consumption might even contribute to a person ’s risk of contracting certain types of cancers .
While the sugars in soft drinks can be avoided with the use of artificial sweeteners , studies have shown them to carry and even higher incident of cancer and other serious ailments that fructose .
My suggestion would be to avoid the soda altogether , and make all natural , calorie free , water your main beverage and favorite drink .
Your body will thank you for it .
Tens of thousands of people from nearly every nation on earth have descended on Copenhagen this month for the UN climate summit .
As the delegates try to piece together a framework for reducing greenhouse gas emissions , they 're also absorbing lessons from one of the world 's leading cities in sustainable transportation .
In Copenhagen , fully 37 percent of commute trips are made by bike , and mode share among city residents alone is even higher .
Come see " the busiest bicycling street in the Western world " , and lots of other you - gotta - see - them - to - believe - them features including bike counters ( featuring digital readouts ) , LEDS , double bike lanes ( for passing ) and giant hot pink cars .
Copenhagen was n't always such a bicycling haven .
It took many years of investment in bike infrastructure to reclaim streets from more polluting , less sustainable modes .
Last week , I was able to squeeze in a whirl - wind tour with Mikael Colville - Andersen , the bike culture evangelist behind Copenhagenize and Copenhagen Cycle Chic , to get a taste of the city 's impressive bike network and cycling amenities .
Watch this video and see how Copenhageners flock to the streets by bike even in December , when average temperatures hover just above freezing .
< blockquote class = " _text " > [ music ] </blockquote > < blockquote class= " speaker_1_text " > < cite class= " speaker_1 " > Mikael Colville - Andersen :</ cite >
We 're here in Copenhagen .
Welcome to Copenhagen .
The climate conference is in full swing at the moment and we 're standing here on what is regarded as the busiest bicycle street in the western world .
We have a long proud tradition of cycling in Denmark and in Copenhagen .
It all started to disappear in the 1960s with the advent of car culture .
We spent the last 30 years working hard towards reestablishing the bicycle as a feasible and acceptable form of transport here in the city .
We can see here we 're standing next to one of the City of Copenhagen 's bicycle counters and there is two reasons for implementing these bicycle counters in Copenhagen .
One of them is that the data that is gathered here is transmitted to the city so they can track patterns , weather patterns , we get snowing , how many people are riding today or whatnot .
But it 's also to instill a form of civic pride in Copenhagen .
It 's because we do n't notice the bicycles .
The bicycles are tools for us .
It 's the quickest way to get around the city .
So , instilling the kind of civic pride in Copenhageners .
" Hey , you know what ?
You live in the world 's cycling capital and look how many people are riding " and hopefully this will encourage more people to ride .
</p><p>
In Copenhagen , at the moment , we have 37 percent of all commuters choosing the bicycles for work , or educational institutions , or schools , and whatnot , 37 percent .
Actually , if you look at the number of all trips by bike to the supermarket , to the cinema , we 're up to 55 percent in the city of Copenhagen .
But we 're actually working towards increasing these numbers .
We want the number of commuters on bike up to 50 percent by 2015 .
We are going to take a ride around Copenhagen and see some of the infrastructural things that we 're doing you know to encourage more people to cycle and to keep our cyclists safe .
</p><p>
And this street here is called NÃ ƒÂ¸rrebro North Bridge Street and we 're going to take a ride up here because this is actually quite a well known street this year , in the last couple of years from a urban planning perspective and bicycle planning perspective .
You can see on this stretch , it 's the busiest bicycle street in the western world of 38.000 cyclists but what we have done first of all on some of the busy stretches was that we doubled the bike lanes .
We took another lane away from the cars and we have a double bike lane here to accommodate the enormous amount of traffic .
</p><p>This is the first place in the world where we have created the " Green Wave " for cyclists for six kilometers into the center of the city .
All the traffic lights are coordinated for bikes .
You have to ride 20 kilometers an hour .
If you do that , you 're not going to put a foot down all the way to the center of the city .
</p><p>
The evolution of our bicycle culture and our bicycle infrastructure is it 's always evolving .
We 're always working on improving safety , improving the mobility of the bicycles .
In a lot of intersections , we have " pre-greens " as we call them , where the lights for bicycles turn green seconds before the cars , between two seconds , in some cases up to 12 seconds before the cars .
This is just to allow the bicycle traffic to start flowing .
But every intersection is individual .
</p><p> This intersection , this used to be one of the most dangerous intersections in Denmark .
15 serious accidents a year in this intersection here by the lake .
Now we 've reduced it to one serious accident a year which is absolutely amazing .
</p><p>This is brand new .
From last week , we have introduced LED lights on our bicycle infrastructure to help avoid right turn conflicts between cars and bikes .
So , what we have is , we have these flashing lights that indicate that a bicycle is on the way through the intersection .
So , it 's only visible to cars in their side mirrors .
They 're not visible for the cyclists who are riding because we would rather have them looking at the traffic .
So , now you can see they 've turned off .
The cyclists have stopped and the cars are allowed to turn .
</p><p>
One of the things that makes Copenhagen very unique is the number of cargo bikes that we have here .
When so few people own cars , we still need to transport various things around .
In Copenhagen , there 's about 30,000 cargo bikes on the streets every day .
These are really our SUVs .
You cannot live without them , the bike I 've been riding on today .
I pick up my two kids every day from school and daycare and go to the supermarket and whatnot .
</p><p>So , the problem with these are that they 're expensive .
You do n't really want to leave him on the street .
The city of Copenhagen has a new initiative they 're just test driving at the moment and this is a way to give our cargo bikes a place to park on the street .
It 's a car but there 's cargo bikes in it and it's locked and it 's secured .
We took away one parking spot for cars by implementing this here .
So , there 's room for four people to park where there used to be only room for one .
</p><p>
If you make the bicycle the quickest way to get around the city , for the citizens , with separated bicycle infrastructure with lots of initiative for the bicycle .
You 're going to get everybody and their dog to do it and they 're going to do their bit for the environment and for reducing pollution in the city and all the good things and for the public health .
</p><p>I hope we can inspire other cities to do the same , implementing the bicycle as a prospective and accepted and feasible form of transport .
And really , this is bicycle culture 2.0 .
The bicycle was n't invented yesterday .
All cities in the world used to have a bicycle as a main feature on their landscape .
We did it again here in Copenhagen .
Other cities are doing it again .
It 's possible for every city .

MIAMI ( Reuters ) - U.S. federal authorities are investigating millions of dollars contributed by fraud suspect Allen Stanford and his staff to U.S. lawmakers in the past decade , the Miami Herald reported on Sunday .
Slideshow ( 2 images )
The newspaper said the Justice Department investigation aimed to determine whether the banker received special favors from politicians while he was operating his alleged $ 7 billion Ponzi scheme centered on fraudulent certificates of deposit issued by his offshore bank in Antigua and Barbuda .
The U.S. Department of Justice said it had no comment on the Herald report .
The newspaper said an e-mail sent to Stanford by Texas Republican Representative Pete Sessions on the day authorities announced fraud charges against the billionaire financier , as well as $ 2.3 million in contributions he made to Sessions and other U.S. lawmakers , were “ part of the government ’s inquiry . ”
It said Stanford , who has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting a trial set for January 2011 , also spent $ 5 million on lobbying since 2001 .
It said he successfully lobbied in 2001 to kill a bill that would have exposed the flow of millions into his secretive offshore bank on the Caribbean island of Antigua .
The following year he helped block legislation that would have led to more government scrutiny of his now disgraced Antigua bank , the Miami Herald said .
Stanford , 59 , has been in custody since June 19 , when he was indicted on 21 criminal charges related to his alleged fraud .
His global banking and securities business was shut down in February when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil charges that he and others had committed fraud .
The Miami Herald said that on the day federal agents raided Stanford ’s offices in the United States , February 17 , the financier received an e-mail message from Sessions , the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee .
The newspaper said the message was found on Stanford ’s computer servers and reads : “ I love you and believe in you .
“ If you want my ear / voice -- e-mail , ” the Miami Herald quoted the message as saying , adding it was signed “ Pete . ”
Sessions did not respond to requests for interviews and his press secretary said she had not seen the e-mail and so could not comment on it , the newspaper said .
It said Stanford also funded Caribbean trips for a group of U.S. lawmakers known as the Caribbean Caucus , including Sessions and Democrats Gregory Meeks of New York and Donald Payne of New Jersey .
The newspaper said most of the members of Congress it contacted about their ties to Stanford declined to discuss them , other than to say they had returned the contributions .
Prosecutors say Stanford paid tens of thousands of dollars in bribes for years to a top financial regulator in Antigua and Barbuda to shield his Ponzi scheme from U.S. investigators .
Apparently the Goldman Sachs management is starting to connect the dots ?
Alice Schroeder from Bloomberg writes :
Dec. 1 ( Bloomberg ) --
“ I just wrote my first reference for a gun permit , ” said a friend , who told me of swearing to the good character of a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. banker who applied to the local police for a permit to buy a pistol .
The banker had told this friend of mine that senior Goldman people have loaded up on firearms and are now equipped to defend themselves if there is a populist uprising against the bank .
I called Goldman Sachs spokesman Lucas van Praag to ask whether it ’s true that Goldman partners feel they need handguns to protect themselves from the angry proletariat .
He did n’t call me back .
The New York Police Department has told me that “ as a preliminary matter ” it believes some of the bankers I inquired about do have pistol permits .
The NYPD also said it will be a while before it can name names .
While we wait , Goldman has wrapped itself in the flag of Warren Buffett , with whom it will jointly donate $ 500 million , part of an effort to burnish its image -- and gain new Goldman clients .
Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein also reversed himself after having previously called Goldman ’s greed “ God ’s work ” and apologized earlier this month for having participated in things that were “ clearly wrong . ”
Has it really come to this ?
Imagine what emotions must be billowing through the halls of Goldman Sachs to provoke the firm into an apology .
Talk that Goldman bankers might have armed themselves in self - defense would sound ludicrous , were it not so apt a metaphor for the way that the most successful people on Wall Street have become a target for public rage .
Common sense tells you a handgun is probably not even all that useful .
Suppose an intruder sneaks past the doorman or jumps the security fence at night .
By the time you pull the pistol out of your wife ’s jewelry safe , find the ammunition , and load your weapon , Fifi the Pomeranian has already been taken hostage and the gun wo n’t do you any good .
As for carrying a loaded pistol when you venture outside , dream on .
Concealed gun permits are almost impossible for ordinary citizens to obtain in New York or nearby states .
In other words , a little humility and contrition are probably the better route .
Until a couple of weeks ago , that was obvious to everyone but Goldman , a firm famous for both prescience and arrogance .
In a display of both , Blankfein began to raise his personal - security threat level early in the financial crisis .
He keeps a summer home near the Hamptons , where unrestricted public access would put him at risk if the angry mobs rose up and marched to the East End of Long Island .
Politico is reporting that Congressional Republicans want to force their colleagues in the House and Senate who vote for a public insurance option as part of health care reform to enroll in that public plan when it becomes available .
I think Democrats ought to call their bluff and pledge to be the first to sign up .
If they do , they will have to shove me out of line .
I would love to have the option of enrolling in a public plan that offers a decent standard benefit package at a more affordable price .
I am sick and tired of knowing that only 80 cents of every dollar I pay in premiums to my private insurer goes to pay doctors and hospitals for care they provide .
( This figure is down from 95 cents in 1993 before the industry came to be dominated by a cartel of high for - profit insurance companies like the two I used to work for . )
I am eager not to have to donate 20 cents of every premium dollar to cover my insurer 's sales , marketing and underwriting expenses and to help make the CEO and the big institutional investors and Wall Street hedge fund managers even more obscenely rich than they already are , thanks to the inflated premiums we have to pay .
Here 's what Politico reported :
Rep. John Fleming ( R - La. ) , a family physician , kicked off the quixotic bid last week , urging House members to give up their right to participate in the much - revered Federal Employees Health Benefits Program if they support a government - run program as part of the health care reform package .
Sens . John McCain of Arizona and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma are pushing the same concept in the Senate , preparing separate amendments that would require members -- and maybe even their staffs -- to sign up for the public option .
With Democrats firmly in control of Congress , the idea is not likely to gain traction .
Proponents of the public plan say the resolution would do exactly what Republicans have warned against , undermining the private insurance system by moving people into a public plan .
But the effort has caught fire in the right - wing blogosphere and on talk radio , serving as a rallying point for conservatives opposed to one of the top priorities of Democrats ...
Newt Gingrich 's Center for Health Transformation is promoting Fleming 's resolution on its website and started an online petition titled " Good Enough for Congress . "
After Democrats call their bluff , I would counter with this :
Every member of Congress who votes against the public insurance option must enroll in one of the high - deductible plans like the one that CIGNA forced me into a few years ago , against my wishes .
( I am a former CIGNA employee , so CIGNA was both my employer and my insurance company . )
Opponents of health care reform raise the specter of the government forcing us out of health care plans that we like .
In reality , our employers and insurers are doing this to us already .
While employed at CIGNA , I was in a PPO that I liked , until the company decided a few years ago to force all if its employees out of their HMOs and PPOs and Point of Service plans and into what the industry refers to , misleadingly and euphemistically , as " consumer - driven " plans .
It was a take - it - or - leave - it deal .
If I did n't want to enroll in the high - deductible plan that CIGNA offered , I could join the growing ranks of the uninsured or try to get coverage through the individual market .
That was n't really an option .
I was in my 50s and could not find a decent plan that I could afford , because insurers are free to gouge us when we reach a certain age .
In a high - deductible plan , enrollees have to spend a lot more money out of their own pockets before their insurance coverage kicks in than they had to spend in their HMOs and PPOs .
These plans are fine for people who are young , healthy , and not accident - prone .
and wealthy .
It also helps to have a better - than - average income .
In other words , a high - deductible plan might be exactly what you 're looking for if you do n't really need decent insurance now and can afford to shell out thousands of dollars of your own money in the event you get hit by a bus .
The rest of us , however , might want to steer clear of this sort of plan -- if we had the choice .
More and more companies are doing what CIGNA did -- forcing their employees out of the plans they like and into plans they do n't .
Another big insurer , United Healthcare , did the same thing to its employees a few years ago .
If it has n't happened to you yet , just wait .
Insurers are eager to send HMOs and PPOs to the ash heap of insurance history , which is where they sent traditional indemnity plans several years ago .
On second thought , it might be good to give members of Congress who vote against a public insurance option the choice of enrolling in one of the limited - benefit plans being promoted these days by insurers -- including the huge for - profit insurance companies that now dominate the industry .
The premiums for these plans are a little lower than plans that offer comprehensive coverage , but they often do n't cover things most of us have grown to expect .
Little things like hospitalization .
Such a deal .
Now you see why the insurance industry insists on being able to charge older folks a lot more for coverage than younger folks and why it is insisting on " benefit design flexibility . "
They want to have the flexibility to " design " and force us into plans that cover less and less and cost us more and more .
That , readers , is what your private insurance company has in store for you if Congress fails to pass meaningful health care reform legislation .
By the way , insurers including CIGNA are now also marketing these limited - benefit , high - deductible plans as " voluntary . "
This means that your employer would allow you to enroll in these type of plans at the workplace but make you pay the entire amount of the premium .
That 's right , employers in the future will not have to contribute one thin dime toward your coverage .
Future , heck , many are already there .
A growing number of employers are already " offering " these plans to their employees .
CIGNA offers such coverage under the brand name Starbridge , which " enables companies to offer a limited - benefit plan that is affordable and does not require employer contribution . "
The underwriting guidelines for Starbridge make it available only to employers who have at least 70 percent annual employee turnover and who have fewer than 65 percent female employees .
Also , the average age of the workforce has to be 40 or younger .
You 're right if you think the profit margins on these plans are high .
How could they not be ?
Cha-ching !
I encourage every member of Congress , Republicans as well as Democrats , to do a little research into what Big Insurance has in store for us before voting on legislation this summer or fall .
This is why I left my job and why I am speaking out .

Charlie Rangel says the House - Senate negotiations on the final healthcare bill are going badly .
" We 've got a problem on both sides of the Capitol .
A serious problem . "
The WashPost story this morning sounds a little less bleak than that :
Negotiators for both chambers have been working virtually around the clock to resolve their differences , and aides say a broad framework for compromise is beginning to emerge .
House leaders , and union officials , have signaled that they might be willing to accept a tax on high - cost insurance plans if the exemption for the tax were set high enough .
The lost revenue would be replaced by some version of a tax on the wealthy , aides said .
Rangel is close to the unions , and he 's representing their opposition to the " Cadillac plans " tax .
The unions are going to lose that fight mostly , so Rangel is probably reflecting that .
Remember back last summer when people were saying why is n't Obama cracking heads ?
That was not really needed then .
But now is the time to crack heads .
The ball is on the three yard line .
If these negotiations blow up and the Democrats somehow do n't pass this legislation at this point , they are done as a political party for the foreseeable future .
The Republicans are already done -- despite the tea party enthusiasm , GOP poll numbers overall are in the toilet .
The party has no solutions , no ideas , nothing .
It 's great at daily political combat .
And that 's all .
So we'd have two failed parties .
Would anybody then get the message that maybe our system is broken nearly to the point of disrepair ?
Big changes often start in unexpected places .
Very few who have followed Russia 's political development over the last decade have kept faith with the idea that international law might act as a source of restraint and influence over the actions of its ruling elite .
But a judgment announced by an international arbitration panel sitting in The Hague might just be about to change all that .
In an action brought by the former shareholders of Yukos Oil – the private energy company seized and dismantled by the Russian state in 2004 – the panel was asked to rule on Russia 's status under the Energy Charter Treaty ( ECT ) .
Thought by many to be a dead letter after Russia signed but then refused to ratify , the ECT turns out to have the legal equivalent of an afterlife .
In a landmark decision , the panel ruled that Russia had accepted provisional application of the treaty when it signed and was fully bound by its provisions at the time of its expropriation of Yukos .
The decision opens the way for a claim of damages against the Russian state under the ECT 's tough investor protection rules .
The shareholders dispossessed by the demise of Yukos will now ask the arbitration panel to rule on the merits of the case , with a compensation claim estimated to be in the region of $ 50 bn - $ 100bn .
Those hearings will probably take two or three years to conclude and the result cannot be predicted with absolute certainty .
But to avoid a hefty bill the Russian authorities will have to do something they have conspicuously failed to do so far : to convince an independent court that the seizure of Yukos was a legal act and not a politically inspired violation of property rights .
Sceptical observers might question whether any of this matters .
After all , the wastepaper bins of the Kremlin are full of discarded rulings by the European court of human rights .
Surely the Russian government could ignore a demand for compensation just as easily as it ignores demands for the extradition of Andrei Lugovoi , wanted in the UK in connection with the murder of Alexander Litvinenko .
Well , the long arm of the law appears to be longer in some cases than in others .
Under the terms of the New York convention , compensation awards by international arbitration tribunals are recoverable against assets held in any country that adheres to it .
In the event of an eventual award against it , any property owned by the Russian state or state - owned enterprises in any of the 142 countries that have adopted the convention would be vulnerable to an enforcement order and seizure .
Perhaps the most interesting thing about this case is that it lays bare the limits of Russia 's unofficial state ideology of " sovereign democracy " .
Developed for the purpose of freeing Russia from foreign dependency and recasting it as an autonomous force in world affairs , its bullish assumptions about Russia 's national capacities always ignored the reality of its reliance on access to foreign markets to drive economic growth .
Consider , for example , Gazprom 's extensive portfolio of infrastructure assets in the downstream European energy market .
Carefully built up as a means of increasing its position as a dominant energy provider , this now looks more like a potential source of national vulnerability .
Another significant aspect of this is what it says about the enduring importance of international law as a factor in global politics .
Hard power enthusiasts in Russia and the US alike are often dismissive of Europe 's preference for a rules - based approach to international relations .
But law has a persistent , entangling quality that should not be underestimated as a real and positive constraint on state behaviour .
Whereas politicians and business leaders are often biddable and sometimes bribeable , judges in the developed world are usually of a stubbornly independent turn of mind .
That may be why Russian policymakers failed to see this coming .
In a country where the political elite is more accustomed to seeing the law as an extension of its own power , instead of an independent source of authority over it , the potential consequences of flouting a normally obscure international legal instrument must have been hard to anticipate .
The most sensible course of action for Russia now would be to seek an early out - of - court settlement with Yukos 's shareholders .
That would allow it to remove uncertainty and prevent disruption to its external economic relations at a time when it is struggling to recover from a severe downturn .
It would also go some way to restoring the idea that Russia offers a business climate friendly to foreign investors .
It will certainly need foreign capital and technology if it wants to refurbish its increasingly dilapidated energy sector .
But for elements of the ruling elite in Moscow there is a heady mix of pride and profit at stake .
The attack on Yukos was the moment that Vladimir Putin established his political authority over the country 's once powerful business class and enabled him to distribute the spoils in a way the reinforced his own power base .
That would be hard to give up without loss of face and loss of power , yet the alternative could be worse if Russia stumbles on only to face the seizure of up to $ 100bn of its overseas assets .
Either way , it may turn out that the founding act of Putinism also sowed the seeds of its eventual destruction .
KABUL ( Reuters ) - Eight U.S. service members working for the NATO - led force and one Afghan civilian were killed in multiple bomb attacks in southern Afghanistan on Tuesday , the alliance said in a statement .
The NATO - led International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) said several troops were also wounded in the “ multiple complex ( bomb ) attacks ” but would not give further details of the attacks , which come a day after 11 U.S. troops were killed in two helicopter crashes .
For those of you who have read my profile , you know that I ’m finishing up my math degree .
More specifically , I ’ve just finished lectures for my last term as an undergraduate student of statistics .
One of my main fears about switching to a different operating system was that it would disrupt my studies .
Fortunately , this fear was unfounded – in fact , I can confidently say that Linux actually made my school experience much easier and smoother than it would have been had I stuck with Windows Vista or XP .
As a statistics student , I obviously work with numbers .
Some courses , such as those dealing with experimental design , have fairly simple mathematical procedures ( Note : these usually follow not - so - simple justifications for the procedures ) .
Normally I ’m given a small data set and told to carry out an Analysis Of Variance ( ANOVA ) .
Since the mathematical work in these assignments is pretty straightforward , I like to carry it out in Excel , or some equivalent .
Thankfully , OpenOffice .
Org Calc works just as well as Excel and uses essentially the same syntax and commands , so I managed to switch between programs rather seamlessly .
Some of my other assignments require more complicated procedures ( and occasionally more complicated ANOVAs ) , so I have to use R , which is basically a very powerful statistical tool .
In Windows XP , I found that adding libraries and updating R could occasionally be a difficult process – my roommates can verify that as a consequence , I often go months without updating my programs .
In Mint , there were no such troubles – installing and updating libraries is as easy as opening Synaptic and clicking a few times .
Linux also provided some less important benefits , such as not having to alter every slash in a filepath to make sure that R can actually find the file .
I ’m guessing this has something to do with the difference between a backslash and a frontslash .
Other programs like Do , which I ’ve reviewed , and Kate , my preferred text editor , make life so much easier .
When I ’m working , I usually have several data sets open , and I frequently have to jump between folders to access images , old code , old solutions for reference , etc .
Kate simplifies things by letting me have several text files open in one window at once , so I can make better comparisons between data sets or summary tables .
This is especially important for when I have data sets that are so large that viewing them in R in the terminal would be ill - advised ( tip : do n’t try to view anything longer than 1000 lines in terminal ) .
Thanks to Do , I can quickly flip between several folders without ever having to move my hands off of the keyboard .
In particular , this comes in handy when I need to reference some old solutions for an obscure - but - suddenly - desireable mathematical quality .
I have n’t done too much writing this term aside from updating my resume , so I wo n’t dwell on the various word processors .
In my opinion , if the word processor can create a decent looking resume – it did , by the way – then it should suffice for any other purpose .
I ’ve also tried out a few other math programs ( eg. , gnuplot ) , but I have n’t used them enough to give a reasonably well - informed opinion .
However , the fact that I could install them and try them out with absolutely no effort on my part really speaks well for Linux Mint .
After a long , gruelling term , I can confidently say that I benefitted academically from using Linux Mint .
Along with everything I ’ve mentioned , Linux has provided less direct benefits , such as faster load times and fewer restarts , which make getting started on an assignment or project easier .
Despite having a few bugs ranging from annoying ( I really wish Do would load on startup consistently ) to catastrophic ( oh my god why did my desktop shift what is going on ) , I will probably have some distribution of Linux running on my machine when I switch to Windows 7 , if only to run R and some other math programs .
If you like to do any sort of math on your computer , I recommend you give it a go too .
You always suspected school lunch food could kill .
Now there 's evidence to back up your worst childhood fears .
( OK , not worst .
There 's still no evidence that an evil clown is hiding under your bed .
Thank god . )
Professor Doug Powell 's Barf Blog quotes a USA Today story that draws attention to the shamefully lax food safety standards of our public school lunch system :
McDonald's , Burger King and Costco , for instance , are far more rigorous in checking for bacteria and dangerous pathogens .
They test the ground beef they buy five to 10 times more often than the USDA tests beef made for schools during a typical production day .
And the limits Jack in the Box and other big retailers set for certain bacteria in their burgers are up to 10 times more stringent than what the USDA sets for school beef … Mansour Samadpour , a Seattle - based food safety consultant and microbiologist says the AMS approach to sampling " is not robust enough to find anything . "

Dr. Benjamin Rush , a signer of the Declaration of Independence , is quoted as warning two centuries ago :
" Unless we put medical freedom into the Constitution , the time will come when medicine will organize into an underground dictatorship .
. . .
The Constitution of this republic should make special privilege for medical freedom as well as religious freedom . "
That time seems to have come , but the dictatorship we are facing is not the sort that Dr. Rush was apparently envisioning .
It is not a dictatorship by medical doctors , many of whom are as distressed by the proposed legislation as the squeezed middle class is .
The new dictatorship is not by doctors but by Wall Street -- the FIRE ( finance , insurance , and real estate ) sector that now claims 40 % of corporate profits .
Economist L. Randall
Wray observes that ever since Congress threw out the Glass - Steagall Act separating commercial banking from investment banking , insurance and Wall Street finance have been " two peas in a pod . "
He writes :
" [ T ] here is a huge untapped market of some 50 million people who are not paying insurance premiums -- and the number grows every year because employers drop coverage and people can't afford premiums .
Solution ?
Health insurance " reform ' that requires everyone to turn over their pay to Wall Street . . . .
This is just another bailout of the financial system , because the tens of trillions of dollars already committed are not nearly enough . "

In my recent post on automatic skinning , one of the steps involved creating a voxel representation of the character .
I could n't find any explanations of how to do this on the Internet , so I decided to write my own !
What is a voxel ?
" Voxel " is short for " volume pixel " .
A pixel is a single square in a 2D image , and a voxel is a single cube in a 3D lattice .
Voxel models are useful in games because they are n't hollow like triangle meshes are , so we can use them for ' deep ' physical simulations such as heat diffusion , fracture , and soft physics .
I used voxels extensively when working with Alec Rivers to visualize his RealMatter technology , and when testing out destructible cover for an unreleashed shooter project .
Here is the example model that I used for the previous post again -- the triangle surface is on the left , and the voxel model is on the right .
So how do we make a voxel model ?
A voxel model is a bounded 3D grid , so the first step is to decide its basic characteristics .
How big is each block , and what are the dimensions of the grid ?
The size of each block depends on what you need it for -- in this case we are using it for attaching the mesh to the bones , so we only need enough resolution to make sure that important details like the mouth and fingers are not lost .
Let 's say each block is 1 cubic cm in size .
The dimensions of the grid have to be big enough to fit the entire model , but no bigger ( to avoid inefficiency ) .
This is fairly simple -- we can just set the dimensions equal to the size of the bounding box of the surface triangles ( the smallest box that encloses every point ) rounded up to the nearest centimeter .
Here 's a picture of the voxel grid :
Now we have to decide which voxels are solid ( intersecting the model ) , and which voxels are not .
The method I used is a two - step process .
First , we solidify a shell representing the surface , and second , we fill it in using a scanline fill algorithm .
This is most clearly illustrated by looking at a single slice -- first we have just the triangle surface , next the voxel shell , and finally the filled voxel model .
Calculating the shell is pretty straightforward .
For every triangle , I check every voxel in the triangle 's bounding box to see if it intersects .
If it does , the voxel is made solid .
Filling the shell is a little more complicated .
We can see this best by looking at a single row as it's filled in .
You can think of a pen scanning from left to right that goes down to the paper when it hits an outside edge and raises again when it hits an inside edge .
We start out on the left with the pen up , shown here as a green square .
There is no surface here and the pen is up , so we just move onto the next square without changing anything .
Here there are some intersecting surface triangles !
We send a horizontal ray from left to right through the center of the voxel to see what it intersects .
If the last triangle it intersects is facing to the left , then we lower the pen .
Otherwise , we keep it raised .
Here is a close - up of this voxel .
The small white lines represent the triangle normals ( which way is ' out ' ) .
The last ( and only ) triangle that the pen intersects faces to the left , so we lower the pen !
Here we illustrate that by changing the pen from green to red .
Since the pen is down , it fills in empty voxels as it steps to the right .
This process continues until we get to the next intersection .
Fill , step to the right .
Fill , step to the right .
Here 's a close - up of this intersection test .
The rule is the same as before :
If the last triangle the pen intersects is facing to the left , then we keep the pen lowered , otherwise , we raise it up .
In this case the last ( and again , only ) triangle is facing to the right , so we raise the pen .
As it keeps moving out of the model , the pen is raised , so it fills no voxels .
When we repeat this process for every row , the whole slice is filled in !
Here is a 3D view of half of the model : first , a surface slice , next , the voxel shell , and finally , the filled voxel model .
That 's all there is to it !
I hope this helps you use voxel models in your own projects .
Do you have any ideas about better ways to voxellize triangle meshes , or any questions about how this works ?
Posted by John , December 15th , 2009 - under Neoliberal Keynesianism , Neoliberalism .
The whole neoliberal , or free market , order that has dominated the world for over 30 years was called into question when the system plunged into economic crisis in the autumn of last year .
The recent financial collapse in Dubai reminds us that the crisis is still shaking capitalism ’s foundations .
Yet talk about “ the twilight of neoliberalism ” has unfortunately proved premature .
It is true that a modified form of neoliberalism is emerging .
This retains its core aspects while making pragmatic adjustments out of economic necessity .
But these measures , such as the part - nationalisation of British and US banks , are seen as temporary .
They are certainly not undertaken as a means of achieving social reform .
If anything is blamed for the present debacle it is the excesses of financial institutions rather than the capitalist system itself .
“ What we are experiencing is not a crisis of capitalism , ” proclaimed a recent article in the Newsweek magazine .
“ It is a crisis of finance , of democracy , of globalisation and ultimately of ethics . ”
Neoliberalism did not promote economic growth or reduce inflation , let alone restore companies ’ profit rates , except on a temporary and very uneven basis .
Why then is it still dominant ?
Like the 19th century neoclassical economic school from which it takes much of its theory , neoliberalism is an ideology representing particular class interests .
Neoclassicism represented mainly the interests of a subset of the capitalist class .
This was characterised by extreme individualism and focused on the consumption of goods rather than their production .
In some respects , neoliberalism reflects the way in which these attitudes have been generalised across the capitalist class .
The Italian journalist Loretta Napoleoni even argues that we have entered a new “ Gilded Age ” where the ruling class has once again become a “ leisure class ” .
Farce
This goes too far .
But it is true that neoliberalism has benefited individual capitalists by increasing their wealth at the expense of the poor and the working class .
It is unsurprising , therefore , that no significant section of the international ruling class has abandoned its belief in neoliberal capitalism .
It appears that we have returned to the start of the crisis of the late 1970s .
Almost 35 years later , the same solutions are being offered to the same problems , with the same intended victims .
At this point it is customary to quote Karl Marx on how “ the great events and characters of world history ” are repeated “ the first time as tragedy , the second as farce ” .
But , if the ruling class does achieve its aim , the repetition is unlikely to be funny .
It will extend and deepen the original tragedy .
But there are two differences from the late 1970s .
One is that the original practitioners of neoliberalism , particularly those associated with the vanguard regimes of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan , shared key objectives and strategies .
Their successors no longer do so .
Instead , they display a sense of panic and consequent incoherence .
Yet they are agreed about one thing – that the cost will be borne by the people they rule over , rather than by themselves .
The other is that , for most people , economic life has become more uncertain , political life more meaningless , social life more fragmented and cultural life more degraded .
Since human beings are not just greedy little bundles of appetite , they are rebelling against these assaults on their humanity .
Those who might have been persuaded to accept a supposedly temporary deterioration of their living conditions in order to restructure capitalism for the greater good are less likely to be fooled again .
They have seen how their years of sacrifice have only benefited those at the top of society , and failed to prevent a recession .
Also , the idea that Labour represents an alternative to the capitalist parties has suffered with its 12 years of “ social neoliberal ” government .
The experiences behind these developments have been terrible .
But they represent potentially positive changes in consciousness , if the left can offer people an alternative .
This article , by Neil Davidson , first appeared in the UK weekly Socialist Worker .
( This guest post originally appeared at The Huffington Post and is reprinted with the author 's permission )
The New York Times published a Christmas Eve expose of Goldman Sachs 's so - called " Abacus " synthetic collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) .
They were created with credit derivatives instead of cash securities .
Goldman used credit derivatives to create short bets that gain in value when CDOs lose value .
Goldman did this for both protection and profit and marketed the idea to hedge funds .
Goldman responded to the New York Times saying many of these deals were the result of demand from investing clients seeking long exposure .
In an earlier Huffington Post article , I wrote about Goldman ’s key role in the AIG crisis ; it traded or originated $ 33 billion of AIG ’s $ 80 billion CDOs .
AIG was long the majority of six of Goldman ’s Abacus deals .
These value - destroying CDOs were stuffed with BBB - rated ( the lowest “ investment grade ” rating ) portions of other deals .
These BBB - rated portions were overrated from the start .
Many of them eventually exploded like firecrackers .
Goldman said it suffered losses due to the deterioration of the housing market and disclosed $ 1.7 billion in residential mortgage exposure write - downs in 2008 .
These losses would have been substantially higher had it not hedged .
Goldman describes its activities as prudent risk management .
Many Wall Street firms wound up taking losses .
The question is , however , how did they manage to get through a couple of bonus cycles without taking accounting losses while showing “ profits ? ”
The answer is that they sold a lot of “ hot air ” disguised as valuable securities .
Goldman claims this was prudent risk management .
In reality , Goldman created products that it knew or should have known were overrated and overpriced .
If Wall Street had not manufactured value - destroying securities and related credit derivatives , the money supply for bad loans would have been choked off years earlier .
Instead , Wall Street was chiefly responsible for the “ financial innovation ” that did massive damage to the U.S. economy .
Earlier , Goldman denied it could have known this was a problem , yet acknowledged I had warned about the grave risks at the time .
If Goldman wants to stick to its story that it did n’t know the gun was loaded , then it is not in the public interest to rely on Goldman ’s opinion about the greater risk it now poses to the global markets .
Goldman excuses its participation by saying its counterparties were sophisticated and had the resources to do their own research .
This is a fair point if Goldman were defending itself in a lawsuit with a sophisticated investor trying to recover damages .
It is not a valid point when discussing public funds that were used to bail out AIG , Goldman , and Goldman ’s “ customers . ”
Goldman claims the portfolios were fully disclosed to its customers .
Yet at the time of the AIG bailout , Goldman did not disclose the nature of its trades with AIG , and Goldman did not disclose these portfolios to the U.S. public .
If it had , the public might have balked at the bailout .
The public is an unwilling majority owner in AIG , and public money was funneled directly to Goldman Sachs as a result of suspect activity .
The circumstances of AIG ’s crisis were extraordinary and without precedent .
I maintain that the public is owed reparations , and it would be fair to make all of AIG ’s counterparties buy back the CDOs at full price , and they can keep the discounted value themselves .
Some similar CDOs currently trade for less than a dime on the dollar in the secondary market .
Goldman ’s trades amounted to more than $ 20 billion ( albeit Goldman traded or originated $ 33 billion of AIG ’s $ 80 billion of this ilk ) .
If Goldman wants to claim it was “ only following orders ” for customers , that is between Goldman and the hedge funds or other “ customers ” involved .
Goldman can fight it out with them if it wants its money back .
Goldman ’s synthetic deals that are still on AIG ’s books can be settled at ten cents on the dollar .
This is the value at which other bond insurers have settled similar deals .
The excess money already paid to Goldman can used to pay down AIG ’s public debt .
SO , here 's something interesting .
At the beginning of 2010 , the Bush estate tax plan is scheduled to change such that all estates , up to any value , are excluded .
Because the tax bill was passed through reconciliation , however , it has a ten - year time frame , meaning that the law expires at the end of 2010 .
And that means that the heirs of fortunes received in 2010 will pay no tax , while heirs getting theirs in 2011 will pay 50 % of the value of the estate to the Internal Revenue Service .
Perhaps you notice the uncomfortable incentive structure here .
The House of Representatives voted at the beginning of December to continue the current year policy into 2010 ; instead of an exclusion for all estates , only those greater than $ 3.5 million in value would be taxed .
That would still leave some bad incentives in place , but it would be better than the current policy path .
That left the Senate , graveyard of sensible policy ideas .
And the Senate has now abandoned its effort to pass the House extension of the estate tax measure .
Democratic senators are saying that they 'll address this early next year and will likely impose the tax retroactively .
We 'll see .
If they do not , there may be a few nervous older people tottering around next year , checking the brake lines on their Cadillacs and generally eyeing their heirs with suspicion .
Caracas , December 14 , 2009 ( Venezuelanalysis.com ) – Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez considered recent declarations by U.S. secretary of state Hilary Clinton , as “ signs of an imperialist offensive ” which aims to stop the growth of progressive forces in the region and recover control over its “ backyard ” .
Last Friday Clinton told a state department briefing on Latin American relations that countries in the region should “ think twice ” before increasing ties with Iran , citing Venezuela and Bolivia in particular .
“ If people want to flirt with Iran they should take a look at what the consequences might well be for them .
And we hope that they will think twice , ” she said .
“ We can only say that is a really bad idea for the countries involved , ” Clinton warned .
Speaking at the summit of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America ( ALBA ) as it met in Havana , Cuba on Sunday , Chavez insisted that the statements are an open threat , an indication of the imperialist offensive reflected in the installation of seven U.S. military bases in Colombia and the coup in Honduras .
“ These statements are threats , especially against Venezuela and Bolivia , and against the whole of ALBA ” he said .
Iran has strong diplomatic and trade ties with Venezuela and has also recently strengthened its relations with Brazil , Ecuador , Bolivia and Nicaragua .
The Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Brazil , Bolivia and Venezuela in late November .
At the time Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said Brazil recognised Iran 's right to develop a peaceful nuclear programme .
Both the Brazilian and Bolivian governments made statements rejecting Clinton ’s comments on Saturday .
For the Venezuelan president , Clinton ’s threats oblige ALBA countries to consolidate their process of regional integration .
“ We must strengthen ALBA and consolidate it from all points of view , ” he said .
Bolivian President Evo Morales rejected Clinton ’s comments and reiterated he would not accept any kind of threat or warning from the U.S. government .
The Latin American leaders also criticised the U.S. role in Honduras , where the democratically elected President Manuel Zelaya was ousted in a military coup in June .
Amidst reports of massive fraud , ballot stuffing , an abstention rate of 70 % and at least one death , the coup regime carried out elections in a U.S. backed process on November 29 .
However , the majority of Latin American governments , including Brazil and Argentina have refused to recognise the outcome , categorising the elections as simply an attempt to legitimise the coup .
Clinton defended Washington ’s role as a “ pragmatic , principled , multilateral approach ” .
However , Cuban president Raul Castro slammed the U.S. for presiding over an “ electoral farce . ”
Latin American countries have also criticised the Obama administration for its failure to condemn the human rights violations carried out by the coup regime .
At least two protestors active in the resistance to the coup have been killed since the “ elections ” in Honduras : Santos Corrales García , who was last known to be in police custody after being arrested on December 5 and whose decapitated body was found on Friday and human rights defender Walter Trochez , who was shot in the chest by a drive - by gunman on Sunday , after earlier recounting that he had escaped a kidnapping attempt December 4 after suffering several hours of beatings and threats by masked men .
Until recently , anyone advocating a global tax on financial transactions was dismissed as hopelessly naive .
That was until the world banking system came close to collapse .
While the economies of rich nations dived , those of developing countries foundered .
This led to an urgent initiative by the United Nations to find financial mechanisms to protect poor nations .
Exactly 12 months ago , the UN stumbled on one that could be worth at least £ 40 bn .
A presentation by David Hillman , the coordinator of a little - known NGO called Stamp Out Poverty , at a high level conference in Doha proved to be pivotal .
With the UN warming to a 0.005 % micro tax on currency trading , it gave intellectual credibility to the so - called Leading Group of Nations , a 55 - strong body of countries whose task was to find innovative financial answers to poverty .
It took the idea to the G20 at Pittsburgh in September .
Meanwhile , German NGOs persuaded Chancellor Angela Merkel and her political rival Peer Steinbrück to back the tax during the German federal election campaign in September .
At the same time , in Pittsburgh , G20 world leaders asked the International Monetary Fund to consider introducing what is widely known as the Tobin tax after the late US Nobel prizewinning economist who dreamed up the device .
When Gordon Brown became the first G20 leader to publicly back the plan , the Tobin tax suddenly shook off its left - field image and crossed over into the political mainstream .
Now that the EU has called on the IMF to back it , its chances of being adopted have remarkably become closer still .

Features
Three new Riot Arenas
Bank to store items
One additional skill point for each playthrough as mission rewards [ 4 ]
New game mode , with waves of enemies [ 5 ]
5 new trophies / achievements
Plot
Mad Moxxi is a thrill - seeking woman in search of a new husband .
Having gone through three husbands already , her search has led to her becoming the Ring Master / Hostess and Commentator of the Underdome .
She equates the excitement and the competition of the Underdome to matrimony and plans to stay only as long as the thrill lasts .
Gameplay includes three new Riot Mode arenas where players will fight AI - controlled enemies ( PvE ) in single player or multiplayer [ 4 ] .
The add - on starts with the mission titled " Prove Yourself " in which players complete all three arenas .
This is the only DLC that does n't contain a full plot with side missions and multiple plot missions .
After successful completion of " Prove Yourself " , though , the player is allowed unlimited replays of all content , including the three arenas with 20 5 - wave - rounds instead of 5 .
Mechanics
Main article : Underdome gameplay mechanics
The DLC can be accessed in - game by using the Fast Travel system and heading for the starting location of The Underdome .
The gameplay consists of rounds and waves .
Each round consists of five waves ending with a Boss wave .
Every round brings an increased difficulty level .
As the round number increases , the number of gameplay - altering rules increases , adding variables such as different gravity levels and modified enemy regeneration , accuracy , damage , etc .
If a character is incapacitated and fails to achieve a second wind they will respawn in the Penalty Box on top of Moxxi 's tower and the round will be reset .
If the player is downed in a multiplayer game , they will respawn in the Penalty Box ( from which they can still play an active role by sniping enemies ) for the remainder of the wave .
No experience is gained from kills inside the Underdome and consequently weapon proficiencies are not affected , although it is still possible to complete challenges for experience .

Trivia
The title " Mad Moxxi 's Underdome Riot " is a reference to Mad Max : Beyond Thunderdome .
.
In the trailer for the DLC , when Moxxi 's first husband is shown , the Konami Code runs across the screen , shooting him .
The tournament audience sometimes gives a cheer of " Heyooo ! " a greeting otherwise used by Steve .
Steve is featured in many Borderlands promotional works , including the ' Borderlands Claptrap Web Series ' .
Killing a humanoid opponent ( such as a bandit or psycho ) with a critical hit will usually prompt the cheer .
Yet another reference to Steve is in the intro clip that plays the first time you fast travel to the Underdome , when Moxxi describes her former husbands .
For number two , you see the shadow of a Bandit Raider and hear " Heyooo ! " shortly after he appears .
After players unlock the greater challenges , dead bandits can be seen buried with flowers planted on their exposed heads .
Mordecai is the only character who is canonically stated to have won The Underdome Challenge as revealed in the Borderlands 2 side mission Rakkaholics Anonymous .
side mission Rakkaholics Anonymous .
It is told in Borderlands 2 that Moxxi 's Underdome was destroyed by Handsome Jack after she broke up with him .
that Moxxi's Underdome was destroyed by Handsome Jack after she broke up with him .
Gamefiles reveal that total of 13 ( The Angelic Ruins , The Arena , The Bandit Camp , The Bunker of Blood , The Crimson Halls , The Danger Canyon , The Decrepit Mine , Hell - burbia , The Scrap Hole , The Slaughter Caves , The Bog , The Gully , and Wonderland ) arenas were to be included in this DLC .

Unfortunately , it only answers some of the questions in my E-mail :
A 37 - year - old Bible - class teacher at a private academy has been arrested for allegedly creating a " secret society " to lure teenage girls to have sex with him , the San Antonio Express - News reports .
Robert Louis Rosseau , who taught eighth - graders at Christian Academy of San Antonio , was charged with aggravated sexual assault .
The principal at the academy said none of the alleged sexual acts took place on campus and that only one of the three girls involved attends the school , the paper says .
Rosseau 's secret society , which included him and two of the girls , came to light when a third teen resisted joining the organization , which they referred to as an " order , " and discussed it with friends .
The paper says that the arrest affidavit quotes the two girls as telling the potential recruit that she had to be " intimate " with Rosseau to become a member and gain his trust .
The affidavit says Rosseau would read Bible passages to the two girls " to legitimize his believed ability " to have sex with them , the Express - News says .
Weniger Staatsverschuldung durch mehr Klimaschutz Matthias Brake
Klimaschädliche Subventionen streichen
In Sachen Staatsschulden agieren bundesdeutsche Politiker mittlerweile so maßlos wie die vielgeschmähten ' Bonibänker ' .
Grenzenlose Neuverschuldung ist , scheints , zur Normalität geworden .
Als Wolfgang Schäuble letzte Woche mitteilte , die Koalition werde allein für nächstes Jahr 86.000.000.000 Euro neue Kredite aufnehmen , versuchte er nur noch Beträge für die ' Nebenhaushalte ' genannten Extrakredite zu bemänteln .
Die FAZ berechnete , dass so insgesamt 100 Mrd. Neuschulden für das nächste Jahr geplant seien .
Der Deutsche Naturschutzring DNR ( Dachverband der deutschen Natur- und Umweltschutzverbände ) fordert angesichts dieser maßlosen Ausgaben den Abbau umweltschädlicher Subventionen quasi als Doppelstrategie :
Die Staatverschuldung würde geringer ausfallen und dem Klimaschutz wäre geholfen .
Das Umweltbundesamt listet beispielhaft für 2006 im Hintergrundpapier " Umweltschädliche Subventionen in Deutschland " allein in Deutschland gut 42 Mrd. Euro umweltschädlicher Subventionen .
Ein Hauptposten , der besonders leicht zu korrigieren wäre , sind die umweltschädlichen Strom - und Energiesteuerermäßigungen für das produzierende Gewerbe und den gewerblichen Flugverkehr allein sie machten 6,9 Mrd.
Euro / Jahr aus und verzerren das Angebot zur Ungunst emissionsärmerer und umweltfreundlicher Herstellungsmethoden und Verkehrsmittel .

When I first came to Japan , I was told that Kentucky Fried Chicken , or simply ‘ Kentucky ’ as it ’s known in Japan , is a Christmas tradition .
I was told that people flock to KFC for their annual Christmas Eve dinner .
I did n’t really take it seriously until I saw people lining up for three blocks one Christmas Eve , just to get their dose of chicken !
Although it exists , turkey is n’t common in Japan , and it certainly is n’t associated with Christmas .
Colonel Saunders and his massive advertising campaigns have embedded “ KFC = Christmas ” into the minds of most naive Japanese .
I say ‘ naive ’ because Christmas in Japan is purely commerical with no religious strings attached .
Therefore everything the Japanese understand about Christmas has been fed to them through TV , radio and magazines , including commercials for chicken .
Maybe it ’s because Colonel Saunders bears a resemblance to Santa Claus himself , and his statue outside every KFC is wearing a Santa suit .
Or maybe the American occupation after the war is the reason for KFC ’s success , that is assuming the Americans all ate chicken at Christmas due to the lack of turkey .
I really have no idea… and neither do the Japanese .
Here ’s what Wikipedia has to say about it :
KFC is so prevalent in Japan that many Japanese unknowingly consider it to be a Japanese Company .
On Christmas day many families ( who have made reservations weeks in advance ) , have their traditional Christmas dinner at KFC .
Colonel Sanders has become somewhat of a cult figure in Japan .
Not only is there a life - sized statue of the Colonel in front of every KFC , but his memorabilia like wind - up toys and figurines can be found at many toy stores throughout Japan .
Japanese baseball team Hanshin Tigers is thought to be under the Curse of the Colonel , a curse coming from when an enthusiastic fan threw a store - front statue of Colonel Sanders into a local canal during a celebration for the Tigers victory in the 1985 Japan Series .
The curse says that the Tigers will not win again until the statue is recovered .
I thought that comment about the Hanshin Tigers was worth looking into elsewhere on the web and this is what I found on this Hanshin Tigers page :
The year 1985 is still fondly remembered by all Hanshin fans .
Not only did the club win the Japan Series for the first ( and so far only ) time , but their first baseman Randy Bass won the Triple Crown award AND the Japan Series MVP award as well – in the process elevating himself to God - like status in the Kansai region .
When the Hanshin Tigers won the Japan Series in 1985 , the fans went delirious .
Among other things , they hijacked a train in Tokyo , and at Dotonbori , one of the entertainment districts in Osaka , people were jumping into the polluted river .
The story goes that as the crowd yelled their way through the Hanshin roster , someone who looked like each of the players jumped into the river .
Apparently nobody looked like Randy Bass , so some bright spark thought the life - sized statue of Colonel Sanders outside the local KFC would do .
Well , he had a beard , he was n’t Japanese … Anyway , you can guess the rest – Colonel Sanders found himself at the bottom of the river .
The whereabouts of the Colonel remain a mystery to this day .
They ’ve even had divers down in the murky depths trying to find him , but to no avail .
It is said that the Hanshin Tigers will never win again until he is found .
That page goes on to say the Tigers finally won the Central League pennant in 2003 but failed to win the Japan Series , so the curse supposedly continues .
As for Colonel Santa , erm , I mean Saunders , I guess I ’ll be seeing him on Christmas Eve if I can reserve my chicken .
What ’s that Mami ?
You ’re kidding !?
KFC is already fully booked ?!
I guess we ’ll be eating McDonald ’s chicken nuggets for Christmas this year … .

I 'd love to hear from you !

The following is an effort to reduce the AGW issue to a minimum number of necessary claims to support or reject .
When I read of “ thousands of supporting papers ” on the issue , I would like to hear what these papers show that refutes the following .
The issue of anthropogenic global warming and its consequence arose from several factors .
The obvious three main factors that prompted the issue coming up were :
The global average temperature has been rising noticeably since about 1850 ( with obvious results of glaciers melting , sea level rising , etc )
The atmospheric CO2 concentration has been increasing significantly since it was first accurately measured in 1958 , and proxies indicate the main part of the rise started about 1850 .
This rise seems to be clearly related to human burning of fossil fuels .
There is a theoretical basis for the fact that CO2 is a major greenhouse gas and contributes to the surface temperature level .
It seemed an obvious step to correlate the temperature rise to the human activity .
The next step that followed was an effort to estimate the long - term effect of continuing increases in the use of fossil fuels , and thus production of CO2 .
This was particularly important , since the developing nations of the world seemed headed to ever - greater uses of fossil fuels as their economies expanded .
The theoretical models only show a modest temperature increase from the direct effect of the increase of the CO2 .
Additional factors had to be implicated before the increase could be considered a problem .
Some studies indicated that there was a feedback effect from increases in CO2 level that greatly magnified the resulting temperature increase .
The mechanism was that the modest temperature increase from the increased CO2 also caused the water vapor content of the atmosphere to increase .
Water vapor is the primary greenhouse gas and has the largest contribution to the Earths surface temperature increase .
The increase in water vapor engendered by the increased CO2 then causes more temperature increase , and this results in a net positive feedback .
The estimate generally used ( but not proven ) is that there is a gain of a factor of 3X over the direct CO2 effect alone .
With the large positive feedback assumption and projected increase in CO2 from growing worldwide fossil fuel burning activity , computer models were developed to estimate the worldwide increase in temperature over the next several decades .
These models all showed significant increase in temperature over the next 50 to 100 years and longer , and raised considerable concern .
In order for the models to be reasonable , two facts had to be established :
Much of the temperature rise since 1850 had to be shown to be not due to natural variability , but due to human activity , with the greatest activity from 1970 to the present .
The positive feedback with large gain factor due to water vapor had to be supported by measured data .
The first of these two facts required that the global temperature rise since 1850 , with emphasis from 1970 to the present , had to be significantly larger and occurring faster than any other time in at least the last couple of thousand years , so that it would not be reasonable to associate the recent rise with natural variability .
This requirement seemed to contradict the previous best understanding of the global temperature variation .
Previous work had indicated that there were periods of warming and cooling every few hundred to thousand years that were comparable to the recent one .
However , since the direct temperature measurements only went back a few hundred years , and direct global measurements even a shorter time , the older global variation had to be determined by indirect measurements from proxies .
There are several proxies that can be used .
These include ice cores from glaciers , cores from sea floors , coral cores , tree ring data , bore hole temperature distributions , etc .
All of the proxies are limited in the number of locations they can be obtained from , or in temporal resolution , and many have sensitivity to several parameters .
As an example , tree ring data is affected by cloudiness , rainfall , CO2 fertilizer , and surrounding conditions as well as temperature , and in fact does not measure nighttime or winter temperature , so extracting just average temperature data is not easy and in fact may be not possible in many cases .
Some data that was deduced from these proxies seemed to support the claim that even though some regions ( such as Europe and Greenland ) may have had other warm periods such as the “ Medieval Warm Period ” and cooling periods such as the “ Little Ice Age ” , that these were regional and not world wide as the present warm period is .
If that was true , then the present period of worldwide warming would seem to be unique over the last several thousand years .
However , more recent and complete data , along with reanalysis of some of the previous data , contradicts that conclusion of uniqueness of the present average temperature .
In addition , the present temperature trend is not continuing upwards even though CO2 is still increasing .
The comparison of the present temperature trend to previous trends falsifies the claim of uniqueness of the temperature rise .
The upper Troposphere absolute water vapor content has not increased with increasing CO2 , and the temperature trend has continued flat or even down for the last few years .
This tends to falsify the positive feedback assumption between CO2 and water vapor .
In addition , the present low sunspot activity and PDO phase make it very likely that there will be more cooling over the next several years .
With these two claims falsified , there is NO argument supporting AGW , and the computer models are clearly GIGO .
Attorney Hoffman represented me during my divorce ( which ended up in a trial ) and then represented me in a post - divorce modification ( which also ended up in a trial ) .
I truly cannot say enough good things about Attorney Hoffman .
I could not be happier with his work and the results .
He has many years of experience and is really an expert in his field .
He is a true professional , and is sympathetic , honest , and respectful .
I trust his advice 100 % .
These are qualities that are not at all easy to find !
He is very dedicated to his work and is incredibly good at what he does .
He is thorough and puts a great deal of thought into his work , which I think is so important in dealing with difficult divorce and custody issues .
In addition , he surrounds himself with top - notch people ; the other lawyers in his practice and his staff are amazing .
He is a superb lawyer and a great person .

It ’s starting to seem like it may just be better for Dems to try to make a deal with Olympia Snowe , kick Joe Lieberman out of the party and be done with it .
The leadership in the senate thought that Lieberman was on board with the latest compromise .
But in an appearance on Face the Nation and later in a sit - down with Sen.
Reid , Lieberman said he ’d join the Republican filibuster if the Medicare buy - in remained in the bill .
What ’s most telling about Lieberman is n’t his positions , which are not that much different from Sen.
Nelson ’s and perhaps Sen. Lincoln’s .
It ’s more that he seems to keep upping the ante just when the rest of the caucus thinks they ’ve got a deal .
If it happened once , a misunderstanding might be a credible explanation .
But it ’s happened too many times .
Sen . Nelson has driven Dems to distraction on this bill .
But his demands have been fairly consistent over time .
Lieberman just does n’t seem to be negotiating in good faith .
He keeps pulling his caucus to some new compromise , waiting a few days and then saying he can’t agree to that either .
It ’s coming to a breaking point .

Somebody at CNN ’s Larry King Live thought that it would be a great idea to put Ben Stein and Rep.
Ron Paul on the same panel to discuss terrorism , and what occurred was a microcosm of the current GOP civil war , with Paul absolutely schooling Stein on how neo-con policies help to create terrorists .
Here is the video courtesy of Crooks and Liars :

After Rep .
Paul once again explained how the Bush administration fell into Bin Laden ’s trap the following exchange took place :
STEIN : Well , that ’s —
I have never heard anything quite like that in my whole life .
What he ’s saying , basically , is we are doing something wrong by defending ourselves .
Look , if these terrorists are trying to kill the government of Yemen , we ’ve got to help defend them .
They ’re our friends .
We ca n’t just let al Qaeda run wild .
If we try to stop them —
PAUL : Why ?
STEIN : Why should we stop them ?
Because they are terrorists and murderers and they ’re very anti-American .
PAUL : Why are they terrorists ?
STEIN : Surely congressman —
PAUL : Why are they terrorists ?
STEIN : They ’re terrorists and murders because they are psychos .
Ron Paul asked Ben Stein an intelligent question , and was given the answer that we should terrorists are bad because they are psychos .
Ben Stein is supposedly an intelligent man , but his answer would have been more fitting for an 8 year old than an intelligent conservative .
The person that I really felt bad for in all this was Democratic congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee who could not get a word in between Stein and Paul .
Even the usually out of it Larry King noticed that he was seeing something special here , “ Look at this , folks .
Two republicans going at it .
This is fascinating .
With a democratic liberal in the middle . ”
This segment said a great deal about the state of the Republican Party .
The man who was trying to engage in an intelligent discussion about an issue was met with the simplistic because they are psychos response .
The intelligent people like Rep .
Paul are a distant minority as the GOP has been hijacked by simpletons , who have even managed to convince Ben Stein to join the parade .
Most of the light from stars and other objects like planets in the universe is doubly invisible .
It comes in the form of infrared , or heat radiation , with wavelengths too long for our eyes to pick up .
Moreover , most infrared wavelengths do not penetrate the Earth ’s atmosphere to get to our unseeing eyes .
So to take a proper inventory of cosmic shenanigans , astronomers have had to take to space .
On Friday , they will get a little more help when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is scheduled to launch the Wide - field Infrared Survey Explorer , or WISE , into orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California as early as 9:09 a.m. , Eastern time .
Circling the Earth in a polar orbit 300 miles high , the spacecraft , equipped with a 16 - inch telescope and infrared detectors , will photograph the entire sky every six months .
WISE is a successor to the Infrared Astronomy Satellite , or IRAS , which was launched in 1983 and made the first heat maps of the sky .
And it is a trailblazer for the giant James Webb Space Telescope due in 2014 .

It 's no secret to students that coed dorms are more fun than same - sex dorms .
But they can also fuel very unhealthy behavior that might otherwise be moderated .
A new study finds university students in coed housing are 2.5 times more likely to binge drink every week .
And no surprise , they 're also likely to have more sexual partners , the study found .
Also , pornography use was higher among students in coed dorms .
Some 90 percent of U.S. college dorms are now coed .
More than 500 students from five college campuses around the country participated in the study .
Among the results :
42 percent of students in coed housing reported binge drinking on a weekly basis .
18 percent of students in gender - specific housing reported binge drinking weekly .
While that does n't put coed housing on par with fraternity and sorority houses , the researchers note that binge drinking is n't exclusively a " Greek problem . "
" In a time when college administrators and counselors pay a lot of attention to alcohol - related problems on their campuses , this is a call to more fully examine the influence of housing environment on student behavior , " said Jason Carroll , a study coauthor and professor of family life at Brigham Young University .
BYU was not one of the participating campuses .
The findings are detailed in the Journal of American College Health .
A separate study in 2007 found that college exacerbates the innate predisposition of some young adults to become heavy alcohol users .
In effect , going to college can fuel alcoholism .
In light of the finding , the natural question is whether a selection effect is in play .
For example , do partiers and teetotalers sort themselves out in the housing application process ?
That does n't appear to be the case , the researchers said in a statement today .
College housing offices generally assume students prefer coed housing and give them the option to " opt out " if single - gender housing is available .
Very few exercise that option .
" Most of the students who live in gender - specific housing did not request to be there ; they were placed there by the university , " said Brian Willoughby , lead author of the study .
Willoughby recently earned a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota and returned to BYU as a visiting professor .
A wealth of information on the study participants allowed the researchers to examine other factors that could predict binge drinking .
Their statistical analysis took into account the effects of age , gender , religiosity , personality and relationship status .
" When we first identified these differences with binge drinking , we felt certain that they would be explained by selection effects , " Willoughby said .
" But as we examined the data further we found that the differences remained . "
The participating campuses included two public universities in the Midwest and another on the West Coast , as well as a liberal arts college and a religious university on the East Coast .

Introduction
The discussion of Zionist Power Configuration ( ZPC ) in the US political system revolves around several essential issues , including :
1 . The claims by the ZPC that it represents Jewish opinion and values as well as its authority to speak for the interests of the American people .
2. Measuring the power of the ZPC and determining its influence over policy , appointments and political institutions .
3 . The question of whether the ZPC is a legitimate part of the US political system , another lobby , or something very different , an unregistered agent of a foreign power ( Israel ) .
4 . The scope and depth of the ZPC influence in US politics beyond the focus on its “ lobbying ” in Washington on a “ single issue ” .
5 . The organizational weapons and techniques utilized by the ZPC to maximize influence and deny voice and influence to critics of Israel and itself .
6 . The similarities of the organizational linkages of the Israel - Zionist relationship to the Russian – Stalinist Communist Parties of the 1930’s .
Method : Public Records , Ethnic Neutral Sources and Citations
The case against the Zionist Power Configuration is based on the open record of publications , speeches , articles , interviews and sources available to the general public ( and any interested reader ) .
Many facts and data are drawn from Zionist and Israeli sources as well as mainstream publications and writings by critical journalists and analysts .
We do not privilege the statements by Jews , whether they are critics or supporters of the State of Israel , as most “ progressive ” writers do .
The pursuit of truth is not an “ ethnic science ” , an approach that smacks of Nazi and Zionist racial theories .
Indeed , nothing reveals the extreme Zionist power or cultural hegemony over the debate on Israel and American Zionism so much as the constant reliance , reference and citation of the “ Jewish ” authorship of critical articles , even when publications by non-Jews are better documented , of earlier publication , and better argued .
The ethnic ( Jewish ) label attached to writings and intellectual and political activity is selectively applied : the ethnic labels are applied to ‘ positive outcomes ’ as part of a general campaign exalting the “ superiority ” of the “ race ” ; and disregarded in the face of ‘ negative outcomes ’ and activities ( e.g. , financial swindles , Russian oligarchs , espionage agents ) .
In fact the “ double standard ” is buttressed by savage attacks by the ZPC on those who , following the ethnic labeling tradition , actually mention the Jewish background of mediocrities and war criminals as well as peace and justice advocates .
We will begin by questioning and challenging the representativeness of the ZPC in the United States today .
Zionists and the Jewish Communities in America
The 51 Presidents of the Major American Jewish Organization ( PMAJO ) claim to speak for all Jews in the US .
A major study in the north Boston region found that less than 25 % of Jews belong to a synagogue , fewer ( 10 % ) contribute to the Jewish Federation and over 50 % do not accept rabbinical Zionist precepts against inter- marriage with non-Jews . )
According to the Jewish Telegraph Agency ( 12/4/2009 ) conservative synagogues have declined by almost 25 % from 800 to 650 over the past decade .
Even most striking many prominent individuals who may be of Jewish parentage , no longer consider themselves “ Jews ” despite frequent claims by Zionists that their achievements are a product or a result of their being “ Jewish ” .
Near majorities of young people of Jewish ancestry do not identify with Judaism and are critical or indifferent to Zionist appeals for Israel .
They have no involvement in Jewish centered civic activities .
A small , but vocal , group of Jews are organized and active critics of the entire Zionist apparatus , rejecting the idea of Israel as an exclusive ethno- religious state and supporting a secular democratic republic in Palestine .
In addition several Orthodox Jewish sects view the ‘ state of Israel ’ as a form of blasphemy and call for its destruction .
The “ 51 ” misrepresent their actual numbers and claim to speak for 6 million US Jews .
At best they may speak for less than half of the imputed population and even then their support waxes and wanes according to the issue , the timing and the place and varies in intensity .
The power of the “ 51 ” is not a result of its representativeness of the Jewish community at large , but the location of its followers in the power structure and the intensity and quasi-religious fervor of their activists .
Their political power resides in their singular forces in pursuit of the interests of the State of Israel and the control and influence in media ; their nationwide networks and the wealth and financial power of contributors .
Their capacity to browbeat apathetic Jews into making contributions and lending support adds organizational muscle .
Their willing use of force , money and media slander intimidates any and all critics , including dissident politicians , media , journalists and professors .
At most there are probably no more than 500,000 Jews who actively back the “ 51 ” – but what a half million !
Given the low level of political participation of the US population in general , the relative low salience of Middle East issues to most Americans and the one - sided pro-Israel mass media propaganda , which misinforms the public , the Zionist zealots have little competition .
They have a free hand in penetrating and influencing political , social and cultural institutions in line with the policies dictated by their Israeli influenced leaders among the “ 51 . ”
The issue of the limited representativeness of the Zionist organization must be separated from the exercise of power .
By leveraging non-Zionist , non-Jewish civic organizations , political institutions , pension funds , trade unions etc. the ZPC magnifies its power beyond its numbers .
The limited representativeness of the “ 51 ” is compensated by the silence and apathy of the majority of Jews and non-Jewish / Jews , who either are not willing to challenge ZPC claims or are immersed in private concerns , careers or other unrelated civic issues .
The ‘ 51 ’s hundreds of thousands of activists are strategically placed in institutions , as well as geographically , with a centralized command capable of mobilizing money , media attention and political leverage in any priority , political , cultural or social arena .
The ‘ 51 ’ organizations are not merely a “ lobby ” in the sense of having paid officials operating to influence congressional votes .
They include religious , civic , charitable , ideological , cultural and social organizations unified and unconditionally committed to following the zigzags of Israeli political directives .
The actual structure resembles a ‘ power configuration ’ that reaches from small chapters in municipalities to statewide confederations , as well as national organizations , each with its own budget , its own ideological watchdogs and appropriate levels of power .
The power for Israel is exercised by elected and appointed Zionist officials , especially those in positions that have any relevance to Israeli interests .
These “ interests ” include direct aid to Israel , sanctions and wars against Israel ’s Middle East and Asian adversaries , American pension fund investments in Israel , boycotts of companies trading with Israeli - designated adversary countries and many other strategic concerns .
The key to the power of the Zionist Power Configuration is that it is a mass grassroots organization , bolstered by the financial support by scores of millionaires and dozens of billionaires and a complicit mass media .
These political resources translate into tremendous leverage over the far more numerous non-Zionist electorates , the mass media spectators and the upwardly mobile politicians .
The ZPC illustrates clearly how “ numbers ” in the abstract do not count , especially in a permeable electoral system like the US , where money , organization , discipline and ethno- religious fanaticism define the boundaries , issues and acceptable policies .
The ZPC as Foreign Agents of the Israeli State
The recent decision of the US Congress to repudiate ( HR 867 ) the findings of Israeli war crimes in the official Final Report of the United Nations ’ Fact Finding Mission on the 2009 Gaza Conflict by a vote of 344-36 is a measure of the power of the ZPC .
The report , also known as the “ Goldstone Report ” , after its principle author Justice Richard Goldstone , was released on September 15 , 2009 , amid a carefully orchestrated campaign to discredit its findings and its authors .
What is even more important than the US Congressional vote of condemnation is the fact that the campaign was publically ordered from Israel , directed by the Presidents of the ‘ 51 ’ and obediently and enthusiastically carried out by several hundred thousand Zionist activists , throughout the country .
The ‘ 51 ’ and the mass of Zionist zealots were openly defending Israeli state terror and crimes against humanity .
Their defense of war crimes never evoked a second thought .
What mattered was their ability to pressure , threaten , cajole and promise future funds to Congressional representatives in order to secure their vote against Justice Goldstone .
Blind obedience to Israeli dictates was evident in the fact that many Congresspersons proudly confessed to never having even read the Goldstone Report and that none dared question the egregious fabrications , which its two uber - Zionist Congressional sponsors , ( Representatives H.L. Berman , D - California and G.L. Ackermann , D - New York ) , of the House Resolution 867 , concocted .
The US Congress , in fact , almost unanimously rejected the eminent Justice Goldstone ’s request to present his findings in person .
In the UN National Assembly , the Zionists were able to leverage the US to vote against the Goldstone Report , which in turn secured the vote of several Eastern European client states , insignificant island dependencies and the predictable Western European “ Allies ” .
This amounted to a total of 18 votes against the 114 UN members who endorsed the Report ’s thorough documentation of Israeli war crimes and state terrorism , an endorsement which represented over 80 % of the world ’s population .
The ZPC is powerful but not omnipotent .
It controls the US Congress and Executive and has decisive influence in the mass media , but there are important fissures in the monolith , as a number of Jewish organizations and individuals , revolted by Israel ’s mass killings in Gaza and the ZPC unconditional support , have spoken out in support of the Goldstone Report .
More importantly , major national trade / union federations in Canada , Ireland , Great Britain , France and Italy , along with numerous human rights organizations , support a global boycott and disinvestment campaign against Israeli products .
Judicial processes are proceeding in various European countries to arrest and put on trial top Israeli officials involved in the Gaza massacre .
The United States , under the tutelage of the ZPC , remains as the center of Israeli power and the sole reliable backer of Israeli war aims in the Middle East , especially with regard to Iran .
The power of Israel over Washington ’s Middle East policy is in direct relation to the strategic influence of the ZPC .
The denial of the power of the ZPC by seemingly “ progressive ” and “ leftist ” writers and journalists has been one of the principal obstacles undermining efforts to effectively counter US government support for Israeli war crimes , the expansion of colonial settlements in the West Bank and the military / sanctions policies toward Iran .
Israeli Power over US Middle Policy : The Centrality of the ZPC
The manifestations of Israeli power over the US are public , visible , outrageous and unprecedented in the annals of US foreign relations .
Israeli power is wielded directly through its subordinated political arm , the ZPC , which in turn facilitates the direct intervention of the Israeli state in the internal politics of the US .
Let us examine several crucial empirical indicators of Israeli power in the US .
On November 9 , 2009 , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed the mass based Jewish Federation ( JF ) of North America General Assembly and thanked US President Obama and the US Congress for repudiating the Goldstone Report .
The Israeli head of state then told his US followers to increase their efforts to influence US policy to “ stop Teheran from realizing its nuclear ambitions . ”
The previous day , Israel ’s Ambassador to the United States , Michael Oren , told the same Jewish Federation to “ press for sanctions on Iran and condemn the findings of the United Nations commission on Gaza . ”
Speaking as a tribal chieftain dictating orders to the loyal overseas followers , Oren stated , “ Our strength derives from the belief that we have a right to independence in our tribal land , the land of Israel … ” Israel is the only country that can intervene in the internal politics of the US , counting on a powerful political organization , to shape US policy to serve its state interests .
By drawing on the now discredited myth that American Jews ’ tribal ancestry is rooted in Israel , rather than Central Asia , Khazaran , reinforces the idea that Israel and not the United States — is the true ‘ homeland ’ of American Jews and therefore it is their right and duty to obey the dictates of the Israeli state .
Each year dozens of Israeli state officials visit the US and directly intervene in US political debates , congressional hearings and executive policy making – with nary a whisper of protest , let alone censure from the US State Department .
Any other country ’s officials who so flagrantly intervene in US politics would be declared persona non grata and expelled from the country .
In contrast , because of the power of the ZPC , Israeli civilians and military officials are invited to intervene in US policy making , to set the agenda for numerous Zionist officials in and out of public office and to bludgeon and praise those who criticize or oppose Israeli dictates .
The repeated public statements by Israeli officials that the primary loyalty of American Jews is to Israel and its policies – in other words , that they should act as a fifth column for Israel — is incompatible with the notion of citizenship everywhere except for this small group in the US .
One could imagine the outcry ( and brutal reprisals ) if any political leader from a Moslem country called on their co-religionists to pursue its state interests .
What is striking then about the ZPC is that it openly and publicly organizes meetings , follows orders and pursues policies dictated by Israeli public officials and yet is not registered as a foreign agent , let alone prosecuted for acting , by its own admission , on behalf of a foreign power .
The ZPC : Lobby or Unregistered Foreign Agents ?
Based on its organizational structure and political aims , the pro-Israel social - political configuration cannot be reduced to a common “ lobby . ”
The mass activist organizational structure encompassing and penetrating civic , political , cultural institutions and media outlets resembles a power configuration that works within and outside of Washington to shape political decisions relevant to Israel .
Equally important it plays a major role in shaping the opinions and behavior of public opinion and civic society organizations .
Secondly , unlike American lobbies , it acts to shape US foreign policy in the interest of a foreign military power , up to and including decisions on promoting war and imposing sanctions against Israel ’s opponents , prejudicing the lives and security of thousands of American working people and taxpayers .
Thirdly , the term “ lobby ” does not ordinarily encompass the virulent repressive activities pursued by the ZPC against critical writers , cultural figures , academics and others in American society who question Israeli policy .
The ZPC not only acts a foreign agent for Israel today , but has been openly doing so over fifty years .
In the 1960 ’s the Justice Department attempted to enforce the 1938 Foreign Agents Registration Act ( FARA ) against the current American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) ’s predecessor , the American Zionist Council ( AZC ) , but was blocked by pro-Israel politicians .
The ZPC no only publicly gives unconditional support to Israeli policy but engages in espionage on behalf of Israel as several prominent members of the ZPC and Mossad have testified .
One of America ’s leading experts on Israel ’s “ lobby , ” Grant Smith , has amassed a vast archive of declassified official US documents on Israeli - Zionist activities in the US .
He cites numerous cases in which AIPAC purloined internal classified government documents in order to further Israeli trade privileges n the 1980’s .
A leader of the Zionist Organization of America was implicated in the illegal transfer of US government uranium to Israel in 1956 .
In 2005 , Steve Rosen and Keith Weissman , leaders in AIPAC , admitted to receiving a confidential document relating to US - Iran policy , transmitting it to an Israeli embassy official .
From 1979 to 1985 , senior US Army Weapons Engineer Ben-ami Kadish , an American Zionist and former member of the fanatical Jewish Haganah militia in British Mandate Palestine , handed critical confidential documents on an enormous number of US weapons systems over to agents from the Israeli embassy .
These were then believed to have been passed to the Soviet Union in order to influence their policy on immigration to Israel .
Under the influence of the Zionist - infested Justice Department , Kadish got off with a $ 50,000 fine and not a single day in jail – for handing scores of crucial US military secrets to Israel .
Ben-ami Kadish ’s fellow spy , American Zionist Jonathan Pollard , shared the same Mossad handler in the 1980s .
Pollard , who worked as an analyst for US Naval intelligence , provided the Israelis with crate - loads of classified military and intelligence documents filled with top secret information on US policy in the Middle East , weapons systems , US agents in the Soviet Union and any and all relevant strategic objects of interest to his Israeli handlers .
On October 29 , 2009 , the Justice Department charged Stewart David Nozette , a Defense Department scientist , with attempting to transmit classified information to an Israeli Mossad agent .
Nozette , an American Zionist , did not act strictly out of tribal loyalties to the Jewish State .
Like Pollard , he asked for money and an Israeli passport ( Boston Globe 10/20/09 ) .
According to former Mossad agent Victor Ostrovsky , the spy agency recruits thousands of overseas Zionist sayanim ( Hebrew for ‘ helpers ’ ) who “ must be 100 percent Jewish ” for Israeli Mossad operations , which may include terrorism .
In 2001 Fox News investigative reporter , Carl Cameron , reported that scores of Israeli spies were rounded up and deported in the aftermath of 9/11 , including five Mossad agents videoing the World Trade Center bombing .
Industrial and political spying is not uncommon among states , even between allies .
What is striking is that representatives of an organized ethno- religious group , the major American Zionist organizations , have expressed sympathy and solidarity with such spies as Ben-ami Kadish , Jonathan Pollard and others , even defending their acts of espionage as a significant contribution to US – Israeli relations .
The implication , or better still , the explication for this perverse thinking is that for the leading American Zionist organizations , spying for Israel , is part and parcel of their primary loyalty to the Jewish state .
Zionist primary loyalty to Israel is not confined to mainline American Jewish organizations .
During the Rosen - Weissman trial , numerous prominent Jewish leftists ( including Democracy Now ’s Amy Goodman ) publicly defended the procuring of confidential documents and their handing over to a foreign ( Israeli ) government as a matter of “ free speech ” and “ freedom of the press . ”
Rosen in his civil suit again his firing by AIPAC ( to deflect FBI investigators ) claimed that his dealing of US government documents to Israeli officials was “ common practice ” AIPAC officials .
Top Zionist leaders in the Bush and Obama administration have a long history of work for and with Israel , including in some cases activity , which has caused them to lose security clearances and / or to come under investigation .
Two top Pentagon officials in the Bush administration , Former Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Assistant Secretary of Defense , Douglas Feith are cases in point .
Obama ’s chief of staff , Rahm Emmanuel spent time in the Israeli armed forces and has long been suspected of ties to Mossad .
Stuart Levey , a top US Treasury Department official involving in enforcing sanctions against Iran , has spent nearly a decade in close collaboration with MOSSAD , a point he brags about .
During the Bush ( Jr. ) Presidency , non-Zionist officials in the Pentagon and CIA complained of being sidelined by top Zionist officials , who set up their own intelligence offices run by their own fellow Zionist policymakers .
Wolfowitz and Feith set up the Pentagon ’s Office of Special Plans run by Abram Shulsky .
Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski , an official in the Pentagon at the time , complained of being marginalized and supplanted by Israeli officers who had unfettered access to the highest Pentagon officials .
The November 2007 United States National Intelligence Estimate Report ( NIE ) on the Iranian nuclear program was savaged by all the major Jewish American organizations , their cohorts in Congress , and the Executive branch because the report concluded that Iran had suspended its nuclear weapons development since 2003 .
The major Zionist organizations and their supporters in the US government favored Israeli intelligence disinformation claiming an active nuclear weapons program that threatened US security .
In short order the NIE report , prepared by 16 major US Government intelligence agencies , was pushed aside and US policy followed the lead of the Zionist - backed Israeli claims of a “ secret ” Iranian weapons program despite the absence of any hard data .
Leveraging Power
The key to Zionist power in shaping US policy toward the Mid-East , Arab - Muslim relations and toward “ third parties ” affecting Israeli policy is the combined influence of Zionists in executive offices ( Treasury , State , National Security , Pentagon , etc. ) and Congress , especially leading committees relevant to Israeli interests , and as well as the mass organizations in civil society ( the ‘ 51 ’ major American Jewish organizations ) and Zionist control over the mass media .
Zionist power and control in these crucial areas spreads out into influencing academic activity , including the repression of Israeli critics , the censoring of publications , manipulation of professional societies , trade unions and state and union pension funds , whose members are overwhelmingly neither Jewish nor Zionist .
The result is that the Zionist Power Configuration ’s automatic and unquestioning support for the crimes and treason , including Zionist espionage for Israel within the US and the universally - condemned Israel war crimes , goes uncontested in the mass media , the Congress , and even the small political and literary journals on the ‘ Left . ’
This uncontested support of espionage by foreign power acting through public organizations is unique in US history .
In the past organizations acting as surrogates for a foreign power were condemned , ostracized , suppressed , prosecuted and subject to mass public outrage .
It is a “ tribute ” to the power of ZPC that none of that occurs today .
As a footnote to history , it is the first time that practically all Marxist journals , monthlies , bi-monthlies , quarterlies and annuals and their leading contributors have avoided a serious critique of the ZPC .
On the contrary , the sparse articles which purport to deal with Middle East policies cover - up the role of the ZPC in shaping US policy .
There is evidence that , even in the most radical publications of “ critical writing , ” fellow traveling editors , who otherwise claim “ internationalist ” and “ working class ” allegiances , are not willing to confront the ZPC war makers who promote wars in the Middle East , funded by American taxpayers and fought by 99.9 % non Jewish / non - Zionist working class Americans in uniform .
The Interlocking Directorate : Establishing Zionist Hegemony
Several critical analysts have identified some of the key issues and institutions under Zionist influence .
Some have identified AIPAC as an influential pro-Israel lobby .
Others have noted the pro-Israel bias of the mass media .
A very few have even identified Zionist predominance in media ownership .
Others , especially during the Bush presidency , noted the influence of key Zionists in the Pentagon , especially their role in promoting the US invasion of Iraq .
The narrow focus of their otherwise valuable critiques fails to account for structural continuities over time and place : the long - term , large - scale presence of unconditional Israel Fisters across administrations especially over the past two decades .
Moreover , while case studies of Zionist influence over specific policy issues , such as the recent Congressional repudiation of the Goldstone Report and support for Israeli war crimes , are useful , the larger theoretical and empirical phenomenon of the growing chain of issues over ever more extended policy areas of interest to Israel ( and therefore the ZPC ) is ignored .
In a word , the problem of ZPC power in the US is not confined to a single issue lobby .
This narrow approach obfuscates the systemic role of the ZPC in effectively disenfranchising the great majority of the American wage and salaried people ( at the expense of their living standards ) , increasing war taxes for the middle class and blocking investment opportunities for corporate America in countries designated ( by Israel ) as “ security threats ” ( adversaries of Israeli colonial expansion ) .
The career patterns of leading Zionists include movers from business ( Wall Street , Corporate law firms ) to government ; another pattern involves Zionist academics who move to the executive branch and then on to corporate or Zionist think tanks .
Others follow a career combining academic – propagandist – journalist policy consultant positions , often prominent on the television political ‘ talk ’ shows .
The leading media moguls combine roles as CEO ’s – propagandists – and Israel advocates .
The overlap of career positions creates a network of shared ideologies , defined by ‘ what is best for Israel ’ ( Israel First ) .
The shared “ world view ” creates a cohesive group that sets the boundaries of US policy debate .
Congressional behavior , Executive policy makers and intellectual discourse are confined by these ZPC - determined parameters .
In effect pro-Israel career patterns and projections of power have established a kind of Judeo - Zionist hegemony of US public life .
Ethno-sizing Truth
One of the extreme manifestations of Zionist - Jewish hegemony is found in the fear and trepidation with which critics of Israeli policy approach the issue .
Most seek to “ Judaize ” any criticism , instead of seeking and citing truth , facts or analyses on their own merits .
They support their statements by citing Israeli sources and Jewish writers , even if earlier non-Jewish , non-Israeli writers and analysts have raised the same issues and may have provided a more systematic and consequential critique .
This “ tactic ” of seeking to play off critical Jews against the ZPC and Israel is debatable if not counter - productive , regressive and serves to re-enforce the pervasive fear of the ZPC .
The proponents of this approach , assuming they are not ignorant of non-Jewish critics , argue that by citing the Jewish background of the critics of Israel , they disarm the ZPC charge of “ anti-Semitism . ”
They further argue that by putting an ethnic ‘ spin ’ or ‘ ethnicizing ’ the critique they are responding to “ Jewish sensibilities ” and are more likely to get a hearing from Jews and their sympathizers .
These arguments are plausible but deeply flawed .
Committed Zionists , meaning the entire ZPC , dismiss Jewish and non-Jewish critics with equal ferocity : the former as “ self - hating Jews , ” the latter as “ anti-Semites . ”
Sacrificing truth and principled criticism to shield “ Jewish sensibilities ” means refraining from challenging their residual tribal sympathies to a ‘ Zion - centric ’ view of the world .
If the central problem is Zionist hegemony of US culture and especially foreign policy in the Middle East ( and wherever else Israel dictates ) , it ill behooves us to pander to amorphous ‘ special sensitivities ’ of the few Jewish dissidents who demand ethnically - based critiques .
Demystifying a Racial Doctrine
The big challenge for opponents of Judeo - Zionist hegemony is demystifying its ideological bases .
Zionists and their media camp followers always highlight “ Jewishness ” and the disproportionate number of notable , successful scientists and public figures with whom the Zionists self - identify ( even if the said individual have no identification with anything remotely “ Jewish ” beyond some distant ancestry ) .
In contrast , to highlight the “ Jewishness ” ( and Israel - centricity ) of notorious swindlers , spies , warmongers , gangsters , drug or arms traffickers is be labeled anti-Semitic .
Selective ethnic identity is crucial to maintaining and perpetuating the racist myth of Jewish superiority and the corollary of power and prestige , based on special meritorious qualities .
One of the key components of Zionist - Jewish ideology and Israeli power is precisely the racist myth of the Jewish moral and intellectual superiority – not the guns , money and backing of Washington and the ZPC ’s central location within the US elite social structure .
There are two options for those interested in demystifying Zionist - Jewish hegemony :
One could eliminate all ethnic labels or one could insist that labels be applied to all individuals including the most nefarious , grotesque and embarrassing .
Despite cracks in the Zionist monolith and the emergence of public critics within and without the Jewish community , especially among young former Jews , who prefer to assimilate with their fellow - citizens ( the passive majority ) , still up to a third of US Jews remain hard - core backers of the ZPC with Israel as their most enduring political loyalty .
While not discounting the psychological gratifications , which accompany beliefs in a mythical biblical past , there are real material benefits to joining the Israel First Power Configuration .
While it is true Zionists contribute money and time to promoting the Israeli agenda , there are also powerful material incentives , especially the benefits accruing from exclusive identification and membership in a cohesive configuration , which empowers its members , finances electoral campaigns and is well - connected among political leaders , as well as financial , real estate and insurance moguls .
The spinoffs and payoffs for upwardly mobile Zionist activists can be lucrative and career - enhancing .
Ambitious politicians , who measure up and toe the line , are likely to tap into substantial funding and favorable media coverage .
Networks , which work for Israel , enhance Jewish - Zionist prestige while providing emotional gratification and vicarious pleasure in sharing the thrill of Israel ’s bloody military victories and its forceful expansion of the “ fatherland . ”
Not a few careers have advanced through the “ contacts ” made at the national and regional Zionist meetings .
This is especially the case for many , otherwise mediocre , political candidates facing competitive elections .
Active membership in a powerful Zionist organization may protect the careers of lackluster , or even incompetent , performers in some academic or professional settings where the threat of a lawsuit charging anti-Semitism can ensure contract renewal .
Zionist racist ideology , with its implicit and explicit emphasis on Jews as “ special people ” ordained by God , as well as the media ’s bias toward presenting a selectively positive ethno- religious identity , provides symbolic gratification to lower middle class Jews , who sell Israel bonds , write letters to politicians , heckle critics of the Jewish state and march under the flag of Israel .
They are likely to play a role at the grassroots level in bullying family members , neighbors and colleagues to join the cause or refrain from voicing criticism of Israel .
Recently , more than a few Seders have led to family bust - ups over issues like the massacre of Palestinian civilians in Gaza , the Goldstone Report and the Ben-ami Kadish spy episode .
The success of the ZPC in projecting power and shaping US policy depends , in large part , on the financial clout of its millionaire financiers , its penetration of the state apparatus and the interlock of the corporate - political directorate .
However , equally important is the grassroots work of hundreds of thousands of middle and lower middle class activists .
The effective exercise of power by the Zionist elites is based on the vertical ties between the leaders and followers , especially in mobilizing for Israel ’s high priority campaigns promoting dubious causes – like Israeli repudiation of moderate US policies toward Jewish colonial settler expansion or calls for more restraint from killing civilians in Palestine and elsewhere .
It is highly unlikely that any changes can be induced among the Zionist elite ; but there are reasons to believe that some sections of the rank and file can be influenced by anti-Zionist Jews and non-Jews .
This is especially true at a time when Israeli political leaders have embraced such openly ultra-rightist postures .
Zionist Hegemony is Vulnerable
Several developments encourage the hope that these vertical links can be weakened .
Over the past five years , numerous articles , books and videos critical of Israel have broken through Zionist censorship .
Equally important , the emergence of new activist Jewish anti-Zionist organizations and the vast increase in member organizations supporting a boycott and divestment campaign against Israeli products , companies and cultural institutions have broken the ZPC stranglehold on public opinion .
Faced with growing opposition in civil society the ZPC has escalated its repressive efforts to ban publication of critical authors , fire academics and savage journalists and politicians .
Simultaneously a concerted effort has been made to encourage its ideological ‘ attack dogs ’ in academia suppress any critical discussion of the issues that most discredit the Israeli state , namely the recent Israeli massacres in Gaza , the brutal expansion of settlements in the West Bank , the Goldstone Report on Israeli war crimes and Israel ’s well - orchestrated push for war against Iran .
Zionist Intellectuals : In Defense of Terror
The ZPC has long established a near stranglehold on the major media outlets for opinion and analysis on the Middle East and especially on issues , which Israel ’s foreign office has given high priority .
As a result Israel First academics and pundits monopolize the editorial and opinion pages of the Washington Post , the Murdoch chain , the Wall Street Journal , the New York Times , the Los Angeles Times , the Chicago Tribune , Newsweek , and other print outlets .
The spread of Zionist extremism is evident in two recent feature articles published by Newsweek ( December 21 , 2009 ) , glorifying the neo - fascist head of the Israeli secret police , Mossad , Meir Dagan for his success in assassinating political adversaries in violation of national boundaries and his close ties with US Treasury official and Zionist zealot Stuart Levey , who is in charge of blackmailing Iran ’s trade and investment partners , in order to strangle the Iranian economy and impoverish seventy million of its people .
The Newsweek authors of these articles are rightwing Israel and US Zionists .
Notorious Zionist news anchors , like Ted Koppel and Wolf Blitzer , parrot the Israeli- ZPC line in the major media ( Fox News , CBS , NBC , ABC , CNN , BBC ) as well as secondary outlets ( National “ Public ” Radio ) .
The result is self - styled “ experts ” of dubious loyalty to the America , but with strong ties to Israel and Zionist propaganda institutes , grind out opinion pieces which defend the Israeli regime ’s most atrocious war crimes and land grabs .
Numerous professors from the most prestigious universities hack out op - ed pieces defending Israel ’s assault on Gaza , fabricating judicial precedents , and citing “ Just War ” theory .
Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu , when confronted by near universal support for the Goldstone Report , ordered the ZPC to denigrate Justice Goldstone , the basis and legality of the Report and falsify its contents .
When the extreme militarists , like Netanyahu , passed the word to Israel ’s mouthpieces in North America , they unleashed the ZPC ’s entire stable of academics , journalists and propagandists .
Over one hundred op - ed pieces in the major media savaged the Report , slandered Goldstone and defended Israeli terror attacks , which destroyed the entire human infrastructure of the Gaza .
No Israeli crime was too great to cause any Harvard , Yale , Princeton or John Hopkins Zionist academic to rethink their bind subordination to the Jewish state .
They parroted Netanyahu ’s line that the massacre over one thousand civilians and the brutalization of hundreds of thousands was an exercise of “ Israel ’s right to self - defense . ”
Few of the Jewish and non-Jewish academics , who dared to criticize Israel ’s terrorist policy , cited the weakest section of the Goldstone Report – its amalgamating Israel ’s all - out terror bombing of Palestinian neighborhoods , schools , hospitals , mosques and farms , with Hamas ’ futile and ineffective retaliatory rockets falling mostly on empty Israeli fields .
Few if any raised their voices against the domestic propaganda arm of Israeli war crimes – the Presidents of the 51 Major Jewish American Organizations .
Needless to say , with few domestic critics willing to even identify their opponents , the ZPC secured over 90 % of the US Congress in favor of Israel ’s repudiations of the Goldstone Report , which they had never even read .
What is striking about the vast majority of Zionist academic apologists of terrorism is their shoddy scholarship , their tendentious and illogical arguments and de-contextualized analogies .
Their ‘ persuasiveness ’ is based on the fact that their ‘ line ’ is reinforced by the mass media and enforced by the ZPC ’s political thuggery and character assassination of potential critics .
Their repeated presence in the media gives the appearance of legitimacy in defending violations of international law .
Their prestigious positions provide a veneer of expertise or knowledge even as their research in the region is based on flawed premises , including disproven religious legends and colonial mythology .
As Zionist academics become more deeply involved in justifying the expansionist Zionist claims , Israeli conquests and brutal militarism there is an accompanying marked deterioration of intellectual standards .
Over time prestigious positions become linked with mediocrity .
Academic degrees , awards and badges of merit are harnessed to hack writing and political hatchet jobs .
Noted critics , who exempt Israeli war crimes and terror , are still published by prestigious publishers , despite their shabby intellectual output .
Promotions and academic chairs are secured by eminently distinguished apologists of dubious morality .
Their blind support and defense of the practices of a terror state puts the lie to their claims to high ethical and scholarly standards .
The American Zionist academic elite fits Adorno ’s authoritarian personality : at the throat of the American polity and at the feet of the Israeli - ZPC elite .
Arrogant posturing , angry polemics and emotional ejaculations cover up for their lack of substantive arguments .
Where bullying fails , soothing rhetoric which speaks to values , dialogue and cooperation accompanies a blind eye to the relentless Israeli uprooting of Arab residents from Palestinian / Jerusalem .
Princeton academics cite classical political theorists in defense of gun-toting Jewish settlers who brutalize shepherds , threaten school girls and up - root centuries - old Palestinian olive groves .
The Globalization of Zionist Power
From the Israeli fatherland to the nerve centers of Zionist power in the US , using the experiences and drawing on the support of the ZPC , pro-Israel influence has spread to important political institutions in England , Canada , France , Netherlands , Russia and more recently South America .
In England , leaders and deputies from both the Conservative and Labor party accept millions in campaign funds from billionaire Zionists , paid junkets to Israel and other payoffs in exchange for supporting Israel ’s most egregious acts of violence in Lebanon , Gaza and the West Bank .
Zionist front groups like the “ Conservative Friends ( flunkeys ) of Israel ” and “ Labor Friends ( flunkeys ) of Israel ” ensure that the incumbent regimes and the opposition put Israeli trade and militarist interests at the center of British Middle East Policy .
In Canada under the Conservative Harper regime , Zionists have secured unprecedented influence and diplomatic and material support for Israel ’s top priorities .
These include support for the annexation of most of Palestinian East Jerusalem ; repudiation of the Goldstone Report ; support for Israeli war crimes during the 2008/09 invasion of Gaza ; Israel ’s invasion of Lebanon and pending legislation criminalizing criticism of Zionism as “ anti-Semitism ” among a host of other pro-Israel acts , decrees and trade privileges .
The opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties compete with the Conservatives in pandering to the pro-Israel power configurations in order to secure campaign financing from millionaire real estate , financial and media moguls .
In contrast , major Canadian trade unions and anti-Zionist Jewish campus and community organizations have organized boycotts of Israeli goods and academic organizations serving the bloody occupation .
In France , life - long Zionist zealot , Foreign Minister Bernard “ Bernie ” Kouchner , has embraced Netanyahu ’s extreme position of “ unconditional negotiations ” which allows massive land seizures and the construction of ‘ Jews - only ’ apartment complexes on illegally confiscated Palestinian land to continue while endless inconsequential “ peace ” negotiations take place .
This position has been supported by uber - Zionist Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton .
In Russia , eight of the top nine billionaire oligarchs have claimed dual Israeli citizenship .
They illegally and violently seized hundreds of billions of dollars worth of formerly state - owned mines , factories and banks , and then transferred part of their illicit fortunes to overseas banks in Israel , the US , London and the money - laundering offshore island states and tax - havens .
Zionist power peaked during the debauched Presidency of Yeltsin in the 1990’s , but residual influence is evident in the Putin - Mevedev regime .
This is particularly apparent in the US - Russian accords to increase sanctions on Iran , a policy that jeopardizes billions of dollars in Russian investments and trade with Iran .
Russia has resolutely refused to pressure Israel over its colonial settlement expansion .
In a similar manner , Israel retains a decisive influence over Holland and Germany ’s Middle East policy , via the exploitation of the Holocaust Memory , the Ann Frank legacy and the pressure of pro-Israel economic sectors .
The newest example of the “ globalization ” of Zionist power and the drive for new Israeli spheres of influence is found in Latin America .
Major US
Zionist organizations have contributed substantial financial resources to building , advising and orienting their counterparts , especially in Argentina , Brazil and Peru , while engaging in a systematic effort to curry favor with the US by demonizing President Chavez for his forthright defense of Palestinian rights and condemnation of Israel ’s crimes against humanity during its blitz of Gaza .
For these acts of courage the 51 US Jewish organizations branded Chavez an “ anti- Semitic ” , even going so far as to accuse him of fomenting an assault on a Jewish community center in Caracas .
When the arsonists were arrested , the assault was revealed to have been carried out by center employees hired by the local Jewish notables .
Global Zionism has targeted Argentina and Brazil .
Argentinean Jews have a history of ambiguous feelings toward the state of Israel and Zionism .
Early twentieth century Jews established farming and cattle ranches — the legendary “ Jewish Gauchos ” — while urban artisans and working class Jews were active in socialist , anarchist , communist and left - wing Yiddish organizations .
The mid-century generation ( 1940 - 60 ) of professionals , businesspeople , academics and bankers divided between leftist anti-Zionists and Zionists .
Both suffered attacks from the pro-fascist sectors of the dominant mass - based populist Peronist regime .
The 1960 ’s to 1970 ’s saw a profound generational split – characteristic of all Argentinean society – especially under the military dictatorships of ( 1966 - 1973 ) and ( 1976 - 82 ) .
A significant contingent of university - based students and professors , psychologists and professionals of Jewish ancestry joined urban guerrillas and radical mass movements and suffered “ disproportionate ” number of deaths by torture and ‘ disappearances . ’
During the worst years of terror , the Israeli government retained relations with the bloodiest of the military regimes ( Videla , 1976 ) , overlooking its anti-Semitic proclivities in order to trade in arms and military technologies .
At the same time , Israel promoted Jewish immigration to Israel , securing passage of Zionist and non-Zionist Jews to Israel .
The decimation of the generation of young non-Zionist Argentine revolutionaries of Jewish ancestry and the subsequent post - dictatorial neo-liberal electoral regimes , saw the rise of new groups of wealthy Argentine Zionist Jews who grew to dominate local community organizations .
They deepened ties with Israel and more recently established extensive links with the US ZPC .
Once again , however , under the pro-Israel Menem regime ( 1980 - 90 ) anti-Semitic terrorists bombed a major Jewish civic center killing and maiming scores of Jews in downtown Buenos Aires .
Investigations of police complicity were aborted by the Menem regime .
Israel ‘ overlooked ’ Menem ’s “ negligence ” and instead exploited Jewish fear to offer extremely favorable terms for Argentine Jews to immigrate ( including paid travel , subsidized housing in the occupied territories – education , jobs etc. ) .
The decline of left - wing activity during the1980 ’s and 1990 ’s was accompanied by the de-radicalization of secular Jewish offspring , especially in the professional classes .
With de-industrialization , Jews , who had formed the backbone of the previous progressive national bourgeoisie , turned to emigration , finance , real estate and Zionism .
The severe depression and financial crash of 2001 - 2002 led to the mass impoverishment of all Argentines ( poverty levels hit 50 % in December 2001 - 2002 ) including otherwise prosperous middle class Jews .
They joined the popular mass neighborhood assemblies calling for the return of their savings , the end of neo-liberal policies and politicians and the restoration of their jobs .
The subsequent economic recovery and commodity boom ( 2003 - 2008 ) led to a sharp de-radicalization and the ascendance of Jewish Zionist bankers , real estate and media moguls as principle leaders in the Argentine community .
Their influential role in business and the center - left Kirchner regime led to a shift toward closer relations with the ZPC – including increased efforts to include Israel as a member of the regional integration treaty MERCOSUR .
From the US side , the ZPC – especially the ADL and AIPAC , through their servile Secretary of State Clinton and US Congressional clients , fabricated an Islamic Iranian terrorist conspiracy in Latin America , especially in the region of the Argentine - Brazilian - Paraguayan frontier .
On October 27 , 2009 , Zionist Congressman Elliot Engle , head of the Subcommittee on Western Hemispheric Affairs of the Foreign Relations Committee , opened hearings focusing on “ Iran ’s expanding influence in Latin America , ” calling new trade ties between Iran and Brazil a threat to the region and the security of the US . ”
Faced with the leftist regimes in Venezuela , Bolivia and Ecuador opposed to US and Israeli colonial wars and with Brazil and Argentina ’s public opposing Israel ’s crimes in Gaza , Israel launched its US and Latin American agents on a propaganda blitz to counter the overwhelming public rejection of Israeli policies .
President Shimon Peres followed a disastrous failed tour by thuggish Zio- fascist Foreign Minister Lieberman , gaining trade and investment concessions in Brazil and Argentina .
Peres ’s visit benefited especially through the contacts and leverage of local millionaire and billionaire Zionist business leaders .
Nevertheless , Brazil , which has major trade and investment ties especially in gas and oil with Iran , has no intention of pandering to Israel .
In Argentina , the Zionist connection continues to limit any major openings to the Arab - Iranian investments .
Overall , the Zionist offensive and expanding local power base has resulted in mixed results : a major outflow of supporters in Venezuela and diminished influence in Bolivia and Ecuador .
In contrast , Zionists have increased their influence in Brazil and Argentina .
The enormous growth of Israeli power in Europe and the US , and the new Zionist offensive in Latin America is part of the “ globalization ” of Zionism .
But the process is not linear .
An especially hard sell for overseas Zionists are the repeated horrendous massacres by Israeli military forces , the blatant dispossession of Palestinians and the aggressive militarism pushed by the ZPC and Israel in the Middle East and South Asia .
As a result , public hostility is growing world - wide ; and there is a profound disconnect between the 80 % to 90 % Israeli Jews who defend Gaza war crimes and land seizures and the rest of the world .
This is evidenced by the United Nations General Assembly vote on the Goldstone Report , which was endorsed by an almost ten to one margin .
Moreover , in the case of the leftist regimes in Latin America , there is a significant reversal of Zionist influence .
There are equally important cracks in the Zionist monolith among North American Jews and former Zionist fellow travelers .
The continued “ failure of the nerve ” or “ intellectual treason ” of the American left academics and their “ Marxist ” journals to even discuss the role of the ZPC in making war policy has not stopped a breakthrough of Zionist critics , even in some mass media outlets .
Jewish - Zionist Cultural - Political Hegemony in the US
Jewish Zionist hegemony over the political narrative in the US has grown in recent years , evidenced by the support or , at most , tepid criticism , found in the major literary and political journals and magazines .
In the beginning the ZPC imposed their view that Israeli conquest and wars against the native people of Palestine and its Muslim neighbors was a war of “ national liberation ” or “ independence ” .
This first phase culminated with Jewish - Zionist success in convincing President Johnson to cover up Israel ’s bombing of the USS Liberty during the Seven Day War .
From 1970 - 90 , Zionist - Jewish hegemony extended from its traditional bastion in the film , TV and radio mass media to a whole series of former left - of - center and conservative weekly and monthly publications and the establishment of new publications on the far right .
The formerly liberal New Republic became a pulpit for virulent attacks on any critics of Israel .
Commentary , formerly a liberal cultural journal , became a mouthpiece for neo-conservative apologists of Israeli wars … and war crimes .
The conservative National Review moved firmly into the ‘ Israel First ’ camp , purging any critical dissent on Israel and its unconditional supporters in the US .
As Zionist hegemony in intellectual and popular cultural print and mass media was established , committed Israel - Firsters gained influential positions in US State Department and foreign policy apparatus .
“ Think Tanks ” , thinly veiled propaganda mills , produced pro-Israel position papers .
Their staff elbowed their way into the mass media as “ experts ” and into foreign policy advisory positions serving various politicians and Administrations .
They rose to the highest levels of government in the Clinton Administration and expanded further during the Bush - Obama regimes .
Zionist entry into key positions of structural political power mirrored their long march through the cultural institutions .
Their influence was reinforced by billionaire Jewish - Zionists ’ contributions to established think tanks , like the Brookings Institute , and to both political parties .
Contributions influenced the nominations and candidates for office from local mayors to the Presidency of the United States .
It is estimated that as high as 60 % of Democratic Party contributions came from Israel First benefactors , securing an automatic 90 % Congressional vote on whatever issue the Israeli Foreign Office marks as priority for its US Fifth Column .
With very rare exceptions neither liberal , progressive , radical or “ Marxist ” writers , academics , editors , journalists broach the issue of Zionist - Jewish cultural - political hegemony , nor its economic structural underpinnings .
The “ left ” is equally hegemonized by Zionist - Jewish influence , to the point that not a few join the vile ad hominem chorus slandering critics of the ZPC as “ veering on anti-Semitism . ”
Even today , at the end of the first year of the Obama regime , the Zionist presence in strategic positions in foreign policy making has been ignored by leftist and liberal critics of US Middle East policy .
Few , if any critics , look at the structural determinants of that policy .
One is more likely to find “ data ” in the business press .
For example , an article in the Financial Times , criticizing President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton ’s “ inconsistent ” position on Israeli settlements in Palestine ’s West Bank , points to the “ … problems with the administrations message – including its inconsistent policy on Israel - Palestine – can be traced back to the White House , where Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel ( dual Israeli - US citizen ) keeps a firm grip on foreign policy .
Some ex-diplomats say they have never seen power so centralized … Mrs. Clinton ’s own deputy , Jim Steinberg , is widely perceived as a White House enforcer , who polices even relatively minor policy statements that often leaves State Department spokesmen ( sic ) mouthing near meaningless talking points . ”
Emanuel has been active in the Israeli military and is suspected of ties to its spy agency ( MOSSAD ) .
Steinberg is just a high powered “ native born ” Israel Firster , marginalizing the State Department from any alternative policies to pandering to Israel and its US Fifth Column .
Hegemonized American liberals and leftists maintain their “ support ” for Israel on the basis of the fiction that the “ bad ” Israelis are the fanatical Likud party leaders while Labor and Kadima party leaders and the Israeli people want peace and a just settlement .
Unfortunately for these supporters of “ progressive ” Zionism , the Defense Minister Barak who directed the bloody massacre in Gaza is the leader of the Labor Party and is backed by his party in support of all the new aggressive Israeli land seizures and colonial settlements .
The genocidal wars and violent settlements have the support of the vast majority of the Israeli Jewish population .
Public opinion polls carried out by the Israel National News published in mid-November 2009 reveals that 53.2 % of Israeli ’s say the solution to the conflict with the Palestinian people is their forceful dispossession and ethnic cleansing – “ transfer ” is the Zionist euphemism for a crime against humanity .
Such are the “ just wars ” receiving unconditional support by the ‘ 51 ’ Presidents of the Major American Jewish Organizations .
The point is that not even the Israeli - Jewish majority ’s embrace of a totalitarian final solution shakes Zionist hegemony in the US .
The embrace of inconvenient positions , such as genocide approval , is not publicized in the Zionist mass media .
Instead we continue to hear the chattering classes mouthing the clichés of a “ dialogue ” and “ negotiated solution ” between the expropriators and the dispossessed .
The question of Zionist cultural and political hegemony , where it is even been acknowledged by non-Jews and Jews , revolves around several mistaken partially distorted conceptions .
One key idea held by anti-Semites and Zionists alike is that Jews possess special qualities ( “ blood ” or “ genetic ” ) .
Many cite the importance of a Jewish historical tradition , which emphasizes education and learning .
Others still , claim success and power comes from knowledge , merit and achievement .
Recent studies refute the idea of a special , unique Jewish “ gene pool ” – as most contemporary Ashkenazi Jews are descendants of Central Asian Khazari converts to Judaism in the 8th Century A.D. , who subsequently were pushed into Eastern Europe and beyond by the Mongols .
Israelis are not descendants of the ancient Jews of Israel , many of whom converted to Christianity and later Islam and whose descendants are most certainly the modern - day Palestinians ( as conceded by early Zionists myth - makers , like David Ben- Gurion ) .
Secondly , for over one thousand years Jewish “ scholarship ” revolved around sterile debates and exegeses of the minutiae of the Talmud and bodies of law based on religious myths .
Critical philosophers like Spinoza were looked at as renegades .
The rise of scholarship and scientific thinking among Jews coincided with the growth of the Enlightenment and the establishment of liberal laws , which opened doors for promising Jewish scholars , scientists to break out of the sterile confines of the Rabbinal intellectual ghettos .
Many of the great thinkers were called “ Jews ” because of their ancestry , like Spinoza , Karl Marx and Leon Trotsky although they did not practice Judaism nor identify as “ Jews . ”
Recognition and success of Jews came from business and financial activity as well as from occupations like money managers in the West and overseers of feudal lords in Poland .
A Jewish authored scholarly history of the Jewish people was not written till the 19th century and even then it treated biblical legends as fact .
Equally questionable is the notion that the rise of Jewish - Zionist hegemony is a product of “ merit ” or “ achievement . ”
But here we must distinguish between the mass of Jews who occupy middle or lower middle - class positions in society and those few individuals who have made major contributions .
Moreover , it is important to not confuse the rise of individuals to economic power through the exploitation of labor , the extraction of rent from tenants and speculation and achievement through “ merit , ” namely , skills applied to advancing knowledge for the greater good of working people .
Zionists ’ “ superior race ” theorists lump successful Wall Street speculators with innovative scholars as examples of “ Jewish superiority ” justifying or “ explaining ” hegemony .
Zionist race theories , which claim a homogeneous ‘ Jewish ’ people bound by common history and horizontal and vertical ties , is more an ideological manifesto ignoring profound class and even ideological divisions ( at least in the past and perhaps emerging today ) .
Jewish - Zionist hegemony in the US is the result of a supra or meta- historical mythology with mystical religious foundations in the Old Testament .
The rise of American Zionism is tied to a virulent exclusivist tribal religious loyalty to Israel as the “ mother state . ”
The driving force of US Zionism is the subordination of US civil society organizations and the instrumentalization of the US military and economic resources to service Israeli colonial expansion and projections of power in the Middle East .
What needs to be understood is that the present subjection of our Middle East policy to the Zionist Power Configuration is a result of the latter ’s accumulation of power and political - cultural conditions within the US , which weakened the articulation of alternative values and policies and a defense of American working class interests embodied in a democratic foreign policy .
The Decline of US National Identity and Working Class Politics
The rise of Zionism , as a virulent form of tribal - religious identity linked to a foreign state and its successful exercise of hegemony within US society , has been facilitated by the abdication by the US ruling class ‘ establishment ’ of any ‘ national ’ identity and its interlocking economic ties with Zionist power brokers in strategic economic sectors .
The “ globalization ” of US capitalism , the process of world wide empire building , has shifted the focus of the US ruling class toward international issues , as the center of its concerns , even as it intervenes in domestic economic policies to secure state protection , subsidies and bailouts , none which trespass on Zionist priorities .
Going “ global ” and the emergence of “ global consciousness ” has worked against challenging the Zionist pursuit of the colonial agenda of the state of Israel .
The ZPC has filled a ‘ power vacuum ’ left by the ‘ globalized elite ’ and has been able to instill and impose a Zionist conception of US “ national interest ” relatively uncontested .
The rise of the Zionist business elites into the top echelon of investment banking , financial institutions , real estate and insurance led to the inter-mixing of Zionist and non-Zionist members of the ruling class , in which one side had a deep and abiding political commitment to Israel , while the other sector gave exclusive primacy to the accumulation of wealth and guaranteeing that state economic policy ensured profits , a deregulated financial sector and bank bailouts , policies which they shared with their Zionist partners .
Given the low salience of Israeli politics , the non-Zionist sectors of the ruling class were not willing or able to engage in a fight with their Zionist financial colleagues .
However , there are divisions , both in government and within policy advisory bodies , over Zionist control .
As mentioned earlier , the 16 major intelligence agencies issued a report on Iran ’s nuclear program in late 2007 , which debunked the Israeli - Zionist claims of an active Iranian nuclear weapons program .
Likewise a Pew Foundation Study of the Council on Foreign Relations , taken between October 2 - November 16 , 2009 , found that over two - thirds of its members ( 67 percent ) believe the US favored Israel too much – yet the same percentages claimed Obama is “ striking the right balance ” and “ Iran is a major threat to US interest . ”
What is striking about these ‘ dissident ’ opinions within the policy elite is that they have had no impact on Obama ’s subservience to Israel on all major issues promoted by the ZPC .
Whatever the CFR “ really thinks ” has not “ really ” affected the power of the ZPC to shape policy via its stooges in Congress and its assets in State ( Clinton ) and Treasury ( Stuart Levey ) .
In other words , Zionist power at the top is uncontested and free to work the lower echelons of the political system and class structure for its own interest .
This includes the wholesale purchase of political parties and the retail buyout of congressional politicians on key foreign policy committees .
The latter is facilitated by the success of the Israel First Political Action committees ( PAC ) which promotes the selection of Zionist Congress people to key committee posts .
Four of the top fifteen Congress people funded by Wall Street speculators are Zionists .
Eleven of the top fifteen are Democrats , who receive 60 % of their contributions from Zionist multi-millionaires in Los Angeles , New York , and south Florida and other metropolitan centers .
The political class , party leaders , executive and congress people , have also eschewed pro-American working class economic policies , endogenous growth and the avoidance of foreign entanglements ( interventionism ) .
The political class – particularly its dominant sector – favors military driven empire building – undermining any popular democratic definition of ‘ national interest ’ .
Moreover , the military nature of empire building resonates with the Zionist - Israeli projection of regional military power and hegemony .
Military - driven imperialism weakens any effort to develop alternative US overseas economic interests and policies , especially with Moslem and Middle East oil countries , to counter Israeli - Zionist policies designed to privilege Israeli military expansion and colonial interests .
If the majority of the US ruling class has surrendered to the Zionist definitions of US Middle East policy , and facilitated the rise of Zionist hegemony , the decline of the values embedded in working class solidarity and defense of republican virtues and interests has opened the door for the minority of Zionist cadres to influence mass culture and civil society organizations and divert American trade union pension funds to Israeli investments with no opposition .
For decades , predominantly Afro-American and Hispanic female workers in garments , textiles and related activities have been members of trade unions run by Zionist functionaries , who channeled hundreds of millions of member pension funds and dues into purchasing Israel bonds , rather than building co-operative housing as was done previously when the union workers were mostly Jews .
Many current ( minority ) leaders of trade unions and Afro-Hispanic ethnic organizations have been co-opted by the ZPC though junkets to Israel and subject to propaganda campaigns promoting Israeli interests .
In universities , municipal politics , professional associations , Israel Firsters operate to stifle any debate , let alone criticism , of Israeli war crimes .
Zionists in America are the most pernicious force eliminating debate on American democratic foreign policy options in the Middle East and favoring unconditional submission to Israel .
Millions of individuals , who may question the “ Israel First ” option , are frightened , intimidated and / or unwilling to face the onslaught of organized , zealous Zionist - Jewish notables , who can and will influence their employers and jeopardize their jobs and promotions .
Conclusion : Alternatives to Zionist Hegemony
In other countries , especially where independent class conscious trade unions , autonomous and organized anti-Zionist professional and academic groups exist , Zionist power in civil society is contested , challenged and its heinous blackballing of critics is weakened .
Where internationalist movements are strong , as in support for Palestinian resistance to Israeli colonialism , the local ZPC has not been able to use their economic power and media ownership to impose their hegemony over civil society .
This is especially true in those locales where the international solidarity movement is active in impacting society .
While there are pockets of international solidarity among some universities and trade unions in the US , especially the dock and warehouse workers in San Francisco , the major potential counterweight to Zionist Israel First hegemony in the US would be in a revival of patriotic working class consciousness .
America ’s “ special relation ” with Israel has been at an enormous cost to the working class , amounting to over $ 1.5 trillion dollars in foreign aid , loan guarantees , hijacked technological innovations , lost overseas investment opportunities , not to mention the wars on Israel ’s behalf and the lost lives in fighting Israel ’s war in Iraq .
There is a ‘ material base ’ for a mass patriotic working people ’s revolt against the crass submission of the entire political class to the ZPC and its patrons in Tel - Aviv .
But today , tens of millions of Americans are disillusioned with “ patriotic ” appeals , whose purpose is to promote imperial wars ( including ironically wars for Israel ) at the expense of their living standards .
Right wing pro-capitalist politicians use patriotic rhetoric to deflect attention from the domestic failures of capitalism and the massive transfers of wealth to Goldman - Sachs and other Wall Street speculators .
The devaluation of “ patriotism ” is evident in the right wing ’s perverse manipulation of ‘ nationalism ’ to turn native born workers against immigrant workers , instead of against the ZPC ’s costly pro-Israel agenda .
This , in turn , hinders the growth of a national popular movement against the Wall Street speculators at home and the wars for Israel and Empire abroad .
What is striking about the lack of mass based movements against Wall Street is the fact that literally less than 5 % of the population even trusts the financial sector .
A vast outpouring of letters and protests denounced Obama ’s initial bank bailout plan , forcing a temporary postponement .
Unorganized mass resentment persists and is smoldering , waiting for effective popular organization .
Likewise , family and relatives of the Zionist power configuration , in and out of the government , who promote US wars for Israel in the Middle East , are rarely to be found in the Armed Forces , least of all at the frontlines ( or for that matter in any war zone ) .
If we exclude non-Zionist Jews – mostly immigrants from the former Eastern Bloc and USSR – the figure would be one - thirtieth of one percent .
It is a biting irony that more American Zionists are more eager to join the Israeli ‘ Defense ’ Forces than to put on an American uniform .
Yet Zionists in public office , in the Pentagon , executive branch and the White House , who design and promote war policies and military - driven sanctions , are in the forefront of shedding American working class lives , especially now when jobless American workers , including many minorities , are forced to seek employment in the military .
A soldier ’s anti-war movement could be organized and energized under the banner : “ A Zionist war is a not the American workers ’ fight ” if the left and pacifists were not so beholden to their Jewish colleagues ‘ sensibilities . ”
The anti-war leaders have been reluctant to raise the issue of the Zionist / Israeli influence in promoting US war policies .
Genuine patriotic solidarity is weak at the top and bottom , lacking any meaningful recall of our anti-colonial , anti-slavery , anti-imperialist and anti-fascist identity .
In contrast , the Zionist fifth column is driven by a powerful mythological - tribal race - driven identity , which in some cases is religious driven and in others embedded in a deep - rooted secular sense of racial superiority .
Israeli hegemony , embedded in a Zion - centric cultural universe , has not been challenged by Anglo - America ’s flaccid intellectuals .
Their intellectual cowardice is covered by a thin veneer of “ cosmopolitan ” impotence .
Their pusillanimous silence and even complicity is intended to ‘ protect the sensitivities ’ of their Zionist colleagues regarding any forthright critique of Zionist power in America .
Only a revived working class movement , which recovers its historical memory of class solidarity and inspires the popular imagination with an independent American republic free from foreign dictates , will be able to displace Zionist hegemony and Wall Street pillage .
Our study raises several central questions that need to be addressed by Americans concerned about Zionist power and hegemony over public debate regarding US wars for Israel in the Middle East .
Can we oppose Israeli war crimes and expansion and US government support of Israel by confronting the ZPC ?
Can we open a debate on US , Middle East policy by fighting Zionist authoritarianism , witch hunts and hate crimes ?
Can we discuss and propose a democratic foreign policy , which opposes military intervention , sanctions and economic blockades , by tackling American militarists and Israel ’s foreign agents ?
If we answer in the affirmative , what can be done ?
What practical measures can be pursued and supported ?
We can educate the American public about the Obama regime ’s charade – of talking peace to the American people while supporting the Israeli war machine ; of talking about an evenhanded Middle East policy while appointing committed Zionists to top policy positions .
We can demand the Justice Department enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act toward the ‘ 51 Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations ’ and especially AIPAC .
We should oppose all dual citizens ’ appointments to key policy - making posts .
We should demand that Undersecretary of Treasury and Israel Firster Stuart Levey be investigated and prosecuted for gross malfeasance of office for his refusal to investigate the illegal billion - dollar money laundering operations by US Zionists in the funding of illegal Jewish settlements in the West Bank and for his promotion of economic sanctions against trade with Iran , which have cost US workers thousands of jobs and the crippled US economy billions of dollars in lost trade .
We should oppose military and economic aid to Israel , especially when the average per capita income of Israeli ’s exceeds that of 40 % of Americans .
We should demand the end of trade privileges for Israel in light of the US ’ multi-billion dollars trade deficit with Israel , which has destroyed tens of thousands of American jobs in industry and services .
We should combat widespread Zionist hate propaganda , organized and publicized by the ZPC , against Muslin Americans and Arab American , their cultural foundations and charities .
We should demystify Zionist claims that the Jews ’ ancestral homeland is Israel , rather then North Africa and Central Asia , and that there is no historic basis for the Right of Return .
We should support the class and popular struggle against finance , real estate and insurance billionaires ( Wall Street ) for their pillage of the American economy and exploitation of American workers and for their corruption of American politicians to serve their interests and US and Israeli war aims .
Most of the region ’s doctors , along with large hospitals , trauma and birthing centers , are on the Vermont side .
Larry Tuner of Moriah , N.Y. , said his wife was scheduled for surgery in Vermont soon  which will mean hours of driving or riding the ferry to see her .
A temporary ferry will start running from the bridge site in late January , and a new bridge is scheduled to be finished by the summer of 2011 , said John Zicconi , a spokesman for the Vermont Agency of Transportation .
Many residents say the timeline is too slow to help businesses that are suffering now .
“ We lost our life ’s blood , ” Ms. Cloutier said of Vermonters .
“ They lost their life ’s line , ” she said of New York residents .
It used to take Carole St. Pierre about a half hour to get to her job at B. F. Goodrich in Vergennes , Vt. , from her home in Crown Point , N.Y .
Now she wakes up around 3 a.m. to drive to a shuttle bus that takes her to a ferry that leaves at 6 a.m .
She leaves work at 3:30 p.m. , then reverses the trip , arriving home after 5 p.m .

Climatologists had no idea what the temperature would be in the year 2000
…
Looking back in 1981 , the world had just barely started warming , despite years of rising CO2 levels .
…
Three decades later they still admit privately that they do n’t understand the climate
…
It ’s hard to do the full Timeline justice on a small screen .
One day , in historical exhibitions , I hope this chart will be exhibited to help people dissect just how the global warming scam grew , and to help teach children what to look for , to minimize the damage from the next exaggerated claim of catastrophe before it grows so large .

Number of death sentences falls to 106 , seventh straight year the number has fallen and sharply down on high of 328 in 1994
The number of death sentences imposed by US courts has fallen because of a growing number of exonerations through DNA testing , according to a report by a prominent anti-death penalty group .
The Death Penalty Information Centre in Washington says judges and juries imposed fewer death sentences over the past 12 months than at any time since the restoration of execution in 1976 .
This year 106 death sentences have been passed , the seventh straight year the number has fallen and sharply down on the high of 328 in 1994 .
Richard Dieter , DPIC 's director and author of the report , said the fall reflected growing concern over the reliability of convictions .
" The principal reason is the innocence cases , the exonerations , people getting out because of DNA testing .
" People read about these exonerations , people walking out of prison 20 years after the crime .
Jurors are convicting but giving life sentences not the death penalty . "
DPIC said nine condemned men were exonerated in 2009 , the second highest number of exonerations since the death penalty was reinstated .
The Innocence Project says that overall 245 convicts have subsequently been cleared by DNA evidence across the US .
Yesterday a man was released after 35 years in prison for raping a child .
James Bain was sentenced to life for kidnapping and raping a nine - year - old boy who identified him from a photograph .
A judge ordered the 54 - year - old to be freed after DNA testing cleared him of the crime .
Dieter said the decline in death sentences was particularly pronounced in the two states that carry out the most executions , Texas and Virginia .
A decade ago Texas was imposing 34 death sentences a year .
This year it imposed nine .
In Virginia the number fell to one this year from an average of six a year in the 1990s .
The economic climate had also contributed , Dieter said , because prosecutors were increasingly hesitant to spend the millions of dollars it often takes to secure a death penalty conviction when spending by many states is being cut .
The number of executions rose to 52 this year , a sharp increase on the year before , because of the lifting of the de facto moratorium while the supreme court considered the legality of lethal injection .
Half of the executions were in Texas .
But the total number was still down by nearly half from 10 years ago .
Speaking for the desperate housewives of New Jersey , former NJ governor Jim McGreevey 's ex-wife Dina Matos , told a crowd at the Zonta Club in Mountain Lakes that the legislature was right to reject marriage equality :
“ We have the civil union law in place , which I think is wonderful .
I was raised a Catholic .
I grew up in the church , so I believe in traditional marriage between a man and a woman . "
Added Matos : " There are at least two million marriages that break up each year
because one of the spouses come out of the closet .
You do n’t understand
unless you live it .
When you ’re living with someone who has a secret , they take every measure possible to hide it . "
What Matos apparently failed to convey to the crowd was that if homosexuality was more accepted in society ( i.e. marriage equality ) , it would spare untold amounts of marriages doomed because the husband is in the closet but suddenly realizes he wants to be openly gay , and after coming out subjects his ex-spouse to years of self doubt .
Ahem .

Many of the letters are to Van Gogh 's younger brother Theo With a new edition of the letters of Vincent van Gogh getting the art world very excited , Vincent Dowd visits a small town in France , where the artist painted some of his most famous works .
There are just a handful of opportunities left this year to take the Van Gogh Express from the Gare du Nord out beyond the northern suburbs of Paris to Auvers - sur - Oise .
The train is not actually called the Van Gogh Express but that is what it is .
Because from spring to the end of October - on Saturdays , Sundays and National Holidays - the 0956 non -stop service takes the day - trippers , art - lovers and shameless Van Gogh groupies to Auvers to see two things : the little auberge , or inn , where in July 1890 Vincent lay dying after he shot himself , and the cemetery where he has lain ever since .
Fitting monument Vincent spent the last 70 days of his life in the little town .
It was already an artist 's colony - quiet , but not too far from Paris .
It had a homeopathic doctor , Paul Gachet , who befriended Vincent and other painters such as Cezanne and Renoir .
In 1990 , one of Vincent 's portraits of Dr Gachet fetched over $ 80 m ( £ 48 m ) at auction in New York .
How it would have astounded the artist , who at the auberge was pretty much painting a picture a day .
Van Gogh 's room at the Ravoux Inn is kept virtually empty How Dominique Janssens came to own the Auberge Ravoux would make a drama in itself .
Suffice to say that in 1985 , as a young Belgian - born biscuit executive with a lifetime of retail opportunity ahead , he was sitting in a stationary car just outside the inn , when another vehicle hit him at very high speed .
Much later Mr Janssens , aware he was lucky to be alive , spotted a mention in the police accident report of Auvers ' Van Gogh connection .
He decided to buy the building Vincent had died in and fashion from it a fitting monument to one of the world 's great painters .
Now some 70,000 people a year traipse up the creaky stairs to see the small and irregularly shaped attic room where Vincent lived and died .
" We could have at least twice that , " Dominique Janssens told me , " but it 's a place of pilgrimage as well as tourism " .
A large number of Japanese in particular want their ashes scattered over Vincent 's grave - for much of the year the thick ivy covering it carries a light coating of grey
He visited houses of the famous all over Europe to pick up tips on how the Van Gogh House might operate .
Finally he found somewhere which evoked for him a sense of the previous occupant - the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam .
One simple thing there struck him , and as a result Vincent 's room is kept virtually empty .
That way people have to supply their own thoughts and images .
Big in Japan
A trip to Auvers prompts questions about the painter 's last days
Of the 70,000 visitors a year , a large number are Japanese .
Van Gogh has long been popular in Japan - perhaps because for a time he was interested in Japanese art .
But there is a practical reason too .
Auvers is convenient for Charles de Gaulle Airport and long - haul tourists often turn up jet - lagged direct from their flight rather than struggle into Paris in the rush hour .
And quite a large number of Japanese in particular want their ashes scattered over Vincent 's grave .
For much of the year , the thick ivy covering it carries a light coating of grey .
Vincent 's body was placed in a coffin made by the carpenter who had been supplying his picture frames .
Some of the works painted in Auvers were arrayed around him and some were given away .
He was put in a common grave with a 15 - year lease .
Later there was money to move the body to a better spot , which is where he lies now , his brother Theo beside him .
Wheatfield with Crows
The cemetery is a 10 or 15 minute walk outside Auvers - past the church and up a track into open fields .
There is a chirp of pewits and crows caw .
Many claim the dramatic Wheatfield with Crows was Van Gogh 's last work
Enlarge Image
Like many I had looked at the well - known Wheatfield with Crows - one of Vincent 's final works - and seen death in the birds ' black and swirling presence .
Or did he simply paint what he saw on a blustery afternoon in the fields above the town ?
Leaving Auvers I meet Dominique Janssens again .
He tells me I have been lucky to get the cemetery to myself for a few minutes .
And he says that his 20 years in Auvers have persuaded him that those who hit the Van Gogh trail are seeking the truth , not about his life , but about their own .
In a secular age , has Vincent 's suffering now attained a quasi- religious status for some visitors ?
A trip to the town prompts other questions too .
Did Vincent really mean to kill himself ?
Was the Auvers countryside a balm to his soul or did it deepen his isolation ?
Did those crows really presage death ?
But Vincent van Gogh was a great painter - none greater , some think .
Maybe all we really need to know about him is there already in oils and canvas .

WASHINGTON  The House approved a Democratic plan on Friday to tighten federal regulation of Wall Street and banks , advancing a far - reaching Congressional response to the financial crisis that rocked the economy .
After three days of floor debate , the House voted 223 to 202 to approve the measure .
It would create an agency to protect consumers from abusive lending practices , set rules for the trading of some of the sophisticated financial instruments that fueled the crisis , and take steps to reduce the threat that the failure of one or two huge banks or investment firms could topple the entire economy .
Whether all of those measures will become law , however , is uncertain because the Obama administration wants certain revisions and the Senate will not take up its version of the legislation until next year .
The Democratic authors of the House legislation hailed the bill as the biggest change in oversight of Wall Street since the Great Depression , and said they believed they had struck a careful balance between protecting the public and the economy while not stifling economic growth and market forces .

Here ’s an interesting story at Consumerist about Jackie Ramos , a Bank of America employee in the collections department , who was fired for giving too many people fix pay programs , and recorded a youtube video on it ( Consumerist has a transcript ) .
Fix Pay is an interesting program .
From Jackie ’s video :
There is something we have in my department called a Fix Pay .
Essentially it is a program that turns your balance into an installment loan .
It stops all fees on the account , and it also closes your account .
In order to get a Fix Pay , though , you have to qualify by answering a rather irrelevant set of questions , like how much you spend on groceries and how much your cellphone bill is .
Day in day out I had to deny countless people who needed the program but did n’t qualify .
Too often I would have to give them the spiel about , “ I ca n’t accept you [ into the program ] because your disposable income is too negative , ” and then they would just sit there on the phone and say , “ Well , if I could afford to pay my bill , why would I need a program ? ”
When I first heard about Fix Pay type programs , I assumed banks would be rushing to take advantage of this kind of structure in this recession , as it kills a line of credit ( most banks have been wanting to extend less credit ) , and turns a highly unlikely to get paid credit card debt by a distressed borrower into something manageable .
And 6 % at a point where Treasuries are at zero seems like a great money deal .
Now note what Jackie Ramos says here : people are too risky for fix pay , and that ’s why they are being denied .
The obvious problem is that if they are too risky at 6 % , they are almost certainly too risky at 30 % with fees .
We looked at some of the theory of where a credit card interest rate comes from before .
The idea that it reflects your credit rating accurately seems false from a quantitative point of view .
The best theory readers and I came up with was that it was a signal to pay off the balance right away .
That converges on another good theory I was unaware of , a “ Sweat Box ” theory , where the idea is just to try and get as much money as possible out of costumers upfront , and be indifferent about discharging the rest under bankruptcy later .
Before I started crunching numbers , I had no idea how profitable that strategy would be , and thus how much sense it makes from a business point of view .
Numbers time :
You work at a collections agency .
Someone calls you with $ 2,000 in credit card debt ; they are paying 30 % interest from missing a payment , and they are having trouble making the minimum 3 % payment , and are racking up a $ 50 late fee every other month .
You are confident that they will default in X months , and not pay a penny of the remaining balance .
You could give them a Fix Pay loan , which would be a 6 % annual interest , no more fees , that they would pay off over 4 years with 100 % certainty .
At what X , if it exists , is it more profitable to deny them the Fix Pay loan ?
And what is the remaining balance on the credit card ?
Here ’s a quick google spreadsheet exercise , which shows ( with an appropriate 3 % cost of capital , or discount rate , as indicated in credit card literature ) , that in this example X is 22 months , with $ 1,250 on the balance .
To make that clear , rather than having the consumer pay off the full loan over 4 years with 100 % certainty at 6 % and no fees , it ’s more profitable to charge 30 % interest and fees for 2 years and then simply forget about the $ 1,250 that is still on the balance when the consumer finally goes under .
Anything more you could get out of them , in court or with a few more minimum payments , is gravy .
[ Edit : Numbers cleaned up after document missed one payment ; even stronger conclusions , with 22 months instead of 24 , and $ 1,250 instead of $ 1,205 . ]
This out - of - the - money - put on consumers is one thing that makes credit cards so crazy .
Here is a conservative meme ; put people who are in over there heads on credit card debt on a rational mechanism to pay it off .
The credit line is cut as a penalty , and 6 % is a high enough rate to make a profit for the business .
Setting up a payment structure that makes the person responsible for paying off their entire balance in an orderly way gives good incentives to be a responsible user of credit going forward .
And yet the ability of credit card companies , without any type of limits on fees or usury laws , to profit from sweating consumers and then forgetting about whatever is left when they are exhausted is so large , that creating innovations and aligning incentives to get people into these good behaviors goes right out the window .
Instead the innovations and incentives run in the opposite direction .
‘ Red Mocho Kooler ‘ is drink referenced by Dr. Venture in The Venture Bros. episode ORB .
To our surprise we could not find anything on this odd drink concoction on the internet .
We actually had to review the episode commentary for the ingredients listed below .
Doc Hammer :
This is how it ’s done .
You get Kahlúa and you put in Hershey ’s syrup and it ’s thick , almost undrinkable .
And then you just sprinkle a dash of red Kool - Aid on the top .
Do n’t stir it , so it just remains thick and undrinkable .
So that there is a little bit of Kool - Aid just as a covering … a little crispy skin .
That is a Red Mocho Kooler , it ’s supposed to be disgusting and undrinkable .
Jackson Publick :
That ’s a joke that ’s been waiting to be told for a couple of seasons too .
Doc Hammer :
We always fantasize that Doc makes up his own drinks and their horrible !
Jackson Publick :
It started out as a Chocotini .
Doc Hammer : A Chocotini and also one with Gatorade .
RED MOCHO KOOLER RECIPE

No explanation on the website .
No one at the company answering phones .
The 200 or so employees at Arrow Trucking 's headquarters were told to pack up their belongings and go home Tuesday morning , according to the Tulsa World .
The only acknowledgement was a brief recorded message on the company 's main phone number , asking drivers of its Freightliner and Kenworth trucks to turn their rigs in to the nearest dealer and to call a special hotline to arrange for a bus ticket home .
Drivers of the company 's Navistar trucks were told to call back for more information .
" I would n't say it 's typical , but I would n't say it 's unheard of " for a trucking company to lay off workers in such a fashion , says Alan Bristol , a truck driver in Fort Collins , Colo. , who was laid off earlier this year .
The difference is that more than 95 percent of such failures involve companies with fewer than 20 trucks .
The apparent failure of Arrow Trucking , with some 1,400 flatbed trucks and 2,600 trailers operating throughout the US , created much bigger ripples throughout the industry .
" A company this size would normally go into this bankruptcy in a little bit more orderly manner , " Mr. Bristol says .
Information about the company 's fate remains scarce .
In February , the company laid off 32 administrative workers , about 2 percent of its workforce , citing a soft economy .
Because trucking firms operate on low margins , several hundred exit the business each year .
Socked by high fuel prices in 2008 , a whopping 3,065 trucking companies with five or more drivers went under .
This year , the industry has lost 1,255 firms through the third quarter , a pace which is a little better than in 2007 .
But " the trucking industry is still in the worst slowdown since the Depression , " writes Clayton Boyce , spokesman for the American Trucking Associations ( ATA ) , in an e-mail .
In October , the ATA 's truck tonnage index – a number that measures the amount carried on trucks for a given month – fell slightly from a month earlier .
Truck freight volumes are down 20 percent to 30 percent from what they were less than two years ago , he adds .
Uefa have banned CSKA Moscow duo Alexei Berezutski and Sergei Ignashevich for one game each .
Berezutski and Ignashevich will each miss one game
Uefa have banned CSKA Moscow duo Alexei Berezutski and Sergei Ignashevich for one game each for failing doping tests .
European football 's governing body revealed last week that the pair had violated doping regulations after last month 's UEFA Champions League draw with Manchester United .
Berezutski and Sergei Ignashevich both missed last week 's win over Besikitas as Uefa looked into the incident .
They have now decided to ban the pair for one match and have also fined CSKA £ 22,000 over the incident .
It means Berezutski and Ignashevich will miss the first leg of their last 16 encounter in February .
You can follow the draw for the knockout stages of the Champions League onandon Friday morning .
The Pentagon pays an average of $ 400 to put a gallon of fuel into a combat vehicle or aircraft in Afghanistan .
The statistic is likely to play into the escalating debate in Congress over the cost of a war that entered its ninth year last week .
ADVERTISEMENT
Pentagon officials have told the House Appropriations Defense Subcommittee a gallon of fuel costs the military about $ 400 by the time it arrives in the remote locations in Afghanistan where U.S. troops operate .
“ It is a number that we were not aware of and it is worrisome , ” Rep. John Murtha ( D - Pa. ) , the chairman of the House Appropriations Defense panel , said in an interview with The Hill .
“ When I heard that figure from the Defense Department , we started looking into it . ”
The Pentagon comptroller ’s office provided the fuel statistic to the committee staff when it was asked for a breakdown of why every 1,000 troops deployed to Afghanistan costs $ 1 billion .
The Obama administration uses this estimate in calculating the cost of sending more troops to Afghanistan .
The Obama administration is engaged in an internal debate over its future strategy in Afghanistan .
Part of this debate concerns whether to increase the number of U.S. troops in that country .
The top U.S. general in Afghanistan , Stanley McChrystal , reportedly has requested that about 40,000 additional troops be sent .
Democrats in Congress are divided over whether to send more combat troops to stabilize Afghanistan in the face of waning public support for the war .
Any additional troops and operations likely will have to be paid for through a supplemental spending bill next year , something Murtha has said he already anticipates .
Afghanistan — with its lack of infrastructure , challenging geography and increased roadside bomb attacks — is a logistical nightmare for the U.S. military , according to congressional sources , and it is expensive to transport fuel and other supplies .
A landlocked country , Afghanistan has no seaports and a shortage of airports and navigable roads .
The nearest port is in Karachi , Pakistan , where fuel for U.S. troops is shipped .
From there , commercial trucks transport the fuel through Pakistan and Afghanistan , sometimes changing carriers .
Fuel is then transferred to storage locations in Afghanistan for movement within the country .
Military transport is used to distribute fuel to forward operating bases .
For many remote locations , this means fuel supplies must be provided by air .
One of the most expensive ways to supply fuel is by transporting it in bladders carried by helicopter ; the amount that can be flown at one time can barely satisfy the need for fuel .
The cheapest way to transport fuel is usually by ship .
Other reasonable methods to provide fuel are by rail and pipeline .
The prices go up exponentially when aircraft are used , according to congressional sources .
The $ 400 per gallon reflects what in Pentagon parlance is known as the “ fully burdened cost of fuel . ”
“ The fully burdened cost of fuel is a recognition that there are a lot of other factors that come into play , ” said Mark Iden , the deputy director of operations at the Defense Energy Support Center ( DESC ) , which provides fuel and energy to all U.S. military services worldwide .
The DESC provides one gallon of JP8 fuel , which is used for both aircraft and ground vehicles , at a standard price of $ 2.78 , said Iden .
The Commandant of the Marine Corps , Gen. James Conway , told a Navy Energy Forum this week that transporting fuel miles into Afghanistan and Iraq along risky and dangerous routes can raise the cost of a $ 1.04 gallon up to $ 400 , according to Aviation Week which covered the forum .
“ These are fairly major problems for us , ” Conway said , according to the publication .
The fully burdened cost of fuel accounts for the cost of transporting it to where it is needed , said Kevin Geiss , program director for energy security in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Installations and Environment .
And moving fuel by convoy or even airlift is expensive , according to the Army news release from July 16 , which quoted Geiss .
In some places , Geiss said , analysts have estimated the fully burdened cost of fuel might even be as high as $ 1,000 per gallon .
Energy consumed by a combat vehicle may not even be for actual mobility of the vehicle , Geiss said , but instead to run the systems onboard the vehicle , including the communications equipment and the cooling systems to protect the electronics onboard .
Some 8o percent of U.S. military casualties in Afghanistan are due to improvised explosive devices , many of which are placed in the path of supply convoys — making it even more imperative to use aircraft for transportation .
According to a Government Accountability
Office report published earlier this year , 44 trucks and 220,000 gallons of fuel were lost due to attacks or other events while delivering fuel to Bagram Air Field in Afghanistan in June 2008 alone .

High fuel demand , coupled with the volatility of fuel prices , also have significant implications for the Department of Defense ’s operating costs , the GAO said .
The fully burdened cost of fuel — that is , the total ownership cost of buying , moving and protecting fuel in systems during combat — has been reported to be many times higher than the price of a gallon of fuel itself , according to the report .
The Marines in Afghanistan , for example , reportedly run through some 800,000 gallons of fuel a day .
That reflects the logistical challenges of running the counterinsurgency operations but also the need for fuel during the extreme weather conditions in Afghanistan — hot summers and freezing winters .
With the military boosting the number of the all - terrain - mine resistant ambush - protected vehicles ( M - ATVs ) in Afghanistan meant to survive roadside bombs , the fuel consumption will likely rise even higher , since those vehicles are considered gas - guzzlers .
The Pentagon comptroller ’s office did not return requests for comment by press time .
In a little over a week I will be giving an invited paper at the Fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union ( AGU ) in San Francisco , in a special session devoted to feedbacks in the climate system .
If you do n’t already know , feedbacks are what will determine whether anthropogenic global warming is strong or weak , with cloud feedbacks being the most uncertain of all .
In the 12 minutes I have for my presentation , I hope to convince as many scientists as possible the futility of previous attempts to estimate cloud feedbacks in the climate system .
And unless we can measure cloud feedbacks in nature , we can not test the feedbacks operating in computerized climate models .
WHAT ARE FEEDBACKS ?
To review , the main feedback issue is this :
In response to the small direct warming effect of more CO2 in the atmosphere , will clouds change in ways that amplify the warming ( e.g. a cloud reduction letting more sunlight in , which would be a positive feedback ) , or decrease the warming ( e.g. a cloud increase causing less sunlight to be absorbed by the Earth , which would be a negative feedback ) ?
In the former case , we could be heading for a global warming catastrophe .
In the latter case , manmade global warming might be barely measurable ( and previous warming would be mostly the result of some natural cause ) .
All climate models tracked by the IPCC now have positive cloud feedbacks , by varying amounts , which partly explains why the IPCC expects anthropogenic global warming to be so strong .
Obviously , we need to know what feedbacks operate in the climate system .
ESTIMATING FEEDBACKS : AN UNSOLVED PROBLEM
I am now quite convinced that most , if not all , previous estimates of feedback from our satellite observations of natural climate variability are in error .
Furthermore , this error is usually in the direction of positive feedback , which will then give the illusion of a ‘ sensitive ’ climate system .
More on that later .
The goal seems simple enough : to measure cloud feedbacks , we need to determine how much clouds change in response to a temperature change .
But most researchers do not realize that this is not possible without accounting for causation in the opposite direction , i.e. , the extent to which temperature changes are a response to cloud changes .
As I will demonstrate in my AGU talk on December 16 , for all practical purposes it is not possible ( at least not yet ) to measure cloud feedbacks because the two directions of causation are intermingled in nature .
As a result , it is not possible with current methods to measure feedbacks in response to a radiative forcing event such as a change in cloud cover , or even a major volcanic eruption , such as that from the 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo .
The reason is that the size of the radiative forcing of a temperature change overwhelms the size of the radiative feedback upon that temperature change , and our satellite measurements can not tell the difference .
There are only two special situations where it can be done : ( 1 ) the theoretical case of an instantaneously imposed , and then constant amount of radiative forcing … which never happens in the real world ; and ( 2 ) the real world case where temperature changes are caused non-radiatively .
While I will not go into the evidence here , satellite observations suggest that cloud feedbacks in the latter case are strongly negative .
Now , if you have an accurate estimate of the radiative forcing of temperature change , accurate estimates of radiative feedback can be made .
But we do not have good estimates of this forcing during natural climate variations .
Only in climate model simulations where a known amount of radiative forcing is imposed upon the model can this be done .
( In another method , if you try to estimate feedback by measuring how fast the ocean responds , you also run into problems because your answer depends upon how fast and how deep in the ocean you assume the temperature change will extend . )
EXAMPLE 1 : FEEDBACKS FROM THE CHANGE IN SEASONS
Once one realizes that clouds causing a temperature change ( forcing ) corrupts our estimates of temperature causing a cloud change ( feedback ) , it becomes apparent that many of the previous attempts to estimate feedback will not work .
For instance , many researchers think that you can estimate feedbacks from the seasonal cycle in average solar illumination of the Earth and the resulting temperature response .
There is about a 7 % peak - to - peak variation in the amount of solar energy reaching the Earth during the year , with a maximum occurring in March and September , and the minimum in June .
So , one would think we could measure by how much this change in solar heating causes a change in temperature .
The trouble is that global circulation patterns also change dramatically with the seasons , mostly due to the large difference in land masses between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres .
Since cloud formation is affected by a variety of circulation induced effects ( fronts , temperature inversions , etc. ) , the cloud cover and thus the natural shading of the Earth by clouds also changes with the seasons , through these seasonal circulation changes .
These non-temperature effects on cloud cover will confound the estimation of feedbacks , because their magnitude is considerably larger than the magnitude of the feedbacks .
If the Earth was 100 % covered by ocean that had a constant depth everywhere , then it might be possible to estimate feedbacks in this way … but not in the real world .
EXAMPLE 2 : FEEDBACKS FROM EL NINO & LA NINA
Researchers have also made feedback estimates from the anomalously warm conditions that exist during El Nino , and the cool conditions during La Nina .
But this runs into a similar problem as estimating feedbacks from the change in seasons : there are substantial variations in global circulation patterns between El Nino and La Nina , especially in the tropics .
These circulation changes can induce cloud changes – wholly apart from temperature - induced changes – and there is no known way to separate the circulation - induced cloud changes ( forcing ) from the feedback - induced changes .
THE ERRORS WHICH RESULT FROM PREVIOUS FEEDBACK ESTIMATES
So , how do these problems impact our estimates of feedback ?
Except under certain circumstances , they will always cause a bias toward positive feedback .
The reason is that radiative forcing and radiative feedback always work in opposition to each other .
( Here I am speaking of the net feedback parameter , which also contains the increase in loss of infrared radiation by the Earth in direct response to warming ) .
Since our satellites measure the two effects combined , if you assume only feedback is being measured when both feedback and forcing are occurring , then you will underestimate the feedback parameter , which is a bias in the direction of positive feedback .
THE IMPACT ON CLIMATE MODEL VALIDATION
I can predict that the climate modelers will claim that we really do not need to know the direction of causation … we can just measure the temperature / cloud relationships in nature , and then adjust the models until they produce the same temperature / cloud relationships .
While this might sound reasonable , it turns out that the radiative signature of forcing is much larger than that of feedback .
As a result , one can get pretty good agreement between models and observations even when the model feedbacks are greatly in error .
Another way of saying this is that you can get good agreement between the model behavior and observations whether the cloud feedbacks are positive OR negative .
This is another fact I will be demonstrating on December 16 .
WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE ?
My first task is to convince both observationalists and modelers that much of what they previously believed about atmospheric feedbacks operating in the real world can be tossed out the window .
Obviously , this will be no small task when so many climate experts assume that nothing important could have been overlooked after 20 years and billions of dollars of climate research .
But even if I can get a number of mainstream climate scientists to understand that we still do not know whether cloud feedbacks are positive or negative , it is not obvious how to fix the problem .
As I suggested a couple of blog postings ago , maybe we should quit trying to test whether a climate model that produces 3 deg .
C of warming in response to a doubling of carbon dioxide is “ true ” , and instead test to see if we can falsify a climate model which only produces 0.5 deg .
C of warming .
As someone recently pointed out in an email to me , a climate model IS a hypothesis , and in science a hypothesis can only be falsified — not proved true .
From what I have seen from my analysis of output from 18 of the IPCC ’s climate models , I ’ll bet that we can not falsify such a model with our current observations of the climate system .
I suspect that the climate modeling groups have only publicized models that produce the amount of warming they believe “ looks about right ” , or “ looks reasonable ” .
Through group - think ( or maybe the political leanings of , and pressure from , the IPCC leadership ? ) , they might well have tossed out any model experiments which produced very little warming .
In any event , I believe that the scientific community ’s confidence that climate change is now mostly human - caused is seriously misplaced .
It is time for an independent review of climate modeling , with experts from other physical ( and even engineering ) disciplines where computer models are widely used .
The importance of the issue demands nothing less .
Furthermore , the computer codes for the climate models now being used by the IPCC should be made available to other researchers for independent testing and experimentation .
The Data Quality Act for U.S. - supported models already requires this , but this law is being largely ignored .
As a ( simple ) modeler and computer programmer myself , I know that the modeling groups will protest that the models are far too complex and finely tuned to let amateurs play with them .
But that ’s part of the problem .
If the models are that complex and fragile , should we be basing multi-trillion dollar policy decisions on them ?
In space solar power concepts , solar panel arrays would gather sunlight in orbit , then beam it to Earth ( Illustration : Mafic Studios )
Energy beamed down from space is one step closer to reality , now that California has given the green light to a deal involving its sale .
But some major challenges will have to be overcome if the technology is to be used widely .
On Thursday , the California Public Utilities Commission gave its blessing to an agreement that would see the Pacific Gas and Electric Company buy 200 megawatts of power beamed down from solar - power satellites beginning in 2016 .
A start - up company called Solaren is designing the satellites , which it says will use radio waves to beam energy down to a receiving station on Earth .
The attraction of collecting solar power in space is the virtually uninterrupted sunshine available in geosynchronous orbit .
Earth - based solar cells , by contrast , can only collect sunlight during daytime and when skies are clear .

Launch costs
But space - based solar power must grapple with the high cost per kilogram of launching things into space , says Richard Schwartz of Purdue University in West Lafayette , Indiana .
Schwartz chaired a US National Academies committee that in 2001 wrote up an assessment of NASA ’s space - based solar power research .
“ If you ’re talking about it being economically viable for terrestrial power , it ’s a tough go , ” he says .
Cal Boerman , Solaren ’s director of energy services , says the company designed its satellites with a view to keeping launch costs down .
“ We knew we had to come up with a different , revolutionary design , ” he says .
A patent the company has won describes ways to reduce the system ’s weight , including using inflatable mirrors to focus sunlight on solar cells , so a smaller number can collect the same amount of energy .
Stay cool
But using mirrors introduces other challenges , including keeping the solar cells from overheating , says Schwartz .
“ You have to take care of heat dissipation because you ’re now concentrating a lot of energy in one place , ” he says .
According to the company ’s patent , Solaren ’s solar cells will be connected to radiators to help keep them cool .
Though Boerman says the company believes it can make space - based solar power work , it is not expecting to crowd out other forms of renewable energy .
Laws in California and other states require increasing use of renewable energy in coming years , he points out .
“ To meet those needs , we ’re going to need all types of renewable energy sources , ” he says .

A note regarding annual distributions : the Hussman Funds generally pay required annual capital gains distributions during the month of November .
As in prior years , our policy is not to announce the exact date of these distributions .
For 2009 , no capital gain distribution is required for the Strategic Growth Fund .
The distribution for the Strategic Total Return Fund is expected to be approximately 0.165 per share ( 1.35 % of the prevailing net asset value ) , primarily characterized as short - term capital gains .

Let 's begin with a news item from last week .
" Realty Trac today released its Q3 2009 Metropolitan Foreclosure Market Report , which shows that cities in California , Florida , and Nevada accounted for the 10 highest foreclosure rates in the third quarter among metro areas with a population of 200,000 or more .
But five of those Top 10 metro areas reported decreasing foreclosure activity from the third quarter of 2008 , while many other metro areas with Top 50 foreclosure rates reported sharp increases in foreclosure activity . "
" Rising unemployment and a new variety of mortgage resets continued to gradually shift the nation 's foreclosure epicenters in the third quarter away from the hot spots of the last two years and toward some metro areas that had avoided the brunt of the first foreclosure wave , " said James J. Saccacio , chief executive officer of Realty Trac .
" While toxic subprime mortgages drove much of that first wave of foreclosures , high unemployment and exotic Alt - A and Option ARMs are spreading the foreclosure flood to more metro areas in 2009 . "
While the news itself is no surprise in the sense that we have expected and written about this situation repeatedly in recent months , the phrase " sharp increases in foreclosure activity " is notable in the context of widespread views that credit difficulties are abating .
Below is a reminder of where we stand in relation to the reset curve .
This news of a shift in the character of foreclosure activity comes precisely in tandem with the beginning of the predictable second wave .
The pleasant lull in the reset schedule is decidedly behind us .
I should also note some features of the resets we are now beginning to observe .
It is tempting to think that with Treasury yields fairly low , mortgage resets might be fairly benign in terms of their impact .
The problem is that these Option ARM and Alt - A structures were specifically designed as " teasers " - allowing loans to be made without documentation of creditworthiness , in return for post - reset interest terms that were generally higher than a documented lender would have paid .
The mortgages certainly do not reset at Treasury bill yields or even at standard spreads over LIBOR .
Instead , they reset to a " premium " spread above those rates .
That " yield spread premium " is precisely what the homeowners agreed to in return for the undocumented loan , and is particularly obnoxious at the point of reset if the mortgage itself is underwater ( loan amount in excess of home value ) .
Given that these mortgages were written during the last stages of the housing boom , at the highest prices , it is reasonable to assume they now sport very high loan - to - value ratios .
Similarly , Option ARM mortgages typically have very permissive payment schedules prior to the reset date , which have allowed homeowners to essentially live in these houses ( at least temporarily ) with fairly discretionary payments .
The data suggest that most of these borrowers have allowed their mortgages to " negatively amortize , " allowing the loan balances to grow larger even as property values have depreciated .
Once again , the resets on these are problematic for borrowers with questionable creditworthiness , who bought the homes largely in anticipation of price appreciation .
For these borrowers , the transition from discretionary payments to more demanding terms is unlikely to be smooth .
Meanwhile , clearly the best news in Friday 's unemployment report , from our standpoint , was the modest 34,000 increase in temporary jobs .
While that was well below the pace that we would normally see several months into a putative economic recovery , the figure was at least positive .
Aside from that , the unemployment rate jumped to 10.2 % , reflecting a loss of 8.4 million civilian jobs since November 2007 .
As I noted in High Loan - to - Value Plus Trigger Event ( Unemployment ) =
Default , the combination of deeply underwater mortgages , poor employment conditions , and a heavy reset schedule is not friendly .
While we observed some moderate improvement in the rate of net job losses in the establishment survey ( 190,000 jobs lost in October , compared with 219,000 in September and 154,000 in August ) , the figures from the somewhat more volatile household survey have been absolutely brutal ( 589,000 jobs lost in October , compared with 795,000 in September and 392,000 in August ) .
Note that weekly new unemployment claims have been running over 500,000 per week , so we 're seeing a very rapid turnover in job loss and creation here .
This is apparently driving much larger than normal disparities in the monthly numbers from the establishment and household surveys .
As economist David Rosenberg notes , what 's odd about the disparity is that coming out of past recessions , the household survey has generally turned higher first .
Rosenberg also notes that U6 , the broadest measure of unemployment ( which includes discouraged workers ) is now at 17.5 % .
Rather than mince arguments about which survey is more reliable at turning points , the chart below simply averages the two , and smoothes the data somewhat by looking at quarterly job growth as a percentage of the labor force .
Although I 've shaded the chart as others have invariably done , showing the recession as having ended in June , the pace of quarter - over - quarter job losses here is still worse than all but the most severe 4 months of the 1974 - 75 recession , and the single worst month of the 1980 recession , so it 's clear that the employment news is " good " only in relation to the frenetic losses we observed early this year .
Moreover , the rate of job losses across these surveys has actually worsened in recent months .
None of this is to say that conditions can't improve - again , the small gain in temporary employment last month was a hopeful sign - but employment conditions remain dismal from an objective standpoint .
This is a clear risk factor , given that we are just beginning the second wave of mortgage resets .
Market Climate
As of last week , the Market Climate in stocks was characterized by unfavorable valuations and mixed market action .
We 're seeing an increasing number of internal divergences , though not to the extent that would justify a major warning .
Overall , our approach in the Strategic Growth Fund is largely to modestly expand market exposure on weakness and clip it on strength .
Currently , the Fund has a very slightly positive exposure to market fluctuations , but our primary concern continues to be downside risk , which would shift to a major concern if we observe further internal deteriorations .
For now , my impression is that stocks are not priced to deliver satisfactory long - term returns , and that intermediate - term conditions remain overbought .
There is some latitude for very small exposures based on near - term market fluctuations of several percent in either direction , but again , our main concern here continues to be defense .
In bonds , the Market Climate improved somewhat last week with the uptick in Treasury yields .
The same factors that have buoyed precious metals and hurt the dollar ( downward pressure on real interest rates ) has brought TIPS yields to a relatively low level , so on yield spikes , our tendency is likely to be to add to straight Treasuries and to de-emphasize TIPS .
I continue to expect longer - term inflation pressures several years out , but the risk of fresh credit concerns is likely to keep near - term inflation pressures relatively restrained ( as those concerns create demand for default - free government liabilities , despite the huge amount of issuance in these liabilities ) .
That puts TIPS in something of a " negative carry " position , and requires investors concerned about long - term inflation to accept low coupon yields and low inflation compensation over the near - term , and limits the likely upside from here - at least until we observe more well - defined inflation concerns .
Likewise , in precious metals , market conditions are n't particularly conducive to sustained strength absent inflation pressures and further dollar weakness , so the Strategic Total Return Fund has very little exposure - about 1 % of assets - to this sector at present .
Aside from Treasuries and precious metals , the Fund continues to hold about 4 % of assets in foreign currencies and about 4 % of assets in utility shares , all of which reflects a fairly conservative overall stance at present .

The Sound Of All Hell Breaking Loose , Comrades
Multiple sources are drawing attention to this English language version of a news item published by the Kommersant , in Russia ;
Climategate has already affected Russia .
On Tuesday , the Moscow - based Institute of Economic Analysis ( IEA ) issued a report claiming that the Hadley Center for Climate Change based at the headquarters of the British Meteorological Office in Exeter ( Devon , England ) had probably tampered with Russian - climate data .
The IEA believes that Russian meteorological - station data did not substantiate the anthropogenic global - warming theory .
Analysts say Russian meteorological stations cover most of the country 's territory , and that the Hadley Center had used data submitted by only 25 % of such stations in its reports .
Over 40 % of Russian territory was not included in global - temperature calculations for some other reasons , rather than the lack of meteorological stations and observations .
The data of stations located in areas not listed in the Hadley Climate Research Unit Temperature UK ( HadCRUT ) survey often does not show any substantial warming in the late 20th century and the early 21st century .
More context at WUWT - Russian IEA claims CRU tampered with climate data – cherrypicked warmest stations
Steve McIntyre - " Climategate emails show that Phil Jones of CRU , acting as a reviewer of the CRU data used in the HadCRU gridded temperature , “ went to town ” to block the publication of criticisms of his handling of Russian data . "
There 's also a request for help in translating this Russian language document .

So stay tuned , and remember that when dealing with foreign newspaper reports , it 's best to remain agnostic until there 's independent confirmation .

When they were coaching women 's basketball at the University of South Carolina , Walvius and Marciniak came up with the idea to apply performance - fabric technology -- the technology that wicks moisture in Nike athletic apparel -- to bedsheets .
Crazy ?
Not so .
Walvius and Marciniak got R&D help from the university 's business school and raised $ 1 million for their " performance bedding " start - up .
In May of last year , they quit their coaching jobs .
They lined up manufacturing in California soon after , and launched Sheex.com this past April .
This month , they cut a deal to sell in the NBA 's flagship store in Manhattan .
Their marketing strategy is grassroots and viral , with Twitter and Facebook promos by pro athletes like the New York Giants ' Steve Smith and the LPGA 's Christina Kim .
Being hard - charging athletes themselves , Walvius and Marciniak are naturally inclined to race for a win .
But the best advice they got ?
" Crawl , walk and then run , " says Walvius .
In business , as in coaching , she adds , " You 're either getting better or you 're getting worse with each day .
There 's no such thing as staying the same . "

Drones have been used to target militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan
The CIA has cancelled a contract with US private security firm Blackwater for its operatives to load bombs onto drone aircraft in Pakistan and Afghanistan .
CIA Director Leon Panetta wanted such work to be done by the organisation 's own employees only , officials said .
The New York Times revealed the existence of the secret contract with Blackwater , renamed Xe , in August .
On Thursday , the paper also reported that Xe employees had been involved in " snatch - and - grab operations " in Iraq .
Xe , based in North Carolina , changed its name from Blackwater after several of its employees were accused of killing 17 civilians in a shooting incident in Baghdad in September 2007 .
Four men are due to stand trial next year .
' Joint operations '
Earlier this year , Mr Panetta ordered a review of the company 's contacts to be sure its operatives were only performing security - related work , intelligence officials said on Friday .
At this time , Blackwater is not involved in any CIA operations other than in a security or support role
CIA spokesman George Little Afterwards , a contract with Blackwater Select , a division which handles classified operations , to load missiles onto CIA Predator drones in Pakistan and Afghanistan was cancelled , they added .
A CIA spokesman , George Little , said Mr Panetta had since ordered that the agency 's employees take over the task .
" At this time , Blackwater is not involved in any CIA operations other than in a security or support role , " he told the New York Times .
The statement came a day after the paper quoted various unnamed current and former Blackwater staff as saying that in Iraq between 2004 and 2006 , colleagues were involved in raids on suspected militants almost every night .
They said that , at one point , joint operations in Iraq and Afghanistan became so routine that Blackwater personnel sometimes were partners in missions instead of just providing security for CIA officers .
Former Blackwater employees also alleged that they provided security on some CIA rendition flights transporting detainees between prisons in different countries .
One former CIA officer was quoted as saying : " There was a feeling that Blackwater eventually became an extension of the agency . "
Xe has insisted it was " never under contract to participate in covert raids with CIA or Special Operations personnel in Iraq , Afghanistan or anywhere else " .
" Any allegation to the contrary by any news organisation would be false . "

Even so , the total number of suicides in New York City has dropped : there were 339 in the first 10 months of this year , or about 34 per month , down from 39 per month in 2008 and 39.4 in 2007 , officials said .
( National statistics are not yet available for the past three years , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . )
The rise in suicides among Koreans in New York , however , mirrors an increase in South Korea , where the suicide rate last year was 26 per 100,000 people , up from 24.8 in 2007 and 21.8 in 2006 , said Dr. Myung - Soo Lee , director of the Seoul Suicide Prevention Center .

The Korea Times
This month , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development reported that South Korea had the highest rate among its 30 member nations , based on 2006 statistics .
A number of prominent South Koreans have killed themselves this year , including former President Roh Moo-hyun , who was implicated in a corruption investigation ; Daul Kim , a top South Korean model ; and Park Yong - oh , the former chairman of Doosan , South Korea ’s oldest business conglomerate .
Some experts trace the increase in the suicide rate , in part , to the nation ’s rapid transformation from an impoverished agrarian society to a booming industrial power .
Traditional family support systems have fractured , age - old value systems have dissolved and materialism has flourished , they say .
And those changes continue to steer the lives of recent emigrants to America .
“ We are thinking that we ’re living in the United States , but we still keep the value of the higher expectations and higher achievements , ” said Mr. Yoon , of the Asian Outreach Clinic , who immigrated from South Korea a decade ago .
Among the Koreans who killed themselves this year in the New York region was Won Jo Lee , 36 , a cabdriver whose body was found , shot in the head , on Sept. 6 in his apartment in Bayside , Queens , the Korean Consulate said .
The Korea Times reported that Mr. Lee had been suffering financial difficulties , and it quoted his roommate as saying he had recently been laid off .
 Invisible Hand rescues baby BOSTON  Witnesses say the reclusive superhero
The Invisible Hand was responsible for the rescue last Wednesday of 1 - year - old Sally Fairfield , who had crawled out the fourth - story window of her familys Back Bay apartment and was plummeting to certain death .
" He saved her , " said a tearful Greta Fairfield , Sally s mother .
" The Invisible Hand saved my baby .
Im so thankful . "
Using his powers of insta-utility - maximization ( see below ) , the Invisible Hand buffered Sallys fall and returned her to her mother unharmed .
As the gathered throngs cheered , the Hand flew off without a word , returning to his secret underground lair deep below the Federal Reserve Building downtown .
With his fantastic superpowers and a doctorate in economics from the University of Chicago , The Invisible Hand of the Marketplace has saved Boston from many a dire situation since the end of the last recession .
Mayor Menino held a press conference today thanking the Hand for his heroism and offering him the keys to the city .
" For years , the Invisible Hand has helped rescue our fair city from disequilibrium , " said Menino .
" Wherever there is evil , wherever there is inefficiency , wherever there is suboptimal allocation of resources , the Invisible Hand is there to save us .
We all owe him a great debt , a debt for which he has negotiated a steep but fair annual interest rate of LIBOR + 3 % .
Please remember that payments are due quarterly . "
Others , however , were less happy with the Invisible Hands feat .
Saving the baby shifted global demand in such a way as to force the closing of a General Motors plant in Flint , Michigan , displacing 1600 workers .
" This so - called  Invisible Hand purports to be a hero , when he in fact causes nothing but pain ! " spat the Hands nemesis , Dr. Intervention , as he stroked a government - issued white Persian cat .
" He is a rogue , a vulgarian , an anarchist ! " Dr. Intervention cited other adverse effects of the Invisible Hands actions .
Two years ago the Hand extinguished a fire in a triple - decker in Dorchester , causing service - sector jobs to erode in inner-city Los Angeles .
And last summer , the Hands neutralization of a lethal 30 - story tidal wave precipitated the collapse of the Malaysian ringgit .
While perennially the loser in his battles with the Invisible Hand , Dr. Intervention has sometimes been able to foil the Hands heroism with lethal rocks of " Regulite , " a substance that takes away the Hands super powers .
In Cambridge , for example , large chunks of Regulite at City Hall stopped the Invisible Hand from rescuing the citys desperate landlords , whom Dr. Intervention had imprisoned beneath a steel - reinforced rent ceiling .
Thankfully , the Invisible Hands French sidekick Laissez Faire lobbied the city council to remove the Regulite , enabling the Hand to regain his super - equilibrating powers and free the landlords .
" I never would have gotten my posh Central Square apartment without the Invisible Hand , " said 25 - year - old Lois Lang , a management consultant and recent Yale grad .
" Hes such a dream !
It s too bad my mild - mannered accountant boyfriend , Adam Smith , never seems to be around to see him . "
Economic superpowers Witnesses say that the Hand performed his feat with his trademark powers of insta-utility - maximization .
After slowing time to a crawl , the Hand contacted Greta Fairfield and asked her how much she would pay to save Sally .
" I told him that up to $ 17,500 I was inclined to save her , but above that price the marginal cost would outweigh the marginal utility gained , " said Greta .
The Invisible Hand then contacted potential suppliers of such a service .
One Boston fireman , Bob Richardson , jumped at the opportunity , hoping to supplement his meager government income .
" Noting that there were few suppliers of baby - saving services , I quoted Mrs. Fairfield a price of $ 50,000 , " said Richardson .
" I seemed to have the market cornered . "
While a few mothers did employ Richardson , Greta Fairfield balked at the price .
But in the meantime , Randall Ferrere , owner of local flower delivery service Ferrere & Co. , had noticed that there seemed to be a lot of money in baby - saving .
" I looked at the prices guys like Richardson were quoting and thought , there has to be a way to do this better and cheaper , " said Ferrere .
" The profit margins of the baby - saving services were far more attractive than those of my flower delivery service .
Besides , I already had twenty drivers in different parts of the city and a dispatch office that communicated with the drivers via radio .
This would enable each driver to save more babies per workday than a solo practicioner ever could . "
Ferrere & Co. launched their service at a price of $ 10,000 per baby saved .
Greta Fairfield excitedly called Ferrere to make an appointment , but received some bad news .
" They said that there was already a long waiting list for their service , " said Greta .
" The first time they could come out and save Sally was in early January .
I was pretty upset .
I asked them if there was any way that they could come earlier . "
Ferrere realized that there was something not quite right with his pricing scheme .
" It occurred to me that some mothers might need faster service , and might be willing to pay extra for it , " he said .
Ferrere created a Premier Platinum service with a price of $ 16,000 .
Mrs. Fairfield scheduled the service and had Sally saved that instant .
" It seemed like a bargain to me , " said Mrs. Fairfield .
" Thank you , Invisible Hand ! "

On Monday , the Georgia Supreme Court ruled [ PDF ] that unauditable voting in the state does not infringe upon the fundamental right to vote and to have that vote counted .
In 2002 , Georgia was among the first in the nation to implement Diebold touch - screen voting machines across the entire state .
The lead plaintiff , Garland Favorito , was astounded .
" This ruling essentially gives the state a license to pretend to conduct elections .
Not one of the 100 + million votes that have been cast on the machines since 2002 can be audited for accuracy and correctness of vote recording . " ...
" Georgia law in 2001 and 2002 required that any new machines have an independent audit trail of each vote cast .
The state 's own witnesses have acknowledged that the specific type of electronic voting machines we purchased and use do not have such an independent audit trail , " Favorito told The BRAD BLOG .
" The machines can only internally recreate selections that may or may not have been shown to the voter .
Without an independent audit trail , it is impossible to determine whether the actual ballots cast on Election Day were recorded correctly . "
His group , VoterGA.org , believes that " auditable electronic voting machines " exist .
But software is undetectably mutable .
It can change without leaving a trace ; and it can do so without malice .
Humidity or heat can cause an electronic system to fail , or its data to become corrupted .
There has been much research --- beginning in 2005 with computer security expert Harri Hursti's famous hacks in Leon County , Florida - which clearly show , repeatedly , that even optical scan machines can be maliciously programmed to defeat pre-election testing .
So - called " Logic and Accuracy Tests " prior to elections can be subverted , without detection .
Once people submit their paper ballots on such systems --- and then those ballots are removed off site for counting --- the public chain of custody is broken and we therefore cannot rely on the paper count .
Ballots should never leave the polling site before being counted .
Not in any real democracy , anyway .
In our current world order , U.S. election officials have consistently chosen to ignore the science and rely on an electronic tally , preserving the ballots only for some potential future recount .
Government officials offer little choice other than the public simply trust that they have protected those ballots from corruption --- the very ballots they use to assert authority .
While all of that is Orwellian enough and anathema to freedom , the Georgia Supreme Court has gone one step further .
They ruled for completely secret , and entirely unverifiable vote casting and counting by allowing the worst possible technology : Direct Recording Electronic ( DRE , usually touch - screen ) voting systems .
With those types of machines , in use across the entire Peach State , officials do n't even have to pretend they kept their paper records secured --- there are n't any .
Favorito notes : " In this particular case , the previous boss of former Secretary of State [ Cathy ] Cox , who signed the purchase agreement , was the lobbyist for Diebold , the voting machine vendor . "
Diebold changed the name of its election division to Premier Election Solutions in 2007 , in hopes of shaking off the horrible reputation they 'd garnered after their voting systems --- both touch - screen and optical - scan paper - based systems --- were found to have failed in so many different states and scientific studies .
They 've recently been acquired by their largest competitor , ES&S , which --- if the sale is allowed to go through --- would create a single voting machine company whose equipment will be used for more than two - thirds of the votes cast in the nation .
Critics , including election integrity experts , Sen. Chuck Schumer ( D - NY ) , and even one of the remaining e-voting competitors still left in the market , are all challenging the sale on anti-trust grounds .
Yes , welcome to the New World Order , where corporations rule without accountability --- or auditability --- and where it seems things will be getting worse , before getting better .

The thick hardbound volume was sitting on a shelf in a colleague 's office when Kirk Sorensen spotted it .
A rookie NASA engineer at the Marshall Space Flight Center , Sorensen was researching nuclear - powered propulsion , and the book 's title — Fluid Fuel Reactors — jumped out at him .
He picked it up and thumbed through it .
Hours later , he was still reading , enchanted by the ideas but struggling with the arcane writing .
" I took it home that night , but I did n't understand all the nuclear terminology , " Sorensen says .
He pored over it in the coming months , ultimately deciding that he held in his hands the key to the world 's energy future .
Published in 1958 under the auspices of the Atomic Energy Commission as part of its Atoms for Peace program , Fluid Fuel Reactors is a book only an engineer could love : a dense , 978 - page account of research conducted at Oak Ridge National Lab , most of it under former director Alvin Weinberg .
What caught Sorensen 's eye was the description of Weinberg 's experiments producing nuclear power with an element called thorium .
At the time , in 2000 , Sorensen was just 25 , engaged to be married and thrilled to be employed at his first serious job as a real aerospace engineer .
A devout Mormon with a linebacker 's build and a marine 's crew cut , Sorensen made an unlikely iconoclast .
But the book inspired him to pursue an intense study of nuclear energy over the next few years , during which he became convinced that thorium could solve the nuclear power industry 's most intractable problems .
After it has been used as fuel for power plants , the element leaves behind minuscule amounts of waste .
And that waste needs to be stored for only a few hundred years , not a few hundred thousand like other nuclear byproducts .
Because it 's so plentiful in nature , it 's virtually inexhaustible .
It 's also one of only a few substances that acts as a thermal breeder , in theory creating enough new fuel as it breaks down to sustain a high - temperature chain reaction indefinitely .
And it would be virtually impossible for the byproducts of a thorium reactor to be used by terrorists or anyone else to make nuclear weapons .
Weinberg and his men proved the efficacy of thorium reactors in hundreds of tests at Oak Ridge from the '50s through the early ' 70s .
But thorium hit a dead end .
Locked in a struggle with a nuclear - armed Soviet Union , the US government in the '60s chose to build uranium - fueled reactors — in part because they produce plutonium that can be refined into weapons - grade material .
The course of the nuclear industry was set for the next four decades , and thorium power became one of the great what - if technologies of the 20th century .
Today , however , Sorensen spearheads a cadre of outsiders dedicated to sparking a thorium revival .
When he's not at his day job as an aerospace engineer at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Alabama — or wrapping up the master 's in nuclear engineering he is soon to earn from the University of Tennessee — he runs a popular blog called Energy From Thorium .
A community of engineers , amateur nuclear power geeks , and researchers has gathered around the site 's forum , ardently discussing the future of thorium .
The site even links to PDFs of the Oak Ridge archives , which Sorensen helped get scanned .
Energy From Thorium has become a sort of open source project aimed at resurrecting long - lost energy technology using modern techniques .
And the online upstarts are n't alone .
Industry players are looking into thorium , and governments from Dubai to Beijing are funding research .
India is betting heavily on the element .
The concept of nuclear power without waste or proliferation has obvious political appeal in the US , as well .
The threat of climate change has created an urgent demand for carbon - free electricity , and the 52,000 tons of spent , toxic material that has piled up around the country makes traditional nuclear power less attractive .
President Obama and his energy secretary , Steven Chu , have expressed general support for a nuclear renaissance .
Utilities are investigating several next - gen alternatives , including scaled - down conventional plants and " pebble bed " reactors , in which the nuclear fuel is inserted into small graphite balls in a way that reduces the risk of meltdown .
Those technologies are still based on uranium , however , and will be beset by the same problems that have dogged the nuclear industry since the 1960s .
It is only thorium , Sorensen and his band of revolutionaries argue , that can move the country toward a new era of safe , clean , affordable energy .
Named for the Norse god of thunder , thorium is a lustrous silvery - white metal .
It 's only slightly radioactive ; you could carry a lump of it in your pocket without harm .
On the periodic table of elements , it 's found in the bottom row , along with other dense , radioactive substances — including uranium and plutonium — known as actinides .
Actinides are dense because their nuclei contain large numbers of neutrons and protons .
But it 's the strange behavior of those nuclei that has long made actinides the stuff of wonder .
At intervals that can vary from every millisecond to every hundred thousand years , actinides spin off particles and decay into more stable elements .
And if you pack together enough of certain actinide atoms , their nuclei will erupt in a powerful release of energy .
To understand the magic and terror of those two processes working in concert , think of a game of pool played in 3 - D .
The nucleus of the atom is a group of balls , or particles , racked at the center .
Shoot the cue ball — a stray neutron — and the cluster breaks apart , or fissions .
Now imagine the same game played with trillions of racked nuclei .
Balls propelled by the first collision crash into nearby clusters , which fly apart , their stray neutrons colliding with yet more clusters .
Voilè0 : a nuclear chain reaction .
Actinides are the only materials that split apart this way , and if the collisions are uncontrolled , you unleash hell : a nuclear explosion .
But if you can control the conditions in which these reactions happen — by both controlling the number of stray neutrons and regulating the temperature , as is done in the core of a nuclear reactor — you get useful energy .
Racks of these nuclei crash together , creating a hot glowing pile of radioactive material .
If you pump water past the material , the water turns to steam , which can spin a turbine to make electricity .
Uranium is currently the actinide of choice for the industry , used ( sometimes with a little plutonium ) in 100 percent of the world 's commercial reactors .
But it 's a problematic fuel .
In most reactors , sustaining a chain reaction requires extremely rare uranium - 235 , which must be purified , or enriched , from far more common U - 238 .
The reactors also leave behind plutonium - 239 , itself radioactive ( and useful to technologically sophisticated organizations bent on making bombs ) .
And conventional uranium - fueled reactors require lots of engineering , including neutron - absorbing control rods to damp the reaction and gargantuan pressurized vessels to move water through the reactor core .
If something goes kerflooey , the surrounding countryside gets blanketed with radioactivity ( think Chernobyl ) .
Even if things go well , toxic waste is left over .
When he took over as head of Oak Ridge in 1955 , Alvin Weinberg realized that thorium by itself could start to solve these problems .
It 's abundant — the US has at least 175,000 tons of the stuff — and does n't require costly processing .
It is also extraordinarily efficient as a nuclear fuel .
As it decays in a reactor core , its byproducts produce more neutrons per collision than conventional fuel .
The more neutrons per collision , the more energy generated , the less total fuel consumed , and the less radioactive nastiness left behind .
Even better , Weinberg realized that you could use thorium in an entirely new kind of reactor , one that would have zero risk of meltdown .
The design is based on the lab 's finding that thorium dissolves in hot liquid fluoride salts .
This fission soup is poured into tubes in the core of the reactor , where the nuclear chain reaction — the billiard balls colliding — happens .
The system makes the reactor self - regulating :
When the soup gets too hot it expands and flows out of the tubes — slowing fission and eliminating the possibility of another Chernobyl .
Any actinide can work in this method , but thorium is particularly well suited because it is so efficient at the high temperatures at which fission occurs in the soup .
In 1965 , Weinberg and his team built a working reactor , one that suspended the byproducts of thorium in a molten salt bath , and he spent the rest of his 18 - year tenure trying to make thorium the heart of the nation 's atomic power effort .
He failed .
Uranium reactors had already been established , and Hyman Rickover , de facto head of the US nuclear program , wanted the plutonium from uranium - powered nuclear plants to make bombs .
Increasingly shunted aside , Weinberg was finally forced out in 1973 .
That proved to be " the most pivotal year in energy history , " according to the US Energy Information Administration .
It was the year the Arab states cut off oil supplies to the West , setting in motion the petroleum - fueled conflicts that roil the world to this day .
The same year , the US nuclear industry signed contracts to build a record 41 nuke plants , all of which used uranium .
And 1973 was the year that thorium R&D faded away — and with it the realistic prospect for a golden nuclear age when electricity would be too cheap to meter and clean , safe nuclear plants would dot the green countryside .
The core of this hypothetical nuclear reactor is a cluster of tubes filled with a fluoride thorium solution .
1// compressor , 2// turbine , 3// 1,000 megawatt generator , 4 / / heat exchanger , 5 / / containment vessel , 6 / / reactor core .

When Sorensen and his pals began delving into this history , they discovered not only an alternative fuel but also the design for the alternative reactor .
Using that template , the Energy From Thorium team helped produce a design for a new liquid fluoride thorium reactor , or LFTR ( pronounced " lifter " ) , which , according to estimates by Sorensen and others , would be some 50 percent more efficient than today 's light - water uranium reactors .
If the US reactor fleet could be converted to LFTRs overnight , existing thorium reserves would power the US for a thousand years .
Overseas , the nuclear power establishment is getting the message .
In France , which already generates more than 75 percent of its electricity from nuclear power , the Laboratoire de Physique Subatomique et de Cosmologie has been building models of variations of Weinberg 's design for molten salt reactors to see if they can be made to work efficiently .
The real action , though , is in India and China , both of which need to satisfy an immense and growing demand for electricity .
The world 's largest source of thorium , India , does n't have any commercial thorium reactors yet .
But it has announced plans to increase its nuclear power capacity : Nuclear energy now accounts for 9 percent of India 's total energy ; the government expects that by 2050 it will be 25 percent , with thorium generating a large part of that .
China plans to build dozens of nuclear reactors in the coming decade , and it hosted a major thorium conference last October .
The People 's Republic recently ordered mineral refiners to reserve the thorium they produce so it can be used to generate nuclear power .
In the United States , the LFTR concept is gaining momentum , if more slowly .
Sorensen and others promote it regularly at energy conferences .
Renowned climatologist James Hansen specifically cited thorium as a potential fuel source in an " Open Letter to Obama " after the election .
And legislators are acting , too .
At least three thorium - related bills are making their way through the Capitol , including the Senate 's Thorium Energy Independence and Security Act , cosponsored by Orrin Hatch of Utah and Harry Reid of Nevada , which would provide $ 250 million for research at the Department of Energy .
" I do n't know of anything more beneficial to the country , as far as environmentally sound power , than nuclear energy powered by thorium , " Hatch says .
( Both senators have long opposed nuclear waste dumps in their home states . )
Unfortunately , $ 250 million wo n't solve the problem .
The best available estimates for building even one molten salt reactor run much higher than that .
And there will need to be lots of startup capital if thorium is to become financially efficient enough to persuade nuclear power executives to scrap an installed base of conventional reactors .
" What we have now works pretty well , " says John Rowe , CEO of Exelon , a power company that owns the country 's largest portfolio of nuclear reactors , " and it will for the foreseeable future . "
Critics point out that thorium 's biggest advantage — its high efficiency — actually presents challenges .
Since the reaction is sustained for a very long time , the fuel needs special containers that are extremely durable and can stand up to corrosive salts .
The combination of certain kinds of corrosion - resistant alloys and graphite could meet these requirements .
But such a system has yet to be proven over decades .
And LFTRs face more than engineering problems ; they 've also got serious perception problems .
To some nuclear engineers , a LFTR is a little ... unsettling .
It 's a chaotic system without any of the closely monitored control rods and cooling towers on which the nuclear industry stakes its claim to safety .
A conventional reactor , on the other hand , is as tightly engineered as a jet fighter .
And more important , Americans have come to regard anything that 's in any way nuclear with profound skepticism .
So , if US utilities are unlikely to embrace a new generation of thorium reactors , a more viable strategy would be to put thorium into existing nuclear plants .
In fact , work in that direction is starting to happen — thanks to a US company operating in Russia .
Located outside Moscow , the Kurchatov Institute is known as the Los Alamos of Russia .
Much of the work on the Soviet nuclear arsenal took place here .
In the late ' 80s , as the Soviet economy buckled , Kurchatov scientists found themselves wearing mittens to work in unheated laboratories .
Then , in the mid-'90s , a savior appeared : a Virginia company called Thorium Power .

Footprint 2,000 - 3,000 square feet , with no need for a buffer zone Founded by another Alvin — American nuclear physicist Alvin Radkowsky — Thorium Power , since renamed Lightbridge , is attempting to commercialize technology that will replace uranium with thorium in conventional reactors .
From 1950 to 1972 , Radkowsky headed the team that designed reactors to power Navy ships and submarines , and in 1977 Westinghouse opened a reactor he had drawn up — with a uranium thorium core .
The reactor ran efficiently for five years until the experiment was ended .
Radkowsky formed his company in 1992 with millions of dollars from the Initiative for Proliferation Prevention Program , essentially a federal make - work effort to keep those chilly former Soviet weapons scientists from joining another team .
The reactor design that Lightbridge created is known as seed - and - blanket .
Its core consists of a seed of enriched uranium rods surrounded by a blanket of rods made of thorium oxide mixed with uranium oxide .
This yields a safer , longer - lived reaction than uranium rods alone .
It also produces less waste , and the little bit it does leave behind is unsuitable for use in weapons .
CEO Seth Grae thinks it 's better business to convert existing reactors than it is to build new ones .
" We 're just trying to replace leaded fuel with unleaded , " he says .
" You do n't have to replace engines or build new gas stations . "
Grae is speaking from Abu Dhabi , where he has multimillion - dollar contracts to advise the United Arab Emirates on its plans for nuclear power .
In August 2009 , Lightbridge signed a deal with the French firm Areva , the world 's largest nuclear power producer , to investigate alternative nuclear fuel assemblies .
Until developing the consulting side of its business , Lightbridge struggled to build a convincing business model .
Now , Grae says , the company has enough revenue to commercialize its seed - and - blanket system .
It needs approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission — which could be difficult given that the design was originally developed and tested in Russian reactors .
Then there 's the nontrivial matter of winning over American nuclear utilities .
Seed - and - blanket does n't just have to work — it has to deliver a significant economic edge .
For Sorensen , putting thorium into a conventional reactor is a half measure , like putting biofuel in a Hummer .
But he acknowledges that the seed - and - blanket design has potential to get the country on its way to a greener , safer nuclear future .
" The real enemy is coal , " he says .
" I want to fight it with LFTRs — which are like machine guns — instead of with light - water reactors , which are like bayonets .
But when the enemy is spilling into the trench , you affix bayonets and go to work . "
The thorium battalion is small , but — as nuclear physics demonstrates — tiny forces can yield powerful effects .

I think judgment matters .
If you have something that you do n’t want anyone to know , maybe you should n’t be doing it in the first place .
If you really need that kind of privacy , the reality is that search engines — including Google — do retain this information for some time and it ’s important , for example , that we are all subject in the United States to the Patriot Act and it is possible that all that information could be made available to the authorities .
This , from 2006 , is my response :
Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power , even if we ’re doing nothing wrong at the time of surveillance .
We do nothing wrong when we make love or go to the bathroom .
We are not deliberately hiding anything when we seek out private places for reflection or conversation .
We keep private journals , sing in the privacy of the shower , and write letters to secret lovers and then burn them .
Privacy is a basic human need .
[…]
For if we are observed in all matters , we are constantly under threat of correction , judgment , criticism , even plagiarism of our own uniqueness .
We become children , fettered under watchful eyes , constantly fearful that — either now or in the uncertain future — patterns we leave behind will be brought back to implicate us , by whatever authority has now become focused upon our once - private and innocent acts .
We lose our individuality , because everything we do is observable and recordable .

This is the loss of freedom we face when our privacy is taken from us .
This is life in former East Germany , or life in Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq .
And it ’s our future as we allow an ever - intrusive eye into our personal , private lives .
Too many wrongly characterize the debate as “ security versus privacy . ”
The real choice is liberty versus control .
Tyranny , whether it arises under threat of foreign physical attack or under constant domestic authoritative scrutiny , is still tyranny .
Liberty requires security without intrusion , security plus privacy .
Widespread police surveillance is the very definition of a police state .
And that ’s why we should champion privacy even when we have nothing to hide .

A Pakistani newspaper reports the arrest of five foreign nationals after a raid in a town called Sargodha .
The raid took place at the home of a member of the Jaish - e - Muhammad , a Pakistani movement designated as a terrorist group by the U.S. Treasury Department in 2001 .
According to the report , " The DPO told that these people had been living in Sargodha since Nov 30 and it was quite a possibility that they were engaged in acts of terrorism . "
It names the five as Ahmed Abdullah , Waqar Hassan Khan , Eman Hassan , Yasir and Rami Zamzam and describes them as two Yemenis , an Egyptian , a Swede and a U.S. - born Pakistani .
December 8 : Federal investigators are searching for a Howard University dental student and four other missing Muslim men reported missing from the Washington , D.C. area , the Investigative Project on Terrorism ( IPT ) has learned .
There is concern they may have been sent abroad to train for jihad .
The five were last seen November 29 .
The identities of two of the missing men , Howard student Ramy Zamzam and Waqar Khan , have been mentioned in online postings , including a Facebook page that was set up Monday for friends to offer their support .
Some of those pages , however , appear restricted to friends and associates .
It is not clear where the men are believed to have gone , but an informed source told the IPT that at least one left behind a farewell video .
According to the Facebook and Twitter postings , Zamzam is among the missing .
He has been active in the Muslim Students Association , serving as president of the MSA DC Council .
A Howard University spokeswoman has not responded to questions from the IPT .
The disappearance comes as U.S. officials are increasingly concerned about the threat of homegrown Islamist extremism .
This concern is prompted by a spike in attacks like the Fort Hood massacre , and conspiracies broken up by law enforcement before any attacks took place .
President Obama noted the increase during his speech last week at West Point explaining the Afghanistan surge :
" In the last few months alone , we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror . "
Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano echoed that sentiment in a speech last week .
" We are seeing young Americans who are inspired by Al Qaeda and radical ideology , " she said .
On Monday , federal prosecutors charged a Chicago man with six counts of conspiracy tied to the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai , India that killed more than 170 people , including six Americans .
That attack was believed to be carried out by Lashkar - e - Taiba , a Pakistani terrorist group that has been implicated in conspiracies in Virginia , Toronto and elsewhere .
On the surface , at least , the situation in Washington resembles the case of 20 young Somalis who disappeared from the Minneapolis area a year ago .
They are believed to have made their way back to Somalia , where they trained with the Al - Shabaab terrorist group .
At least three of those men have died , including one who became the first known American citizen to carry out a suicide bombing .
Fourteen people have been indicted in relation to the Somali recruitment effort .
Little is known about Zamzam .
In 2008 , he was part of a student effort in northern Virginia to solicit mosques throughout the country to raise money to build a new mosque .
He also posted a comment indicating he thought women were required by Islam to cover themselves and that Muslim women who did not faced punishment from God .
" Those that do n't , then woe to them for a day where all will be held accountable for what they put forth in the life of this world , and Allah SWT wrongs no one , and He is the Most Just , Most Merciful . "
This is interesting :
Most Americans fail to appreciate that the Civil Rights movement was about the overthrow of an entrenched political order in each of the Southern states , that the segregationists who controlled this order did not hesitate to employ violence ( law enforcement , paramilitary , mob ) to preserve it , and that for nearly a century the federal government tacitly or overtly supported the segregationist state governments .
That the Civil Rights movement employed nonviolent tactics should fool us no more than it did the segregationists , who correctly saw themselves as being at war .
Significant change was never going to occur within the political system : it had to be forced .
The aim of the segregationists was to keep the federal government on the sidelines .
The aim of the Civil Rights movement was to “ capture ” the federal government — to get it to apply its weight against the Southern states .
As to why it matters : a major reason we were slow to grasp the emergence and extent of the insurgency in Iraq is that it did n’t — and does n’t — look like a classic insurgency .
In fact , the official Department of Defense definition of insurgency still reflects a Vietnam era understanding of the term .
Looking at the Civil Rights movement as an insurgency is useful because it assists in thinking more comprehensively about the phenomenon of insurgency and assists in a more complete — and therefore more useful — definition of the term .
Barbarians ( 14 ) 25
Tries : Habana ( 3 ) Cons : Giteau ( 2 ) Pens : Giteau , Steyn
New Zealand ( 10 ) 18
Tries : Smith , Boric Con : Donald Pens : Donald , Delany A hat - trick of tries by Springbok Bryan Habana inspired the Barbarians to only their second - ever win over New Zealand .
Habana notched two dazzling breakaway scores in the first half with the All Blacks replying with a Ben Smith try .
A Matt Giteau penalty made it 17 - 10 before lock Anthony Boric bundled over for an unconverted New Zealand score .
Giteau and Morne Steyn combined to set up Habana for his third , and Steyn 's late penalty ended New Zealand 's 100 % record in the final game of their tour .
The first half was a scrappy but entertaining affair , and despite New Zealand 's weeks of touring and playing together , it was the Barbarians who seemed to gel more quickly .
Stephen Donald had kicked a New Zealand penalty before the Baa - Baas claimed the first try in trademark cavalier fashion .
It is unbelievable .
To come together last Sunday , have a couple of training sessions and then produce a performance like that
Jamie Roberts Drew Mitchell scooped up a loose ball inside his own 22 and sprinted 50 yards up the touchline before off - loading to the supporting Habana , who raced away to dive over in the left - hand corner .
This roused New Zealand into life , and Zac Guildford looked on course to level from a Brendon Leonard - inspired attack , only to be denied by a superb smother tackle by Fourie du Preez .
But it was only a temporary delay to the inevitable , and it was winger Smith who went over in the right corner after Luke McAlister 's break in midfield sparked a superb move .
Leonard was again in the thick of the action when his dogged tackling denied Du Preez a second Barbarians try after Jamie Roberts ' off - load allowed him to run straight and punch a hole in the defensive line .
Heading towards the end of the first half , the All Blacks had the majority of possession but failed to turn it into points , and in the dying seconds they were made to pay .
Habana intercepted a pass near the half - way line and after several goes at juggling the ball finally got it into his hands and streaked away from the remaining cover o score .
Only a superbly - timed McAlister tackle stopped Rocky Elsom extending the Barbarians ' lead just after the break , bundling the Australia captain into touch right on the corner flag .
When Giteau 's penalty stretched the Barbarians advantage , New Zealand upped the pressure and finally got their reward when Boric powered over from close range after great approach work by McAllister and Rodney So'oialo .
606 : DEBATE
Really enjoyed the game and its nice to see the Barbarians evolve into the modern era by inviting the best from all over the world
wyngwili
But with 11 minutes left Giteau 's dart and offload made space for Habana to go over in the left corner to seal his hat - trick .
Replacement fly - half Mike Delany kicked a penalty after 72 minutes to reduce the All Blacks ' deficit to four points .
But Steyn stepped up to restore the seven - point cushion and despite New Zealand 's best efforts , the Barbarians held on for a famous win , their first over the All Blacks since their celebrated 1973 victory in Cardiff .
Barbarians wing Bryan Habana : " It is right up there with my best moments .
It was a fantastic side with an unbelievably talented group of players .
" To beat an All Blacks side who have n't lost on this tour is pretty special .
We understand the Barbarians ethos and rugby is all about friendship .
It has been an amazing week . "
Barbarians centre Jamie Roberts : " It is unbelievable .
To come together last Sunday , have a couple of training sessions and then produce a performance like that ... it is one of the best weeks of my life .
I am hugely grateful to the Blues for releasing me . "
Barbarians coach Nick Mallett : " Bryan Habana is exceptional , a fantastic player to coach because you do n't have to coach him .
He understands defensive systems so well , it is no coincidence he scores so many intercept tries , and he has such great pace .
" Jamie Roberts was absolutely fantastic like he was for the Lions in South Africa , so was Matt Giteau .
All the guys did a great job .
" Everyone remembers the 1973 match and the great try [ by Gareth Edwards ] .
Hopefully this will also go down in history as a great performance . "
New Zealand assistant coach Wayne Smith : " It is disappointing , although the Barbarians are a great team and it was a joy to play in that match .
" We gave away a couple of sloppy tries against the run of play and could n't quite peg it back .
But we wanted to give these guys another opportunity , that was an objective of the tour . "

French Bliss The Irrepressible ( and Kind of Disturbing ) Rise of Phoenix
The release of French rock band Phoenix 's 2006 album It 's Never Been Like
That caused an obsession to sweep across my group of friends like a contagion .
A few of us had been fans nearly from the start — Phoenix 's 2000 single " Too Young " made us early believers — but It 's Never Been Like
That had a unifying quality to it that seemed to make everyone in the room feel a little brighter whenever it was playing .
Over the summer , we played that record into the ground .
It was a mandatory soundtrack to every barbecue and house party , and somehow it seemed to never wear out its welcome .
When Phoenix ( Laurent " Branco " Brancowitz , Thomas Mars , Deck D'Arcy , and Christian Mazzalai ) came through on tour to support It 's Never Been Like That , they played the Crocodile , and we all got tickets .
We stood up front and chanted along , dancing , smiling , and swaying in unison .
Onstage , the band breathed a sleek and exotic air into their songs , with each instrument adding intricate visceral layers of sound to create a fully realized string of pop gems .
It may have been just another rock concert , but it felt like a taste of a singular foreign delicacy .
As years passed , we waited patiently for a new album , and when it came , we were overjoyed .
Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix was a pop masterpiece , meticulously crafted and sparkling from start to finish .
But then it started happening , like we all knew it would : Everybody else heard the record and loved it , too .
Pitchfork raved about it , calling Phoenix " a bona fide ' should be bigger ' band . "
Their songs began popping up in Cadillac commercials and on Entourage .
They played every late - night TV show in America .
Seattle 's 107.7
The End started airing their single regularly , an act that has historically signaled the end of everything that was once good and pure in a band 's music .
This week , Phoenix return to Seattle to perform at The End 's annual Deck the Hall Ball , held in the massive cement tomb known as WaMu Theater .
As a longtime fan of the band and a realist , I 'm not surprised at all that Phoenix have become so popular .
It is surprising , however , to band guitarist Laurent " Branco " Brancowitz .
" Actually , we thought that this album was going to appeal only to connoisseurs , to music lovers , " says Branco .
" We did this album with this in mind , the fact that with the internet , we could reach the few people who would love this kind of music .
We never imagined it would go beyond a close , small circle .
It 's really great what 's happening with the album , because it was done with very pure intentions . "
For nearly a decade , Phoenix have been playing moderate - sized clubs around the world .
Their current tour is a series of major radio holiday concerts in music halls and arenas across the U.S.
" We are just discovering this world , " says Branco .
" We 've played big venues , but never stadiums .
We are not really a stadium band . "
Though Phoenix 's members are used to smaller settings , they 're not worried about losing a sense of intimacy with the crowd while performing on such big stages .
" It 's a different kind of energy when you are playing in front of a bunch of people , " says Branco .
" But we 've played in a lot of festivals — it 's just a different mode .
There is something great about the power you can conjure on a big stage , but we love both kinds of shows .
We will be very excited to play in small clubs in the near future .
It 's great being in a band where we can have that kind of contrast .
We always end up in a very small club with a very small stage , and it 's really cool .
We love that . "
None of my friends are going to go see Phoenix open for 30 Seconds to Mars .
That is not where Phoenix belong , but you can't really blame them for being there .
Thankfully , the band is n't too interested in following the arena - rock route much further .
It would seem they have little aspiration to become an international pop juggernaut .
" We are very happy with this amount of fame ... a very modest amount , " says Branco .
" Actually , we never really think about that .
What 's good is to have a level where when you make an artistic move , it has an effect on people .
That is the only level we want to have , where people listen to what we are trying to say . "
Japan is a country of fads and obsessions , and the latest among young women is an interest in history .
The trend is so big that one newspaper has put rekijo , or history girls , into its list of top 10 buzzwords of the year .
Roland Buerk reports .
Much criticism – positive and negative – has already been ladled on Ego " James " Cameron 's latest film , Dancing with Smurfs , aka Avatar .
But one point that has not been discussed is how much Sarah Palin would enjoy it .
On the one hand , considering that this movie features the most simplistic racial stereotypes since Star Wars ' Jar Jar Binks did his best Butterfly McQueen impression for George Lucas , Avatar is an obvious winner for Palin .
After all , she is the woman who , according to her father , left Hawaii University because there were too many Asians there for her liking : " They were a minority - type thing and it was n't glamorous , so she came home , " said Chuck Heath .
On the other hand , as Avatar comes weighed down with anti-war sentiments , topped with some environmental awareness waffle ( if discussions about trees having " energy " count as environmental awareness , as opposed to cod-spiritual ethno - tourism you might expect from Sting and Trudie Styler ) , this may not be the obvious festive outing for la famille Palin .
Sarah , of course , does n't really believe in silly - billy man -made " climate change " , describing it instead as " doomsday scare tactics pushed by an environmental priesthood " .
Doomsday ?
Priesthood ?
Has someone been reading Dan Brown ?
All of this dovetails with the most ­ important issue of the week : how to define the past decade .
After all , the 80s had bling ( according to Jay McInerney ) , the 90s had grunge ( according to Winona Ryder ) .
The noughties , or whatever we end up calling them , were surely defined by fakery : fake celebrities ( anyone who came from reality TV ) ; fake " reality " ( see previous ) ; faked news stories ( Balloon Boy , which has since been compared to Orson Welles 's War of the Worlds stunt – although , as far as I know , Orson was n't trying to regain the power he had when he appeared on Wife Swap , as Balloon Boy 's father , Richard Heene , was ) ; fake fashion designers ( any celebrity who sewed their name into the back of a badly made dress ) ; fake friends ( Facebook ) ; and fake communication ( " social " networking sites which tend to involve people sitting at home , alone , and not speaking ) .
Sure , some of these things were around before Millennium New Year .
But it was only afterwards that they became so ubiquitous and were given so much leeway .
That this decade should be summed up with the epithet of Fake is not so surprising , though , considering that we entered it with a fake – or " New " – Labour government , and then followed this with the fake election of a fake American president in 2000 .
Yet perhaps the most embarrassing , not to mention damaging , fakery has been the rise of " fake science " , which stems entirely from a fear of science and leads inexorably to no science at all .
We saw this on a terrifying scale when George W Bush banned federal funding for stem cell research , and we see it on a pathetically comical scale with Prince Charles selling Duchy Herbals Detox Tincture .
Sales of these kinds of supplements rise exponentially every year , just as stories about acai berries / pomegranates / whatever - the - trendy - fruit - is - this - week curing diseases continue to make headlines in respectable and unrespectable papers every week .
Michael Specter writes about the rise of fake science in his gripping new book , Denialism .
Although Specter generally keeps his palpable anger at bay , it breaks through in his chapter about the MMR jab furore , with particular ire reserved for certain well - known names connected to it ; namely , the actors Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy , and Tony Blair .
Yes , Blair is grouped with Ace Ventura and his girlfriend , the latter of whom has insisted that she knows the MMR jab causes autism because " there is an angry mob on my side " .
Specter writes ( to Britain 's shame ) : " What does it say about the relative roles that denialism and reason play in a society when a man like Blair , one of the democratic world 's best - known and most enlightened leaders , refused at first to speak in favour of the MMR vaccine ? "
That the MMR jab does not cause autism has been definitively proven by now , despite what McCarthy 's angry mob maintains ( she is said to be getting her own talk show , produced by that unfortunately frequent promoter of fake science , Oprah Winfrey ) .
But fear of the jab has led to the rise of another illness : there were more cases of measles in 2006 and 2007 in England and Wales than in the previous 10 years combined .
Fake science values naivety over knowledge , as it harks back to a non-existent age of innocence before the so - called corrupting influence of modern medicine .
Palin , too , has used this modus operandi : she is qualified to speak precisely because she is unqualified .
She is untainted by biased things such as facts and experience .
And that is why she would like Avatar : its depiction of " the noble savages " is , no doubt , a well - intended argument against the destruction of rainforests , but add in a couple of orange brush strokes and you have a Gauguin painting .
It is patronising , simplistic and offensive , like Palin and fake science .
Last year , incidentally , Palin sneered at the allocation of federal funds to projects such as " fruit fly research " .
Unfortunately for her these silly fruit fly studies have led to a greater understanding of diseases such as , um , autism .
Is n't science annoying ?

Former president Geroge H.W. Bush relaxes with his wife , Barbara , outside their home in Maine .
I first met George H.W. and Barbara Bush more than 10 years ago .
She had sent me a letter introducing herself as a fan of my novels and asking me to speak at her annual literacy fundraiser .
I said yes .
She also invited me and my family to visit hers at Walker ’s Point , the Bushes ’ historic home in Kennebunkport , Maine .
My wife , Michelle , and I were excited but nervous–we were especially worried that Collin , our then - 2 - year - old , would break a priceless family heirloom .
So as soon as we entered their front door , Michelle assumed a defensive position in front of Collin .
Mrs. Bush immediately put us at ease .
“ We ’ve had lots of grandchildren here .
Sit and relax , ” she said .
This laid - back air was bolstered by the former President getting down on the floor to show our daughter , Spencer , his “ scoop ” method for putting things away after a board game –this involved using the box top to “ scoop ” up everything helter - skelter .
While it was efficient , Mrs. Bush pointed out , it was n’t very organized .
“ Nothing ’s perfect , Bar , ” her husband said with a twinkle in his eye .
Since then , our families have spent some memorable times together .
Once , my son accidentally locked himself into one of their powder rooms at Walker ’s Point , and Mrs.
Bush had to ask someone to break a century - old window to get him out .
Another time , the former President took me for a ride on his boat , Fidelity III .
He said he only had one rule onboard :
If he was driving too fast , I should raise my hand .
After the seventh time that I was levitated out of my seat by the boat coming fully out of the water , I swallowed my pride and raised my hand .
Bush looked at me mischievously , said “ Faster ? ” — and then sped up .
On a recent fall day , I traveled to Maine to spend the afternoon with them . [ Click here for more behind the scenes . ]
Mrs. Bush met me at the door holding a white maltipoo puppy named Mini .
Her husband joined us for lunch on their deck facing the Atlantic .
At 85 , Bush is tall and trim , with a face that has seen much sun and wind .
His list of accomplishments is long .
He was one of the Navy ’s youngest aviators during World War II , a graduate of Yale , a successful businessman , a Congressman , an ambassador , CIA director , Vice President , and , finally , the U.S. President ( our 41st ) .
Out of a lifetime of amazing experiences , the one that Bush holds most vividly in his mind takes him back nearly 70 years .
“ It was at a dance in Greenwich , Connecticut , in December 1941 .
I saw this glorious girl in a green dress with red trimmings .
I asked , ‘ Who is that beautiful girl ? ’
Someone told me , ‘ That ’s Barbara Pierce . ' ”
They were engaged in 1943 and married in 1945 .
“ And ever since then , ” he added , “ if I ever got out of hand , the Silver Fox ” –this nickname said while looking fondly at his wife – “ would bring me down to earth . ”
Mrs. Bush , now 84 , smiled and nodded .
In the years that I ’ve known them , their good - natured banter has always been constant and easy .
After 64 years of marriage , the Bushes banter easily .
As newlyweds , they lived in Connecticut while he attended Yale .
Their first child , George W. Bush , was born there .
They have five surviving children and more than a dozen grandchildren .
( Their second - eldest , Pauline Robinson Bush , died of leukemia in 1953 . )
After moving to Texas and building a prosperous oil business , Bush entered politics .
He served in Congress for four years , followed by stints as the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and as chair of the Republican National Committee .
In 1974 , President Gerald Ford offered Bush his choice of plum ambassadorships to England or to France .
“ I told him what I really wanted was to be Ambassador to China , ” Bush said .
“ Even back then for me , China represented the future .
With so many of the world ’s people , it was inevitable . ”
He spent 14 months in that country as special envoy .
At the time , the U.S. maintained official ties only with the Republic of China on Taiwan , so there was no formal ambassadorship .
Bush and his wife enjoyed living in China and biked everywhere –
“ You ca n’t understand a country from inside a limo ” –until President Ford asked him to take another job : CIA director .
“ My friends told me not to do it , that it was a political dead end , it would finish me off , ” Bush said .
So why did he accept ?
“ Because my President asked me , and he knew I would do it . ”
“ Aside from the Presidency , I think it was George ’s favorite assignment , ” Mrs. Bush added .
“ It was a bad time .
Congressional commissions were investigating the CIA , and morale was low , ” Bush recalled .
“ But what I took away was the dedication and bravery of those folks working to protect our country . ”
Although he was director for just a year , he is credited with restoring the agency ’s reputation , and its Virginia headquarters is named for him .
Running the CIA was also the job that Bush believes best prepared him for the Presidency .
“ It showed me what intelligence can and what it ca n’t do , ” he said frankly .
“ I came to know the limitations of intelligence .
As President , that was invaluable . ”
As Vice President from 1981 to 1989 , Bush witnessed the Presidency ’s demands up close .
“ I saw the weight of the decisions Reagan had to make .
I saw the toll it took on him .
Every decision you make as President is going to have a tremendous impact . ”
After Bush himself became President in 1989 – defeating Democrat Michael Dukakis –the greatest challenge he faced was the Persian Gulf War .
“ We did n’t know how that would play out , but we also could n’t ignore that aggression .
When we were victorious , some people said , ‘ Why did n’t you stay and finish [ Saddam Hussein ] off ? ’
It was because I ’d given my word to the coalition that we ’d kick him out of Kuwait and then go home .
And we did . ”
Bush ’s son , George W. Bush , also dealt with a war in Iraq during his Presidency , and some people have speculated that the elder Bush disagreed with him about the conduct of that war .
In our conversation , they alluded to the criticism regularly leveled against the younger Bush only when Mrs. Bush said , “ As a parent , it ’s still hard to see your child endure it . ”
On a much lighter note , Mrs. Bush said that being the First Lady was , in her opinion , “ the second - best job in the country . ”
The best job ?
“ Being the spouse of the Vice President . ”
When I asked why , she said , tongue partly in cheek , “ Because nobody cares what the spouse of the V.P. says , so you can basically say anything .
But as First Lady , everyone pays attention to you . ”
More soberly , she continued , “ It can be a very powerful force .
You can raise money and awareness for some great causes . ”
During her husband ’s time in office , Mrs. Bush established the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy .
To date , it has awarded some $ 34 million in grants . [ Click here for more behind the scenes . ]
After Bush lost the 1992 election to Bill Clinton , the couple made an uneventful transition back to private life .
Since then , they ’ve divided their time between Walker ’s Point and a home in Houston .
Bush has continued to serve his country .
In 2005 , at the request of his son , he and Bill Clinton went to Asia to help in the aftermath of the devastating tsunami .
The trip led to the former rivals becoming close .
“ We have a genuine friendship , ” Bush said of Clinton .
“ Some people find it hard to believe , but not me .
With both of us having been President , we have a lot of common experiences . ”
The Bushes continue to maintain busy schedules .
A typical day for them may include any of the following : walking their dogs on the beach , going out on their boat , spending time with children and grandchildren , doing charity work , attending Astros and Texans games , visiting friends , and working at the Bush Presidential Library at Texas A & M University .
What advice would Bush give to leaders today ?
“ Politics can be civil and not personal .
It does n’t have to be shouting and questioning the other guy ’s motives .
Try to see the other person ’s view .
That means you have to listen and not talk all the time . ”
He was deeply offended by Rep. Joe Wilson ’s ( R. , S.C. ) outcry during President Barack Obama ’s September speech to Congress .
“ There has to be a certain decorum and civility .
And that was just smashed .
I thought , ‘ How low have we gotten here ? ' ”
While he said he does not agree with some of Obama ’s policies , Bush insists that all Americans should want the President to succeed .
On the state of the world : “ We need to get ourselves out of this financial mess and help Americans get back on their feet .
Globally , China and Russia remain critically important .
And I think we ’ve got to be careful that we do n’t fall into the trap of being against Islam because of the excesses of the few . ”
Bush on his 85th birthday
He ’d like to see some of his grandchildren enter public service .
“ Get in there to do something to help people , ” Bush said .
“ George P. [ son of Jeb , the former Florida governor ] would make a good one , and Pierce [ Neil ’s son ] has never met a stranger .
He can talk to anyone . ”
I asked Bush about what he thought his Presidential legacy would be .
Surprisingly , he chose not to answer the question .
“ I ’ve banned the ‘ L ’ word , ” he declared .
“ I just think it ’s better to let history sort out what you got right and what you got wrong .
But that does n’t mean you do n’t care . ”
When asked what ’s next for them , Mrs. Bush pointed heavenward .
“ You ’re showing a lot of confidence , Bar , ” Bush quipped .
“ I know you ’re going up , ” she fired back at him , “ and you ’ll take me with you , right ? ”
While the former President is in generally good health , he chafes at having had to use a cane since hip - replacement surgery in 2007 .
“ You ’re not in the game , just on the sidelines , ” he lamented about getting older .
“ Nobody will pick you for their team .
I do n’t feel as driven as I used to , not as motivated .
But I am looking forward to seeing my friends in Houston when we go there for the winter and doing some work at my [ Presidential ] library . ”
“ And jumping out of a plane when you turn 90 , ” his wife reminded him .
“ Absolutely .
I have every intention of doing that .
But piloting the boat keeps me young now .
It ’s something I really love and can still do . ”
Mrs. Bush added , “ And can do very well . ”
The fearless old Navy pilot smiled .
“ Well , a crash always makes a bad landing . ”

PARADE Contributing Editor David Baldacci is the author of 20 novels .
His latest is “ True Blue . ”
George and Barbara kick back at home .
Author David Baldacci first met George H.W. and Barbara Bush more than 10 years ago .
One of the author ’s favorite personal stories about the couple occurred after he , his wife , and their two children had been to stay at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport , Maine .
A few days after the Baldaccis returned home , they received a FedEx box from the Bushes .
Inside was a pair of tiny Tasmanian devil boxer shorts .
The accompanying note from Mrs. Bush read , “ I checked with George , and he said he was reasonably sure they were n’t his so we figured they belonged to your son . ”
Here are some extras from Baldacci ’s interview with the former President :
George H.W. Bush owns a Maltipoo named Bibi .
The Secret Service actually had to upgrade the chase boat it uses to shadow Bush to a Zodiac inflatable jet boat .
It ’s the only vessel that can keep up with him and his 70 - plus - knots scampers across the ocean .
George H.W. Bush ’s rules for success in business or politics are fairly straightforward .
“ Give the other guy credit .
Nobody likes a braggart . ”
As vice - president to Ronald Reagan for eight years , Bush traveled the world meeting world leaders .
Of Mikhail Gorbachev he said : “ I met him at a state funeral in the Soviet Union and we had a long talk .
Afterward , I wrote a cable to President Reagan , saying that with Gorbachev I believed we had a different kind of Soviet leader .
If I had been too much of a big shot to have gone to that funeral , I never would have gotten to know him .
It ’s all about people , face - to - face interaction .
I ’ve always tried to break down the formal walls and check in regularly with other leaders and not just speak through advisers .
For me , it ’s always made a difference . ”
In response to Baldacci ’s question “ Is it important that a spouse stand behind a politician ’s career ? ” Mrs. Bush said she believed that a wife had to be supportive of her husband in order for him to be truly successful .
“ Or a husband supportive of his wife , ” Bush broke in .
She shot back dryly , “ Thank you for remembering the wives , George , very liberal of you . ”
On the day of the Flight 253 incident , reporter Michael Rosenfield of WXYZ in Detroit appeared live on CNN during the evening news and reported that , earlier that day , another passenger was arrested on a different flight from Amsterdam to Detroit .
Same route , same airline , same day .
This report appears to have been corroborated by a woman who was apparently a passenger on that flight in an on - camera interview ; an interview which was even played at least once on CNN on December 25 .
However , the media subsequently blended this separate incident with the widely - reported “ failed bombing ” incident .
Hence , the many media reports of Mutallab “ screaming about Afghanistan ” despite the fact that the witnesses actually describe him as being amazingly calm and totally silent .
The End Run deconstructs this apparent , suspicious , and convenient misreporting .

January 4 , 2010
On Christmas Day , the public was inundated with reports that a 23 - year - old Nigerian had attempted to blow up Northwest / Delta Flight 253 , which had departed from Amsterdam , as it neared its destination in Detroit .
We are already seeing information coming out that indicates a deliberate cover - up on many fronts , to say the least .
One thing we have now learned is that a second man from Flight 253 was handcuffed and taken away by authorities on Christmas Day .
According to witness Kurt Haskell and his wife Lori , bomb sniffing dogs had detected something in his bag , which led to an extended period of questioning in another room , followed by his ( apparent ) arrest .
Government officials initially denied that anyone other than Mutallab was detained ; but , after other witnesses came forward to corroborate the Haskells , they had to admit that someone else was detained .
However , they cited “ immigration charges ” as the reason , and have since changed their story at least three more times .
As of now it seems they are trying to claim that this man was from a totally different flight , a claim that Kurt Haskell says is false and impossible because the passengers from his plane were “ quarantined ” and absolutely not permitted to comingle with passengers from any other planes .
He facetiously suggests that the government official who made this claim “ should become a comedian ” .
Haskell also says that he witnessed a “ nicely dressed ” Indian - looking man around 50 years of age approach the ticket counter with Mutallab in Amsterdam .
He says Mutallab “ never said a word ” as the Indian - looking man pressed the person behind the counter to allow Mutallab to fly , even though he did not , according to the Indian - looking man , have a passport .
Eventually the two were sent down a hallway to talk to a manager , according to Haskell .
So far neither U.S. nor Dutch authorities have acknowledge that this took place , instead opting to make what Haskell calls “ self serving play [ s ] on semantics ” .
Other passengers have reported that there was a mysterious man who video taped the entire flight with a camcorder , and when the “ attempted bombing ” occured , he “ sat up and videotaped the entire thing , very calmly ” .
Passenger Patricia “ Scotty ” Keepman , who witnessed this along with her daughter Richelle , has said : “ We do know that the FBI is looking for him intensely .
Since then , we ’ve heard nothing about it . ”
The rest of this article will provide new information that further points to a cover-up .
THE REPORT FROM THE “ UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE PASSENGER ”
On the day of the event , numerous passengers from Flight 253 were interviewed on camera while they were still in the airport .
One woman reported the following :
He was — stood up .
He was belligerent .
Uh , he was yelling , swearing .
He would put hats on .
He was screaming about Afghanistan .
Umm .
He was fighting with the wonderful s– err , stewards that we had .
There were five men — big men — and three women .
I said to my husband I was so thankful that there were three — er , five men on the , um , flight .
The video recording of this short interview is not easy to find online , but as of this writing it can still be viewed here , on the website of The Daily Telegraph , sandwiched in between interviews with two other passengers .
For your convenience I have uploaded her interview by itself :
Unlike most if not all of the other passengers who have been interviewed and quoted by the media , this woman was not identified by name at the time , and still ( to my knowledge ) has never been identified .
As far as I can tell she has never been interviewed again .
The other two interviewees in that Telegraph video , on the other hand , were both identified by name on Christmas day in many other places as Richelle Keepman and Melinda Dennis .
Both have been quoted in myriad other articles , and have subsequently appeared on mainstream news stations ( For example , Keepman was interviewed on CNN ’s Anderson Cooper 360 Degrees and Dennis on NBC’s The Today Show . )
In this early BBC article she is quoted along with six other passengers .
She is referred to as an “ unidentified female passenger ” , while all others are referred to by their full name .
THE MUTE CONSENSUS
Given that a week has now passed and the dust has been able to settle a bit , many readers who have been following the Mutallab story will likely be able to see that there is something wrong with this witness account .
Namely , all of the other passengers report Mutallab ’s behavior as being the total opposite of what this woman describes .
For example , in a video - recorded interview in the airport shortly after the event ( later aired and transcribed by CNN ) , passenger Melinda Dennis ( mentioned above ) told WXYZ news :
“ He did n’t say anything .
He was injured .
He was burnt quite severely on his leg [ … ]
He was very calm .
He did n’t show any reaction to pain or any feeling of shock or nervousness .
He just looked like a normal individual .
Appearing on the Fox News show “ On The Record ” on December 28 ( transcript ) , passenger Daniel Huisinga told guest host Shannon Breem :
… that ’s one of the strangest things about this experience is he was burned very badly , he was in a situation where he was being put in a headlock , dragged into the aisle , handcuffed , but he was n’t screaming , he was n’t yelling , he was n’t really struggling .
And , the — the scariest part of the whole experience was looking into the eyes of the person who at that time I thought had just sealed my death warrant and seeing no emotion , not even anger , no fear , just a blank stare , blank expression in the face of this unbelievable evil that he was attempting to commit against all of these innocent people .
Syed Jafry , a passenger who was three rows away from Mutallab , was interviewed by CNN’s Ali Velshi on the day of the event .
Here ’s what he said :
VELSHI : … did he look like he was struggling ?
JAFRY : No , he — I do n’t recall that he was struggling , more that he appeared to be more stunned and sort of surprised with the whole act . [… ]
VELSHI : Did he seem to be yelling anything or saying anything , uttering any threats ?
JAFRY : No , nothing at all .
I , at least , did n’t hear anything .
Maybe some other people who were closer to him may have heard him , but I did not hear anything ...
Jasper Schuringa , who the Herald Sun says “ has been hailed as the hero of Northwest Airlines Flight 253 ″ for subduing Mutallab , agrees :
FREDRICKA WHITFELD ( CNN ANCHOR ) : Now tell me about him .
Was he fighting you ?
Was he struggling ?
Did he just seem to , uhh , upon discovery just kind of let it go , and — and you all were able to kind of manhandle him ?
JASPER SCHURINGA : No , he was — he was just very calm .
Uhh , he was shaking though .
But he did n’t resist anything .
And uh , he was just sitting there .
And , uh , he looked like a normal guy as well .
But , you know , it was just , uh , just hard to — to believe that , you know , he was going to try — trying to blow up this plane .
WHITFELD : Was there — was there anything about him prior to that incident that ever made you look at him ?
Did you suspect anything ?
Did anything catch your attention about him ?
SCHURINGA : No .
Nothing , nothing , nothing .
Absolutely nothing .
So , it was a big , uh , surprise when we heard the first explosion people were just like looking around like , you know , “ Okay , this is not good .
What ’s going on ? ”
And then the first person shouted “ Fire ! ”
And then , uh , like I got to my sense and [ I thought ] okay this is wrong . [… ]
WHITFELD : Were there any words ? … was there any yelling , any screaming ?
SCHURINGA : No .
Yeah , well the — like the — like , like whole plane was screaming .
And uh , but the suspect , he , he , like he did n’t say a word .
No nothing like that .
WHITFELD : Never said a word .
Not prior , not during , not even once you all had subdued him and you were holding him waiting for authorities .
SCHURINGA : Well we were holding him , but he was n’t , uh , struggling , he was n’t saying a word , nothing .
He was just [ inaudible ] I guess . [..]
SCHURINGA : Well he was , uh , like , he was in trance .
By December 30 , the uniformity of the witness accounts with regard to Mutallab ’s behavior could not be denied , even by the major media .
Writing for Time Magazine that day , Michael Duffy and Mark Thompson summarized the descriptions :
Passengers later said there was something curious about the spare young man who had tried to bring down their plane : he was silent throughout the attack .
He did n’t panic .
He did n’t yell any last - second religious slogans .
He was calm and methodical as he set himself on fire .
It was as though he had been trained .
THE ANOMALOUS REPORT EXPLAINED
I began researching the “ failed bombing ” incident in the very early morning on December 26 .
I watched and read dozens of news reports , paying careful attention to the accounts of the passengers ( amongst other things ) .
I did this because I know that when these kinds of “ terrorist events ” occur there are usually early witness reports that contradict what will eventually become the official ( government - endorsed ) storyline .
Since I was looking critically at the witness accounts from the very beginning in this way , it did not take me long to recognize that the “ unidentified female passenger ” was an anomalous account .
Later that day , while discussing the incident with a family member , I mentioned the report of this unidentified woman .
She replied , “ Oh , she was probably on that other flight . ”
I , of course , had no idea what she was talking about .
She proceeded to tell me ( nonchalantly ) that it was reported on television the previous day that there was another man arrested on another flight from Amsterdam to Detroit whose behavior fit the description of this unidentified female passenger .
Having just spent hours reading dozens of media reports , I informed her that none of them said a word about such a thing , and asked if she could be mistaken .
She insisted that she was not .
I went online and searched , but could not find any reports of this .
Not one .
Then , finally , I found a single blog post which stated : “ CNN is also reporting a weird coincidence :
Another guy was arrested today on the same route , same airline , ( different flight ) for shouting “ pro-Afghanistan , anti-American ” statements and generally being rowdy .
Law enforcement say the two incidents are n’t related — the guy was just drunk ” .
The post included a link to the CNN video clip from Christmas Day — the same one my family member saw , which was , as far as I can tell , the only broadcast in which this story was ever reported on live .
( Part of it re-aired at least once , see below ) .
Here it is :
Here is a transcript :
MICHAEL ROSENFIELD :
We have also learned about another incident , also on board a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit this afternoon .
Another passenger was arrested on that flight as well .
Federal officials and local law enforcement here do n’t think the two incidents were connected , but it also did happen on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit .
A passenger was yelling pro-Afghanistan statements , anti-American statements as well .
He was throwing food on passengers in the back part of the plane .
He was taken into custody , but law enforcement officials here on the ground tell us they think that it was just a drunk passenger .
They do not think these two incidents were connected .
Live in Detroit , I ’m Michael Rosenfield .
Back to you .
ALI VELSHI ( CNN ANCHOR ) : Mike , was that a — was that a Northwest flight as well coming in from Amsterdam , or was that a different flight ?
ROSENFIELD : Yeah , that was also a Northwest Delta flight also coming in from Amsterdam to Detroit .
Another incident on that case .
But again , law enforcement officials think that they were not connected .
But , uh , pretty coincidental that both happened on the same route on the same day .
Now does the unidentified woman — who , in diametric opposition to all of the other witnesses , reported that “ he ” ( who ? ) “ stood up ” , was “ beligerent ” , “ yelling ” , “ swearing ” , “ screaming about Afghanistan ” , “ fighting with the stewards ” , and “ would put hats on ” — make sense ?
If you go back and watch her interview ( or read the transcript ) , you ’ll notice that she gives no indication that she was on the plane with Mutallab whatsoever .
She does not say one word about the “ failed bombing ” .
She simply describes someone ’s unruly behavior ( clearly not Mutallab ) , and even seems somewhat amused by it .
Can there be any doubt that she corroborates Rosenfield ’s report and was in fact on that other flight that the media , for some reason , has failed to speak of ever again ?
THE SUNDAY INCIDENT
If you answered “ no , there can be no doubt ” to that question , then this information ought to raises a lot of new questions .
For instance , are we to believe that CNN and WXYZ did not see Rosenfield ’s report as worthy of following up on ?
Or even mentioning ever again ( save one partial re-airing the following morning as described below ) ?
Are we to believe that every other news station simply missed this story , or else saw it and found it equally uninteresting ?
These kinds of considerations are particularly implausible in light of the fact that ( ” coincidentally ” , I guess ) an extremely similar “ coincidence ” occurred on Sunday , and became a top news story of the day , if not the top story .
It was covered in detail by most if not all major media outlets , including CNN .
Here are a few of the countless headlines with links to the articles .

Not one of these articles about the Sunday incident makes any mention of the extremely similar incident reported by Rosenfield on Friday ; not even the one published by CNN !
Did CNN have amnesia ?
THE RE - AIRING
The full , live Rosenfield report aired shortly before 8:45 pm EST on Christmas day .
The Christmas Day part is made clear by his statements .
That it ’s nighttime is obvious in the video .
I originally derived the timeframe based on two posts found on message boards from Christmas Day .
Post # 1 : On the Professional Pilots Rumor Network ( PPRuNe.org ) the user “ AASLF ” in “ DFW , Tx ” said :
“ CNN News here reporting a SECOND – separate NWA flt ex-AMS / DET today had a pax arrested on landing for shouting anti-American / pro-AQ speech in cabin and throwing food at pax .
It is believed this pax was “ merely ” drunk .
Coincidence ??? ”
This post was dated December 25 , 2009 , at 2:45 .
After browsing the PPRuNe.org site it seems that their clock is set six hours ahead of Eastern Standard Time , meaning that it was posted at 8:45 pm EST .
Post # 2 : Another post made by a user on the DetroitLuv.com message board , stamped 8:54 pm on Dec 25 ( that forum ’s clock appears to be on set to EST ) reads :
“ … and to add more strangeness , a second man , on a separate Amsterdam to Detroit flight , was taken off a plane upon landing shouting anti-American slogans ( and pro-Afghani ones ) and throwing food on the other passengers .
Weirdness . ”
CNN has now released a transcript of that Dec 25 broadcast , which begins at “ 20:00 ET ” ( 8:00 pm EST ) .
Rosenfield ’s report comes roughly two - thirds of the way through the broadcast , confirming the time frame implied by those message board posts .
The CNN transcript reveals a few things :
1 ) Rosenfield ’s entire report was considerably longer than that video clip .
Before giving the “ second flight ” report , he first reported on the main Mutallab incident for what must have been at least two or three minutes , playing clips from witnesses .
2 ) A few minutes after Rosenfield ’s report , Velshi did summarized it in his own words :
“ We did hear from a reporter in Detroit a few minutes ago , Michael Rosenfield , about another passenger on a different flight also a Delta Northwest flight coming in from Amsterdam to Detroit .
This passenger was arrested earlier today .
Now have word from Delta Airlines that that passenger was intoxicated , caused a disturbance and was subdued .
That flight was also met by authorities at the request of the crew .
Delta at least for now does not believe that that incident was in any way related to the incident on Northwest 253 that we ’re discussing now .
That is the Northwest flight that came in from Amsterdam to Detroit and moments before landing , a passenger attempted to ignite something on the plane .
3 ) Remember that , after Rosenfield finished his report , Velshi asked him if the second incident was on the same airline , to which Rosenfield said yes , it was the same airline and route on the same day .
That is where the video I found cuts off , but in the transcript we can see that , before moving on , Velshi replied “ Michael , thanks very much for all this information .
We appreciate it .
We ’ll be checking in with you again . ”
I see no indication that they ever did check in with him again .
I see zero articles written about this story by CNN or a single other news outlet .
I see no indication that Rosenfield ’s report was ever re-aired except for one time the following morning ( Dec 26 ) on CNN Saturday Morning News .
The transcript begins around 7:00 am EST , and the re-airing of Rosenfield ’s report is found about two - third of the way down the page , so it probably aired sometime between 7:30 and 8:00 am EST .
Calling it a re-airing is n’t exactly accurate , though .
It was a partial re-airing .
What ’s interesting is that they play his entire report ( starting just after his original three - sentence introduction of general background information about the Mutallab incident ) , but the clip is cut off just before Velshi asks about which airline the flight was from .
Rosenfield ’s response that it was the same airline as the “ failed bombing ” , and his comment about the whole thing being “ pretty coincidental ” , were therefore not re-aired .
This is from transcript of this Dec 26 re-airing :
We have also learned about another incident also aboard a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit this afternoon .
Another passenger was arrested on that flight , as well .
Federal officials and local law enforcement here do n’t think the two incidents were connected .
But it also did happen on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit .
A passenger was yelling pro-Afghanistan statement , anti-American statements , as well .
He was throwing food on passengers in the back part of the plane .
He was taken into custody .
But law enforcement officials here on the ground tell us they think it was just a drunk passenger .
They did not think these two incidents were connected .
( END VIDEOTAPE ) HOLMES :
Well , a little scary there from our reporter from WXYZ , Rosenfield .
But everybody a little on edge and they will be for some time , especially during this holiday season .
BALDWIN : Yes , for good reason .
HOLMES : Yes .
BALDWIN : So that ’s the situation on the ground at Detroit .
Again , in the original live report from Rosenfield , just after the “ ( END VIDEOTAPE ) ” mark on the re-airing , Velshi asked Rosenfield , “ Mike , was that a — was that a Northwest flight as well coming in from Amsterdam , or was that a different flight ? ” , to which Rosenfield responded , “ Yeah , that was also a Northwest Delta flight also coming in from Amsterdam to Detroit .
Another incident on that case .
But again , law enforcement officials think that they were not connected .
But , uh , pretty coincidental that both happened on the same route on the same day . ”
It ’s a bit odd that Rosenfield did n’t include this very interesting and “ coincidental ” information in his original report until prompted , and it ’s also interesting that CNN left this key point out of the single re-airing of the clip , especially since the incident was apparently “ dropped down the memory hole ” after that entirely .
BLENDING THE UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE’S ACCOUNT WITH THE MUTALLAB INCIDENT
What did the major media do with the odd , extremely anomalous report given by the unidentified female “ passenger ” ?
Did they connect the dots to the second incident reported by Rosenfield ?
If not , did they investigate why on earth someone would be reporting Mutallab ’s behavior as being the total opposite of what all of the other witness reported ?
No .
What happened was the woman was rarely quoted at length after the first 24 - 48 hours .
Even during that initial period , her account was already significantly edited .
Here is an article from WITN , an NBC affiliate in North Carolina , published on Dec 25 , the day of the incident .
Like everywhere else , the unidentified female is presented as having been on the Mutallab plane .
Notice , however , that she is quoted in full , except for the part where she says that “ he would put hats on ” , which is possibly the most blatantly eyebrow raising part .
They simply omitted it .
The White House is now calling the frightening incident on a flight from Amsterdam to Detroit an attempted terrorist attack .
Passengers on that Northwest flight are talking about the experience .
Administration officials say a passenger ignited a small explosive device at the end of the flight .
Three people were injured , one of them the suspect .
A federal bulletin lists the suspect as a Nigerian national who claims to have extremist affiliations .
One passenger describes what she saw : “ He stood up , he was belligerent , he was yelling … swearing .
He… screaming about Afghanistan .
Um , he was fighting with the stewardesses .
There were five men on the flight .
I said to my husband I was thankful that there were five men on the flight and I kept tapping him because I was nervous and he kept telling me relax , relax . ”
The suspect has been taken into custody and is being treated for burns from the explosion .
In an article on Dec 26 entitled “ ‘ Smoke and screams ’ on board plane “ , BBC News quoted her this way .
( ” The “ man ” she is describing , at least according to BBC News , is Mutallab ) :
Another unidentified female passenger described the man ’s behavior during the incident .
“ He stood up .
He was belligerent .
He was yelling , swearing , ” she said .
“ He was screaming about Afghanistan .
He was fighting with the wonderful stewards that we had . ”
Just like in the WITN report , the bizarre “ he would put hats on ” line ( bizarre if you are trying to make this work as a description of Mutallab ’s behavior ) is omitted .
Also , again , note that she is the only unidentified passenger mentioned in the article .
There are six other witnesses quoted in the article , and full names are given for all of them .
On Dec 27 , Express.co.uk quoted her the exact same way as BBC News word - for - word , while also implying that she was talking about Mutallab .
The one difference is that Express.co.uk presents it all as one continuous quote .
Remember , in between the “ yelling , swearing ” part and the “ screaming about Afghanistan ” part , the unidentified female said that the person she was describing “ would put hats on ” .
WITN at least included an ellipsis ( dot - dot - dot ) to indicate that some words had been omitted .
BBC broke theirs up into two pieces with a “ she said ” in the middle , which is a little more ambiguous .
Express.co.uk gives us no ellipsis or anything else to that effect .
The “ hats ” comment has simply disappeared .
( Note : this could have just been a result of copying it from BBC News or elsewhere and not watching the primary source video . )
Another passenger described the man ’s behavior during the incident .
She said : “ He stood up .
He was belligerent .
He was yelling , swearing .
He was screaming about Afghanistan .
He was fighting with the wonderful stewards that we had . ”
Ironically , they quote Jasper Schuringa in the very same article saying that Mutallab was “ out of it ” and “ staring into nothing ” .
While the dropping of the odd “ hats ” line was significant , the media went on to make almost the entire rest of the quote disappear after December 26 .
All but one little part , that is .
If you ’ve followed the Mutallab story , you probably know which one I am referring to : the “ screaming about Afghanistan ” line .
Here are a some examples of the many articles in which the major news outlets used this one little snippet from the unidentified female ’s account and ascribed the behavior to Mutallab , even though it was not corroborated by any other passenger , and in fact was contradicted by them ( as was the rest of her account ) :
“ Detroit terror attack : ‘ He was screaming about Afghanistan ’ ” – Telegraph.co.uk ( headline ) Dec 26 “ A woman passenger from the plane described the man as standing up and shouting and “ screaming about Afghanistan ” .
Investigators were examining the residue of the device , which was thought to contain powder and liquid . ” Financial Times , Dec 26 – ” The suspected terrorist was said to have been yelling and swearing and “ screaming about Afghanistan ” .
– The Guardian , Dec 27 ” As the bomber was being manhandled away one woman passenger said he was yelling , swearing and “ screaming about Afghanistan ” .
– News of the World , subisidiary of News International Ltd. , which is owned by Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp , Dec 27 Abdulmutallab , described as a devout Muslim , attempted to ignite an explosive device on a plane from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day after shouting about Afghanistan .
– Times Online Dec 27
” When he was overpowered , Abdulmutallab was said by witnesses to be “ screaming about Afghanistan ” – The Guardian Dec 28 ” Although Abdulmutallab was screaming about Afghanistan when he was overpowered , it is to Africa we should look for the source of his fanaticism . ” – Mail Online , Dec 28 “ Abdulmutallab , described as a devout Muslim , was charged on Saturday with trying to destroy the plane flying from Amsterdam to Detroit on Christmas Day and placing a destructive device in the plane .
He had attempted to ignite explosives after shouting about Afghanistan . ” Times Online Dec 27 – ” Although it has been reported that he shouted slogans about Afghanistan as he tried to trigger the device , 23 - year - old Abdulmutallab does not fit the stereotype of a poverty - stricken jihadi … ” – The Independent , Dec 28
CNN APPARENTLY REMOVES THE UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN FROM AN ARTICLE ON THEIR WEBSITE
Notice that CNN is not one of the networks who makes mention of the “ reports ” that Mutallab was “ screaming about Afghanistan ” .
At least not anymore .
On Google , if you preface your search terms with “ site : ” , it allows you to search just within a specified domain ( like CNN.com ) or even subdomain ( like TRANSCRIPTS.CNN.com ) .
For example , the following search terms …
site:transcripts.cnn.com
“ Richard Gage ”
… will search the “ transcripts ” subdomain of CNN.com for any references to “ Richard Gage ” .
( Incidentally , Richard Gage is never mentioned in any of CNN ’s thousands of transcripts . )
If a subdomain is not specified , then it simply searches the entire domain ( all of CNN.com in this case ) .
If one searches CNN.com for the “ he would put hats on ” quote , they will discover that CNN played the full clip of the unidentified woman on Dec 25 .
However , viewing the full transcript that this search turns up reveals that they misattribute her words to Melinda Dennis .
Dennis herself is mislabeled as an “ unidentified female ” , the title that should have gone to the first woman .
MELINDA DENNIS , PASSENGER : He was — stood up .
He was belligerent .
He was yelling , swearing .
He would put hats on .
He was screaming about Afghanistan .
He was fighting with the wonderful stewards that we had .
There were five men , big men .
and three women .
I said to my husband , I was so thankful there were three — five men on the flight , because I kept tapping him that I was nervous .
And he kept telling me , “ Relax , relax . ” UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE :
He did n’t say anything .
He was injured .
I — he was burnt quite severely on his leg .
They were very careful in trying to make sure that he had nothing else on him so it was easy to see that — from the exposure that he had gotten significantly burned .
If we search CNN.com for just the phrase “ screaming about Afghanistan ” we get four results .
One is the aforementioned transcript .
The other three are all for the article entitled “ Passenger : Terrorist suspect seemed ’ stunned ’ ” :
We can see from the Google snippets that she is quoted just before Elias Fawaz in the article .
However , if one clicks any of the three links to the article , they are met with a message saying “ The content item you requested is not available at this moment . ”
Here is a working link to the current incarnation of the article on the CNN page ( it works at the time of this writing , at least ) .
This article still contains the part about Fawaz seen in the Google snippets in the image above ; however , the unidentified female ’s quote , which immediately preceded it , has been removed .
If we go back to our original search results and click the “ Cached ” link for each of the three “ Terror suspect ’ seemed stunned ’ ” listings , copies of the article do come up , but they also do not contain the unidentified female ’s quote .
What we can see by looking at these , however , is that the article was edited at least twice : once at 10:15 pm EST on Dec 25 and once the following morning at 10:24 am EST .
A search within the CNN domain for the article title , plus “ 12.25 ″ , reveals that one more edit took place at 9:27 pm EST on Dec 25 , before the other two ( although this could have just been the time that the article was first posted ) .
Another Google search reveals that the section about the unidentified female immediately followed the section about Syed Jafry — a section which still remains in the article .
Further advanced Google searching yields the entire section where the unidentified female was quoted .
Here is the deleted passage from the CNN report , which was previously appeared between Jafry and Fawaz , but was subsequently removed by CNN :
At one point the suspect grew agitated , a female passenger who did n’t want to identify herself , told WDIV - TV in Detroit , Michigan .
“ He stood up , he was belligerent , he was yelling swearing , ” she said .
“ He was screaming about Afghanistan . ”
The current version on the CNN website gives no notice of there ever having been edited or updated , even though this passage is now gone .
It just says “ December 26 , 2009 10:24 a.m. EST ” .
SOME MORE QUESTIONS
Why did someone at CNN apparently make a conscious decision to quietly remove this quote ?
Was it because they realized that she was not on Flight 253 ?
If so , why did n’t they notify the public of the initial error ?
Even if they did n’t originally think it was a big deal , it certainly became one once the media began quoting the same tiny snippet from her interview ad nauseam , painting a false picture of Mutallab ’s behavior .
Did they really not connect the dots and realize that she was apparently talking about the same man Rosenfield reported on ?
Did no one in the media make this connection ?
Did no one in the media remember anything about the story that CNN ’s Holmes called “ a little scary ” and Mike Rosenfield himself called “ pretty coincidental ” , even as it became increasingly significant , especially Sunday ?
CONVENIENT MISREPORTING
The introduction to this article makes reference to how all of this was “ convenient misreporting ” .
It was convenient because more and more information is coming out that makes this event look like a set up , and Mutallab a patsy / dupe manipulated by U.S. intelligence assets and other interested parties to play a role in this “ failed bombing ” , which will now serve as a pretext for further military action and probably an invasion of Yemen , virtual - strip - search body scanners at airports , renewal of the Patriot Act , and much , much more .
If you think this is a “ conspiracy theory ” , and that our wise and benevolent leaders would never consider doing such a thing ( guess again ) , let alone actually go through with it , you had better read some real history .
False flag terrorism is nothing new .
In fact , if this was an actual ( failed ) surprise attack , it would be an exception to the rule .
In the critical first days after the “ failed bombing ” , when the public was most actively seeking out information about the event and people were still forming their opinions about what had transpired , the widespread reports that Mutallab was “ screaming about Afghanistan ” at the time of the attack surely helped sell the claims being made by usually - anonymous “ official sources ” that Mutallab was a monster ; a true radical , linked to a larger “ al Qaeda ” - affiliated network which is planning to launch more attacks .
“ The Man , The Menace ” , as reporter Andrea Isom called him on Dec 25 .
Not a dull , quiet , “ poor ” - looking , “ surprised ” - looking patsy “ in a trance ” .
The mainstream press seems to have essentially quietly dropped the “ screaming about Afghanistan ” meme .
However , people who do not usually follow current events have largely tuned out already .
Most people who are still following the story , and who have noticed all of the passenger reports about how calm and quiet Mutallab was , will not have the information contained in this article and therefore will not realize that the reports to the contrary were apparently bogus all along .
Many will simply reconcile the supposedly “ conflicting reports ” in their minds as meaning that he must have been calm and quiet at one point , and “ screaming about Afghanistan ” at another .
This means that this convenient mythical image will live on in the minds of many .

All supernova explosions are violent affairs , but this onetakes the cake .
Astronomers have spotted a new type of extremely bright cosmicexplosion they think originates from an exceptionally massive star .
This breed of explosion has been long predicted , but neverbefore seen .
Like allsupernovas , the blast is thought to have marked the endof a star 's life .
But in this case , that star may have started out with 200 times the mass of the sun .
The supernova in question , SN2007bi , was observed in 2007 ina nearby dwarf galaxy .
Scientists knew at once it was somethingdifferent because it was about 50 to 100 times brighter than a typicalsupernova .
" It was much brighter , and it was bright for a verylong time , " said researcher Paolo Mazzali of the Max - Planck Institute forAstrophysics in Germany .
" We could observe this thing almost two yearsafter it was discovered , where you normally don?t see anything anymore . "
After analyzing its signature , astronomers published a paperin the Dec. 3 issue of the journal Nature confirming that it matchestheoretical predictions of a so - called pair - instability supernova .
" There were some doubts that they existed , " saidastronomer Norbert Langer of the University of Bonn in Germany , who did notwork on the project .
Langer wrote an opinion essay on the finding in the sameissue of Nature .
" There were severe doubts that stars that massive couldever form in the universe .
Now we seem to be very sure that there was a starwith 200 solar masses . "
In a pair - instability supernova , the star has neared the endof its life and exhausted its main supplies of hydrogen and helium , leaving ita core of mostly oxygen .
In smallerstars , the core continues to burn until eventually it is all iron , thencollapses in a Type II supernova , leaving behind a remnant black hole orneutron star .
But in the case of an extremely massive star , while its coreis still made of oxygen , it releases photons that are so energetic , they createpairs of electrons and their anti-matter opposites , positrons .
When the matterand antimatter meet , they annihilate each other .
This reaction reduces thestar 's pressure , and it collapses , igniting the oxygen core in a runawaynuclear explosion that eats up the whole star , leaving no remnant at all .
The discovery of this rare type of supernova suggests that afew stars actually can grow into such large behemoths ?
which has long been atopic of debate .
" I was never a believer in very massive stars , " Mazzali told SPACE.com .
" Seeing something like this explode means thesethings exist .
This is a fairly new development in the formation of stars . "
Since I have decent Internet access for a couple of hours , let me weigh in a bit on the craziness sweeping America .
Joe Klein reports on a town hall meeting where people think that Obama has larded the government with communists .
Bizarre — but I ’ve been getting equally bizarre claims in much of my mail .
And what ’s striking is the intensity .
I ’ve mentioned before that my hate mail has reached levels I have n’t seen since 2004 or so .
But back then , the hate was in a way understandable .
People like me were questioning Bush ’s bona fides as the great protector against terrorism , were claiming that he deliberately misled the country into an unnecessary war .
Those were strong charges , and in a way you could understand that people who idolized Bush ( believe it or not , there used to be a lot of them ) were upset .
But now I get spitting , incoherent rage over articles on , um , health care economics or macro modeling .
What enrages people so much about these pieces ?
Usually , it ’s impossible to tell — in fact , I often have the sense that the enraged correspondents have n’t read the things at all .
But that ’s OK — they know that I ’m corrupt , a liar , a Nazi , and have been spewing my evil in my writings .
The point is that whatever is driving all this does n’t have anything to do with the realities of what I , or , much more important of course , Obama say or do .
Obama could have come in proposing to pursue an agenda identical to Bush , and he would still be a socialist / Commie / fascist , with those of us who do n’t see it that way lying Nazis ourselves .
Something is going very wrong in the heads of a substantial number of Americans .
Three years ago , Sheila Blanco was not a vengeful woman .
She had a job she loved , teaching students music and English at Guildford College , and was looking forward to spending time in northern Spain where her son Mark , an actor and writer , was planning to move .
But on 3 December 2006 that all changed .
Mark , a 30 - year - old Cambridge graduate , died after falling from a balcony of a flat in Whitechapel , East London , during a party attended by , among others , the singer Pete Doherty – who Mark was trying to convince to go to a play in which he was starring .
An argument ensued and Mrs Blanco , who believes her son did not fall but was pushed , began a fight for justice .
And she is still fighting .
Well - spoken and impeccably dressed , she appears stern , reserved and detached – even a little cold .
" I hardly knew who Pete Doherty was , " she tells The Independent with a calm assurance .
" I was vaguely aware that he was a musician , but this man came into my life , destroyed it , then skipped off into the sunset .
He stuck two fingers up at everything I held dear .

" Whether it is the master , Doherty ; the dog , Johnny ' Headlock ' Jeannevol ; or the weasel in the middle , Paul Roundhill , they are all culpable in some way for my son's death , " she says of the three men known to have clashed with Mark the night he died .
Her determination to prove her son was murdered makes her a formidable foe .
In the early hours of that fateful morning in 2006 , Doherty 's minder , Jeannevol , had grappled with Mr Blanco and the singer 's friend , Roundhill , had punched him in the face .
Partygoers later said Mr Blanco was thrown out because his conduct was " socially unacceptable " .
Less than a minute after returning to the flat where the party was held , apparently to collect some belongings lost in the struggle , Mr Blanco was lying on the pavement with fatal head injuries , having fallen from the balcony .
A coroner recorded an open verdict and ordered a second , independent , investigation .
Mrs Blanco says her faith in humanity has been shaken by the " callous actions " of the men she holds responsible for her son's death that night .
" I am disgusted by human nature .
I came from a difficult background , which I do not talk about , and I think there are evil people around . "
She says she hates to hear parents whose children have died talking about how wonderful they were and says Mark was not special , even admitting that he was , at times , naïve .
" Mark was always going on to the next thing in his life and he trusted people to help him .
He would never have believed they would turn on him like they did .
He paid the price for his trust .
But I think he deserves justice in death , as anybody does .
" Mine is a bigger fight than just for one person .
I have beliefs and this is a democratic country ; if we want changes to be made , we need to make them ourselves .
The people of this country are owed a proper investigation and I consider myself lucky to be able to speak out , " she says .
Mrs Blanco balks at the idea of easing up in her fight .
" It is incredibly tiring but I can honestly say I have never woken up in the morning and wanted to take a day off , " she adds .

" I have not sat down and cried for a long time because if the adrenaline did not keep me going I would not be able to cope .
There is only me to deal with this .
I cannot burden my daughter , I have to be the one to push this fight forward .
I simply fail to see why people should get away with murder . "
In her three - year campaign to prove her son was murdered , Mrs Blanco has interviewed people who attended the party , as well as neighbours .
Johnny Jeannevol initially owned up to killing Mr Blanco but later retracted his confession .
Doherty and his cronies may not yet have faced Mrs Blanco but she believes their day of reckoning may be near .
Recently , she alleged that expert evidence supported her claim that her son was pushed .
Professor Richard Wassersug , an expert in anatomy and neurobiology , and Corrina Cory , a security expert with the engineering company Arup , found the actor 's injuries ( almost exclusively to the head ) were not those of someone who intended to fall or jump .
The possibility of suicide was officially ruled out by the second investigation , leaving only two possible explanations : Mr Blanco jumped , not intending to hurt himself , or he did not mean to fall at all .
In his report , Professor Wassersug wrote : " To sustain lethal injuries almost exclusively to the head in a fall from such a low height [ 11ft 7in ] would require more than just drug - induced poor co-ordination and slow reflexes .
" Based on the research , I stand by my opinion that it is extremely unlikely that Mark jumped deliberately , but if he did he did not intend to harm himself .
Given the nature of his injuries , the two most likely explanations are that he was backed into railings [ in front of the balcony ] and pushed over , or he was not conscious and was dropped over the railings . "
A character reference from a friend of Mark's , Dr Anthe George , suggests that he would not even have been able to stand on the balcony of his own accord because of his acute acrophobia .
" Mark was truly afraid of heights .
I do not mean he was afraid of standing on the edge of a cliff – he was afraid of any height . "
Mrs Blanco , who runs the website justiceformark.com , says she will not rest until it is proved that her son was murdered and his killer is brought to justice .
And her steely glare leaves you in no doubt that she means it .

I always yearn for a warm bowl of Curry Laksa during the colder weather seasons .
There are many varieties of Laksa in Malaysia ; but , I still feel curry laksa is the most popular as compared to Asam Laksa , Laksa Kedah , Sarawak Laksa , and many more .
Curry Laksa is a coconut based soup that ’s infused with a variety of spices such as chili , galangal , turmeric , shallots , and pandanus leaves to fragrant the soup .
Throw in some noodles , bean sprouts , chicken , prawns , tofu puffs , eggs , cockles , and you have another great comfort food from Malaysia !

Taking the pill for past 40 years ' has put women off masculine men '
It ushered in the 1960s sexual revolution and gave women control over their own fertility .
But the Pill may also have changed women 's taste in men , according to a study .
Scientists say the hormones in the oral contraceptive suppress a woman 's interest in masculine men and make boyish men more attractive .
Although the change occurs for just a few days each month , it may have been highly influential since use of the Pill began more than 40 years ago .
Classic men :
In the Fifties , more masculine men like Burt Lancaster and Kurt Douglas were considered attractive
Tough guys :
In the Sixties rebels like Sean Connery and Steve McQueen made women weak at the knees
If the theory is right , it could partly explain the shifting in tastes from macho 1950s and 1960s stars such as Kirk Douglas and Sean Connery to the more wimpy , androgynous stars of today , such as Johnny Depp and Russell Brand .
Dr Alexandra Alvergne , of the University of Sheffield , says the Pill could also be altering the way women pick their mates and could have long - term implications for society .
' There are many obvious benefits of the Pill for women , but there is also the possibility that the Pill has psychological side - effects that we are only just discovering , ' she said .
' We need further studies to find out what these are . '
The links between the Pill and sexual preferences are highlighted in a paper in the journal Trends in Ecology and Evolution .
Scientists have long known that a woman 's taste in men changes over her menstrual cycle .
During the few days each month when women are fertile - around the time of ovulation - they tend to prefer masculine features and men who are more assertive .
On these fertile days , women are also more attracted to men who are ' genetically dissimilar ' , Dr Alvergne said .
Picking a partner whose genetic make - up is unlike their own increases the chances of having a healthy child .
Big hair : Long locks like John Travolta and Ryan O'Neal 's hit the spot in the Seventies
Softer look : Pin-ups like Rob Lowe and Michael J. Fox were popular in the Eighties
On days when women are not fertile , their tastes swing towards more feminine , boyish faces and more caring personalities , researchers have shown .
However , if women are taking the Pill they no longer have fertile days .
That means they no longer experience the hormonal changes that make them more attracted to masculine men and those with dissimilar genetic make - up .
Although the effect is subtle , Dr Alvergne said it could alter women 's view of male attractiveness .
' It is a possibility - but there is no evidence of this yet , ' she said .
' We need a lot more research in this area . '
In her paper , Dr Alvergne reviewed seven studies showing how the Pill can change women 's behaviour .
She also found evidence from three studies that the Pill can affect the way women are looked at by men .
Past studies have shown that men find women more attractive around the time of ovulation , possibly because women have evolved instinctive ways , by their natural scent or their behaviour , of alerting men that they are fertile .
One study showed that lap dancers get bigger tips at the time of the month when they are most fertile .
Dr Alvergne said the use of the Pill could influence a woman 's ability to attract a mate by reducing her attractiveness to men .

Datenschutz bei digitalen Büchern : Der Spion im E - Book
Digitale Lektüre ist praktisch : Man kann einst Gedrucktes in rauen Mengen mit sich führen und drahtlos neuen Lesestoff besorgen .
Doch was passiert eigentlich mit meinen Daten ?
Wer wann wo welches gedruckte Buch gelesen hat , geht niemanden etwas an .
Deshalb fallen zum Beispiel die Ausleihlisten von Bibliotheken unter das strenge deutsche Datenschutzrecht .
Doch was passiert eigentlich , wenn die Lektüre in digitaler Form vorliegt und über ein E - Book - Lesegerät oder eine entsprechende PC - Software konsumiert wurde ?
Technisch gesehen ist das neue Medium ein Paradies für Datenschnüffler : Die Systeme können prinzipiell auf die Seite genau erfassen , wer sich für welche Information wann interessiert hat und diese ohne große Probleme drahtlos auf Statistikserver ins Internet hochladen - Kindle & Co. besitzen immer häufiger einen eingebauten Mobilfunksender , der jederzeit aktiv werden kann .
Dank dem so genannten digitalen Rechtemanagement , das den Kopierschutz bei E-Books darstellt , sind die elektronischen Bücher zudem auf Einzelpersonen " gebucht " .
Die müssen sich mit Name und Passwort vorher anmelden , bevor sie Zugriff auf ihre elektronische Bibliothek mit dem Lesestoff erhalten .
Die Netzbürgerrechtsorganisation Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) beobachtet den Markt für digitale Güter schon länger - und bemängelt regelmäßig die Gängelung der Kunden durch Medienkonzerne .
Zu Weihnachten hat sie sich nun mit dem Datenschutz bei elektronischen Büchern beschäftigt - und kam zu teilweise erschreckenden Ergebnissen .
So sind die Nutzungsbedingungen vieler Anbieter erstaunlich freizügig .
Jedenfalls für die Konzerne , die die E - Books verkaufen .
Amazons beliebter E - Reader Kindle darf so laut EFF drahtlos " Informationen über die Nutzung des Gerätes " an seine eigenen Server übertragen .
Das Gerät speichert außerdem , welche Produkte gelesen und welche Suchbegriffe verwendet wurden und verknüpft sie mit dem Amazon - Account .
Ebenfalls erfasst wird eine Liste mit allen jemals gekauften Werken .
Amazon macht das auch für physische Produkte .
So kann mancher Stammkunde noch seine Einkäufe von vor zehn Jahren ansehen .
Die von Amazon erfassten Daten werden auf gerichtliche Anordnung an Dritte herausgerückt , der Konzern sichert sich aber auch zu , gesammelte Infos " zum Schutz eigener Rechte und derer anderer Parteien " zu nutzen .
Der Kunde kann sich derweil nur aus bestimmten Marketing - und Werbeprogrammen zurückziehen , so die EFF .
Google Books , der Internet - Buchservice der Suchmaschine , hat ebenfalls erstaunlich viele Möglichkeiten zur Datenerfassung implementiert .
So speichert der Dienst laut EFF nicht nur gelesene Bücher , sondern auch alle angeklickten Seiten .
Suchdaten mit Internet - Protokoll - Adresse werden 18 Monate vorgehalten und auf Wunsch mit dem Nutzernamen verknüpft .
Auch Google rückt Daten auf Anordnung an Ordnungshüter heraus , lässt sich aber ebenfalls zusichern , sie mit " dritten Parteien " zu teilen .
Immerhin verspricht Google nebulös , besonders sensible Daten von weniger problematischen zu trennen .
Barnes & Noble stellt mit dem Nook einen direkten Kindle - Konkurrenten , der derzeit allerdings nur in den USA angeboten wird .
Dort äußert man sich zur Erfassung des Lektüreverhaltens nicht , räumt aber ein , dass Suchanfragen und Seitenabrufe auf dem Web - Angebot des Buchhändlers erfasst werden .
Daten werden mit Behörden auf Anordnung geteilt , aber auch mit Dienstleistern und Tochterfirmen .
Nutzerinformationen können Kunden jederzeit verändern .
Sonys Reader , der in Deutschland lange Zeit das einzige E - Book - Lesegerät mit elektronischer Tinte stellte , erweist sich laut EFF unterdessen als Datenschutzprimus .
Das Gerät speichere keine Daten über Inhalte und sammelt nur dann Suchanfragen , wenn im E - Book - Laden der Firma eingekauft wird .
Buchkäufer werden wiederum nur im eigenen Buchladen erfasst , nicht auf dem Gerät .
Dem Reader dürfte entgegenkommen , dass er in der Grundversion ohne Mobilfunkschnittstelle kommt - würde Sony Daten sammeln , müssten diese mühsam per USB - Kabel und dann weiter per Internet an den Hersteller transportiert werden .
Manchmal hat Low - Tech eben auch etwas Gutes .

The Empire State Building is an architectural marvel , and one of the most spectacular attractions in New York City .
The building itself was constructed in 1930 during the Great Depression and is a living monument to that era .
The Empire State Building is located at Fifth and 34th Avenues .
For 40 years after it was constructed , it held the record for being the largest skyscraper in the world .
The building has starred in over 90 movies , and it remains one of New York City ’s most popular tourist attractions .
However , what most people do not know are the brave men behind the construction of the building that costs about USD40.5 millions .
One of them might be our grandfathers .
We should be proud of them .
Below are the photos of the fearless men behind the construction of the magnificent Empire States Building .

There are a lot of reasons for invention that goes beyond necessity , and pure want is right up there at the top .
A clever gent named Dave tired of making the 15 - minute walk to his freezing cold car , so he built a long - distance remote starter from a prepaid cellphone .
To make it work , Dave removed the vibrating mechanism that would signal a call after receiving pulses from the phone 's circuit board .
Then he wired the phone to send those pulses to the remote starter 's switch , and voila : two rings and the car starts up .
He is no longer limited by proximity when using the remote start ; as long as the phone gets a signal , he 'll have a warm car whenever he gets there .
Clever , no ?
Total cost of the hack was $ 71.03 , but that does n't include the remote starter unit you 'll need to buy and install in your car .
And speaking of installing , should you try this out you might want to conceal your handiwork .
These probably are n't the safest days to have someone coincidentally poking under your hood and finding a cell phone wired to your engine ... [ Source : Dave Hacks via Engadget

On Friday afternoon , Google made the biggest change that has ever happened in search engines , and the world largely yawned .
Maybe Google timed its announcement that it was personalizing everyone ’s search results just right , so few would notice .
Maybe no one really understood how significant the change was .
Whatever the reason , it was a huge development and deserves much more attention than it has received so far .
To put how little attention the change got in perspective , less than 50 news articles and blog posts were written about it , according to Google News .
In contrast , nearly 1,000 articles were written about a relatively minor change to Google ’s First Click Free program .
If you want to understand more about the change and how it works , see our Google Now Personalizes Everyone ’s Search Results story .
In this piece , I ’m going to cover why this is such a significant change .
Until now , search engines have largely delivered the same results to everyone .
Two different people could search for Barack Obama and get back the same set of results .
In fact , the results have been so consistent that people have used them as a universal navigation tool .
For example , Sony Pictures ran an ad campaign for its 2012 movie with the tagline “ Search : 2012 , ” apparently guessing correctly that anyone searching for that word would find the movie web site .
WordPress founder Matt Mullenweg has a business card that says to find him by searching for matt on Google .
The days of “ normal ” search results that everyone sees are now over .
Personalized results are the “ new normal , ” and the change is going to shift the search world and society in general in unpredictable ways .
Is a search for Michelle Obama showing a racist image ?
Maybe for one person , but not for another .
What are the results you get back for a search on the US health care debate ?
Fox
News might be all set to lambaste
Google for giving a liberal site top billing , only to find that CNN reports that it ’s a conservative site that ’s number one — and both stations might be wrong .
That ’s because the results each reports on will be only what their particular reporters at each station saw .
Their viewers may see different results .
In fact , each one of their viewers may see results different from one another .
Happy that you ’re ranking in the top results for a term that ’s important to you ?
Look again .
Turn off personalized search , and you might discover that your top billing is due to the way the personalized system is a huge ego search reinforcement tool .
If you visit your own site often , your own site ranks better in your own results — but not for everyone else .
Does this mean SEO is dead ?
No .
I ’ve warned for years that search results would be getting more personalized .
Still , for many queries , there will continue to be “ normal ” results until Google harvests enough information to start personalizing them .
SEO remains important to ensure that you ’ve got that first shot at being considered .
And the best tip in this new world of personalization remains the same .
Make a good impression .
Titles and descriptions are important , as is having outstanding content .
Are normal results really dead ?
They ’ve actually been dying for some time , as Google has “ group ” personalized results on a country - by - country basis , then on a region - by - region basis .
Those in the UK have long seen results slightly different than those in the US .
Those in San Francisco have gotten results slightly different than those in Los Angeles .
Some of this has been disclosed , as Google Now Notifies Of “ Search Customization ” & Gives Searchers Control from last year explains more .
Even with last week ’s new universal personal results ( now there ’s an oxymoron ! ) rollout , where everyone is getting personalized results , there should remain many searches where two people can do the same query and get very similar to identical results .
Personalization is n’t so dramatic that everyone will see radically different stuff .
In particular , Google told me it does n’t envision a future where someone who ’s conservative would get only conservative results while someone who ’s liberal will get only liberal ones :
“ We want diversity of results , ” said product manager Johanna Wright , when we talked about the personalized release on Friday .
“ This is something we talk about a lot internally and believe in .
We want there to be variety of sources and opinions in the Google results .
We want them in personalized search to be skewed to the user , but we do n’t want that to mean the rest of the web is unavailable to them . ”
Still , make no mistake .
“ Normal ” is dead .
This is n’t the personalized search system of old , where Google only personalized results if people were signed in .
In the new personalized search , millions of Google users have been opted - in to the system even if they are n’t signed - in using a Google account .
While people can opt - out of personalized results , I doubt many will do so .
That also means SEOs should n’t get distracted wondering about hacks to view “ normal ” results .
Even though the pws=0 technique still apparently works , it ’s not like typical Google users are using it .
Should Google have required opt-in ?
I ’m split .
Last week , I was talking about personalized search in general to someone who was concerned that Google would make exactly this move , without asking .
I explained that it ’s a tough call .
There ’s some reasonable expectation that you can use what people have told you before .
Imagine you ’re in a library — the classic metaphor for a search engine and how it interacts with a searcher , from when WebCrawler ’s Brian Pinkerton used to explain how they worked back in the 1990s .
Someone walks in and says “ travel . ”
In a library , the librarian would ask more questions , to try and understand what they want .
Early search engines did n’t do this .
They could n’t do this !
Over time , search engines tried to do the library - style conversation by offering related searches , as a way to get searchers to refine their queries .
Then Google took a huge leap last year by making use of your previous query to refine your results .
That makes sense and does n’t seem to require any particular reason to ask for user opt-in .
Again , imagine the librarian .
It would be unreasonable to expect them to forget the last thing you said in a conversation you were having , as they tried to help you .
Unreasonable and unhelpful .
But would you expect the librarian to help you by remembering everything you ’d asked over a half - year period ?
That might be helpful , sure , but it might also be eerie .
But this is what Google is doing now .
It remembers everything you ’ve searched for over 180 days , and it uses that information to customize your results .
To alert you about this huge change , it made a blog post on Friday afternoon .
That ’s it .
This is the second time Google widely expanded personalized search on an opt - out , rather than an opt - in basis .
Google Ramps Up Personalized Search covers how in 2007 , Google enrolled anyone with a new Google Account into personalized search .
At least then , it also showed a big notice on the search results page to alert you that personalization was happening .
With Friday ’s change , you have to spot the “ Web History ” link in the upper - right hand corner of search pages to understand logging is being used to customize your results .
Or you have to spot the “ View Customizations ” link .
When Google can expend some of its precious home page space to shill its Android phones , it ’s not unreasonable that it might consider alerting searchers to the personalized search change in this visible area .
It ’s not unreasonable that rather than immediately opting everyone in , it might have considered giving people 3 to 6 months notice that the change was going to happen .
Do n’t get me wrong .
I think personalized search is a good thing .
I think using the data in this way makes plenty of sense .
It will help improve search results ( see Search 4.0 : Social Search Engines & Putting Humans Back In Search and Eye Tracking On Universal And Personalized Search for more ) .
In addition , it ’s not like Google or the other search engines were n’t already logging it this way .
Still , the shift deserves more attention than it received through a Friday afternoon rollout .
The passing of old “ normal ” results deserves a better obituary than that .
Attention must be paid .
Searchers , site owners and others — take note .

That is to say , it 's not the same as man 's corrupted , fleshy one .
As I said when this subject first came up , once again : Penises are not just for sex & peeing .
It is only because man is evil that he thinks of penises exclusively in those terms .
Man is made in the image of God the Father .
That is the primary reason why man has a penis .
You cannot insert your evil prejudicial ideas of man 's penis onto God - which is exactly what you are doing .
God 's Penis is not equal to man 's penis .
It 's really not hard to understand .
Whoops :
The top prosecutors in seven states are probing the constitutionality of a political deal that cut a funding break for Nebraska in order to pass a federal health care reform bill , South Carolina 's attorney general said Tuesday .
Attorney General Henry McMaster said he and his counterparts in Alabama , Colorado , Michigan , North Dakota , Texas and Washington state - all Republicans - are jointly taking a look at the deal they 've dubbed the " Nebraska compromise . "
" The Nebraska compromise , which permanently exempts Nebraska from paying Medicaid costs that Texas and all other 49 states must pay , may violate the United States Constitution - as well as other provisions of federal law , " Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said .
McMaster 's move comes at the request of Republican U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham and Jim DeMint of South Carolina .
In a letter to McMaster , Graham singled out the deal to win Nebraska Sen .
Ben Nelson 's vote on the massive health care bill the Senate is expected to adopt Thursday .
Nelson held out as fellow Democrats worked to get 60 votes to foreclose a GOP filibuster and the bill was amended to shield Nebraska from the expected $ 45 million annual cost tied to expanding Medicaid programs .
" We have serious concerns about the constitutionality of this Nebraska compromise as it results in special treatment for only one state in the nation at the expense of the other 49 , " Graham and DeMint wrote .
Nebraska was n't alone in getting Medicaid breaks .
Vermont , Louisiana and Massachusetts also got help with their programs .[.. ]
Also Tuesday , U.S. House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn , D - S.C. , said Republicans need to stop complaining about deals their colleagues made .
" Rather than sitting here and carping about what Nelson got for Nebraska , I would say to my friends on the other side of the aisle :
Let 's get together and see what we can get for South Carolina , " Clyburn said .
Sponsors of California 's ban on same - sex marriage , which faces a federal court trial in San Francisco next month , have told the trial judge that his suggestion to televise the proceedings is both unwise and illegal .
Television coverage could expose witnesses and other trial participants to harassment and intimidation , backers of Proposition 8 said in a court filing Monday .
They said some of their witnesses " have indicated that they would not be willing to testify " if the trial was televised .

US President Barack Obama has said the " entire nation " is grieving after a shooting that killed 13 people at a Texas army base .
He said he had ordered all flags at the White House and other Federal buildings to be flown at half mast until Veterans Day on 11 November .
Meanwhile hundreds of people held a candle - lit vigil at the Fort Hood base .
Major Nidal Malik Hasan , 39 , a US - born Muslim and army psychiatrist , opened fire at Fort Hood on Thursday .
He was due to be deployed soon to Afghanistan , a military official said .
Family members said Mr Hasan was strongly opposed to the deployment and had wanted to leave the army .
Mr Obama cautioned against " jumping to conclusions " and said the motives for the shooting were being investigated .
ANALYSIS Adam Brookes
Washington Military officers have long expressed concern over the state of psychiatric medicine in the US armed forces .
Officers say privately that thousands of young men and women are returning from Afghanistan and Iraq with psychological problems .
Post - traumatic stress disorder can result in debilitating symptoms , ranging from anxiety to depression .
Earlier this year , the Pentagon committed $ 50 m to a study designed to investigate why suicide rates in the military are rising .
Officers are overwhelmed by the number of soldiers requiring treatment and they say there 's been pressure to retain psychiatrists inside the military system .
It is quite possible that if and when Maj Hasan goes on trial for these shootings , military medicine will be on trial , too .
" What we do know is that their families , friends and an entire nation are grieving right now for the valiant men and women who came under attack yesterday , " he said on Friday .
He added that the order for flags on federal buildings to fly at half mast was a " modest tribute to those who lost their lives " .
Later Japanese media reported that Mr Obama had asked to postpone his visit to Japan next Thursday by a day so that he could attend a memorial service for those killed .
The chief of staff of the US Army - Gen George Casey - said the attack had been a " kick in the gut " for the entire army .
On Friday , US soldiers and civilian residents at Fort Hood attended a candle - lit vigil in honour of the victims of the shootings , many crying and bowing their heads .
" Remember to keep breathing ... keep going , " Chaplain Douglas Carver told the crowd , quoted by AP news agency .
Over 100 rounds fired
The attack began at about 1330 ( 1930 GMT ) on Thursday at a personnel and medical centre at Fort Hood - the largest US military base in the world , home to about 40,000 troops .
The commander of the base , Lt Gen Robert Cone , told NBC News that , according to eyewitnesses , Mr Hasan had shouted the Arabic phrase " Allahu Akbar ! "
[ God is great ] before opening fire .
Deputy commander at Fort Hood , Col John Rossi , later said that more than 100 rounds were fired during the attack .
Col Rossi also confirmed earlier reports that the two handguns carried by Maj Hasan were not military arms , but " privately owned weapons " .
He said that the suspect - who had been on a ventilator in a civilian hospital - was transferred on Friday by helicopter to the Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio , Texas .
' Nightmare ' Maj Hasan was shot four times during the attack and is currently being treated in hospital under armed guard .
The policewoman who shot him first - named as Kimberly Munley , 34 - was among those wounded .
MAJOR NIDAL MALIK HASAN Born in US to Palestinian parents Joined the army and trained to be a psychiatrist Treated soldiers returning from combat zones Described as a devout Muslim Said to have been unhappy about imminent overseas deployment
Shock and insecurity at Fort Hood Mardell :
No clear motive Profile : Major Nidal Malik Hasan US media on Fort Hood shootings Fears for Muslims in US army A picture is beginning to emerge of the suspect , a psychiatrist who was transferred to the Texas base in July .
Reports suggested that he had been increasingly unhappy in the military and that his work at his previous post - Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington DC - had been the subject of concern .
His cousin told US media that Maj Hasan had been opposed to an imminent deployment overseas , describing it as his " worst nightmare " .
He also said that Maj Hasan had been battling racial harassment because of his " Middle Eastern ethnicity " .
Asif Qadri , who runs a clinic at a Muslim community centre where Maj Hasan prayed in Silver Spring , Maryland , told the BBC : " He seemed to be quite a gentleman ...
When I saw this news last night , it was unbelievable to me that this was the same person . "
The imam of the mosque , Mohamed Abdullahi , said : " I never assumed that someone who took care of the mentally ill would himself be having problems . "
SHOOTINGS AT FORT HOOD
Dealing with stress in the US military Timeline : Fort Hood shootings Reaction : US base shootings
In pictures : Fort Hood shootings A fellow Fort Hood soldier told the BBC that the incident could put pressure on Muslim American soldiers .
" It kind of puts a negative light on them and makes people distrust them because everybody is going to look at them [ and think ] : ' Well , you 're probably going to pull something like this ' , " the soldier said .
" And it 's a sad fact that that will happen . "
The New York Times said the FBI had been investigating internet postings by a man called Nidal Hasan that appeared to back suicide bombings - but said it was not clear whether it was the suspect .
Gen Cone said a graduation ceremony for a group of soldiers was taking place nearby at the time of the shooting .
" Thanks to the quick reaction of several soldiers , they were able to close off the doors to that auditorium where there were some 600 people inside , " he said .
" As horrible as this was , I think it could have been much worse . "
In an e-mail to the BBC , a US soldier stationed at the base described the venue as a large , open room where hundreds of soldiers were queuing up to get their pre-deployment checklists signed off .

Recently by Ron Paul : It Is Time To Leave Afghanistan
Before the House of Representatives : Statement Opposing the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act , December 15 , 2009
I rise in strongest opposition to this new round of sanctions on Iran , which is another significant step toward a US war on that country .
I find it shocking that legislation this serious and consequential is brought up in such a cavalier manner .
Suspending the normal rules of the House to pass legislation is a process generally reserved for non- controversial business such as the naming of post offices .
Are we to believe that this House takes matters of war and peace as lightly as naming post offices ?
This legislation seeks to bar from doing business in the United States any foreign entity that sells refined petroleum to Iran or otherwise enhances Iran ’s ability to import refined petroleum such as financing , brokering , underwriting , or providing ships for such .
Such sanctions also apply to any entity that provides goods or services that enhance Iran ’s ability to maintain or expand its domestic production of refined petroleum .
This casts the sanctions net worldwide , with enormous international economic implications .

Recently , the Financial Times reported that ,  [ i ] n recent months , Chinese companies have greatly expanded their presence in Iran ’s oil sector .
In the coming months , Sinopec , the state - owned Chinese oil company , is scheduled to complete the expansion of the Tabriz and Shazand refineries — adding 3.3 million gallons of gasoline per day . 
Are we to conclude , with this in mind , that China or its major state - owned corporations will be forbidden by this legislation from doing business with the United States ?
What of our other trading partners who currently do business in Iran ’s petroleum sector or insure those who do so ?
Has anyone seen an estimate of how this sanctions act will affect the US economy if it is actually enforced ?
The Revolution : A Mani ... Ron Paul Best Price : $ 1.99 Buy New $ 6.99 ( as of 11:00 EST - Details )
As we have learned with US sanctions on Iraq , and indeed with US sanctions on Cuba and elsewhere , it is citizens rather than governments who suffer most .
The purpose of these sanctions is to change the regime in Iran , but past practice has demonstrated time and again that sanctions only strengthen regimes they target and marginalize any opposition .
As would be the case were we in the US targeted for regime change by a foreign government , people in Iran will tend to put aside political and other differences to oppose that threatening external force .
Thus this legislation will likely serve to strengthen the popularity of the current Iranian government .
Any opposition continuing to function in Iran would be seen as operating in concert with the foreign entity seeking to overthrow the regime .
This legislation seeks to bring Iran in line with international demands regarding its nuclear materials enrichment programs , but what is ironic is that Section 2 of HR 2194 itself violates the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) to which both the United States and Iran are signatories .
This section states that  [ i]t shall be the policy of the United States to prevent Iran from achieving the capability to make nuclear weapons , including by supporting international diplomatic efforts to halt Iran ’s uranium enrichment program . 
Article V of the NPT states clearly that ,  [ n ] othing in this Treaty shall be interpreted as affecting the inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research , production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination and in conformity with articles I and II of this Treaty . 
As Iran has never been found in violation of the NPT — has never been found to have diverted nuclear materials for non-peaceful purposes — this legislation seeking to deny Iran the right to enrichment even for peaceful purposes itself violates the NPT .
Mr. Speaker , I am concerned that many of my colleagues opposing war on Iran will vote in favor of this legislation , seeing it as a step short of war to bring Iran into line with US demands .
I would remind them that sanctions and the blockades that are required to enforce them are themselves acts of war according to international law .
I urge my colleagues to reject this saber - rattling but ultimately counterproductive legislation .

" No one deserves to have his or her livelihood threatened , and no one should have to put up with discrimination or other behaviors at work . " -- William M. Julien
Types Of Discrimination In Florida
Unfortunately , an employer 's motivation to promote , hire or fire an employee , for instance , is not always based on his or her performance .
Such action can be based on other motivations , ones that are often against the law .
There are many different ways that employers can unlawfully discriminate against their employees .
People over the age of 40 are protected by federal law from being discriminated against in favor of younger workers .
A worker 's career may be stalled or thwarted by discrimination based on gender .
Pregnant women can face employment barriers , sometimes finding themselves demoted or even fired after taking guaranteed leave .
If an employer refuses to make scheduling allowances for the Sabbath or religious holidays , this may constitute religious discrimination .
Employers will discriminate against a worker based on his or her sexual orientation .
How Do You Know You Have A Claim ?

Engraved on a bracelet around Will Alsop ’s left wrist are what he calls “ the three tenets of architecture ” : DIVERSITY , INDIVIDUALITY and NAUGHTINESS .
As a distinguished visiting practitioner in architecture at Ryerson this academic year , Alsop is working in a city that flaunts its embrace of the first tenet — but has much to learn about the second two .
“ On the whole , Torontonians are very polite , very nice , very pleasant people , ” he observes , sipping coffee in the Ryerson Architecture building .
But the lips of the English starchitect , who has a Falstaffian presence and an air of perpetual amusement , turn up with the trace of a smirk .
“ On the other hand , ” he says , “ there ’s a sense that everyone can have a say .
Too much democracy can prevent things happening .
I ’d prefer people to be proactive , and I ’m not sure that Torontonians are good at that — they ’re good at just saying no . ”
Alsop knows whereof he speaks .
Since winning the commission to design the Sharp Centre at the Ontario College of Art and Design in 2000 , he has returned to the city frequently , and even though his rectangle - on - pencil - crayon - stilts building is now a much - loved local landmark , he has also encountered setbacks in his work .
His funky Westside sales centre on Queen West was built , in part , to showcase a nearby loft tower that has since been scuppered ; a condo building intended for King Street was also cancelled .
The conglomerate Archial , which acquired his practice in 2006 , closed his Toronto office shortly thereafter to cut costs .
This summer , Alsop brought his naughtiness to the fore when he declared he was quitting architecture altogether in order to devote himself to painting .
The Guardian concluded that this announcement was “ just a ruse to throw his previous employers , Archial , off the scent , while he did some behind - the - scenes manoeuvring ” in order to switch over to his current firm , RMJM .
When asked to corroborate this , Alsop , ever the individualist , avers : “ I ’ve never felt as though I ’ve been employed by anyone , ever .
But the truth is , I wanted to leave what I ’d originally set up . ”
His voice drops to a conspiratorial near - whisper : “ And it was a ruse , yeah . ”
All the better for Toronto : Alsop plans to open a new office here with RMJM around March , and is currently designing the Finch West and Steeles West subway stops for the 2015 Spadina extension .
His plans for Steeles West , with their characteristic Alsopian visionary whimsy , were approved last month by the TTC ; expect to see warped - eggshell shapes aboveground with openings that allow light to flood into platform level .
Alsop does favour certain design features — among them bold , vibrant colours ; blob - shaped holes cut into flat surfaces , and those tilted stilts — but he wo n’t admit to having a particular style .
Style , he says , leads to obsolescence :
To continue to consider oneself a Modernist , for instance , is as absurd as saying , “ I believe in Elizabethanism . ”
Similarly , he holds no truck with architectural theory , methodology or philosophy .
Of Toronto ’s waterfront , a particular bugbear for Alsop , he says : “ There was a masterplan ; there was an idea , and that ’s the most dangerous thing — having an idea .
Because it ’s always wrong . ”
Despite the optimism for a better 2010 , house prices are not going to rise , HELOC money is not coming back , and the giant house party of the 00s has come to an end .
Properties like today ’s are a symptom of our collective hangover .

The party ’s over
It ’s time to call it day
They ’ve burst your pretty balloon
And taken the moon away
It ’s time to wind up
The masquerade
Just make your mind up
The piper must be paid
The Party ’s Over — Nat King Cole
People have not accepted the fact that the The Party ’s Over .
Even our government and banking oligarchs are trying to re-inflate the housing bubble to avoid the consequences of their greed and incompetence .
The mainstream media is full of stories about the bottom for house prices , many are planted by the NAR or their shills , but these stories reflect a concerted effort to either sell overpriced homes or keep people paying oversized loans .
Some reporters and bloggers are telling the truth , and today I want to examine why house prices will decline in 2010 , and why I am only predicting a small decline in the aggregate median numbers .
Prices are too High
The basic argument as to why prices will fall is not complex ; prices are still too high by historic measures .
As a recent article quipped , “ …we
still have a 30 % fall ahead of us and , as you know , we have a 30 % fall
behind us .
Better send in your mortgage payment . ”
Calculated Risk put it this way : “ House prices are not cheap nationally .
This is apparent in the
price - to - income , price - to - rent , and also using real prices .
Sure , most
of the price correction is behind us and it is getting safer to be a
bottom caller !
But “ cheap ” means below normal , and I believe that is
incorrect .
” The efforts of the Federal Reserve and the GSEs to reinflate the housing bubble have made payments affordable , but only falling prices is going to make houses truely affordable by conservative metrics .
Mortgage Interest Rates will go up
This is also a simple argument ; interest rates are nearly zero , and based on the long - term chart , it looks like rates must move higher .
Perhaps the best evidence for concluding interest rates have bottomed and will soon move higher comes from Ben Bernanke , Chairman of the Federal Reserve , who recently refinanced his ARM to a fixed - rate mortgage .
Our central banker converted to fixed because he knows the FED is not going to push interest rates lower .
Actions speak louder than words , and Ben Bernanke called the bottom in fixed - rate
interest financing without saying anything .
How high will interest rates go in 2010 ?
Morgan Stanley thinks they could hit 7.5 % in 2010 .
That would be an unmitigated disaster for the housing market .
&amp ;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp ;
Lenders would rather see Real Estate ’s Lost Decade .
They do n’t care if real estate prices go up as long as debtors are making their payments , but further price declines will create more losses , and they would rather see a slow and orderly increase in mortgage interest rates to support prices .
It probably will not happen that way .
Foreclosures will Increase
CNN
Money recently published an article titled , 3 reasons home prices are heading lower , where the authors cited ( 1 ) foreclosures , ( 2 ) rising interest rates , and ( 3 ) the end of the tax credit .
Rising interest rates was mentioned above , and tax credit props made my list of caveats as to why people may not want to buy now .
Foreclosures and Shadow Inventory made my list of 2009 Residential Real Estate Stories in Review , and it is the biggest unknown facing the market — it is n’t unknown as to whether or not this inventory exists ; it does , what is unknown is when this inventory will hit the market .
This inventory may be released and push prices lower more quickly , or it may be withheld to stop prices from falling .
The lending cartel may wish for a slow release , but the instability of the cartel will probably make for a quicker one .
The median declines less than the values of individual properties
The changing mix — more sales will occur at the high end — will serve to make the reported median higher , it will not reflect increasing quality in what people are getting for their money , particularly individual properties at the high end which is likely to fall much more than the 2 % - 5 % I am predicting .
The high end is rather unique because current comps are so few and far between that is is difficult to accurately measure what those houses are worth .
Our market is characterized by high end delusion with many more properties currently asking prices that only a few buyers can afford .
The plethora of high - end inventory — when the actual distress is reflected in the market — will cause large declines in the values of these properties .
This will reverberate through the housing market as people substitute up to better properties for less money .
The net effect of more high - end transactions at lower price points is that the median changes very little ; people are still spending the same amount of money , but the quality of what buyers get for this money is much higher .
We can see 10 % - 20 % drops in the prices of high end properties without much impact on the median , and this is exactly what I believe will happen .
For evidence of these forces in the market , examine today ’s featured ( previously ) million dollar plus property .

Community Northpark
Tract Bela
According to the listing agent , this listing may be a pre-foreclosure or short sale .
Beautiful home in Northpark gated community with main floor bedroom with full bath , berber carpet , customized ceramic tile , granite counter tops and much more .
In addition , there are also fountains in the front and back entrance .
The owner of this home paid $ 1,127,000 and timed the peak of 6/9/2006 .
He used a $ 845,250 first mortgage , a $ 169,050 second mortgage , and a $ 112,700 downpayment .
The second mortgage on this property is listed as a HELOC , so the lender loss is completely dependent upon how much the borrower took out .
I assume the max as this was opened at the closing as a purchase money mortgage .
Perhaps someone more knowledgeable can comment on the recourse implications of a purchase money mortgage HELOC .
How much use disqualifies a HELOC for non-recourse protections ?
This owner is probably asking an attorney these same questions , and I suspect the answers will not be favorable .
Homeowners are extremely leveraged .
Without a return on their investment , many will succumb to the weight of their debt service payments and wash through the foreclosure system .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A home movie showing a relaxed Marilyn Monroe apparently smoking marijuana has surfaced , retrieved from an attic some 50 years after it was filmed .
The reel - to - reel silent , color film taken at a private home in New Jersey was recently purchased by collector Keya Morgan for $ 275,000 from the person who took the film , who has asked to remain anonymous .
Morgan and the person who shot the film gave Reuters permission to use it in shortened form .
The copyright of the image will be put up for sale on eBay later this week , Morgan said .
At one point Monroe is passed a cigarette and takes a puff but does not appear to inhale deeply .
The person who made the film confirmed that the cigarette contained marijuana , saying : “ I got it ( the pot ) .
It was mine .
It was just passed around . ”
“ It was not a party .
It was just a get - together .
You know , come over and hang out , ” the person said .
Morgan , a collector of historical photos , manuscripts , autographs and documents , is also working on a documentary on the death of Monroe in August 1962 .
He learned of the film during his research and tracked down the owner , who kept it as part of an archive that was moved between various homes over the years .
The Monroe film had been stored in an attic for three years before Morgan tracked it down .
The actress appears happy and relaxed at a small gathering of friends that Morgan dates to 1958 or 1959 , based on her appearance .
“ This is the late ‘ 50 s so she is already very famous , but this is a personal side of her we ’ve never seen before .
People have never seen her in such a relaxed pose , ” Morgan said .
Rail link reopens with only ' very limited ' service after 2,000 passengers are stranded by cold - weather breakdown
This article is more than 10 years old
This article is more than 10 years old
More than 2,000 people have been evacuated from four Eurostar trains that were trapped in the Channel tunnel after breaking down due to the cold weather .
The trains are believed to have failed as they left the cold air in northern France and entered the warmer air inside the tunnel .
The four trains had been moved from the tunnel and passengers were being transferred to England , said a Eurostar spokesman .
Some passengers were evacuated to shuttle trains that carry vehicles but others were stuck overnight .
Many complained about the conditions on the stranded trains .
Lee Godfrey , who was travelling back from Disneyland Paris with his family , said they were left overnight without light , air conditioning , food or water .
Passengers opened emergency doors by themselves and set off down the tunnels to find refuge on another train , he said .
" We were without power .
We ran out of water , we ran out of food and there was very very poor communication from the staff , " he told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme .
" We lost air conditioning when we lost the power .
We had to open the emergency doors ourselves .
The evacuation procedure we followed was one that we set down ourselves .
" We have had children asleep on the floor , they have been sick .
It has been a complete nightmare .
" It was very scary for the children and elderly people .
We had a lady in a wheelchair and a lady who was seven months pregnant and we had asthma attacks , people were fainting on the train .
It was just pandemonium .
People were very , very panicky . "
Godfrey said their train left Disneyland Paris at about 6.30 pm GMT but 14 hours later had only just reached Folkestone , having first been taken back to Calais this morning where passengers were given food and drinks .
Another passenger , Philippe Serna from Lincolnshire , said his train left Paris at 4.30 pm GMT and was stuck in the tunnel for about four hours .
" Then they announced there would be another train coming to meet us .
We got out and walked down the tunnel only a short distance , and Kent fire brigade were there , and they put us on a shuttle which took us to Folkestone where we got back on another Eurostar which brought us here .
" The journey was very long but it was fine to be honest – just boring , frustrating and a bit stuffy . "
Eurostar spokesman Bram Smets said " very limited services " were expected to resume today and tomorrow but passengers were advised not to travel this weekend if their journey was not essential .
Another Eurostar spokesman said : " We have done all we have can to get people to their destination as quickly as possible .
Obviously we understand people 's frustration . "
The tunnel closure exacerbated the travel problems caused by the cold weather in Kent .
Kent police issued an urgent warning for drivers to stay away from the Folkestone and Dover areas of the M20 .
The police have brought in Operation Stack , which allows lorries to park along sections of the M20 , to ease congestion near the Eurostar terminal .
There have been tailbacks on the A20 into Dover after ferries were stopped for several hours due to severe weather in France .
A Dover spokesman said all ferry services to Dunkirk , Boulogne and Calais were running normally , and it was able to receive ferries and traffic .
He said : " The port is still full and traffic continues to queue on the A20 into Dover .
Customers intending to sail to Calais are advised not to set out for the port without checking with their operator first . "
Police urged people to stay away from traffic - clogged routes around Dover and Folkestone .
Chief Superintendent Matthew Nix , from Kent Police , said : " We would appeal to everyone to consider whether their journey is really necessary .
Because of the problems with the Channel Tunnel and the Port of Calais , it will take a considerable time to clear the backlog . "
More snow is expected across the UK in the next 24 hours .
Helen Rossington , a forecaster with MeteoGroup , said north - east England and Yorkshire could see 10 - 15 cm of snow on high ground , while southern and eastern England were likely to get 2 - 5 cm .
Amnesty International called on Saudi Arabia on Monday to stay a sentence of 40 lashes against a 75 - year - old woman for breaching a sex segregation law .

The Daily Show ’s Jon Stewart finds it “ very sad ” that former Vice President Dick Cheney seems to be suffering from signs of premature senility .
When Cheney was interviewed by the FBI in 2004 about his role in the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame , he responded 72 different times that he could not recall details of events a year earlier .
“ We ’ve all grown accustomed to thinking of ex-Vice President Dick Cheney as a villain , ” Stewart stated soberly .
“ But did you know he ’s also an old man ? ”

Stewart then introduced a new segment —
“ Is Our Dick Going Soft ? ” — in which he noted several things Cheney professed to be unable to remember during the FBI interview , such as “ the time his press secretary Cathie Martin first told him and Scooter Libby that Valerie Plame … worked for the CIA . ”
Cheney ’s most outrageous lapse of memory , however , came when his was shown his own handwritten “ notes on Joe Wilson ’s New York Times op - ed : ‘ Have they done this sort of thing before ? …
Or did his wife send him on a junket ? ' ”
According to the FBI summary , Cheney “ said his review of that portion of the document did not ring a bell as to why he wrote those words . ”
“ You admit you wrote it but you do n’t know why you wrote it ? ” Stewart asked incredulously .
Stewart then snickered , in his best Cheney imitation , “ Heh , heh , heh .
I have one of those evil dead hands that does things on its own .
…
I ’m an enigma wrapped in a man-sized safe . ”

Stewart pointed out , however , that earlier this year , when Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi insisted she could not recall being briefed on waterboarding by the CIA , Cheney had commented , “ I think what often happens in these circumstances is once a controversy develops , then some of the people that were briefed get forgetful . ”
“ That ’s the hard Dick we were taking for years , ” Stewart concluded .
This video is from Comedy Central ’s The Daily Show , broadcast Nov. 3 , 2009 .

10 Quick Facts About Weed .
Or Marijuana , Cannabis , Dope , Hash , Draw .
1 . It staves off the ultimate form of memory loss – Alzheimer ’s .
Recent studies on mice suggest that anti-inflammatories found in cannabis prevent the clumping of brain proteins , one major cause of the disease .
More Info .
2. Skunk is giving Marijuana a bad name .
Before the arrival of skunk , Marijuana was n’t seen a such a hard drug by the authorities .
Skunk has changed this all and is being used to demonize marijuana by police and governments .
3 . You can still buy weed in a lot of countries with no trouble at all .
Holland of course – but there are also places in Switzerland , Germany , Denmark , Tasmania , America and Australia where the buying and selling of weed is tolerated by the authorities .
4. Nobody has ever died from a Marijuana overdose .
This is not true of alcohol .
5. Marijuana helps with : Stress Relief , Pain Relief , Meditation , Eating Disorders .
6. Marijuana has been around since ancient times .
It was n’t considered a problem until a disinformation campaign about it was launched in the 1930s by the Americans .
7. £ 6 Billion is spent on marijuana by Britons each year .
And that ’s not including money spent on chocolate and munchies .
8 . Driving under the influence of cannabis is not dangerous .
9. Cannabis can improve your sex life – acting as an aphrodisiac .
10 . Cannabis does NOT cause violent behavior , unlike Alcohol And Cocaine

teresa : Just to clarify something … it was n’t a disinformation campaign by “ The Americans , ” it was a disinformation campaign by Wm. Randolph Hearst specifically , who coincidentally owned both a large amount of forest land and a newspaper empire and was very personally invested in the promotion of the wood pulp paper industry .
Hemp , of course , makes much better paper than wood pulp .
But since you can grow it on the same plot of land over and over again , it ’s not nearly as easy or lucrative a resource to monopolize as timber .

tony :
Thanks for the blog .
I enjoyed a lot of it .
One thing I did n’t agree with was the seeming demonization of skunk by yourself .
Skunk is no more than 2 or 3 times stronger than the weed smoked back in the hippy days .
The ludicrous figures of 25 x and 30 x have been debunked a number of times but still seems to get pulled out of the bag by one - time - smoker - present - day - politician types .
I also think it is a shame that it is n’t true as I believe that the stronger the weed is the less I have to smoke to get to my desired “ high ” .
The less I have to smoke the less potentially harmful substances I will have to inhale to get the desired amount of THC .
( Remember kids , you should always use a vaporizer ) .
Anyway , just my tuppence worth , thanks again for the blog .
conor : “ Skunk is no more than 2 or 3 times stronger than the weed smoked back in the hippy days . ” wrong , the kinda of hash mark howard used to smoke had a much higher thc content .
CQA : Saying that driving under the influence of cannabis is not dangerous is dumb and irresponsible of you .
Although a regular smoker , who has built a tolerance for pot and knows their cababilities while under the influence , can usually drive without many problems , they still wont be as alert or as good of a driver if they were n’t stoned .
As for the first time users or the occasional users , it definitely is dangerous to drive under the influence of marijuana so saying it is safe is a dumb thing to say .
Yes , driving under the influence of alcohol is far more dangerous than pot , but it does n’t justify saying driving under the influence of pot is completely safe .
Jared : Marijuana has also been linked with a decrease in libido in men due to the interference of testosterone production .
Also driving under the influence of any mind altering drug can be dangerous if the driver is not experienced with how the drug changes their perceptions .
Marijuana is not a harmless drug , but does not deserve the bad rap it gets from media and governmental agencies .
Marijuana was seen as a black jazz problem in the late 1930 ’s giving rise to fears that the habit would spread across color lines .
old hipster :
There has ALWAYS been dope that was very powerful , folks .
Thai stick for example was around in the 60s .
Hell all kinds of dope with all kinds of fancy names those names were pretty much little more than marketing jive .
Some dope is good , most is medocre and some is just whacky - weed .
Nothing ’s really changed except the sentencing guidelines .
Rollo :
The best weed is grown outdoors in Nature ’s sun and rain , makes you feel happy , giggly , energised sometimes too before you ultimately raid the fridge .
Bad weed ( such as Skunk ) is grown indoors in artificial light , largely in Holland and tends to make you feel either paranoid or paralysed or both .
No real contest .
In any case it ’s much better as an occasional ‘ vice ’ rather than something habitual .
Gern : Rollo -
The real difference is Indica vs Sativa , not indoor vs outdoor .
Correct Steev , semantic faux pas .
Genetically altered engineered .
The new strains are bred , some more effectively than others .
Some companies are just trying for this year ’s cup winner for the tourist trade and are n’t trying for a stable hybrid .
But it ’s just selective pollination .
Warren & Jared - hush yourselves until you ’ve had sex with a buzz .
It works quite nicely , tyvm .
I ca n’t keep my girlfriend off me 😀
No friction burns or missing libido either .
Chronic users are another story - there ’s a whole bunch of reasons to not do that .
Even Rastas know better than that .
It ’s a sacrament to them , not a couch potato amusement .
I do n’t recommend anyone make a habit of driving stoned , but I have found without exception that when I have , I drive like my grandmother , very slow and careful .
And I do n’t drive on major highways or hectic city streets when stoned .
The fact that some people do is a symptom of the suppression of cannabis culture .
Common sense learning needs to be passed down to new smokers .
You ’re not outlaws folks .
Schedule 1 ?
Who are they kidding ?

I think there ’s a right way and a wrong way to approach cannabis .
Demonizing it is the wrong way , as is abusing it .
“ Believe nothing merely because you have been told it …
Do not believe what your teacher tells you merely out of respect for the teacher .
But whatsoever , after due examination and analysis , you find to be kind , conducive to the good , the benefit , the welfare of all beings — that doctrine believe and cling to , and take it as your guide . ”
– Gautama Siddhartha
metaxarox : Also , the term Marijuana was nonexistant before the disinformation campaign of henry anslinger .
it is a racist term used to make “ superior ” whites not want to smoke something associated with “ dirty ” mexicans
jamie wilson : 8 . Driving under the influence of cannabis is not dangerous …. right .
yeah , thats not bullshit .
considering that the 3 young people that died in car crashes last year were all high as kites .
:/ im not against weed … just doing anything dangerous whilst taking it .
its really not worth the risk , and this is really misleading
zwenkwiel : well comming from holland i can’t help but wonder what all this fuss about skunk is about .
over here most people would n’t wanna be seen smoking skunk as it is widely regarded as junk .
skunk is however a reasonably easy plant to grow .
I suspect this to be te reason for it ’s popularity outside of holland .
the increase in thc has more to do with new strains being developped .
And more advanced growing techniqeus .
as for the driving while stoned is safe statement .
Several studies conducted in various countries around the world ( including : UK USA Holland ) show that drivers under the influence of marijuana drive as safely ( or as in some studies showed ) or even safer than drivers who are sober .
http://www.cannabisculture.com/news/driving
( link seems to be down at the moment hope it ’s not permanent )
I personnally however have had a few moments where all I “ used ” was marijuana but yet I found myself unfit to drive and sat inside my car parked somewhere for several hours .
but normally I ’m perfectly able to drive while stoned .
I even find I drive much more relaxed and really focus on driving .
this way I ’m able to observe a lot more and while I might not react as quickly as normal my heightened awareness enables me to anticipate problems .
where normally my mind drifts in like 8 billion different directions except for the task at hand ( paying attention to the road )
Nate : You people are just misinformed and I ’ll tell you why .
Everyone ’s heard that old presidents like Lincoln used to grow hemp .
It was the shit for building stuff and also more importantly , a renewable source .
When 1900 ’s came around , companies developed more technology in things like plastic .
These industries became so lucrative , they saw how hemp could replace what they were doing and at a much lower cost .
Therefore : the ban on marijuana and propaganda to scare people away by making films such as Reefer Madness .
Hemp just threatens too many multi billion dollar industries .
Ace :
For the record many researchers believe the famous martial artist Bruce Lee died of from cerebral edema caused by cannabis alkaloid intoxication .
He was eating a potent form of hashish and was warned by a doctor to stop but persisted .
A great loss .
Mr Candid :
Pot may be less dangerous than alcohol but it ’s certainly not 100 % safe , and it ’s no reason to make it legal , we have enough problems with alcohol in our society without legitimizing another mind - altering substance , my main problem with pot is how it kills a persons drive , alot of my pot smoking friends were good students with good grades who showed alot of promise but got heavy into their habit and are content working at crappy jobs or jobs where they do n’t have to worry about random drug testing … what a waste of potential !
Phil E Drifter : Mr. Candid , hammers are not completely safe .
You could easily kill someone by bludgeoning them to death with a hammer ; you could even miss the nail and slam your finger !
Therefore , lets outlaw hammers , they are a danger to both yourself and everyone around you .
Of course , I ’m being sarcastic .
What we need is a tactic that expresses responsibility , not outright racism , which was how the anti-pot laws were founded .
As well as what someone mentioned earlier about protecting the timber industry .
Outlawing it also protects the pharmaceutical companies , the food industry , medicine , paper , etc etc etc .
Look up these books on half.com and buy them : ‘ The Marijuana Conviction , ’ ‘ The Emperor Wears No Clothes , ’ and ‘ Race to Incarcerate . ’
Matt :
What a wonderful selection of comments you have even including Rollo , is he really from that band faithless ?
Having been a past abuser of cannabis I have to question some of the statements you make but overall it ’s true the effects are definately less dangerous than those of alcohol …
I was stoned for many years and as a result drove under the influence many thousands of times , it ’s difficult to assess the true impact yourself but I never crashed , although I certainly did n’t drive like a grandmother as some people are saying …
Keep up your irreverence , never mind do n’t read this , I ca n’t stop 🙂
Stefan : Weed !
it ’s a freaking plant !
legalize it and take the criminal element out of the equation !
Why is this so hard for our DUMB ASS leaders to understand !
Lin Floyd : ’ skunk ’ is indeed ‘ genetically altered ’ but then so are tomatoes and wheat and corn and okra and cows and soybeans and …. well you get the point .
Whenever you choose plants with certain specific traits you want to promote and you get those plants to pass these traits on to their offspring , you have altered their genes .
The implication that gene splicing or any such lab procedure is responsbile is bogus .
Speaking of being responsible , do n’t smoke and drive .
If weed did n’t alter your perception , why would you smoke it ?
It probably is less dangerous than driving drunk , but just try taking a test while bonked and tell me how little your reasoning has been diminished .
Finally , there is no weed 30 x the potentcy of good commercial Columbian or its equivalent , which has maybe 3 or 4 % thc .
Even a third grader would tell you that 30 times 3.5 equals weed with more than 100 % thc , which is of course ludicrous .
The very best weed is probably thai stick , which tops out at around 35 % , or ten times as potent as typical street weed .
Kyle :
You can not die from weed unless it is laced her shit was probbably laced for a fact plus she ate 2 ounces of weed it probbably fucked up her immune system n shit but ive been smokin weed for 5 years now n ive smoked like a quarterpound of dro in one session thats 4 oz ’s n i just felt really fucked outta my mind but not to even the point where i felt like i was overdosing most cannabis is a clean calm high =)
Marijuana : I ’ve been using marijuana for over 30 years on a near daily basis ( I ’ve stopped when unwell or in hospital ) .
While I can accept it is not entirely harmless , it is far less harmful than many would have us believe .
Importantly , for many it can bring enormous benefits – legalise now

Listen to Anthony Grayling on Russell 's Theory of Descriptions
Reuters
NOVEMBER 20th saw the return of an old phenomenon : the sold - out cinema .
“ New Moon ” , a tale of vampires , werewolves and the women who love them , earned more in a single day at the American box office than any film in history .
The record may not stand for long : next month “ Avatar ” , a three - dimensional action movie thick with special effects , will be released ( see picture ) .
This film 's production budget is reportedly $ 230 m , which would make it one of the most expensive movies ever made .
“ Avatar ” will be a great disappointment if its worldwide ticket sales fail to exceed $ 500 m .
Yet it is a reflection of how things are changing in the media business that such an outcome is unlikely .
There has never been so much choice in entertainment .
Last year 610 films were released in America , up from 471 in 1999 .
Cable and satellite television are growing quickly , supplying more channels to more people across the world .
More than half of all pay - television subscribers now live in the Asia - Pacific region .
Online video is exploding : every minute about 20 hours ' worth of content is added to YouTube .
The internet has greatly expanded choice in music and books .
Yet the ever - increasing supply of content tailored to every taste seems not to have dented the appeal of the blockbuster .
Quite the opposite .
This is not what was predicted by one of the most influential business books of the past few years .
In “ The Long Tail ” , Chris Anderson , editor - in - chief of Wired , a technology magazine ( and before that a journalist at The Economist ) , argued that demand for media was moving inexorably from the head of the distribution curve to the tail .
That is , the few products that sell a lot were losing market share to the great many that sell modestly .
By cutting storage and distribution costs , the internet was overturning the tyranny of the shop shelf , which had limited consumers ' choices .
And , by developing software that analysed and predicted consumers ' tastes , companies like Amazon were encouraging people to wallow in esoterica .
Such companies did not just supply niche markets — they helped create them .
“ The Long Tail ” set off a lively debate .
Professors at Harvard Business School questioned whether many companies can profit from selling a little of a great many things .
The supply of obscure films and music seems to be growing faster than people are discovering them .
Harvard 's Anita Elberse argued in an article last year that only a foolish firm would shift its focus away from the mass market .
People in the media business , who have to back their judgments with money , have a different view .
In a sense , they say , both Mr Anderson and his detractors are right .
At the same time , both are missing the real story .
“ Both the hits and the tail are doing well , ” says Jeff Bewkes , the head of Time Warner , an American media giant .
Audiences are at once fragmenting into niches and consolidating around blockbusters .
Of course , media consumption has not risen much over the years , so something must be losing out .
That something is the almost but not quite popular content that occupies the middle ground between blockbusters and niches .
The stuff that people used to watch or listen to largely because there was little else on is increasingly being ignored .
The strongest survive
Take American broadcast television .
This is an industry in decline , albeit from an immensely profitable peak .
The “ big four ” networks ( ABC , CBS , NBC and Fox ) have steadily lost viewers over the years as eyeballs have wandered to cable networks and , to a lesser extent , online video .
Yet the top programmes are holding up well .
In the 2000 - 01 season the most popular show on broadcast television , “ Survivor ” , was watched by 17.8 m households on average .
The leader in 2008 - 09 , the Wednesday edition of “ American Idol ” , drew 16.5 m .
Less popular shows — fairly funny sitcoms and cheap reality programmes such as “ COPS ” — suffered far worse .
Indeed , the further you look down the prime - time rankings , the more audiences have eroded ( see chart 1 ) .
The fact that the biggest shows continue to draw audiences nearly as big as their predecessors did may not sound impressive .
But it has great commercial consequences .
As broadcast television has lost audience share , its salesmen have convinced advertisers to pay more and more to reach a given number of viewers .
They get away with this because broadcast television is still unchallenged as a mass medium .
No other venue , including the internet , can guarantee an audience of many millions on a single evening .
So a show that reaches 10 m Americans today is worth a lot more than a show that reached 10 m at the beginning of this decade .
Simon Cowell , the star judge on “ American Idol ” , reportedly renewed his contract earlier this year for more than $ 100 m over three seasons .
He is probably worth it .
Or take music .
Like broadcast television , recorded music is a troubled business .
Sales of CD albums are declining thanks to illegal file - sharing and the rise of digital download services such as iTunes , which allow listeners to pluck out the best tracks .
Yet hit albums can still sell well .
In Britain , where album sales in all formats have declined by 18 % since the 2004 peak , those of albums occupying the number - one spot have increased slightly ( see chart 2 ) .
A recent analysis by Billboard , a trade magazine , found a similar trend in America .
There , sales had declined across the board , but the hits were holding up best .
Albums ranked between 300 and 400 suffered the greatest proportionate losses .
One possible reason is that the profile of music buyers has changed .
Young fans , who are more likely to follow up - and - coming guitar bands and dance music , are highly likely to download music illegally .
In 2008 Britons in their 40s spent more on pop and rock music than teenagers or people in their 20s , according to TNS , a market - research firm .
As young people with more unusual tastes abandon music shops altogether , the market becomes skewed towards safe , established pop acts .
One of last year 's biggest sellers was the cast recording of “ Mamma Mia ! ” , which features songs by ABBA , a fizzy 1970s pop group .
But this is not the whole story .
Offer music fans a virtually infinite choice of songs free of charge , and they will still gravitate to hits .
That has been the experience of We7 , a music - streaming service based in London which has 2.5 m users .
Only 22 % of We7's 4 m songs are streamed in any given week , says Steve Purdham , who founded the company .
The top 100 artists account for more than half of all streams .
Users of Spotify , another ad - supported music service , are similarly unadventurous .
Will Page of PRS for Music , which collects royalties for British songwriters , calculates that the most popular 5 % of tracks on Spotify account for 80 % of all streams .
He is counting only the 3 m tracks that were streamed at least once between February and July .
Another 1.5 m were not touched at all .
“ People want to share the same culture , ” explains Roger Faxon , head of EMI Music Publishing .
Music is an intensely social medium , most enjoyable when it is discussed and shared with friends .
Because choice in music — and , to an extent , other media — is collective as well as individual , it is hardly surprising that people cluster around popular products .
And Mr Faxon cites another reason , having to do with the advent of online piracy .
File - sharing has made virtually all music available for nothing .
Yet it has not altogether stopped people from buying .
Even enthusiastic pirates will still buy CDs of music that they love , in order to get the cover art or simply to express their devotion .
And what people love , it turns out , are hits .
The tyranny of the hit
Although you might expect people who seek out obscure products to derive more pleasure from their discoveries than those who simply trudge off to see the occasional blockbuster , the opposite is true .
Tom Tan and Serguei Netessine of Wharton Business School have analysed reviews on Netflix , a popular American outfit that dispatches DVDs by post and asks subscribers to rate the films they have rented .
They find that blockbusters get better ratings from the people who have watched them than more obscure ones do .
Even the critically loathed “ Transformers : Revenge of the Fallen ” is awarded four stars out of five .
Ms Elberse of Harvard Business School has found the same of ratings on Quickflix , the Australian equivalent of Netflix .
Perhaps the best explanation of why this might be so was offered in 1963 .
In “ Formal Theories of Mass Behaviour ” , William McPhee noted that a disproportionate share of the audience for a hit was made up of people who consumed few products of that type .
( Many other studies have since reached the same conclusion . )
A lot of the people who read a bestselling novel , for example , do not read much other fiction .
By contrast , the audience for an obscure novel is largely composed of people who read a lot .
That means the least popular books are judged by people who have the highest standards , while the most popular are judged by people who literally do not know any better .
An American who read just one book this year was disproportionately likely to have read “ The Lost Symbol ” , by Dan Brown .
He almost certainly liked it .
This explains why bestselling books , or blockbuster films , occasionally seem to grow not just more quickly than products which are merely very popular , but also in a wholly different way .
As a media product moves from the pool of frequent consumers into the ocean of occasional consumers , the prevailing attitude to it — what Hollywood folk call word of mouth — can become less critical .
The hit is carried along by a wave of ill - informed goodwill .
These days it may travel far .
Blockbuster films , long among the most international of media products , are now more so .
The leading studios have beefed up their foreign - sales arms and learned how to market films that open at roughly the same time all over the world .
Sony has done particularly well this year , pulling in more than $ 1.6 billion in ticket sales from outside America , a record for the studio .
Big films such as “ 2012 ” and “ Angels and Demons ” have earned roughly twice as much in foreign cinemas as in American ones .
Hollywood seems to have exported the blockbuster model , too .
Anil Arjun , chief executive of Reliance MediaWorks , reckons ticket sales for the top five films in India grew by 250 % between 2004 and 2008 .
Growing professionalism and a multiplex building boom have lifted the market as a whole , but the biggest films are rising most quickly .
In addition , the best Hindi films increasingly serve expatriates in London and California 's Bay Area .
“ New Moon ” , newly enthroned
Blockbusters are also reaching people in more ways .
Peter Chernin , who recently stepped down from overseeing News Corporation 's film and television business , notes that technology does not just expand the range of products available .
It also gives people much greater choice in how they consume the most popular ones .
No longer must people go to a cinema or a video shop if they want to see a popular film .
They can get hold of it as a video - on - demand , download it or stream it .
“ Hits are going to be the single biggest beneficiary of technology , ” Mr Chernin reckons .
In short , just because people have more choice does not mean they will opt for more obscure entertainments .
That is especially clear in the book trade .
A study of the Australian market by Nielsen , a research firm , found that the number of titles bought each year ( measured by ISBNs ) has risen dramatically , from about 275,000 in 2004 to almost 450,000 in 2007 .
Niche titles selling fewer than 1,000 copies each accounted for nearly all the growth in variety .
Yet their market share fell .
In Britain , sales of the ten bestselling books increased from 3.4 m to 6 m between 1998 and 2008 .
The bestsellers are gaining in part because of a change in the retail marketplace that affects other media too .
High - street bookshops , which carry a reasonable selection of what publishers call “ mid- list ” and “ back - list ” titles — that is , modestly popular and somewhat out - of - date books — are struggling .
Borders UK , owner of a British chain , is reportedly seeking a buyer for its stores .
Such shops are being displaced by online retailers , which offer vast selections of obscure titles , and also by supermarkets , which sell a tiny selection of hugely popular books .
In newspapers , too , the leading outfits are faring best .
The three biggest - selling American publications — the New York Times , USA Today and the Wall Street Journal — have all held on to subscribers better than the large metropolitan papers that comprise the second tier .
That market also has a thriving long tail in the shape of small - town papers .
This has less to do with consumers ' tastes than with advertising .
The metropolitan papers are suffering because the classified advertisements on which they rely have collapsed under pressure from free listings websites such as Craigslist .
Small - town papers also depend on classified ads , but they face less online competition .
The nationals rely more on display advertising .
What is a media company to do ?
As sales become ever more concentrated , it is becoming both more urgent and harder to establish a foothold near the top of the market .
A book or film that fails to attract a mass audience tumbles quickly into the depressed middle .
To avoid this fate , should a company spread its development and marketing budget over lots of products , hoping that one or two catch on , or should it bet on just a few ?
The problem is especially acute in businesses like music , where money is tighter than ever and even the hits are not quite as solid as they used to be .
The joke answer , proffered by several executives asked these questions , is that media companies should simply churn out hits .
This is less of a joke if a firm knows in advance what will prove popular .
Of all creative media enterprises , Hollywood is the most confident of its ability to predict demand .
Film studios carry out rigorous audience research and adjust production and marketing budgets according to the size of the group they are targeting .
The studios have learned that stars are much less reliable generators of profits than films based on known characters and stories .
That is why , in August , Disney agreed to pay $ 4 billion for Marvel Entertainment , a veteran comic - book and media firm that had filed for bankruptcy protection in the mid-1990s .
Above all , Hollywood has learned that bigger is better .
Although small films can do astonishingly well ( the latest is “ Paranormal Activity ” , a cheap thriller that has sold more than $ 100 m - worth of cinema tickets in America alone ) , they do not do so at all dependably .
SNL Kagan , a research firm , calculates that between 2004 and 2008 films costing more than $ 100 m to produce consistently returned greater profits to the big studios than cheaper films did .
With DVD sales slumping in the recession and outside financing hard to obtain , the leading studios are cutting back their output of films .
But the cuts are concentrated at the bottom end .
Studios have shut down or neglected their divisions that specialise in distributing low - and middle - budget films .
None has sounded a retreat from big - budget blockbusters .
Hollywood is one of America 's most stable industries , with the same number of big studios now ( six ) as in the early 20th century .
As both production budgets and risks soar it seems less likely than ever that an outsider will break into the club .
On the contrary : the club may eventually shrink .
The trend towards blockbusters is likely to suit the most successful studios , with the deepest pockets , the best marketing departments and the greatest ability to wring revenues from a hit by selling DVDs , television rights and toys .
Of course , not everything can be big .
Complex political films ; violent cartoons ; English folk music — none of these things is likely to produce queues around the block .
And a great many hoped - for hits fail : every media company puts out many more misses than hits .
What to do with them ?
One answer , says Mr Bewkes , is to take advantage of the protective power of brands .
Television programmes , in particular , do not compete for audiences on a completely featureless playing field .
They are shown on channels that attract distinct audiences with different expectations .
In the right context , a middling show can survive .
“ You let the strong brand carry the medium product , ” Mr Bewkes explains .
Another way of rescuing less popular stuff is to charge more for it .
In many media businesses it is an accepted principle that such products cost more .
Specialist magazines are often expensive .
Less popular books cost more than bestsellers , because the latter are discounted .
Even television has a successful model for charging more for shows that a smallish group of people feel passionately about , in the form of premium subscription channels like HBO .
Yet , with the exception of live screenings of opera and sport , film tickets all cost the same .
This is one thing that could change .
But nobody knows quite what to do .
The old - media world of limited choice , in which any product that was not too objectionable was guaranteed a decent audience , was a comfortable place .
Pleasing a customer who can choose from several hundred films and television programmes even without getting up from the sofa , by contrast , is an unnerving prospect .

FIRSTBORN children are more likely to achieve greatness , but this may come at the cost of a less trusting , uncooperative disposition .
We know that firstborns are generally smarter than their younger siblings and more likely to become leaders , while younger brood - members tend to be more rebellious .
To see if trust in adults might also be affected by birth order , Alexandre Courtiol at the Institute of Evolutionary Sciences in Montpellier , France , paired 510 students with anonymous partners to play a finance - based game .

WHAT do you say to a recent law - school graduate ?
“ A skinny double - shot latte to go , please . ”
From New York to Los Angeles , Edinburgh to Sydney , the downturn of the past two years has hit the legal profession with unprecedented severity .
As even some leading law firms struggle for survival , recruitment has dried up .
The lucky few who get jobs are often being told to find something else to do for now , and report for duty on some far - off date .
The same is true for MBA graduates seeking jobs in management consulting .
Even the mighty McKinsey is said to be postponing start dates by several months .
Given that new graduates are the grunts of the professional - services industries , earning less than anyone else and working the longest hours , the lack of demand for their services is the clearest indicator of how bad things are .
Although a deeper - than - usual cyclical downturn is largely to blame — and is hitting hardest those firms that specialised in financial - market activities such as mergers and acquisitions , and private equity — it is already clear that there will be long - term structural consequences , not least a growing gap between the best firms and the rest .
Cutting lawyers ' jobs used to be frowned upon in the profession and thus rarely happened , even in recessions .
But last year was the “ worst year ever for law - firm lay - offs ” , reckons Law Shucks , a legal - industry blog .
It counted 218 reports of lay - offs at 138 big firms , including no less than ten rounds of cuts at Clifford Chance , a British firm whose ambitious global expansion before the crisis now seems a big mistake .
Thacher , Proffitt & Wood , a New York firm which by 2007 earned around half its revenues from structured finance , was devastated by the bursting of the subprime mortgage bubble and ended up being dissolved in December 2008 .
It was followed in March 2009 by the venerable but property - exposed Philadelphia firm of Wolf , Block , Schorr and Solis - Cohen .
As for management consulting , in the third quarter of last year Marsh & McLennan reported a 10 % decline in its consulting revenues , in line with the overall shrinkage of the industry .
Figures from other big firms are patchy , since they are private partnerships .
Still , in 2009 , to ensure they had enough cash to weather the financial storm , even leading firms such as McKinsey and BCG held back a chunk of their partners ' bonuses .
Of the big three , McKinsey and Bain are said to have suffered slight falls in revenues last year , while BCG , after a strong second half , was slightly up .
All three deny making lay - offs — although it is said that they made their “ attrition rates ” increase , by significantly raising the bar on their traditional “ up or out ” policy .
McKinsey now has 10 % fewer consultants .
The experience of some once - booming boutique consultancies has been even worse .
Marakon Associates was bought for a song by CRA International after the bankruptcy last January of its parent , Trinsum ; and Katzenbach Partners was saved by Booz & Company after shrinking alarmingly in the first six months of 2009 .
Perhaps the hardest hit of the professional services has been human - resources consulting , where revenues fell by 20 % in Britain last year .
Pay - and - benefits consultants also suffered : sharply falling revenues were one reason why Towers Perrin and Watson Wyatt decided to merge last year .
And although accounting firms are less exposed to the cycle than most professional - services firms — annual reports still have to be prepared and audited , whatever the state of the economy — in the year to last June the two biggest accountants , PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst & Young , each suffered 7 % falls in revenues .
Of course , firms with countercyclical activities , such as bankruptcy work , have fared better .
Consultants offering outsourced services , like IBM and Accenture , have also done well as cost pressures have driven other companies to use their services .
In particular , legal - process outsourcing is booming , as law firms parcel out some of their more basic work to reduce costs .
One of the leaders of this nascent market , Pangea3 , whose offices in Delhi and Mumbai take on work from clients worldwide , expects to earn twice as much revenue this month as in January 2009 .
Another booming business is helping the government sort out the economic mess .
This is favouring the market leaders most , says Heidi Gardner of Harvard Business School , because the crisis has made governments risk - averse about whom they hire .
Slaughter and May , a big London law firm , earned £ 33 m ( $ 54 m ) for its work on the financial crisis , including on the nationalised Northern Rock bank .
Sullivan & Cromwell in New York has also done nicely from helping the American government with troubled banks .
Big management consultancies have done well too , despite their poor record in the public sector ( see Schumpeter ) .
BCG , for instance , has advised the quango created to oversee America 's state - rescued car firms .
Under the knife
Though the best will gain at the expense of the rest throughout professional services , the legal profession seems likely to undergo the most profound structural changes .
For the first time — long after IT and finance departments went through the same experience — the corporate legal departments that hire law firms are under great budgetary pressure , and are thus demanding much better value from them .
In a recent paper , “ The Death of Big Law ” , Larry Ribstein , a law professor at the University of Illinois , argued that after decades without changing , law firms are likely to have an outburst of experimentation with different business models : even the venerable and lucrative “ billable hour ” method of charging clients is in doubt .
The experimentation may include more firms abandoning their traditional partnership model to go public , following in the footsteps of an Australian law firm , Slater & Gordon , which went public in 2007 .
Not everyone is excited by this idea .
“ At firms like McKinsey it was the partnership ethos that helped them through the crisis , as partners believed they were in it for the long term .
At some law firms too , ” says Jay Lorsch of Harvard Business School .
Contrast that with the investment banks that switched from being partnerships to public companies , such as Goldman Sachs .
“ If you talk to some older Goldman partners they are unhappy with the behaviour of those now running the firm , who have abandoned the partnership ethos in favour of aggressively pursuing profits and have ended up looking like greedy bastards . ”
As they adapt to survive a tougher climate , lawyers and consultants will need to ensure that any changes do not put their culture of professionalism at risk .
There are upper limits for the drug , though .
While it can make a rat better at navigating a maze , it cannot grant the rat new intelligences beyond the known limits of rat comprehension .
Or , at least that 's what the rat wants us to think as it tries to take over the world .
Do n’t panic if you ’re watching Fox ’s New Year ’s Eve special and the screen goes black moments before host Carmen Electra finishes screaming “ Happy New Year . ”
There ’s nothing wrong with your TV .
You ’re just caught in a brawl between two media giants .
At issue are the fees that News Corp. , Rupert Murdoch ’s sprawling media empire , is demanding that Time Warner Cable pay for transmitting its
Fox stations -- including KTTV - TV Channel 11 and KCOP - TV Channel 13 in Los Angeles -- as well as cable networks such as FX , Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket .
The current deal between Fox and Time Warner Cable , the nation ’s second - biggest cable operator with more than 1 million subscribers in Southern California , expires at midnight Thursday .
If the contract is not renewed , viewers will have to scramble to find an alternative TV service or risk missing the network ’s coverage of important college football games , including the Sugar , Fiesta and Orange bowls .
If the spat drags on , fans of “ American Idol , ” “ 24 " and “ House ” may be out of luck too .
Add cable TV along with the cost of healthcare and taxes to the list of things that cash - strapped consumers probably are going to have to pay more for in 2010 .
Any deal between Time Warner and Fox will set a new benchmark for content producers to charge cable operators to carry their networks .
Cable operators in turn will pass along the fee hikes in the form of higher cable TV bills .
“ This is n’t good public relations for either company , ” warned Andy Donchin , director of media investments for advertising firm Carat , whose clients include Radio Shack and Papa John ’s International Inc .
“ Ultimately , whatever agreement they come to , the consumer will pay for it . ”
Feuds over fees between content producers and distributors usually are resolved without consumers getting caught in the crossfire .
The last major programming blackout was in 2000 , when Time Warner Cable stopped carrying Walt Disney Co. 's ABC for almost two days and deprived millions of viewers of Regis Philbin ’s then hit show “ Who Wants to Be a Millionaire . ”
Even by the standards of a jaded media industry , however , the showdown between News Corp. and Time Warner Cable has turned unusually hostile .
Time Warner Cable has unleashed a media campaign accusing
Fox of holding consumers hostage “ unless we give in to their demand for massive price increases . ”
News Corp. , meanwhile , is goading Time Warner Cable subscribers to sign up for a competing TV service so they wo n’t miss any Fox shows .
The rhetoric has become so heated that Washington politicos are getting into the act .
Last week , Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the powerful Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communication , Technology and the Internet , sent a missive to top executives of both Time Warner Cable and News Corp. urging them to make peace .
Making a veiled threat , Kerry reminded the executives that they were “ leaders of major companies that are Federal Communications Commission licensees and are obligated to serve the public interest . ”
A lot is at stake for both companies .
Fox could see ratings fall and advertising revenue tumble for its programming if Time Warner Cable stops carrying its TV stations and cable networks .
Time Warner Cable , on the other hand , is likely to see its phone lines light up with calls from irate subscribers threatening to drop cable and switch to satellite broadcasters DirecTV and Dish Network or phone company Verizon ’s Fios .
Although Fox and Time Warner Cable are haggling over a bundle of channels , the crux of the matter is determining fees for Fox ’s local TV stations .
Ever since a law was passed in 1992 giving broadcasters the right to seek payment from cable operators to retransmit the signals of their stations , the two industries have been at loggerheads .
The cable industry contends that because TV stations broadcast over the air for free , it should n’t pay to retransmit their signals over cable lines .
Broadcasters counter that most consumers would n’t even subscribe to cable if local channels were n’t in the package .
In the past , broadcast networks have forgone demanding fees in exchange for room on the dial to launch new programming services .
Fox , for example , bargained for channel space to launch FX , and NBC began MSNBC , rather than wring payment from cable operators for retransmitting their locally owned stations .
But the system capacity for new cable channels has been tapped out .
At the same time , the broadcast networks , which have seen their audience erode and advertising growth slow , are desperate for new sources of revenue .
They see the fees from cable and satellite operators as a way to rejuvenate their fortunes .
“ It really and truly is the future , ” said Tony Vinciquerra , chief executive of the Fox Networks Group .
Without those fees , he warned , “ the business wo n’t survive . ”
Specifically ,
Fox seeks $ 1 per subscriber each month to carry its TV stations , people involved in the talks said .
That ’s in the range charged by TNT and Disney Channel , but much less than the $ 4 - per- subscriber fee that ESPN commands .
Fox says on a website set up to argue its side of the dispute that the fee it ’s seeking is reasonable .
“ Fox attracts more viewers than the five most expensive cable networks combined ( ESPN , TNT , USA , ESPN2 and NFL Net ) , ” the site proclaims .
Time Warner Cable says the fee
Fox is seeking is “ unreasonable and excessive , especially in this economic climate . ”
The company has countered with an offer closer to 30 cents per subscriber , people familiar with the matter said .
Industry analysts expect that Fox will settle for 50 cents to 70 cents per subscriber .
Other broadcast networks , including CBS , NBC and ABC , are closely watching how this dispute plays out in anticipation that if Fox succeeds , they ’re next in line to benefit .
If the Fox signals go off Time Warner Cable ’s system , there is a risk that Washington regulators may weigh in .
A spokeswoman for FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski declined to comment on the situation .
But Fox ’s Vinciquerra , for one , is n’t worried about Washington .
“ I do n’t know what the government could do .
We are following the law . ”
As of late Tuesday , the two sides were still huddled in talks .
New York - based Time Warner Cable flew in top executives , who set up shop at the tony Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills .
There is a chance that Fox ’s TV signals could stay on the air even if New Year ’s Eve passes without a new deal , if each side believes it is close .
“ We hope Fox wo n’t punish our customers by taking their programming away while we try to reach an agreement , ” Time Warner Cable Vice President Patricia Fregoso said .
“ I assume negotiations will continue , ” Vinciquerra said .
“ Nobody has their guns out . ”

Obama Orders US Government To Begin Preparing For Biological Attack
Biohazard Troops
EU Times | January 2 , 2010
The US Post Office could play a key role in distributing medical aid in the event of a biological attack , according to an executive order released by the White House .
The order signed by President Barack Obama directs government agencies , local law enforcement and the US Post Office to work on a model for distribution of medical countermeasures in the wake of a biological attack .
“ This policy would seek to : ( 1 ) mitigate illness and prevent death ; ( 2 ) sustain critical infrastructure ; and ( 3 ) complement and supplement State , local , territorial , and tribal government medical countermeasure distribution capacity , ” the order said .
“ The US Postal Service has the capacity for rapid residential delivery of medical countermeasures for self administration across all communities in the United States , ” the order added .
The US Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano were instructed to work with the post office to develop a “ dispensing model for US cities to respond to a large - scale biological attack , with anthrax as the primary threat consideration . ”
The order calls for the model to be drawn up within 180 days , but gives no details as to whether the idea of using the US postal system to assist Americans in the wake of a biological attack is a new one .
The United States has sought to bolster its capacity to respond to biological attacks since 2001 , when anthrax - laced letters mailed to people across the United States led to five deaths .
The order came amid heightened security concerns here following an attempt to bring down a US - bound jetliner on Christmas Day .
A 23 - year - old Nigerian has been charged in the case .

CANNABIS CONNOISSEUR : Dakta Green has smoked marijuana for 20 years and wants it legalised .
He calls himself Dakta Green .
The 59 - year - old has been jailed in California and New Zealand for cultivating cannabis but has no plans to change his ways .
Dakta is a strong activist for law reform surrounding the drug and has been pushing for its legalisation since 1999 .
He ’s even set up a cannabis club in a New Lynn warehouse known as the Daktory .
Dakta says marijuana use is widespread and causes less harm in the community than alcohol .
“ You have no idea how many people from all walks of life smoke cannabis in this country , ” he says .
“ The youngest I ’ve smoked with was 14 because his parents were present and the oldest was over 80 years old .
“ We can not call all these people criminals .
It ’s part of popular culture .
The fact that everybody is doing it is a damn good reason to stop locking a few of us up . ”
Dakta Green was born in Wellington in 1950 and attended high school in Taumarunui .
He went on to become a businessman and entrepreneur in Auckland and ran a casino on a boat in 1986 .
He says the operation took place offshore – outside of police jurisdiction .
The New Lynn resident was not always pro-marijuana and did n’t try it until he was 39 .
“ I was a prohibitionist when I grew up .
I did n’t know why .
I thought cannabis was evil and was highly opposed to it .
“ I always thought it was against the law and would cause brain damage .
“ I finally tried it to find out why young people found it so attractive . ”
Dakta ’s first smoke completely changed his life .
“ I woke up the following morning without a hangover and was no longer a prohibitionist .
“ From that point on I slowly became immersed in the culture . ”
The grandfather - of - seven uses the drug daily .
“ It is of benefit for my general health and well - being and also for socialising , ” he says .
“ I am a cannabis consumer and am not ashamed of it .
I do n’t believe I should be treated as a second - class citizen by society . ”
Dakta travelled to Australia and on to the United States to expand his knowledge of the drug .
“ I moved to California to learn how to grow medical - grade cannabis of the highest and healthiest quality .
“ I got busted and spent a year in Chester County Prison in 1999 .
I was then required to leave the States . ”
He continued to perfect his growing techniques until he was caught in Auckland with around 150 cannabis plants .
The father - of - three was locked up in November 2002 and spent the next two years and eight months in 11 prisons around the North Island .
“ I planned the Daktory in prison with a desire to make a change in our laws around marijuana .
“ I decided to travel the country and discuss cannabis with New Zealanders .
I believe if they know the truth about it they wo n’t support the continued incarceration of people . ”
Dakta and his supporters use a bus to spread their message .
“ We started a tour of the country in March last year and did 42 towns in 42 days and had 42 public smoking sessions at 4.20 pm .
We took our protest on tour .
“ In Wellington we did it in Parliament grounds and 60 people turned up . ”
Dakta also ran as a candidate for Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis in the Mt Albert byelection and came sixth out of 15 contenders .
The Daktory opened on November 19 , 2008 .
“ This is a cannabis connoisseurs ’ club .
We are doing it here in private but we ’re not going to stop making noise .
“ This is a place were people bring their own and enjoy our facilities .
“ If the police want to come bursting in here , bring it on . ”
Dakta says he ’s been arrested a number of times over the last year .
He will appear in the Waitakere District Court this month on multiple cannabis charges .
Sergeant Grant Watson says police policy on marijuana is quite clear – it ’s illegal .
“ It does n’t matter where you are , in a private dwelling or anywhere , smoking and possessing cannabis is an offence against the misuse of drugs act and carries a fine and or a term of imprisonment , ” he says .
Mr Watson says police will investigate alleged offences if they have sufficient cause .
He urges people to come forward if they have evidence of an offence being committed .
“ We can search without a warrant under section 18 of the misuse of drugs act and prosecute , ” he says .
Membership at the Daktory is confidential but each smoker pays $ 20 a month and must sign up for at least a year .
“ We started with 20 in November last year and by the end of January there were more than 1500 , ” Dakta says .
“ Our members support the ongoing costs and bills , including renting the premises .
“ This is not a private business .
I run it but only hold the company shares in trust while a community trust is being formed .
This is a model for places to come .
“ Within two years there will be daktories all over the country that will cater for people in our culture and the profits will go back to the community because they will be owned and operated by community trusts .
“ If you want a drink you have to go to licensed premises .
If you want a joint , you go to unlicensed premises and we call them tinny houses .
We think that ’s wrong . ”
There are clear rules within the club .
“ We require people to conduct themselves in a particular way , exactly the same as if we were a legally licensed premises .
We set standards . ”
He says the Daktory started selling up to 20 different strains of marijuana from its premises but stopped in April when demand skyrocketed .
“ We were getting traffic jams outside and people were queuing at our dispensary and wanting to join .
We did n’t have the management systems in place . ”
He says the dispensary will reopen to the public in January and will be restricted to those 18 years and older .
Dakta Green believes cannabis will be legal and available from daktories throughout the country by the end of next year .
“ I expect to prove that cannabis in the hands of a responsible adult is a relatively benign plant and is certainly less harmful than alcohol , ” he says .
“ It ’s time that our Members of Parliament stood up and said we do n’t care about the science .
What we care about is keeping cannabis out and it ’s a political decision we ’re making . ”

The Palestinian leadership is making medium - term preparations to go to the United Nations to ask for a declaration of a Palestinian state within 1967 borders ( i.e. in the West Bank and Gaza ) .
The move comes because the Obama administration ’s attempts to kickstart the peace process have crashed and burned , as Elaf pointed out .
The Obama team told far rightwing Likud Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu that Israel was to cease creating new colonies on the West Bank in preparation for the resumption of talks .
Netanyahu defied Obama , insisting that new Israeli squatter settlements would be started in the Palestinian West Bank .
The Palestinian leadership had made an Israeli settlement freeze a prerequisite for new talks , and so refused to sit down with the Israelis as long as the latter were stealing ever more Palestinian land .
Last week , Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced that he might well not run for president again , given complete Israeli intransigence and expansionism .
Since the Netanyahu government is about the least likely government to negotiate a Palestinian state within 1967 borders you could imagine , the Palestinians are giving up any hopes that talks will lead anywhere .
Moreover , since Netanyahu has secret plans to build thousands of further Israeli houses on Palestinian land in the next few years , time is short .
If it has not already happened , the likelihood is that a Palestinian state will become impossible very shortly simply because the West Bank looks like Swiss cheese because of all the Israeli colonies on it .
A Palestinian state is important because the Palestinian people are stateless .
Being without citizenship in a state leaves people vulnerable and without rights , since there is no state that will defend their rights .
If someone just moved into your house while you were out watching a movie , you could ask the police of your town to remove them , with reference to the property deed that you filed with your municipal authorities .
But if Israelis take over Palestinian land , the Palestinians have no one to complain to .
The Israeli courts favor the colonizers and do n’t recognize Palestinian rights .
Palestinians , being stateless , do not have the right to have rights .
The children of stateless people often lack access to education and other services .
Even three years ago the situation was already dire , and it has gotten worse since then :
As such , the Palestinians are the most oppressed people in the world .
There are other peoples who feel that they have the wrong citizenship and would like to secede , but at least they have a government and rights within that government ’s framework .
They have someone to give them a passport , which Palestinians do not .
There are other peoples that are in conflict and being killed in fair numbers .
A not insignificant number of Palestinians has been killed by the Israelis , whether through often indiscriminate and disproportionate violence or through food and services blockades ( a lot of Gazan children are stunted owing to the bad nutrition caused by the Israeli blockade of Gaza , which is an illegal collective punishment of noncombatants , including children . )
But of course there are other groups that are killed in larger numbers .
But I would argue that the psychological toll taken by the imposition of statelessness on a people is more debilitating than the knowledge that some of the group has been killed by oppressors .
European Jews themselves were made stateless by Nazi decree , as were millions of other Europeans ( leftists were denaturalized by Franco in Spain , e.g. ) .
In the post - WW II world , citizenship has become recognized as key to basic human dignity and civil rights .
There are only about 12 million stateless now , and the Palestinians are the single largest group of them .
If there is not a two - state solution , with the Palestinians gaining citizenship in that way , then ultimately there will be a one - state solution , and Israel will over the long term be forced to take them on as Israeli citizens .
Boycotts of an Apartheid situation will grow in Europe and elsewhere in the world , and Israel is vulnerable to such pressures .
The US has so far backed even the worst Israeli policies to the hilt , but those days may be coming to an end , and anyway the US is now itself an indebted nation rather than a creditor .
It is the creditors who are in the position to deny Israel access to world credit markets over time .
I know it is hard to imagine now the situation in 50 or 75 years , but I believe it will be increasingly unfavorable to Israel if the Palestinians are kept as chattel without basic rights deriving from citizenship .
The rise of al - Qaeda and other radical movements is intimately linked to the oppression that the Palestinians suffer , and that wave of radicalization is not over .
The Israeli and Neoconservative hawks who hoped that if Saddam were removed from Iraq , that Iraq would suddenly turn friendly to Israel have been proved fools .
The ways in which Israel lost both the Lebanon war of 2006 and the Gaza War of Winter 2008 - 2009 in the court of world opinion are astonishing if the situation is compared to 1967 , when the West supported Israel to the hilt in its war with Egypt .
The trend lines are downward .
So if the Palestinians could get the UNO to declare a Palestinian state and pressure Israel over it , they would actually be doing the Israelis a huge favor .
The bully Netanyahu announced that if the Palestinians unilarerally declared a Palestinian state , then Israel would immediately formally annex the largest Israeli settlements on the West Bank .
It is unclear why Netanyahu thinks a formal annexation would be meaningful .
Israel has already de facto announced that territory and no one in Israel is even hypothetically offering to give it back .
The question is not what has been annexed but what will be annexed .
There is every reason to think that the Israeli far right will just steal all Palestinian land over time if this sham ‘ peace process ’ continues as it has since 1993 .
Reuters has video on the Palestinian push at the UN for a state .
Aljazeera English reports on the Apartheid roads of the West Bank , on some of which Palestinians are forbidden to travel .

They added that IOF troops chased and wounded a Palestinian worker from Masliya village , east of Jenin city , also at an early hour on Sunday .
They said that the soldiers fired at Khaled Abul Rub , 25 , and wounded him in the feet while others were detained for working in 1948 occupied lands without permits .
The Israeli occupation police said that they arrested 252 Palestinians from various West Bank districts over the past couple of days for working in the 1948 occupied lands without permits . ”
Bethlehem - based , independent Ma’an News Agency in English reports at 1349 GMT on 15 November : “ A Palestinian farmer was injured by Israeli fire east of the town of Beit Hanoun in the northern Gaza Strip on 15 November , medics said .
According to medical sources at Beit Hanoun Hospital , the farmer sustained several gunshot wounds in both feet while he was tending his land .
Local sources in Beit Hanoun identified the farmer as 28 - year - old Mahmoud Za’anin . ” Israel Issues Demolition Notices for 9 Hebron Homes Ma’an in English reports at 1311 GMT on 15 November : “ Israeli forces distributed demolition warrants to nine Palestinian families from the Al - Hathalin area south of Hebron , near the Karmiel Israeli settlement .
According to local resident Imad Al - Hathalin , the families in question recently sent letters to caretaker Prime Minister Salam Fayyad asking for his intervention to stop the demolitions from proceeding .
Al - Hathalin explained that the demolition notices included residential homes and a chicken den . ” Israeli Settlers Raid Old City of Hebron , Cause Damage Palestinian Information Center in English reports at 1005 GMT on 15 November : “ Jewish settlers wreaked havoc in the streets and homes in the Old City of Al - Khalil ( Hebron ) on 14 November that caused material damage to Palestinian citizens , local sources reported .
They noted that the Jewish settlers started their rampage with a provocative march in the city streets that turned violent when the settlers attacked Palestinian homes and shops and assaulted their owners .
Israeli occupation forces ( IOF ) were deployed in the alleys of the Old City of Al - Khalil and the Ibrahimi Mosque to protect the Jewish settlers while celebrating one of their feasts .
In Yatta village , Al - Khalil district , a 65 - year - old woman was injured along with three kids when eight Jewish settlers threw stones on them .
The Israeli occupation authority ( IOA ) only a few days earlier delivered notifications to 12 citizens in the village warning them that their homes would be demolished .
The IOA delivered similar notifications to 9 families in Rujaib village , Nablus district , on Saturday .
The families appealed to human rights groups and the media to back their case , as tens of women and children inhabit those homes and implementing the oppressive decision would leave them in the open without shelter . ” ‘

Soybean , one of the most important global sources of protein and oil , is now the first legume species with a published complete draft genome sequence .
The sequence and its analysis appear in the January 14 edition of the journal Nature .
The research team comprised 18 institutions , including the U.S. Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute ( DOE JGI ) , the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service ( USDA - ARS ) , Purdue University and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte .
The DOE , National Science Foundation , USDA and United Soybean Board supported the research .
" The soybean genome 's billion - plus nucleotides afford us a better understanding of the plant 's capacity to turn sunlight , carbon dioxide , nitrogen and water , into concentrated energy , protein , and nutrients for human and animal use , " said Anna Palmisano , DOE Associate Director of Science for Biological and Environmental Research .
" This opens the door to crop improvements that are sorely needed for energy production , sustainable human and animal food production , and a healthy environmental balance in agriculture worldwide . "
With the soybean genetic code now determined , the research community has access to a key reference for more than 20,000 legume species and can explore the extraordinary evolutionary innovation of nitrogen - fixing symbiosis that is so critically important to successful agricultural crop rotation strategies .
Jeremy Schmutz , the study 's first author and a DOE JGI scientist at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Alabama , said that the soybean sequencing was the largest plant project done to date at the DOE Joint Genome Institute .
" It also happens to be the largest plant that 's ever been sequenced by the whole genome shotgun strategy -- where we break it apart and reassemble it like a huge puzzle , " he said .
Of the more than 20 other plant genomes taken on by the DOE JGI , those already sequenced include the black cottonwood ( poplar ) tree and the grain sorghum , both targeted because of their promise as biomass feedstocks for biofuels production .
" This is a milestone for soybean research and promises to usher in a new era in soybean agronomic improvement , " said co-author Gary Stacey , Director , Center for Sustainable Energy and Associate Director and National Center for Soybean Biotechnology , University of Missouri .
" The genome provides a parts list of what it takes to make a soybean plant and , more importantly , helps to identify those genes that are essential for such important agronomic traits as protein and oil content . "
From the sequence analysis , Stacey said that he and his colleagues have identified more than 46,000 genes of which 1,110 are involved in lipid metabolism .
" These genes and their associated pathways are the building blocks for soybean oil content and represent targets that can be modified to bolster output and lead to the increase of the use of soybean oil for biodiesel production . "
While biodiesel from soybean oil represents a cleaner , renewable alternative to fossil fuels with desirable properties as a liquid transportation fuel , there simply is not enough oil produced by the plant to be a competitive gasoline on a gallons - of - fuel yield per acre .
The availability of the soybean genome may provide some key solutions .
" We can now zero in on the control points governing carbon flow towards protein and oil , " said Tom Clemente , Professor , Center for Biotechnology , Center for Plant Science Innovation at the University of Nebraska , Lincoln .
" With the combination of informatics , biochemistry and genetics we can target the development of a soybean with greater than 40 percent oil content . "
The availability of the soybean genome sequence has accelerated other soybean trait discovery efforts as well .
For example , researchers have used the sequence to zero in on a mutation that can be used to select for a line that has lower levels of the sugar stachyose , which will improve the ability of animals and humans to digest soybeans .
In another effort , by comparing the genomes of soybean and corn , a single - base pair mutation was found that causes a reduction in phytate production in soybean .
Phytate is the form in which phosphorus is stored in plant tissue .
Because phytate is not absorbed by the animals that eat the feed , the unabsorbed phytate passes through the gastrointestinal tract , elevating the amount of phosphorus in the manure .
Limiting phytate production in the soybean could reduce a major environmental runoff contaminant from swine and poultry waste .
Of additional importance for soybean farmers is that the genome sequence has provided access to the first resistance gene for the devastating disease Asian Soybean Rust ( ASR ) .
In countries where ASR is well established , soybean yield losses due to the disease can be as high as 80 percent .
The introduction of Cesc Fabregas against Aston Villa yesterday swung the game in Arsenal´s favour , despite the influential Spaniard only being on the field for 28 minutes .
Two sublime goals added to a third from the improving Abou Diaby ensured a precious three points for Arsenal in their title challenge .
However , it came at a cost with both Fabregas and Denilson picking up knocks which could see them miss Wednesday´s trip to Portsmouth and possibly longer .
With Alex Song set to travel to the African Cup of Nations shortly , options are considerably low in midfield .
One possible option could be for Aaron Ramsey to start against Pompey , the side who he scored his first Premier League goal against back in September .
Ramsey replaced Fabregas yesterday and struggled to settle into the game but his improvement has been notable this season .
He has resembled Fabregas at times when playing for Wales and , if he can cope with the physical nature of the Premier League , something he should be used to having played rugby when he was younger , then this could be a big period in the Welshman´s season .
Wenger hinted at buying a midfielder after yesterday´s game and it is obvious why he feels his side are short in that area when shorn of three important individuals .
Ramsey , however , who can operate either in the holding role or Fabregas ´position , will be determined to prove otherwise .
Climategate correspondent Michael Mann has published an editorial in the Washington Post .
As a CA reader observed in another thread , the more interesting aspect of the editorial is the overwhelming opposition to Mann ’s editorial in the comment thread .
Readers were not distracted by Mann ’s efforts to deflect attention to Sarah Palin .
Mann ’s editorial commences in Nixonian style :
I cannot condone some things that colleagues of mine wrote or requested in the e-mails recently stolen from a climate research unit at a British university .
Readers were quick to observe the inconsistency with Mann ’s response to Phil Jones ’ request to delete emails ( see Climategate here ) .
Two days after CRU received an FOI request for AR4 comments sent to Briffa that had not been included in the IPCC archive of Review Comments ( IPCC procedures adopted by its member governments require it to be “ open and transparent ” and to archive all review comments for 5 years ) , Phil Jones sent Mann an email headed “ IPCC & FOI ” asking him to delete any emails that he may have had with Briffa regarding AR4 and to contact Gene [ Wahl , then at Alfred University , currently of NCAR ] to do likewise , saying that they would contact Caspar [ Ammann of NCAR ] to delete his emails .
Jones :
Subject : Re : IPCC & FOI
Mike ,
Can you delete any emails you may have had with Keith re AR4 ?
Keith will do likewise .
He ’s not in at the moment – minor family crisis .
Can you also email Gene and get him to do the same ?
I do n’t have his new email address .
We will be getting Caspar to do likewise .
… [ unrelated ] ..
Cheers
Phil
Instead of replying in forceful terms that he did not “ condone ” such a request and urging other parties not to do so as well , Mann immediately replied to Jones that he would “ contact Gene [ Wahl ] about this ASAP ” .
Hi Phil , [… unrelated ]
I ’ll contact Gene about this ASAP .
His new email is : generwahl@xxxxxxxxx.xxx talk to you later , mike
Mann says about this :
Some statements in the stolen e-mails reflect poor judgment — for example , a colleague referring to deleting e-mails that might be subject to a Freedom of Information Act request — but there is no evidence that this happened .
This is , of course , untrue .
Evidence of deletion of emails that might be subject to a FOI rquest is in a later email , in which Jones says
About 2 months ago I deleted loads of emails , so have very little – if anything at all .
In addition , while the Climategate emails are extensive and still being assimilated , they are by no means complete .
In many cases , the curtain goes up for a day or two and we do n’t see the end of the story .
Investigations at the University of East Anglia and Penn State have been authorized .

BERLIN — Consider this : battalions of People ’s Liberation Army soldiers in the world ’s major hot spots — Afghanistan , Sudan , Lebanon ; People ’s Armed Police officers patrolling the streets of Gaza ; Chinese gunboats securing the Strait of Hormuz ; ranking Chinese Communist Party members holding strategic high - level posts at the U.N. , the World Bank , and the W.T.O. ; China ’s voting power in International Financial Institutions drastically increased ; China spearheading regional integration in Asia .
All of these scenarios are realistic translations of the demands for China to assume greater global responsibility that are so persistently made by European leaders .
This week ’s China - European Union summit , where the two declared their “ determination to face and overcome global challenges together , ” is a case in point .
For all the rhetoric of engaging China and global burden - sharing , however , Europe ’s China angst — its fear of losing influence by granting real responsibility to China — regularly turns such bilateral encounters into wasted opportunities for taking on global responsibilities .
The outcome of the latest summit is a perfect illustration of this :
It amounts to updating and celebrating ongoing bureaucratic cooperation while refraining from broader political questions of global responsibilities and leadership .
DUBLIN , Ireland ―
As the few remaining faithful in this once mass - going nation set out for midnight services on a freezing cold Christmas Eve , two bishops announced their resignation , bringing to four the number forced to step down since they were named in a report on the cover - up of sexual abuse by pedophile priests in Dublin .
The bishops are the latest casualties of a civil war within the purple - clad ranks of the once - dominant Irish Catholic Church hierarchy that could have ramifications in the Vatican itself .
Bishops Eamonn Walsh and Raymond Field offered their resignations to Pope Benedict on Christmas Eve only after fighting a rearguard action against the Archbishop of Dublin , Dairmuid Martin , who has pressurized them publicly and privately to quit .
They are accused of being part of a culture of silence and denial about abusive priests that is not peculiar only to Ireland but is worldwide .
The scandal has highlighted the role of the Vatican where this practice of “ see no evil ” was established by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith with an emphasis on protecting church financial assets .
Outrage in Ireland over the actions of individual priests and bishops has consequently also been directed towards the Vatican .
This has wider implications for the influence of the Catholic Church in a country where two decades ago there was 90 percent regular mass attendance .
Bitter criticisms of the Vatican and the papal nuncio — both declined to even respond to a letter from the Dublin Archdiocese Commission of Investigation headed by Judge Yvonne Murphy that drew up the report on sexual abuse — have become the staple diet of current affairs programs on radio and television .
The infighting within the ranks of Ireland ’s Catholic hierarchy , which consists of one cardinal , three archbishops and 24 bishops , became public after Bishop Walsh sent a letter to all priests in his area of the Dublin archdiocese claiming that Archbishop Martin had expressed full confidence in him at a meeting of clergy in a Dublin hotel .
The archbishop ’s spokeswoman retorted that while he had confidence in Walsh ’s ministry , he and other bishops named in the report had questions of accountability to answer .
Walsh protested that it would be unjust to force him to resign as he had done no wrong .
However in a joint resignation statement with Bishop Field , who also denied wrongdoing , just before midnight on Dec. 24 , Walsh expressed the hope that on Christmas Day their action might help to bring Christ ’s pace and reconciliation to the victims and survivors of child sexual abuse to whom they again apologized .
In another public display of the turmoil within the Catholic Church leadership , Cardinal Sean Brady criticized the indifference shown by the Vatican and Papal Nuncio , Archbishop Giuseppe Leanza , to the inquiry .
“ It is unfortunate the requests from the commission did n’t get a reply , ” he said .
“ They should have . ”
In the careful language of the princes of the Church this was tantamount to a demarche .
The Murphy commission investigated 320 allegations against a sample of 46 out of 183 priests from 1975 to 2004 .
It found that several cardinals and bishops protected criminal priests while taking no action to protect children .
A number of priests have gone public with complaints of a witch - hunt against clerics and have protested at the pressure from Archbishop Martin on bishops to resign .
Martin , who was sent from Rome in 2003 to handle the growing scandal , apologized at Christmas midnight mass in Dublin to priests who were suffering the consequences of his actions .
One of the five working bishops named in the Murphy report , Bishop Martin Drennan of Galway , who served in the Dublin diocese in the 1990s , has not declared his intention to resign but is now under intense pressure to do so .
Walsh was the bishop of the Ferns Diocese and Field was president of the hierarchy ’s Commission for Justice and Social Affairs .
The woes of the Church in “ Holy Ireland ” were compounded by a fire which broke out in St Mel ’s Cathedral in Longford after midnight mass .
By Christmas morning the 170 - year - old building was reduced to a shell of its former glory — a metaphor for the condition of the Irish Catholic church itself .
It seems strange that a man best known for creating the quintessential detective , who based his deductions solely on reason , would also be one of the biggest proponents of Spiritualism around the turn of the last century .
Equally strange is that a man who based his career of performing illusions and magic tricks was one of the most stringent disbelievers of the same religion .
Perhaps strangest of all was the friendship of these two men , Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Harry Houdini .
Good Beginnings
Houdini met Doyle while doing a performance tour in Europe .
While the magician did not believe in Spiritualism , he had a strong interest in the subject and said many times that he did desperately want to believe , as he truly wished to speak to his beloved deceased mother .
Doyle was already well - known for his support of the belief by this point , and was considered by many to be a saint of Spiritualism .
When he met Houdini , he went about bringing him to some of the best mediums in Europe in an attempt to convert the magician .
At this point , Houdini attempted to lead Doyle to believe that he was very open to the idea , but just undecided .
He did enjoy hearing about the religion from a person he considered to be on the same intellectual plane as himself and not an entirely gullible person .
Still though , the magician was able to see through the parlor tricks used by the mediums that Doyle brought him to .
The more of the mediums he saw , the less convinced he became .
While he did not yet begin exposing the frauds , he did record their methods and become increasingly frustrated with their taking advantage of people ’s trust .
At Cross Purposes
Soon enough , Houdini started to begin his famous crusade against fraudulent mediums .
He eventually even became part of a Scientific America committee offering a massive reward to anyone who could prove their methods were authentic -- of course , no one ever managed to claim the reward .
As his fame grew for these acts , Houdini even started attending séances in costume , taking with him a reporter and a police officer .
Funny enough , Doyle actually supported these efforts at first , because he was afraid the fakes would damage the religion ’s legitimacy .
Although Houdini offered to show Doyle how to spot the tricks used by mediums , Doyle insisted that the mediums he knew were extremely honest and would never cheat their followers .
As Houdini started to push Doyle even further to admit the people were acting dishonestly , Doyle soon converted to the belief that Houdini himself was one of the most powerful mediums around .
Doyle and other Spiritualists who held this belief claimed the magician actually dematerialized himself to make his famous escapes .
They believed he was working to discredit other mediums so he could gain publicity and take his act even further .
Doyle expressed many of these beliefs in his last book , The Edge of the Unknown .
Houdini , unfortunately , was caught between a rock and a hard place with these accusations .
He could n’t actually reveal his tricks , but by not doing so , the Spiritualists still had ammo to claim he was a medium .
While he simply stated that his escapes were all performed by physical means , these tales haunted him until his death .
Attempting to Convert Doyle
In an attempt to prove to Doyle that his performances only involved trickery , Houdini offered to perform a special trick for his friend .
The two men were joined by the Bernard Ernst president of the American Society of Magicians for the test , which started with a room filled with a slate , five cork balls and some white paint .
Doyle was instructed to choose one of the balls at random and then place it in the container of paint .
He was then given a pencil and a piece of paper and was told to go wherever he wanted to write a message of his choice on the paper .
Houdini and Ernst stayed in the room , while Doyle left the house , walked three blocks away and then wrote a message on the paper .
He then folded the paper , put it in his pocket and returned to the house .
Upon his return , Houdini instructed Doyle to pick up the ball and put it on the slate .
The ball then began to roll over the slate , where it spelled out the words Mene Mene Tekel Upharsin , the same words Doyle wrote on the paper .
While Houdini devised this test to show Doyle these methods all involved simple tricks , Doyle was convinced more than ever that Houdini was a medium .
Attempting to Convert Houdini
The two continued to be friends and spent a vacation together in Atlantic City shortly after Doyle ’s speaking tour in New York .
During the vacation , Doyle ’s wife , lady Jean offered to perform a séance for Houdini .
He accepted , trusting her sincerity and honesty , and tried to completely accept the realism of the experience .
As stated earlier , Houdini wanted to believe , he still had not found anyone who was worth believing in though .
He was particularly excited about the séance when Jean announced that she would be try to contact his mother .
Houdini said , “ I had made up my mind that I would be as religious as it was in my power to be and not at any time did I scoff during the ceremony … with a beating heart I waited , hoping that I might feel once more the presence of my beloved mother . "
Lady Jean entered a trance during the séance and her hand started moving , scribbling words across paper , which Doyle then handed to Houdini .
The message detailed his mother ’s pleasure in finally getting to contact her son .
They started off saying , “ Oh my darling , thank God , thank God , at last I 'm through .
I 've tried , oh so often -- now I am happy .
Why , of course , I want to talk to my boy -- my own beloved boy -- friends , thank you , with all my heart for this . "
After the séance , Houdini wrote a small note on the bottom of the paper , saying , “ Message written by Lady Doyle claiming the spirit of my dear Mother had control of her hand -- my sainted mother could not write English and spoke broken English . ”
A few months after the Doyle ’s returned home to England , Houdini went public about the incident .
He said there was no chance his mother had been summoned in the séance based on her poor English and the fact that she never learned to read or write .
He said he believed the Doyle ’s did not deceive him intentionally , but were victims to their own gullibility .
Doyle tried to argue against these claims by saying that language is universal to the dead .
He also said Houdini was too nervous about the encounter to accept that it was his own mother speaking to him from the beyond .
The End of It All
After this , the pair tried to maintain some level of strained friendship , but the final blow came when Houdini began publicly attacking Mina “ Magery ” Crandon .
His Scientific American panel was fervent in discrediting Mrs. Crandon after she came forward to claim the prize .
Doyle was a huge supporter of Crandon , even praising her in his later book The History of Spiritualism .
“ The commission is , in my opinion , a farce , " he wrote , " and has already killed itself . "
The two began privately quarreling , but by 1923 , the were exchanging criticizing letters to one another via the New York Times .
After they publicly feuded when their tours happened to cross in Denver , they stopped talking for good .
A few years later , Houdini died .
When his wife , Bess began clearing out his property , she uncovered a huge collection of books on Spiritualism and she opted to send them to Doyle .
The author wrote back to her , stating his reluctance to accept the gifts though , because he thought Houdini harbored bad feelings against him up until the time of his death .
Bess wrote back and said that Houdini had , in fact , held out hope of contacting his mother up until his death and even told her so on his death bed .
She assured Doyle that Houdini carried no resentment towards him and that the press had greatly exaggerated the feud between the two .
She best summed up Houdini ’s thoughts by writing , “ he was deeply hurt whenever any journalistic arguments arose between you and would have been the happiest man in the world had he been able to agree with your views on Spiritism .
He admired and respected you -- two remarkable men with different views . ”

Arms globocorp Lockheed Martin announced today that it has won a $ 31 m contract from the famous Pentagon crazy - ideas bureau , DARPA , to reinvent the internet and make it more suitable for military use .
Microsoft will also be involved in the effort .
The main thrust of the effort will be to develop a new Military Network Protocol , which will differ from old hat such as TCP / IP in that it will offer " improved security , dynamic bandwidth allocation , and policy - based prioritization levels at the individual and unit level " .
" New network threats and attacks require revolutionary protection concepts , " said Lockheed cyber-arsenal chieftain John Mengucci .
" Through this project , as well as our cyber Mission Maker initiatives , we are working to enhance cyber security and ensure that warfighters * can fight on despite cyber attacks . "
Lockheed will be partnered with Anagran , Juniper Networks , LGS Innovations , Stanford University and - of course - Microsoft in developing the MNP .
Apart from that , Lockheed 's own Information Systems & Global Services - Defense tentacle will work on amazing new hardware .
According to the firm :
Lockheed Martin's team will develop router technologies that include strong authentication and self configuration capabilities to improve security , reduce the need for trained network personnel and lower overall life cycle costs for network management .
The original Arpanet , which turned into the TCP / IP internet we all know and love , was developed for DARPA 's predecessor .
It was at least nominally intended for military use , though in reality it took off first in academia .
There is some mild irony in the sight of DARPA deciding to more or less repeat the process all over again at this late date . ®
* Perhaps one might speak of " warfs " for short .
Democracy Canadian - style :
How do you like it so far ?
lmartin@globeandmail.com
When you think about it , the way to make governing easy is to dispense as much as is possible with the demands of democracy .
The d-word is a drag .
It gets in the way of the exercise of power .
Ways need be found to circumvent it .
There are a variety of such ways .
One is to limit the voice of the bureaucracy , the public service , making it more submissive and partisan .
Ditto the foreign service .
As well , you want to dispense with agency or commission heads who do n't follow your thinking .
If some agencies get particularly meddlesome , such as Elections Canada , take them to court .
There 's an old - fashioned idea , once a Reform Party thing , that regular people - those grassroots folks - should have a sniff of the action .
As nice as it sounds , do n't go there .
You need to amass unparalleled executive power so everything is top down and put through the filter of politics .
For your own caucus , you enforce such tight discipline that no one dare cast an independent vote .
You issue your members a secret handbook on how to disrupt parliamentary committees .
For Question Period , you instruct your members to answer most queries with a putdown of the previous government 's record .
A key facet of a downgrading democracy campaign has got to be cutting off access to information - so much so that you leave the Information Commissioner appalled , especially with the stonewalling at the Privy Council Office .
Some sensitive documents are going to get out no matter how hard you try .
So the strategy is to use national security as a cover to black out all potentially incriminating paragraphs .
You may also wish to eliminate a huge government information registry ( the Co-ordination of Access to Information Requests System ) because the fewer the tracks , the better .
You may also wish to prevent the publishing of departmental studies , especially ones that do n't reflect well on your law - and - order proclivities .
It is said that a hallmark of democracy is the toleration of dissent .
Best leave that one in the church pew .
Exceptional measures need be used to crush the opposition .
Stuff such as taking the unprecedented step of launching personal attack ads between election campaigns .
Or trying to push through a measure that would effectively cut off financing to the opposition .
A heavy dose of demagogu - ery also can go a long way .
Play on simple prejudices by accusing opponents of not supporting the troops or of being anti-Israel .
If nothing 's working , if the going gets really tough , do n't hesitate to bring out the heavy timber .
Just after Parliament has reopened , have it shut down .
If your campaign is waged effectively , you will enfeeble the checks and balances in the system and give the d-word a good clubbing , emerging very much in control .
That 's effectively what 's happened in Ottawa over the past four years .
The Prime Minister is now in such command that he can get away with pretty much anything .
And he is lauded for his conquests .
A test case of his powers is the re-emergence of the Afghan detainee controversy .
The government is knee - deep in allegations of a cover - up , of obstruction of justice , of treating Parliament , as this newspaper said in an editorial , with contempt .
The censoring of documents on the basis of national security - which also happened in the income trust controversy - is being met with great skepticism .
The way the Military Police Complaints Commission has been blocked from probing the affair is unseemly .
The treatment of diplomat Richard Colvin has spawned a letter of reproach from no fewer than 71 former ambassadors .
William Johnson , a biographer of Stephen Harper , says flatly that " the government has subverted Canadian democracy . "
If true , it likely wo n't matter .
The key is that once you 've established such a pronounced degree of control over the levers of power , you 're in position to strong - arm your way past anything .
And so the government has halted hearings on the detainee file by boycotting them .
And so the government is threatening to prorogue Parliament again so it does n't have to face more detainee music .
It 's more evidence from a stockpile of how the system 's been brought to heel .
It 's democracy Canadian - style .
Third District Congressman Dennis Moore , a Democrat who defied political gravity by consistently winning in one of the wealthiest and most Republican Congressional districts in Republican Kansas , said this week he ’s ending his high - wire act and wo n’t seek re-election in 2010 .
Almost within minutes of his announcement , the frenzied field of Republican candidates for his seat doubled .
“ It is time for a new generation of leadership to step forward , ” Moore , who is in his sixth term , said in a written statement announcing his departure .
Although Moore prided himself on being a Blue Dog Democrat and touted his fiscally conservative credentials , he had a solid lock on his district .
He was affectionately known as D MO -- because of his ability to bring federal money to the district , about $ 190 million for such things as flood control , transportation and social services ; and for his constituent service and rapport with residents in the 3rd District , which includes Johnson and Wyandotte counties in the Kansas City Metro area , and part of Douglas County including part of Lawrence and the University of Kansas .
Moore is a member of the House Budget Committee and the Financial Services Committee , where as chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee , he has conducted hearings on the Wall Street bailout and on reforming banking and financial regulations .
“ I have always taken this responsibility very seriously , ” Moore ‘s statement said .
“ A public office is a public trust .
This has been the most exciting and frustrating job I have ever had .
“ Exciting because of the opportunities to do the right thing for our people , especially those who most need our support .
“ Frustrating because of the strident partisanship which too often distracts Congress from squarely addressing the critical issues of our time . ”
There have been some indications that Moore ’s health prompted his retirement .
His statement referred to the present term as tiring -- a term in which Congress has taken on issues that have proven unusually venomous , including health insurance .
He cancelled town - hall meetings in his district this summer because of death threats .
Global warming , economic stimulus and banking and financial reform have also stirred the political pot .
“ But I have always sought to represent the moderate mainstream of the district , which I hope will also be the case with my successor , ” he said -- a pointed slap at Kansas conservatives .
Kansas Republican Party chair Amanda Adkins said Moore is getting out while the getting is good
“ President Obama and Nancy Pelosi ’s agenda is dangerous for the country and giving Democrats in Washington unchecked powers is unsafe for America , ” she said .
“ Voters in the 3rd District are very aware that Dennis Moore ’s record of voting with Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic leadership 98 percent of the time is out of touch with their values . ”
The Republicans will come up with a good candidate who is pro-growth and pro-business and focused on the needs of Kansans , Adkins said .
But flipping the district to the Republican column might be tricky .
For years , Kansas Republicans have been bitterly divided between the Rotary Club wing of the party , business oriented but moderate on social issues ; and the True Believers , characterized by unusually conservative social stances mixed with strong anti-tax fervor .
The wings are often locked in mortal combat over the control and soul of the Kansas party and often forget about Democrats .
That ’s why Kansas Democrats , who are outnumbered 2 - 1 in voter registration and are basically a third party in the state , have been surprisingly successful .
Indeed many moderate Republicans have found more political success as Democrats , including governors Joan Finney and Mark Parkinson .
Moore , a former Johnson County prosecutor , got into Congress because he upset a moderate Republican incumbent caught in the Republican feuding .
Moore has managed to stay in office by wooing moderate Republicans irked by the parade of conservatives who have challenged Moore .
Members of the True Believers have already said they wo n’t support any Republican candidate who strays too far from their beliefs .
“ There 's no chance to elect a right - wing conservative here , and unfortunately that 's where the Kansas Republican Party is right now ; both in their party leadership and in their primary voters , ” said Sarah Burris , editor of the Web site Forward Kansas .
“ … I think that 's why you see such a boondoggle in the GOP trying to find the right candidate .
“ This is n't a teabagging district , ” Burris said .
“ It went 51 percent for Obama last year and even at one of its most conservative points in 2004 , Moore beat Kobach ( conservative Republican Kris Kobach ) 55/43 .
“ Last year he won it with 56.3 percent to 39.8 percent .
In Douglas County alone Moore got 70 percent of the vote .
You 've got the moderates and the Democrats , all of which have been unified behind a good candidate for years . ”
Before Moore ’s announcement , there were four Republican candidates registered with the Federal Election Commission -- former state representative Patricia Lightner , who had raised the most money ; Thomas Scherer , who ’s put in $ 80,000 of his own money ; John Rysavy and Daniel Gilyeat , who was featured on the ABC TV show “ Extreme Home Makeover . “
Moore ’s announcement sparked a free - for - all , prompting other announcements or expressions of interest from Republicans , mostly conservatives .
;
Kansas House Appropriations Committee chair Kevin Yoder started testing the waters .
Nick Jordan , the former state senator who ran against Moore in 2008 , said he ’ll run , and Overland Park attorney Greg Musil , who ran against Moore in 2000 , is mulling another run .
Charlotte O’Hara , who has twice challenged Johnson County Commission chair Annabeth Surbaugh , said she may run .
For Democrats , the waters may be even muddier .
The party has seen several of its top elected officials take off without leaving a clear heir -- governors Kathleen Sebelius and her successor Parkinson and his lieutenant governor Troy Findley who said he wo n’t run in 2010 , and Moore ’s departure follows that baleful tradition .
But Democrats should hold on to the district and there should n’t be as much fighting , Burris said .
“ There wo n't be as many Democrats file , simply because there is n't the strength in the Democratic Party to have 37 people file , ” she said .
“ Similarly , the Kansas Democratic Party is n't as divided as the GOP and there 's more consensus and fewer issues to debate . ”
Those Democrats being mentioned include Kansas House Democratic Leader Paul Davis of Lawrence , former state representative R.J. Wilson of Shawnee , state senator and Teaparty Democrat Chris Steineger , whose name has also been mentioned for races for governor and secretary of state , and Kansas City , Kan. / Wyandotte County Unified Government Mayor Joe Reardon .
Burris said her favorites are Reardon and state senator Tom Holland , a computer business owner from Baldwin City in Douglas County .
“ Both are incredibly well qualified and would represent the district well , ” she said .
“ There are a number of remarkable people in that district that would make outstanding elected officials . ”

Aggregates.pdf A Burden Off the Mind : A Study Guide on the Five Aggregates 5956 views
One of the new concepts most central to the Buddha 's teaching was that of the khandhas , usually translated into English as â€œaggregates .â€ 
Prior to the Buddha , the Pali word khandha had very ordinary meanings :
A khandha could be a pile , a bundle , a heap , a mass .
It could also be the trunk of a tree .
In his first sermon , though , the Buddha gave it a new , psychological meaning , introducing the term â€œclinging - khandhasâ€ to summarize his analysis of the truth of stress and suffering .
Throughout the remainder of his teaching career , he referred to these psychological khandhas time and again .
Their importance in his teachings has thus been obvious to every generation of Buddhists ever since .

At present , all that is left of Buddhism are the words of the Buddha .
Only his teachings
Ã± the scriptures Ã± remain .
Please be aware of this .
Due to the corruption caused by the defiling nature of the kilesas , true spiritual principles are no longer practiced in present - day Buddhism .
As Buddhists , we constantly allow our minds to be agitated and confused , engulfed in mental defilements that assail us from every direction .
They so overpower our minds that we never rise above these contaminating influences , no matter how hard we try .
The vast majority of people are not even interested enough to try :
They simply close their eyes and allow the onslaught to overwhelm them .
They do n't even attempt to put up the least amount of resistance .
Since they lack the mindfulness needed to pay attention to the consequences of their thoughts , all their thinking and all they do and say are instances of the kilesas giving them a beating .
They surrendered to the power of these ruinous forces such a long time ago that they now lack any motivation to restrain their wayward thoughts ...

Two Styles of Insight Meditation 2138 views
Today the practice of insight meditation has gained global popularity , yet in achieving this success it has undergone a subtle metamorphosis .
Rather than being taught as an integral part of the Buddhist path , it is now often presented as a secular discipline whose fruits pertain more to life within the world than to supramundane release .
Many meditators testify to the tangible benefits they have gained from the practice of insight meditation , benefits that range from enhanced job performance and better relationships to deeper calm , more compassion , and greater awareness .
However , while such benefits may certainly be worthwhile in their own right , taken by themselves they are not the final goal that the Buddha himself holds up as the end point of his training .
That goal , in the terminology of the texts , is the attainment of Nibbana , the destruction of all defilements here and now and deliverance from the beginningless round of rebirths .

Forest Dhamma : A Selection of Talks on Buddhist Practice 2798 views
Training the heart to attain happiness is the way that all the Buddhas proclaimed to be the right and true way .
When our hearts never have time to rest and attain calm , they are not fundamentally different from those of animals .
But when our hearts rest , relax and receive training , we will be able to see the harmful affects of thinking and imagining , and turbulence they cause in the heart .
Then we will come to see the value of a calm heart .
Once we have attained a state of mental calm , we will have reached the first stage of Dhamma , which will lead us steadily onwards .
In other words , we will have a firmly established faith in the principles of Dhamma ...

POLICE are hunting an armed thief after a pistol was stolen from specialist gun shop .
The weapon , which was taken from Field and Stream on Montrose Terrace in Edinburgh , is believed to have been stolen in the early hours of Saturday morning .
Police have described the theft as “ unusual ” , and are investigating as to whether the valuable weapon may have been stolen to order .
The antique sporting pistol , worth around £ 660 , is live and was previously used to put down racing horses .
The valuable weapon , which is 16 inches long , with a long , eight inch barrel , is a collectors ’ item and dates back to around 1840 .
The shop ’s owner opened up to find the item missing , along with a quantity of jewellery .
Lothian and Borders Police said that they are looking into “ all possibilities ” surrounding the theft .
A police spokesman said : “ This is a particularly unusual item to have been stolen and we are eager to speak to anyone with information that can help us return it to the store .
“ Anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious around 4 am on Montrose Terrace is asked to contact police immediately . ”

Auf ihrem ersten Arbeitstreffen am 17.11 . in Strausberg hat die Arbeitsgemeinschaft “ Umwelt und Energie ” die Grundlagen für ihre zukünftige inhaltliche Arbeit gelegt .
Dabei ging es unter anderem um die unterirdische Speicherung von CO2 zur Verminderung des Treibhauseffektes , den Ausstieg aus der Verstromung von Braunkohle und anderer limitierter Energieträger sowie den Ausbau der erneuerbaren Energien .
Die Umwelt - Piraten sprechen sich gegen die CO2 - Abscheidung und - Speicherung ( engl. Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage , kurz CCS ) aus .
Das Verfahren sei , so die Begründung , ineffizient , extrem kostenintensiv und für Mensch und Natur gefährlich .
So könnte der enorme Druck in den unterirdischen Lagerstätten beispielsweise geologische Ereignisse wie Erdbeben auslösen .
Ferner müssten durch den zusätzlichen Energieverbrauch dieses Verfahrens bis zu 66 Prozent mehr Brennstoff eingesetzt werden .
Weiterhin wurde kritisiert , dass die Betreiber die Ewigkeitskosten , d.h. die Folgekosten nach Beendigung des Projekts , nach 30 Jahren dem Bund und damit dem Steuerzahler überlassen .
Die Piraten fordern einen schnellstmöglichen Ausstieg aus der Verstromung von Braunkohle und anderen limitierter Energieträgern .
Alternativen bieten erneuerbare Energien .
So könnte man an geeigneten Orten , zum Beispiel in Güterfelde / Stahnsdorf , Solaranlagen errichten .
Die Umwelt - Piraten sprechen sich auch für mehr Investitionen in Forschung und Technik von Windkraftanlagen aus , um deren Effizienz weiter zu steigern .
Diskutiert wurde auch über das Modell der Gemeinde Güssing im Österreichischen Burgenland .
Die Gemeinde entwickelte seit Beginn der 1990er Jahre ein Energiekonzept zur unabhängigen und nachhaltigen Energiegewinnung , für das sie mit zahlreichen Preisen ausgezeichnet wurde .
Das Modell zeigt , dass es möglich ist , ganze Regionen mit erneuerbaren Energien energieautark zu machen .
Güssing setzt dabei auf die Vergasung von Holz und anderer Biomasse .
Nach diesem Vorbild könnten im Land Brandenburg großnetzunabhängige Biokraftwerke unter kommunaler Verwaltung entstehen , die durch die Nutzung erneuerbarer Energien umweltschonend , nachhaltig und unter demokratischer Beteiligung der kommunalen Bevölkerung betrieben werden .
Die Piraten legen großen
Wert darauf , dass Arbeitsplätze durch den Ausbau erneuerbarer Energien geschaffen werden und Stromerzeugung zukünftig nachhaltig und umweltverträglich stattfindet .
Zu guter Letzt wurde beschlossen , dass sich der brandenburgische Landesverband auf Bundesebene für den Atomausstieg stark machen sollte .

mrharrysan was the first of a few to send in this story of a restaurant in Tucson , Arizona , that just lost a lawsuit and must pay almost $ 49,000 for 14 BMI songs that were played at a karaoke night held at the restaurant .
It was a default judgment , as the restaurant owners apparently did not respond to the lawsuit and failed to show up .
The owners claim they responded to the lawsuit , but there appears to be no evidence of that ( the court never received a response ) .
Based on this , the owners clearly deserve their share of responsibility in what appears to be a decision to ignore this .
The claim that : also does n't make much sense .
If their attorney said to take it to court , they ( perhaps ... just a suggestion ) should have showed up in court .
They now claim they 'll appeal , but not showing up for the original case was a huge mistake .
Separately , they claim that the karaoke night was run by a third party contractor that was " properly licensed " with BMI and ASCAP , but I 'm pretty sure that is incorrect .
If I remember correctly , it 's the venue that needs the license , not anyone doing the entertaining . , there 's still plenty of ridiculousness to go around on the BMI side .
BMI has been bullying anyone hosting karaoke nights for a while now , so it 's got the process down .
However , $ 49,000 for 14 songs seems ridiculous -- and anyone with any sense of reality would admit that .
Not BMI .
It 's spokesperson , Jerry Bailey indicated to the reporter covering the story that the restaurant was lucky BMI did n't push for $ 30,000 per song , since it could ask for that much .
And , of course , BMIadmit that the $ 49,000 for 14 songs is ridiculous and agree to let the restaurant pay a smaller , but reasonable sum , and move on , but it 's not doing that either .
Instead , Bailey highlights how its shakedown specialists are good at collecting on these judgments :
Yes , the shakedown business is a good one , and BMI has lots of experience in it .

The main directions are : GUM , which was one of the first parallel implementations of Haskell many years ago [ 1 ] .
The programming API is the same as GHC has : par / pseq and strategies ( indeed this API was invented in the context of GUM , we just re-used it in GHC ) .
GUM uses PVM message passing to implement a distributed heap , and can run on clusters of machines or a multicore , or a combination of the two .
GUM has in the past been integrated with GHC , but has sufferred from a lack of development effort so has rotted in recent years .
Efforts are now underway to get it working with GHC HEAD again .
Eden [ 2 ] also uses PVM , but does not have a distributed heap .
It 's implementation is much simpler , and the API is rather more explicit than par /seq and strategies .
Eden has been tracking GHC more closely than GUM , but it 's still a research project and there 's little effort available to make releases .
Neither of these are really what you 'd call " Distributed Haskell " , they are implementations of parallel variants of Haskell running on distributed hardware .
There was a Distributed Haskell project , but it is not active at the moment [ 3 ] .

the science terminology abuse top five
Science is full of technical jargon and words with multiple , context - dependent meanings .
And purveyors of woo and snake oil are happy to abuse this to line their wallets .
For as long as there was science , there have been people poaching words from technical jargons to generate an initial sense of respectability to whatever they were saying or selling .
And unfortunately , for the same length of time , they ’ve been disregarding what the terms they borrow actually entail and spun their definition to justify elaborate quackery and crankery .
Today , the situation is no different and technobabble flows from the mouths and pages of woo-meisters like an oceanic current .
Now , all words are not created equal for pseudoscientific abuse and there are trends in woo -speak .
So what are some of today ’s hottest out - of - context buzzwords ?
# 5 . Evolution
As far as scientific theories go , evolution is a damn good one so it may seem like an odd place to begin .
However , when biologists and non-scientists talk about the concept , they often mean two drastically different things .
In biology , evolution is a process of gradual change and selection .
In pop culture , evolution is synonymous with advancement which is why many woo peddlers , New Age enthusiasts , and transhumanist pontificators use it in their discussion .
According to them , human transcendence or spiritual enlightenment is simply part of an evolutionary process and we ’ll somehow overcome our natural limitations as a final stage of our evolution .
Seriously ?
Just try and tell a biologist about a final stage of evolution without being brained and very rightfully so .
Evolution is like climate .
It ’s an ongoing , dynamic process that will be with us as long as life can survive on our planet and its end will only come when the last remaining organisms on Earth a few billion years from now will fade into extinction and our world burns under a blistering , giant , red Sun .
# 4 . Natural
Invoking the natural , wholesome goodness of things is the latest marketing craze in the generally static food and supplement business .
Today , with millions of people highly conscious of their health reading the ingredients on just about every can and box they buy , entrepreneurs figured out that substituting chemical names with herbs and other “ natural ” products would give their customers a warm and fuzzy feeling of escape from all those scary synthetics .
And millions of people fell for it .
Here ’s the funny thing though .
Natural does n’t mean safe or good for you and many of those scary sounding chemical names on boxes are actually extracts from plants , fruits , vegetables and milk .
Nature also has a vast supply of venoms , toxins and radioactive rocks which could kill you just by being in the same room with you .
In reality , natural simply means that it ’s extant in this universe which is a list that consists of well … everything you can legally buy or illegally obtain .
# 3 . Energy
Invoked by mystics , homeopaths , psychics and a whole swath of New Age woo-meisters , energy is perhaps one of the most abused terms in physics .
To get an idea how badly the term could be abused , just check out the inanities uttered by homeopathic optometrist Charlene Werner .
The howling you can hear in the background if you listen hard enough is Einstein ’s ghost screaming in his grave as his formula of mass - energy equivalence is violated in ways that would impress even Marquis de Sade .
For those of us who live in the real world , energy is the potential of a system to do work via whatever mechanism generates and uses it , not a euphemism for magical powers supposedly laying dormant in our bodies , waiting to be harnessed by a meandering quack who trips over her own tongue trying to explain something a middle school student would be expected to know on a science test .
# 2. Toxin
Listen to an alt med practitioner and you ’ll soon imagine a miasma of toxins settling over everything you touch .
They ’re everywhere and their buildup in your body can make you sick which is why all those “ natural supplements ” they sell should be bought for the purpose of cleaning out your system .
While it ’s true that toxin buildup can cause you to get sick , diseases are generally caused by germs which is often missed or outright ignored by naturists and alt med quacks .
Your body evolved in an environment in which it ’s exposed to plenty of toxins on a regular basis and you do have a tolerance for them and their effects on your body .
Unless you ’re having bizarre symptoms , you ’re probably not in danger of being poisoned to death by invisible gunk .
And if for some reason you see trees in your neighborhood turn strange colors and producing their own lacquer , you ’re probably better off going to a doctor and the EPA than someone who wants to sell you a bottle of whatever he ’s calling a natural holistic body cleanser .
# 1. Quantum
Ordinarily , quantum mechanics describes the complex behavior of the basic building blocks of matter .
The implications of understanding how the most fundamental parts of everything around us work can yield grand insights into the function of the universe itself .
But of course , the woo crew had to show up to ruin a good thing and they ’ve co-opted some of the most exotic behaviors in particle physics into their technobabble , which seeks to somehow justify their belief that something inherently unscientific and useless actually works .
One wonders if any of the cranks who invoke quantum particles have ever even seen the formulas underlying the modern understanding of how particles form , interact , arise and decay .
Here ’s a small sample …
And that ’s just the Higgs Lagrangian which provides an overview of the dynamics of the Higgs boson .
Let me give you a moment to pick up your jaw while posing the question of where can we find a paper using what we know to be an accurate mathematical description of how bosons and fermions work , supporting all the ideas behind quantum homeopathy advocated by Deepak Chopra and other oblivious cranks .
Even worse , many a theologian eager to play scientist are dropping the word quantum and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in their proofs of a deity ’s existence , often demonstrating they have no grasp on the very ideas they invoke .
Much like the advocates of woo , they ’ve substituted the quantum for their invocation of magic and miracles and then pretend that by merely using a word from scientific jargon somehow makes their explanations empirical when in reality it does no such thing and adds infinitely more harm than good to their arguments .

Manufacturer to take off references to New Testament passages on kit used by British , US and New Zealand troops in Afghanistan
A US arms manufacturer has agreed to remove coded biblical messages stamped into gun sights used by British , US and New Zealand troops in Afghanistan .
The company , Trijicon , said today it would remove the references to New Testament passages , after New Zealand military chiefs objected to their presence and the US military vowed to review the procurement .
The markings , which blend into the serial number and other product information stamped into the metal , include JN8:12 , an apparent reference to John 8:12 .
The verse reads : " Then spake Jesus again unto them , saying , I am the light of the world : he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness , but shall have the light of life . "
Trijicon , founded by a devoutly Christian South African has acknowledged that the markings refer to biblical passages .
But the existence of explicitly Christian messages stamped on military kit used in a Muslim country risks raising tensions and fears that Nato and other western countries are engaging in a religious crusade .
Furthermore , thousands of Muslims , Jews and agnostics serve in the US military , which prohibits proselytising by its members .
In a statement released today , the company said it would provide free kits to remove the messages .
The US military had pledged to review the purchase , although one military official was unperturbed , likening the citation to the " In God We Trust " motto that graces US currency .
The UK Ministry of Defence said it was not aware of the message and bought the sights because they were the best available .
The Church of England said the messages undermined the military effort .
The New Zealand military is examining ways to remove the messages .
" It 's put us in an uncomfortable situation , " said Major Kristian Dunne .
" We can see how they would cause offence .
We are unhappy they did n't make us aware of it .
They did n't violate any policy but we consider them inappropriate .
It also could be used against us by other religions . "
New Zealand has about 220 troops in the international security assistance force in Afghanistan , mostly in the region surrounding Bamyan .
Growing rice , healing the soil : Project tests new method in southern US
news
The air is filled with obsessive self - satisfied rhetoric about supporting the troops , giving them everything they need and not letting them down .
But that rhetoric is as hollow as a jazzman ’s drum because the overwhelming majority of Americans have no desire at all to share in the sacrifices that the service members and their families are making .
Most Americans do not want to serve in the wars , do not want to give up their precious time to do volunteer work that would aid the nation ’s warriors and their families , do not even want to fork over the taxes that are needed to pay for the wars .
To say that this is a national disgrace is to wallow in the shallowest understatement .
The nation will always give lip - service to support for the troops , but for the most part Americans do not really care about the men and women we so blithely ship off to war , and the families they leave behind .
The National Military Family Association , which commissioned the RAND study , has poignant comments from the children of military personnel on its Web site .
You can tell immediately how much more real the wars are to those youngsters than to most Americans :
“ I hope it ’s not him on the news getting hurt . ”
“ Most of my grades dropped because I was thinking about my dad , because my dad ’s more important than school . ”
“ Mom will be in her room and we hear her crying . ”
The reason it is so easy for the U.S. to declare wars , and to continue fighting year after year after year , is because so few Americans feel the actual pain of those wars .
We ’ve been fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan longer than we fought in World Wars I and II combined .
If voters had to choose right now between instituting a draft or exiting Afghanistan and Iraq , the troops would be out of those two countries in a heartbeat .
I do n’t think our current way of waging war , which is pretty easy - breezy for most citizens , is what the architects of America had in mind .
Here ’s George Washington ’s view , for example : “ It must be laid down as a primary position and the basis of our system , that every citizen who enjoys the protection of a free government owes not only a proportion of his property , but even his personal service to the defense of it . ”
What we are doing is indefensible and will ultimately exact a fearful price , and there will be absolutely no way for the U.S. to avoid paying it .
Got a subscription to Kirkus ?
Maybe not , but if you still read books , in whatever form , Nielsen ’s announcement today that it ’s shutting down the prepublication - review journal matters to you .
( Nielsen ’s newspaper - trade mag , Editor & Publisher , is also reportedly folding , as Nielsen looks to unload all of its publications , including the Hollywood Reporter and Billboard . )
The Pepsi to Publishers Weekly ’s Coke when it comes to prepub press , Kirkus was always known , to the booksellers and industry reporters who relied on its write ups of forthcoming titles , as the cranky one .
Where PW went soft for a big name or a fresh face , Kirkus could usually be counted on to demolish the overblown writers , and to be unsparing when it came to first novels by photogenic young things .
A rave in Kirkus was truly a prize ; a hatchet job was an easy enough excuse for a bookstore owner , besieged by the sheer volume of books being flogged , to move on .
Full details have n’t been released yet , so we can assume there was n’t a willing buyer for either Kirkus or E&P .
( NBM president Greg Farrar ’s letter , published on Romenesko ’s site , offered “ heartfelt thanks ” and nothing more to the workers thus displaced . )
At the end of a year that saw Publishers Weekly ’s mediagenic and hard - driving editor , Sara Nelson , fired , what remains of the infrastructure of book - selling , book reviewing , and book - industry journalism is left with precious few guideposts .
This is by no means the death knell for the industry , any more than Amazon ’s price war or Borders ’s continuing troubles or the disappearance of book - review pages or three dozen other things .
But it is an irreversible turn , a moment to remember :
When it became not just difficult , but impossible , to deny that cataclysmic transformation is n’t coming — it ’s here .

07 Glenn Beck hoodwinks investors to buy gold at $ 800
Posted on by steve0
I will never support Glenn Beck again !!!
On his advice and the advice of people on his show , I bought gold at less than $ 800.00 an ounce .
He began hyping Gold in 11/20/2007 and earlier .
Now gold is dropping like a rock and I can only sell my Gold for $ 1,131.80 a percentage increase of only 41.5 % .

gold
Here is the proof of him hyping gold around November 20 , 2007 .

Here is the proof that gold was about $ 800.00 an ounce at that time .
http://www.kitco.com/scripts/hist_charts/monthly_graphs.plx
Even if I had been more reasonable than just to buy when Glenn told me to and dollar cost averaged into Gold I still would have very large increase in the value of the price of gold that I purchased back then compared to now .
How dare him !!!

You could make the same argument about housing or internet stocks .
It is all about when you buy and when you sell .
You have made ZERO until you sell your gold .
Have you sold it or are you holding on waiting for it to go even higher ?

Since May 29 , 2007 Does Glan Beck control you like a ROBOT ?
Or are YOU capable of thinking too !
Honestly , I ’m sure Glen meant well .
It ’s not really going to matter where you put it .
It ’s all tanking .

He may have been hyping it , or had a relationship with Goldline even before leaving CNN around 10/16/08 .
See : On October 16 , 2008 , it was announced that Glenn Beck would join the Fox News Channel , leaving behind CNN Headline News .
CNN pulled the program off the air the same day .
Should have followed the decade investment advice discussed over here http://www.bespokeinvest.com/bespoke/2009/12/the-ugly-2000s.html
So if I lost money Glenn Beck should have to pay me back .
Now since I am in the black do I owe Glenn the difference ?
How many people has he tipped the scales in terms of their buying decision .
He should have to take responsibility for that .

Did you do any of your own research ?
Gold is an investment , it goes up and it goes down .
I heard him advertising gold on his program , ( a company that sold gold was a sponsor ) but I did n’t buy any because I did n’t know enough about the gold market .
If Beck asked you to jump off a bridge would you ?
He ’s an entertainer and commentator .

So lets use some round numbers shall we ?
Principle $ 800 for one ounce
Time 25 months ( Nov 2007 till Dec 2009 )
Interest earned $ 1100 - $ 800 or $ 300 ( rounding numbers )
So what was my interest rate ?
Interest = principle X rate X time
300 = 800 X R X 25/12
300 = 1667 R
R = 17.996 percent or just about 18 % return if we just use straight interest .
Compound interest would be done differently but either way 18 % percent is a nice return .

Would I land on a tyrant ’s head ?
If so , yes I will jump .
Say the word Glenn .
I ca n’t believe I let this guy have so much power over me .
Hold Glenn accountable for him making people invest in Gold !!!!

That is a straight - line investment , which is to say it does n’t compound .
( all numbers rounded ) :
If you bought an ounce of gold in 1990 , it would have cost $ 400 and be worth $ 1150 today , a straight line ROI of 288 % , or about 23 % a year ( no compounding , since it just sits there like a lump of gold ) .
In 1990 , the DJIA was 2400 and today it is 10000 , a straight line growth of 385 % ( which means it beat gold anyway ) , but , due to the magic of compounding , your $ 400 would be worth OVER $ 70,000 at average annual return of 32 % — even factoring in the post 9/11 and the obama crash of last year .
Can someone check me ?
My eyes bugged out when I finished the math and now I want to go back in time and smack myself for not plopping down a few hundred 19 years ago ...
But we can work this differently .
Even had the stock market ( or any investment ) had made as little as 10 % , your $ 400 bucks would still be worth $ 2500 — outpacing gold by 2X .
Gold is only a hedge for a very short term assumption of a downturn .
It is a BAD idea for the long run .
If you want to churn , you can go to the track and probably outdo gold if you have a good eye for horseflesh ...

How do gold dealers make money selling gold for paper money declining in value ?
To : taxcontrol
You do n’t get compound interest in gold ( not the type Glenn sells ) .
And I could name any number of investments ( or at least I could FIND them ) that did better than 18 % over 2 years ) .
Gold is just another gamble .

Political turmoil built Sunday over the burning of an image of Iran ’s revolutionary founder , which was aired , in a controversial move , on state television .
Accusations that the incident was carried out by anti-government demonstrators sparked protests as well as threats against reformist leaders .
Iran ’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Sunday said reformist politicians and anti-government demonstrators had defiled the image of his predecessor , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , during National Students Day protests last week .
He said the incident showed that the protest movement that sprang out of the disputed reelection of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad now sought to overturn the government .
Opposition supporters , however , said the incident was staged by hard - liners loyal to Ahmadinejad and aired on TV to discredit the opposition ’s cause .
Tensions rose as police surrounded Tehran University , a hotbed of political activism , where students staged a protest rally Sunday to convey their stand that they were not behind the burning .
The official Islamic Republic News Agency said protests also broke out on other Tehran campuses .
News agencies reported that Zahra Rahnavard , the wife of opposition leader Mir-Hossein Mousavi , addressed the students .
Seminary students across the country on Saturday demonstrated against the burning of Khomeini ’s image .
And 232 lawmakers supported a statement condemning the burning and praising state television for broadcasting the image .
Khamenei blamed reformist leaders for the incident .
“ They did their best to encourage people to confront the establishment , although they had not the power to finish the job , ” he told a group of clerics in a speech broadcast on state television .
Khamenei said enemies of the late Ayatollah Khomeini were “ so encouraged that they came to the university and insulted the imam ’s picture . ”
The airing of the footage could harm the protest movement , painting participants as bent on overthrowing the government .
But the move also risks legitimizing radical opponents of the system whose stance rarely gets a public airing .
Khomeini ’s grandson , Hassan , a mid-ranking cleric , criticized state television for airing the footage , rather than the protesters for purportedly burning the image .
Iran is undergoing its worst political crisis in decades in the wake of the disputed presidential election , in which Ahmadinejad defeated reformists Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi and conservative Mohsen Rezai amid charges of vote - rigging .
Over the weekend , Mousavi ’s website , Kaleme.com , and other reformist news outlets warned of his imminent arrest .
But others say such fears are exaggerated .
“ I do not think the system dares to arrest Mousavi or Karroubi , as it may lead to an explosion , ” said Mashallah Shamsolvaezin , a newspaper writer and reformist political analyst .
The supreme leader called on authorities to find out who was behind the burning of the picture but also asked security forces to remain calm .
“ It is not expedient to spread tension , riot and discord into society , because it is what the enemy wants , ” he said .

去 る11月20日、Haskellナイトというイベント ( http://hop.timedia.co.jp/ ) で、" Haskeller のHaskellによるHaskellerのためのプレゼン "
というなんだかよくわからないタイトルで発表してきました。
遅くなりましたが、作った物の公開と発表の補足をしておきます。
概要 Haskellでプレゼンツールを作りました。 Haskellで記述され、
スクリプト もHaskellで書く ようなプレゼンツールです。 プレゼンをモナディックに書くので 、MonadPointと名付けました。略称は「 モナポ」です。
使い方 まず、MonadPointをcabalでインストールしてください( Windowsに入れる場合、依存ライブラリのFTGLを入れるのが大変だと思いますので、前回のエントリを参照していただければ幸いです)。それから、てきとうな.hsファイルを作って、import MonadPoint してプレゼンをモナドでゴリゴリと書いて、runPresentation
に渡せばいい感じになると思います。レポジトリにあるサンプルが参考になると思います。
http://github.com/tanakh/MonadPoint/blob/master/test/Main.hs
若干説明 今のところサポートしているのは、 矩形の中にそれっぽく文字列を書 く
矩形を書 く
画像ファイルの表 示
矩形をレイアウトする のような機能です 。
基本的に、scaleでスケーリングして、縦横に並べてスライドを作ります。自動で高さとか幅を調節することはできないので、手でやらないといけません。 scale d $ do ... - 縦横に縮小。中央に配置。 scalehu d $ do ... -- 縦方向に縮小。上に配置。 scalehd d $ do ... -- 縦方向に縮小。下に配置。 scalevl d $ do ... -- 横方向に縮小。左に配置。 scalevr d $ do ... -- 横方向に縮小。右に配置。 txtc str -- 文字列。中央揃え。 txtl str -- 文字列。左揃え。 txtr str -- 文字列。右揃え。 pict filename -- 画像を表示。 txtarea strs -- 文字列リストを等幅フォントで表示。
他にも色々あるので、ソースをご参照下さい。
スライドによくつかわれるリスト記法は書きやすくする関数を提供しています。 list $ do ... -- 引数に与えられたリスト要素をうまいことレイアウトして表示する list $ do li " hoge " ul $ do li " moge " ちなみに、liなどは型が違うので、listの外側には置けません。うーん、型ですね。
何がいいのか？ 基本的に誰得ではありますが…。 抽象化能力 テンプレートを作りやすいとか。プレゼン=Haskellソースなので、なんとでもできます。 プラグインをHaskellで書ける ニコニコ動画風Twitterプラグインみたいなのも簡単に書けます。
今後の予定 実装がやっつけで、完成度が低すぎるので、まだまだ色々改良したいところです。 ソースをきれいにす る
GLUT 使うのやめる( フルスクリーンから復帰する手段がないとか…)
フォントをきれいにする( フルシー ンAAとかでどうにかなるのだろうか)
もっといろいろカスタマイズできるようにする(ページ遷移時のアニメーションとか)

The biggest black holes in the universe are also the mostperplexing .
Scientists have long been confused about just how the earliest , most massive black holes formed , but new evidence now suggests they could have originatedinside giant cocoon - like stars .
This idea is at odds with the prevailing thinking that largeblack holes are created by the clumping together of smaller black holes .
Not so , says University of Colorado at Boulderastrophysicist Mitchell Begelman .
Rather , these behemoth black holes likelyformed in the middle of even larger supermassive stars that could have held tensof millions of times the mass of our sun , according to Begelman .
" Until recently , the thinking by many has been that supermassiveblack holes got their start from the merging of numerous , small black holesin the universe , " Begelman said .
" This new model of black holedevelopment indicates a possible alternate route to their formation . "
Begelman studied how these gigantic stars could have formed , and how massive their cores might have been , to understand how they might havegiven rise to huge black holes .
The results of his investigation will bepublished in an upcoming issue of the Monthly Notices of the Royal AstronomicalSociety in London .
The monster stars probably started forming within the first fewhundred million years after the Big Bang , which is thought to have created the universe around 14 billionyears ago , Begelman found .
When the cores of these giant stars had burned alltheir hydrogen , they would have collapsed , forming dense black holes .
Meanwhile the outside gas layers of the stars remained as a shroud .
Eventually , though , the black holes would have swallowed all the remaining stellar matter withintheir reach , ballooning rapidly to staggering weights , the study suggests .
This scenario could be more likely than the clumping processas the origin of supermassive black holes , Begelman said , though it's also possiblethat both methods have occurred .
" The problem that most people see in the clumpingmechanism is whether you get these small black holes to merge frequently enough , " Begelman told SPACE.com .
" I 'm working on trying to compare the rates ofthese two processes . "
Over time , the resulting black boles might have merged withother giant black holes to form even larger leviathans .
" Big black holes formed via these supermassive starscould have had a huge impact on the evolution of the universe , including galaxyformation , " Begelman said .
Astronomers think most galaxies , includingthe Milky Way in which the Earth ?s solar system resides , have supermassiveblack holes at their centers .
These black holes are probably responsible for acosmic phenomenon called quasars , which are thought to occur when mass poursonto huge black holes , and some material is flung away in bright jets ofhigh - energy radiation that can be seen across the universe .

Fifty years ago this month , a lawyer living in a posh New York suburb with his former model wife was being investigated for embezzlement .
Julian Andrew Frank of Westport , Conn. , took out nearly $ 900,000 in life insurance and then , investigators believed , boarded a National Airlines plane with a bomb and blew it up over North Carolina , killing himself and 33 others .
The case recalled an airplane bombing five years earlier , when a timed explosive , planted by John Gilbert Graham of Denver , demolished United Airlines flight 629 as it passed over Longmont , Colo .
Graham later admitted to handing his mother a wrapped " Christmas present " containing the bomb before she left .
All 44 on board died .
In 1986 , Israeli security agents at London 's Heathrow Airport took special interest in a young Irish woman waiting for an El Al flight to Tel Aviv .
They thought it curious that the pregnant woman , a hotel maid , would be flying alone to Israel .
Upon questioning her , the guards learned that she had a Jordanian boyfriend .
Investigating further , they found 10 pounds of plastic explosives tucked into a false bottom on her bag .
The bomb could have brought down the Boeing 747 and the 340 passengers inside .
Note the common element in these stories .
In no case was the carrier of the bomb an Arab or a Muslim .
In the one instance of profiling , astute Israeli guards knew to look beyond Muslims of Mideast origin as potential threats .
Profiling goes only so far .
Foes of whole - body scanning -- people who say : " No need to X - ray what 's under the clothes of grandmothers or 9 - year - old Girl Scouts .
Just look at Muslims " -- do n't understand the challenge .
As some bean - brain said on Fox , " Christians are not blowing up airplanes . "
But they have ... some wittingly , some without knowing .
Now mull this : Slovakian airport security personnel recently staged a test in which they planted bomb - making material in the bags of nine travelers .
The screeners found the forbidden substance in eight of them , but one bag got through and accompanied the unsuspecting Slovak passenger to Dublin .
Although the material posed no danger to the aircraft -- it was not attached to other essential bomb parts -- the Slovak government strongly apologized to Irish officials for not informing them of the test .
Apology warranted , but let 's also thank the Slovak authorities for showing why everyone and everything that gets on an airliner must be stringently screened .
The Slovak who owned the bag had no idea that he was carrying potentially explosive material .
Devise a policy that places certain types above suspicion and therefore exempt from " intrusive " screening , and how long before terrorists would start trying to plant explosives on these very people ?
It is true that better intelligence would have stopped Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab from boarding the Delta flight to Detroit .
There was no excuse for not " connecting the dots " on the alleged would - be suicide bomber .
But coordinating intelligence information is not the same as singling out travelers based on their religion and ethnicity for whole - body imaging .
The latter policy offends Muslims without enhancing security .
This is not about " political correctness . "
There was probably not a single " red flag " attached to the Slovak man .
And we 've all heard those recorded announcements at airports that warn passengers against taking packages from strangers .
Would that have applied to the Christmas present that the Denver women took from her son ?
This notion that some people are obviously innocent and some are not is clearly useless in airline security .
If airport security ever waves grannies past the body - imaging machines , then white - haired ladies on walkers will be the very ones we should be afraid to fly with .
Like most of his past jobs , Don R started at a new company with high hopes and low expectations .
And also like many of his past jobs , his dreams were quickly whisked away .
This time , it happened on his first support ticket .
" This 'll be an easy one , " his programmer - turned - manager boss said , " this used to happen quite a bit , and I 've fixed it a few times .
Sometimes we 'll get descriptions with extra spaces , and when we send a datafeed to the processing company , it can mess up their systems .
But I 'm sure you 'll be able to figure it out , it 's in the clean - up routines . "
Don 's boss was right , it was pretty easy to find .
The code in question looked as follows ....
// pull double spaces itemDesc = stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( itemDesc , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) ;
Curious as to why he chose twenty four replacements , Don took a peek in source control at the previus version ...
// pull double spaces itemDesc = stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( itemDesc , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) ;
And then he went to the version before that ...
// pull double spaces itemDesc = stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( itemDesc , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) ;
A pattern was starting to emerge .
He went back another version ....
// pull double spaces itemDesc = stringReplace ( stringReplace ( stringReplace ( itemDesc , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) ;
And another version ...
// pull double spaces itemDesc = stringReplace ( stringReplace ( itemDesc , " " , " " ) , " " , " " ) ;
Until finally , he reached the original ....
// pull double spaces itemDesc = stringReplace ( itemDesc , " " , " " ) ;
As tempted as Don was to simply add in another bunch of stringReplace calls just for fun , he replaced the whole thing with this .
// pull double spaces regexReplace ( itemDesc , " [ ] [ ] + " , " " ) ;

New guidelines to protect whisky from foreign imitation , including new rules on labelling and bottling , are coming into force in Scotland on Monday .
There will be a new requirement to only bottle Single Malts in Scotland , and tighter rules on the use of distillery names on bottle labels .
There will also be better protection of traditional regional names such as " Highland " and " Lowland " .
The Scotch Whisky Association ( SWA ) described it as " landmark legislation " .
The regulations have been drawn up by the UK government .
Additional protection , including the requirement to bottle Single Malt Scotch Whisky in Scotland , helps safeguard Scotch from unfair and deceptive practices
Gavin Hewitt
SWA Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy said : " It is vital that we protect our key industries .
We cannot allow others to trade off our good name and to pass off inferior whisky as being produced in Scotland .
" These regulations will help protect whisky customers across the globe .
" New labelling rules will also mean that customers will have a clearer understanding about precisely where and how their drink has been produced .
This will enhance the education of many whisky drinkers as well as their enjoyment . "
SWA chief executive , Gavin Hewitt said : " This is landmark legislation for Scotch Whisky delivering important benefits for consumers , distillers , and the economy .
" Additional protection , including the requirement to bottle Single Malt Scotch Whisky in Scotland , helps safeguard Scotch from unfair and deceptive practices ; the new labelling rules provide a unique opportunity to promote consumer understanding of Scotch worldwide .
" These regulations have the strong backing of the Scotch Whisky industry . "
Regulation details
Some of the details of the new legislation include : Five categories of Scotch Whisky are defined for the first time ; Single Malt Scotch Whisky , Single Grain Scotch Whisky , Blended Malt Scotch Whisky , Blended Grain Scotch Whisky , and Blended Scotch Whisky .
These compulsory category sales terms will be required to appear clearly and prominently on all labels .
A requirement to only bottle Single Malt Scotch Whisky in Scotland .
New rules to prevent the misleading labelling and marketing of Single Malt Scotch Whiskies .
A ban on the use of the term " Pure Malt " .
A ban on the use of a distillery name as a brand name on any Scotch Whisky which has not been wholly distilled in the named distillery .
Protection of five traditional whisky regions of production ; Highland , Lowland , Speyside , Islay , and Campbeltown .
A requirement that Scotch Whisky must be wholly matured in Scotland .
Clear rules on the use of age statements on packaging .

Already our troops have created a backlash with Kabul University students this week burning President Obama in effigy until police dispersed them with gunshots .
The heavier our military footprint , the more resentment  and perhaps the more legitimacy for the Taliban .
Schools are not a quick fix or silver bullet any more than troops are .
But we have abundant evidence that they can , over time , transform countries , and in the area near Afghanistan there ’s a nice natural experiment in the comparative power of educational versus military tools .
Since 9/11 , the United States has spent $ 15 billion in Pakistan , mostly on military support , and today Pakistan is more unstable than ever .
In contrast , Bangladesh , which until 1971 was a part of Pakistan , has focused on education in a way that Pakistan never did .
Bangladesh now has more girls in high school than boys .
( In contrast , only 3 percent of Pakistani women in the tribal areas are literate . )
Those educated Bangladeshi women joined the labor force , laying the foundation for a garment industry and working in civil society groups like BRAC and Grameen Bank .
That led to a virtuous spiral of development , jobs , lower birth rates , education and stability .
That ’s one reason Al Qaeda is holed up in Pakistan , not in Bangladesh , and it ’s a reminder that education can transform societies .
When I travel in Pakistan , I see evidence that one group  Islamic extremists  believes in the transformative power of education .
They pay for madrassas that provide free schooling and often free meals for students .
They then offer scholarships for the best pupils to study abroad in Wahhabi madrassas before returning to become leaders of their communities .
What I do n’t see on my trips is similar numbers of American - backed schools .
It breaks my heart that we do n’t invest in schools as much as medieval , misogynist extremists .
For roughly the same cost as stationing 40,000 troops in Afghanistan for one year , we could educate the great majority of the 75 million children worldwide who , according to Unicef , are not getting even a primary education .
We wo n’t turn them into graduate students , but we can help them achieve literacy .
Such a vast global education campaign would reduce poverty , cut birth rates , improve America ’s image in the world , promote stability and chip away at extremism .
Education is n’t a panacea , and no policy in Afghanistan is a sure bet .
But all in all , the evidence suggests that education can help foster a virtuous cycle that promotes stability and moderation .
So instead of sending 40,000 troops more to Afghanistan , how about opening 40,000 schools ?
Imagine if you could perform daily activities from a third person view watching everything you do every step of the way .
With the Avatar Machine created by Marc Owens , you can actually get a third person view of the world around you .
“ Avatar Machine is a system which replicates the aesthetics and visuals of third person gaming , allowing the user to view themselves as a virtual character in real space via a head - mounted interface , ” says Owens ' Vimeo page .
The machine is a VR suit constructed with a camera that hovers behind the user .
This camera gives the user a third person view of the world that can be seen through the suit ’s headset .
It also seems to have gotten an overhaul from the puffy suit iterations seen before .
Check out the video here .
Owens ' site says that the Avatar Machine “ potentially allows for a diminished sense of social responsibility and could lead the user to demonstrate behaviors normally reserved for the gaming environment . ”
If you had access to this suit , what would you do ( other than look ridiculous ) ?

" Shooter " describes the discourse that is to occur , specifically the shooting and ultimately killing of the other participants .
Thus , a " first - person shooter " is easily identifiable by its specific perceptual presentation of game events , and the presence of a gun or other weapon .
The gun is typically regarded as a phallic symbol of masculine agency , through which power is won and maintained .
In any first - person shooter , a power dynamic is reinforced between subject ( the player 's subjective sense of self ) and object ( the rest of the game world . )
The player is forced to accept militarism and conquest by violence , historically masculine behaviors , as the only course of action .
To play a first - person shooter is to enter into a context in which only the male perspective exists , regardless of the gender of the character or player .

There have been large rallies against the attacks in Australian cities
The number of Indian students studying in Australia is projected to fall by about 20 % in 2010 .
Australia 's Tourism Forecasting Committee ( TFC ) has said the students are choosing to stay away due to a series of attacks in mid-2009 .
Australian police blamed the attacks on opportunistic criminals , but some Indian students see them as racist .
The drop in the number of Indian students is expected to cost Australia almost $ 70 m ( £ 44 m ) .
More than 70,000 Indians studied in Australia in 2009 .
Australia 's higher education industry is its third biggest export earner after coal and iron ore .
Safety concerns
The TFC said that judging from visa applications there would be 4,000 fewer Indian arrivals next year , a drop of 21 % despite a predicted growth in international tourism numbers of 4.3 % in 2010 .
TFC chairman Bernard Salt said this was the first assessment of the impact of negative publicity over alleged racial violence and exploitation of Indian students this year .
" This is a segment that has grown strongly throughout this decade , but the downturn is expected in response to concerns that the Indian community have had about safety , " said Mr Salt .
The predicted slump was not as bad as some had expected immediately after the street protests in June against the violence in Sydney and Melbourne .
" We were predicting a drop of about 50 % , " Gautam Gupta , president of the Federation of Indian Students of Australia told state radio .
Australia 's higher education industry has grown in value to $ 15.4bn a year and students from the subcontinent account for 19 % of total international enrolments .
An interim report on Australia 's international education sector released this month found its global reputation and brand had been damaged by violent attacks and migration scams , " particularly in India " .
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd visited India this year , together with his education and foreign ministers , to deliver assurances that Indian students were safe .
The attacks earlier this year on Indian students attracted prominent media coverage in India .
An Indian minister cancelled a planned trip to Australia and one of the country 's leading film stars , Amitabh Bachchan , turned down an honorary degree from Queensland University of Technology , saying he could not accept it under the circumstances .

Bengals WR Chris Henry died Thursday morning after suffering injuries in an auto accident on Thursday in Charlotte .
Police said his death occurred at 6:36 a.m. ET .
Henry was 26 .
He was involved in a domestic dispute on Wednesday with his fiance , Loleini Tonga .
Henry jumped into the bed of a truck driven by Tonga and at one point fell out as the dispute continued .
Henry worked through several arrests and suspensions early in his career .
Bengals owner Mike Brown , who granted Henry a second chance when he re-signed him in August 2008 , said he was disappointed the personal growth Henry had shown had been stunted .
CHAD OCHOCINCO : Bengals WR emotionally asks why Henry had to die
" He had worked through troubles in his life and had finally seemingly reached the point where everything was going to blossom and he was going to have the future that we all wanted for him and he wanted for himself , " Brown said .
" And then this tragedy cut him down .
It 's painful for us .
We feel it in our hearts .
We will miss him . "
Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said Henry matured after the Bengals gave him a second chance and in '08 .
" It 's a very difficult thing with his loss , " Lewis said , " and a young life that wo n't ever get to reach his full potential . "
MORE MARVIN LEWIS : Coach said changed Henry was ' a different man '
Henry 's agent , Andy Simms , who had announced on Wednesday that the player was " battling for his life , " said he was devastated to learn of the death .
" For those who knew Chris , he was nothing like his public perception , " Simms said in a statement , via the AP .
" A loving and caring individual , he was thankful for what he had in life , and proud of what he had overcome . "
A five - year veteran , Henry played eight games this season before suffering a broken arm that ended his year on Nov. 8 .
Henry 's death is the second traumatic experience to hit the Bengals this season .
Vikki Zimmer , the wife of defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer , died in October , days before the Bengals won at Baltimore .

Starting from the end of November , Queen Mary 's Particle Physics Research Centre is the sole recipient of the T2 K experiment data .
The T2K Collaboration is a 500 - strong alliance of scientists in 12 countries , who have come together to investigate the ghostly neutrino .
Physicist Dr Francesca Di Lodovico said : " Trillions of neutrinos pass through our bodies every second , but you do n't notice ; they pass through space and the Earth with almost no effect .
This makes neutrinos very difficult to study and yet they are thought to play a fundamental role in the formation of the Universe and understanding where we came from . "
Neutrinos come from outer space , either shot out from the Sun , or left over from the Big Bang .
But despite their abundance , techniques to understand their nature have only been developed in the last few decades , giving surprising results .
" Theories predict there should be three types of neutrinos , " Dr Di Lodovico explained .
" Unexpectedly , early data seems to suggest that they can change type from one to another , an observation which has profound implications on our understanding of the Universe . "
By firing the most intense neutrino beam ever designed , underground from Tokai on the east coast of Japan to a detector on the country 's west coast , it is now possible to observe what happens to the particles as they travel through our planet .
Do they change type ?
And if so , why ?
Scientists hope that neutrinos could be the key to understanding how the Universe has evolved over time and teach us more about deep - space events like supernovas , active galaxies and gamma-ray bursts .
They could even explain one of the biggest mysteries of the universe ; why we have lots of ' matter ' , but only tiny amounts of ' anti- matter ' .
Dr Di Lodovico says : " T2 K will quickly advance our understanding of the strange properties of the enigmatic neutrino to unprecedented precision .
Within a year , we will be able explore neutrino properties beyond the reach of the current experiments and shed light on the unknown . "
MIAMI ( Reuters ) - A record number of endangered manatees died in Florida waters this year , according to the state ’s Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission .

In a preliminary report on Friday , the commission said its Fish and Wildlife Research Institute had documented 419 manatee deaths in state waters between January 1 and December 11 , the most for any year since record - keeping began in 1974 .
The previous worst year for the mammals was 2006 , when 417 deaths were documented in Florida .
A lower - than - average total of 337 deaths was reported in 2008 .
Manatee death counts can swing wildly from year to year and the wildlife commission has cautioned in the past not to read too much into a single year ’s statistics .
Along with an uptick in deadly encounters with boats , Florida ’s manatees faced a string of cold spells this year and a high mortality rate among infant manatees .
Cold - related deaths , at 55 , were more than twice last year ’s total .
The West Indian manatee , related to the African and Amazon species and to the dugong of Australia , grows to 10 feet and more than 1,000 pounds ( 450 kg ) .
Its wrinkled and whiskered face has won the hearts of generations .
Although they have no natural enemies , manatees are routinely crushed or drowned in canal locks , run over by speeding boats or hurt by fishing line and hooks .
They are vulnerable to cold water in winter and to deadly blooms of “ red tide ” algae .
The Florida population is believed to have increased slightly in recent decades , in part due to boat speed restrictions .
As a result , developers and boat industry interests have argued for easing restrictions to allow more construction of boat slips .
State scientists counted a record high number of 3,807 manatees in Florida waters last year , topping the previous high in 2001 by more than 500 .
LONDON , U.K. —
The party is over in Dubai .
It officially ended for the freewheeling emirate late Wednesday afternoon when Dubai World , the government - controlled investment conglomerate , announced a six - month " standstill " on debt repayments .
If Dubai World was hoping that by timing the announcement on the eve of a 10 - day religious and national holiday nobody would notice , it miscalculated .
Reaction in financial markets around the world was swift and devastating .
Here in London , the FTSE 100 ( partially owned by Dubai World ) plunged by 3 percent and British banks saw a total of $ 23 billion in value wiped from their books .
There were similar declines in Frankfurt , Paris and Milan .
Wall Street was saved by the Thanksgiving holiday , but the Dow dropped 230 points when the market opened Friday .
It recovered but by the time the market closed at 1 p.m. all the major U.S. indexes ended Friday 's holiday - shortened session more than 1 percent lower .
Asian markets also took a hit on Friday .
The so - called “ standstill ” declared by Dubai World is bit like telling the bank that you wo n't be paying the mortgage for the next six months .
Your bank would not react sympathetically to such news , but in the case of Dubai World , where the mortgage is $ 59 billion , the banks have little choice but to sit back , swallow hard and hope somebody comes to Dubai 's rescue .
For months , it was assumed that the somebody would be Dubai 's wealthier , financially prudent sister emirate , Abu Dhabi .
The oil - rich United Arab Emirates is a loose federation of seven emirates , and investors figured that Abu Dhabi would not allow Dubai 's potential default to tarnish the U.A.E.'s overall reputation as a safe haven for investment .
But thus far , Abu Dhabi has given no signal that it will come to the rescue .
Unlike Abu Dhabi and the other emirates , Dubai has little in the way of oil and gas resources .
Its explosive growth over the last decade or so was fueled by high - end real estate speculation and a bid to market itself as a regional transportation hub and home to corporate clients .
Dubai World , which essentially functions as the Dubai government 's investment arm , has a diverse portfolio that includes the famous Turnberry golf course in Scotland , Barneys clothing store , the QE2 cruise ship and a 20 percent stake in Cirque du Soleil .
The conglomerate is not the most transparent of operations , but its key holdings are Nakheel , its local property development subsidiary , and DP World , which runs the Jebel Ali container port in Dubai and several others around the world .
DP
World was about to take over several American ports in 2006 until security concerns raised by Congress scuttled the deal .
Nakheel is the creator of the emirate 's signature Palm Islands : manmade islands in the shape of palm trees that are home to exclusive villas , shopping malls and hotels .
But as anyone who has driven along the Sheikh Zayed Road over the last 12 months can plainly see , the property bubble has burst .
The 12 - lane highway that slices through Dubai is lined with scores of finished or nearly finished glass and steel office towers and apartment buildings — most of them empty , most of them with huge “ for rent ” signs flapping in the breeze .
“ Build it and they will come , ” was Dubai 's mantra .
And for the better part of a decade , they did come — from Britain , India and Russia .
But now they are going , casualties of a global recession .
The stunning reaction to the bad news from Dubai is an indication that global financial markets do not believe the economic crisis is over and that they see the potential crash of Dubai World as a possible harbinger of a double - dip recession .
On Thursday , the Dubai government tried to calm the panic with a statement issued by Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum , the chairman of Dubai's Supreme Fiscal Committee , who said the decision to defer debt payments for six months was " carefully planned " and executed with “ full knowledge ” of how the markets would react .
“ While the government understands the concerns of the market and the creditors , it had to intervene because of the need to take decisive action to address its particular debt burden , ” he said .
Local media downplayed the crisis .
In the U.A.E. , reporters have been warned that stories deemed harmful to the nation 's economic well - being can earn a jail sentence .
But in London and elsewhere , the story was front page news .
“ Dubai in deep water , ” was the banner headline of the Times of London .
“ Is Dubai going bust ? ” asked The Independent .
[ Editor 's note :
This story was updated to correct the spelling of Nakheel , the local property development subsidiary of Dubai World . ]
Most of us especially the homeowners would like to make their places safe from any problems and be very safe when it comes to the dangerous situations and to those times that you need others help because of the strong typhoon or there is an earthquake coming in your city .
Most of the Berkeley roofers would suggest that you need to install the best quality materials and make sure that you are going to pick the best one only when replacing some of the parts so that you do n’t need to worry about the construction materials and the fees for the workers .
Your house will tell you something when you installed the best roofing material like the shingles and the gutter so that you can achieve the best result in the coming years as it will stay for more than 35 years for the life span .
Others forgot about the details process so you need to make sure that you are going to learn the basic ways and steps whenever you are going to have the reroofing project and you can do this one by visiting the local department in your city .
Different places and areas would have different requirements so you need to know if your area is prone to an area or calamities as they will give you some instructions so that you can get the best result for the roof of your home .
Along with this is the permit and the other things that you need to prepare so that you can ensure that nothing unpleasant would be met there and this is your chance to get to know the different plans that you have in your mind .
There are different kinds of shingles that you can choose and this is a very good deal for some people as they would be able to get to know the kinds of shingles that they want to use here .
Of course , you have to know the number of shingles that you will be using here so that you will get the desired amount of money that you need to spend here and there could be a bigger chance that you can reduce the price if you are going to buy in bulk orders .
You have to prepare in advance the roof of the house so that it would be very nice and it would not cause any problems to you since that you are going to go up there .
It is nice as well if you are going to think in advance that you have to rent a container or trash truck that will collect all the garbage that you have in there and some people might not understand this thing but this will be a big help to all the people out there .
You need to clean and remove the dirt or the stain there so that it would be very simple for you to remove the roofing later .
You can ask for the professional people to help you so that you do n’t need to worry about this matter .
There is nothing so bad that it will not pass .
If there is one thing the world teaches it is that all things change .
If you can not think of what to do , if you believe that all hope has gone , if you are tired of trying , then pause .
Breathe deeply .
Do you have any money at all ?
If you do , spend it on a good meal , even if you are spending every dime .
Get a good meal , and sit in a warm place eating it , with friendly people serving it .
Eat and enjoy , and think about good things .
Think about your favorite color , your best friend when you were in grade school , how flannel feels when you rub it between your fingers .
Think about those gold coin chocolates that always made you feel rich even though the chocolate was waxy and tasted like tin .
When you were a kid , you had a knack for feeling rich when you had next to nothing .
There is nothing so painful as desperation .
Nothing so counterproductive .
Now that you are feeling good again , nothing has changed , except you .
You are different .
Now you can think .
Where will you sleep tonight ?
What will you do tomorrow ?
Do n't focus on what you can't do or have n't got .
You have a lot of resources , if only you will recognize them .
Try to identify your most pressing problems individually , and find a straight line to a solution .
You need a warm place out of the rain ?
How about a hotel lobby , or a hospital waiting room , or a laundromat , or a bus station , or a fast food restaurant ?
You need to clean up ?
That 's easy .
You need some food ?
You can fill your belly on less than a dollar 's worth of rice .
I 'm not going to teach you any techniques in this section .
That is n't my point .
My point is that to begin surviving , you need to change your head .
Abandon anger , desperation , depression , melancholy .
Embrace confidence , strength , abilities , resources .
Be positive , by all means .
Years ago , before I decided to be homeless and make it work , I was staying with relatives and my welcome had suddenly worn out .
I was so angry my head started to pound .
The anger was a mask for my desperation .
I had , perhaps , $ 300 , barely enough to stay in a seedy motel for a week .
I 've got to find a real room , I thought , but $ 300 wo n't move me in .
I went down to the liquor store , steaming , bought a newspaper , and started scanning the classified ads .
There was nothing , nothing , nothing , and my mood became darker , almost violent , though with no outlet , no target .
This was , after all , my problem , my fault .
At just this rather difficult moment a man in his fifties approached me , hand out , and rage flooded over me .
The man saw it , and withdrew his hand , stung .
He began to turn .
I called out , " Wait . "
I pulled out my money , peeled off a twenty , and handed it to him , and he , maybe even more frightened now , thanked me and left .
For me a spell was broken , and I began to laugh quietly at myself , at my rage , at the terrible seriousness I was approaching life with .
The worst thing about my situation was my attitude , and I paid twenty dollars to change it .
It was a bargain at twice the price .

Mercury exposure in the United States increases with age , then starts tapering off when people turn 50 , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in a study released today .
The CDC study is the first to measure mercury exposure in a wider U.S. population , following research that focused on young children and women in their childbearing years .
People are often exposed to mercury through contaminated seafood , and a recent U.S. EPA survey found that almost half of U.S. freshwater fish carry mercury in excess of federal safe levels for human consumption .
The CDC data are part of a project assessing chemicals in people 's bodies .
The agency has added 75 contaminants to its database , bringing the total to 212 chemicals .
The survey analyzed blood , serum and urine samples from 2,500 people as a part of the CDC's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey , which is released every two years .
The goal of the research is to determine which chemicals end up in people 's bodies and at what concentrations .
It is meant to help prioritize scientific work and for policymaking .
Scientists chose which chemicals to look for based on expected widespread exposure and known toxicity .
Among the report 's findings :
Perchlorate was detected for the first time in all participants .
Perchlorate is a naturally occurring salt that is also a component of rocket fuel and fireworks .
High levels of perchlorate are known to affect thyroid function , while the health effects of low - level exposure are being debated .
Bisphenol A , or BPA , was found in more than 90 percent of the participants ' urine .
BPA is an industrial chemical that mimics estrogen and has been shown to cause developmental problems and precancerous growth in animals .
Lead exposure has been decreasing since the 1970s , validating public health efforts to reduce childhood exposure , the report says .
Between 1999 and 2004 , 1.4 percent of young children had elevated blood lead levels , the smallest percentage of any of the prior survey periods .
But the health of high - risk children -- those living around lead - based paint or lead dust -- remains a concern .
Acrylamide -- formed when foods containing carbohydrates are cooked at high temperatures -- was detected for the first time and is common in the U.S. population .
Biomonitoring detects a chemical 's presence only and cannot evaluate whether its detection signals adverse effects or disease , the report cautions .
Many environmental public health advocates say the findings play a critical first step in prioritizing the thousands of chemicals currently in the market today , many of which have little safety data publicly available .
" Biomonitoring studies such as the ones conducted by the CDC provide direct evidence that people are being exposed to harmful chemicals without their knowledge , much less their consent , " said Davis Baltz , a senior associate with Commonweal , a nonprofit .
" This is critical information for decision - makers , who can then craft policy instruments that will reduce or prevent exposures and also have a way to track whether those instruments are working . "
Sen. Frank Lautenberg ( D - N.J. ) , said in a statement that CDC 's findings highlight the need to reform the Toxic Substances Control Act ( TSCA ) , the law governing all industrial chemicals on the marketplace .
" Far too little is known about the hundreds of chemicals that end up in our bodies , and EPA has far too little authority to deal with the chemicals that science has already proven dangerous , " Lautenberg said .
Lautenberg said he plans to introduce legislation to reform TSCA early next year that would require that EPA determine whether chemicals meet new safety standards based on scientific risk assessment and that chemical companies provide enough data to make that determination .
Lautenberg also wants EPA to prioritize taking action on chemicals that present the greatest health risk .

A TARDIS MADE OF CAKE ?
HELL YEAH .
I helped make this cake for my little cousin's Doctor Who themed birthday .
By the time this picture was taken , it had sagged a little , but it was so fun to make and tasted delicious .
It stood about a foot tall ( ish ) , and yeah , the light at the top was an actual light .
Most ( 98 % ) of the credit should go to my aunt , I just put it together while she was busy with the rest of the decoration / cooking .
Here 's a picture of me making it : [ link ]

Gary Elize was gloomily looking for one last body Wednesday in the flattened apartment where his brother and sister - in - law had died : that of their 5 - year - old child .
He said he spotted the boy ’s leg in the rubble and put on a pair of surgical gloves , preparing to extract it .
Then , the leg moved .
Elize told of how he and several friends dug furiously in the steamy heat and unearthed Monley Elize -- dirt - caked , dehydrated , emaciated and scuffed up , but otherwise unhurt .
Monley ’s first words were whispered .
“ I want some juice . ”
Trapped for nearly eight days -- seven days , 21 hours -- the boy was alive .
Gary Elize raced into the street with the boy in his arms to find a ride to the hospital .
The man who stopped was Neil Joyce , 54 , a San Diego doctor with the Los Angeles - based relief agency International Medical Corps .
Joyce put Monley and his uncle into the car and drove to the IMC clinic in the sprawling General Hospital , near the ruins of the presidential palace .
When Monley arrived , nurses and doctors started an IV .
“ He could barely talk , he was so weak , ” said Gabriella McAdoo , 35 , an IMC emergency room nurse who works at Stanford University Medical Center .
“ Then he started perking up .
It ’s absolutely just a miracle .
No fractures and hardly any scrapes . ”
Speaking from his bed at the clinic an hour later , Monley said he felt “ fine , ” and drained a bottle of water in a few seconds .
“ That ’s his third one since he got here , ” McAdoo said .
His uncle said Monley , his father and mother lived on the ground floor of a three - story apartment building in east Port - au - Prince .
Both of Monley ’s parents died in the temblor , a fact that the boy seemed a bit too dazed to fully absorb .
Elize , who also lost his home , had pulled the bodies of Monley ’s mother and father out a week ago and buried them .
He had resigned himself to the sad task of picking through the rubble to find his nephew ’s body , and had been working on the rock pile for several days , feeling no sense of urgency because he was convinced that the boy was dead .
Monley said the day of the quake had been his father ’s birthday , and his father was relaxing in the house as they prepared to celebrate .
When the apartment began to shake , Monley said , “ I tried to run but a door fell and blocked me , and my shirt got ripped . ”
He said he knelt in a corner of the apartment , with his head cocked to the side , as the building came down .
And that ’s how they found him .
When Joyce arrived on the scene , he saw a crowd of 50 people gathered around a man who had tears in his eyes and was holding a small child covered with dust .
“ I thought , oh no , a dead child .
But as I got closer , I could tell the child was breathing . ”
The crowd was trying to help Elize and his nephew into a crowded bus , so Joyce stopped and offered to take them to the hospital .
They climbed into the car and Joyce noticed that “ the child ’s head was floppy and he was whimpering .
His skin was deeply wrinkled and showed signs of severe dehydration . ”
“ The whole thing really was a miracle , ” Joyce said .
“ Here was a devastated place with tremendous needs , and when you see something like this happen , and a crowd that was so clearly excited and happy . . . well , it was really inspirational . ”
Gary Elize , 24 , is Monley ’s only surviving relative , and he is concerned that he wo n’t be able to properly care for the boy .
Elize does n’t have a job , and he ’s been living in a tent camp near his old home .
“ I do n’t have anything , and I do n’t see how I can do this , ” Elize said .
“ But I know I must . ”
Monley ’s chart at the clinic read : “ Found under rubble after 8 days . ”
And it noted that he had complained of “ belly button pain . ”
“ He was so thin when he came in that his belly was almost touching his back , ” McAdoo said .
He was placed in a bed and , smiling weakly , gave one doctor a fist - bump .
After three hours in the clinic , Monley had taken a few bites of rice and appeared to regain a little strength .
“ You ’re going to be sore , ” McAdoo told him .
“ But you ’re just fine . ”
Dr. Colleen Buono , from San Diego , questioned him , making sure he knew his name and could identify his uncle .
She said he was ready to leave , making room for others .
The IMC staff dressed Monley in an X - Men T - shirt and Spider - Man shorts .
They helped him to his feet and , though wobbly , he clearly was remarkably unscathed .
The doctors decided he could be discharged , but they sent him to the hospital pediatric ward overnight , as a precaution .
As the nurses and doctors who had treated him gathered to watch , Monley was carried in his uncle ’s arms down the hill to the pediatric ward .
Sometime today , Monley will return to the streets where miracles are rare .

A priest named in a damning report on child abuse in the Dublin Archdiocese has been jailed for three years for sexually abusing an altar boy .
Fr Thomas Naughton , 78 , abused the boy between 1982 and 1984 in the parish of Valleymount in County Wicklow .
The judge said the abuse as " shocking and horrific " .
He said Naughton abused his position of trust and said the abuse was " premeditated " .
The last 12 months of his sentence were suspended .
Naughton 's abuse featured heavily in last month 's report which found there was a cover - up by the Catholic hierarchy in the Dublin Archdiocese between 1975 and 2004 .
Bishop of Limerick Dr Donal Murray has come under pressure to resign for his " inexcusable " failure to investigate an allegation of abuse against Naughton .
The report found he did not deal properly with the suspicions and concerns that were expressed to him about Naughton while he was an auxiliary bishop of Dublin .
When , a short time later , factual evidence of Naughton 's abusing emerged in another parish , it found Bishop Murray 's failure to reinvestigate the earlier suspicions was " inexcusable " .
In May 1998 , Naughton admitted six counts of indecent assault on three boys .
He was jailed for three years , reduced on appeal to two and a half years .

Members of the Zulu royal family are meeting with local authorities in South Africa 's KwaZulu - Natal Province to discuss making male circumcision services available at public hospitals in a bid to reduce HIV infections .
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini announced on 4 December that he intended reviving the practice of circumcision among young Zulu men in response to recent studies showing that circumcsied men are 60 percent less likely to become infected with HIV through sex than uncircumcised men .
More than a million of the estimated 5.5 million HIV - positive South Africans live in KwaZulu - Natal , the province with the highest HIV prevalence .
" The King is concerned about the HIV / AIDS toll on his nation .
The delegations are discussing how circumcision could be adopted as government policy before it is introduced in government hospitals , " said Ndabezinhle Sibiya , spokesman for the KwaZulu - Natal Premier , Dr Zweli Mkhize .
The practice has been out of favour among Zulus since the 19th century , when King Shaka banned it because he believed it robbed his army of warrior - age men for months at a time , but South Africa 's Xhosa and Sotho peoples undergo traditional circumcisions as a rite of passage into manhood .
Circumcision is already being promoted as a weapon in the fight against HIV / AIDS in other southern African countries .
In Swaziland , for example , where the custom of removing the foreskin also died out in the 1900s , young men are lining up at clinics and hospitals for the cut .
Zwelithini said he would like to see male circumcision services rolled out in the province before the end of 2010 , but the government is concerned about the capacity of public hospitals , already under severe strain due to HIV / AIDS and understaffing , to conduct the procedure on a large scale .
" We ... would like to see men being circumcised as soon as possible , but we understand that we have to take the government on board , so that it can release resources for this , " said Prince Mboniswa Zulu , a spokesman for the Zulu royal household .
Zulu said the King would prefer the procedure to be conducted at health facilities by trained doctors to avoid the regular fatalities resulting from botched circumcisions conducted at illegal initiation schools , mostly in rural Eastern Cape Province .
But a general practitioner at a government hospital in Durban also expressed doubts about the capacity of local hospitals .
" There is no doubt that this is a timely intervention to fight the scourge of AIDS , but I do n't think it will work .
Already doctors are overworked dealing with normal diseases . "
There is no doubt that this is a timely intervention ... but I do n't think it will work .
Already doctors are overworked .
Medical and cultural experts widely commended Zwelithini 's decision .
" [ It ] is a simple procedure , " said Prof Nceba Gqaleni , deputy dean of the Nelson Mandela School of Medicine at the University of KwaZulu - Natal .
" A patient can walk in for an appointment and a urologist would conduct the circumcision , and the patient would walk out with medications within a short period of time . " Gqaleni works closely with traditional healers on issues relating to HIV / AIDS , who also welcomed King Goodwill 's decision .
" They feel that the King is the custodian of Zulu culture , and ... has the right to make interventions when circumstances require it , " he said .
The Zulu monarch has also supported the controversial comeback of virginity testing for young Zulu girls as a strategy for preventing and raising awareness about HIV .
Nhlanhla Mntaka , a political analyst and an expert on Zulu cultural issues , said he believed young men would heed the King 's call .
" I foresee this as the beginning of a massive awareness programme .
When virginity testing was reintroduced , people said girls would boycott them , but today thousands proudly participate in them .
It would be the same thing with young men . " Siyabonga Memela , 23 , an architect , said : " My approach is simple : if it is going to help fight AIDS , why not do it ?
If I am given a chance to cut my foreskin for free , I would do it .
" But Francis Myende , 29 , a restaurant employee , said he was against reintroducing the practice .
" Our fathers did not use circumcision , and I am not about to change that , " he told IRIN / PlusNews .
" Starting to circumcise now would be adopting other people 's cultures .
I think there are other ways of preventing HIV .

Are you a fearless Motorola Droid owner ?
Want a few extra homescreens ?
Extra fast and fluid navigation / actions ?
Some UI improvements ?
Google News and Weather ?
Then perhaps you ’ll want to install Android 2.1 on your Motorola Droid as it will accomplish all of the above ( at the risk of ruining your device of course ) :
He emphasizes how fast 2.1 is several times which is very encouraging .
When the Droid first launched with 2.0 it was a bit sluggish but 2.0.1 took care of a lot of those issues and it sounds like 2.1 takes that to the next level .
And by the way , I ca n’t believe it took so long to get some more screen real estate on stock Android – FINALLY !

Pandemic Studios recently closed their doors , with their last game being released with little fanfare in early December .
The Saboteur puts you in the role of an Irish member of the French resistance in Nazi occupied Paris and while the game is n’t horrible or unplayable , it fails to rise above other recent releases in terms of overall quality .
The first two things you see when beginning a new game are a Parisian stripper ’s perfectly rendered breasts as she does a seductive dance to a club of Nazi officers .
As Sean Devlin , you sit at the bar drowning your sorrows when a Frenchman approaches you about performing some sabotage for the Resistance .
What ensues is an adventure of modest length firmly rooted in Hollywood depictions of the war .
Characters are little more than cultural archetypes ( the erudite and deep - thinking Frenchman , the insane and sadistic German scientist , the boozehound and initially uncaring Irishman ) and the plot is adequate but the way it is all presented makes it seem more original than it truly is .
Gameplay , sadly , fails to impress .
You ’re given the entirety of Paris and the surrounding area plus a German bordertown to roam around in and for the most part , Sean navigates over all obstacles without much of a problem .
However , the climbing mechanics are n’t as finely hewn as the ones seen in Assassins Creed II or InFamous , just as the driving mechanics are n’t as well implemented as in Grand Theft Auto IV .
Shooting is handled adequately , especially in light of the broken stealth gameplay .
Although ‘ broken ’ might be a bit of a strong word ; the stealth is functional to a degree , but compared to Batman : Arkham Asylum , Metal Gear Solid 4 , or even Assassin ’s Creed II , it falls short .
Fortunately , the game compensates by having some of the dumbest Nazi ’s you ’ll ever encounter .
While a General and some heavy soldiers can prove to be somewhat of a challenge if you ’re spotted , the average footsoldier can be lured away from his comrades simply by drawing your pistol and hiding it before his ‘ Suspicion Meter ’ fills up .
Stealthily dispatching an enemy without drawing blood will allow you to use his clothes as a disguise and at this point , you can attack a base without ever being discovered .
But killing Nazis is only half of the gameplay ; you ’ll spend most of your time tracking down Nazi sniper nests or fuel depots and blowing them to kingdom come .
Everything you destroy earns you ‘ Contraband , ’ which can be used to purchase weapons , ammunition , and vehicles on the black market .
And should you be low on funds , an armed Nazi soldier is never far off and any car can be stolen .
Graphically , the game distinguishes itself by having Nazi occupied areas displayed in black & white with only yellow lights and Nazi reds showing up .
As you whittle away at the Nazi influence , color slowly bleeds back into the city of Paris and the contrast between the bright lights of a freed street and the oppressive nature of one under Nazi control is definitely one of the highlights of the game .
The radio and bars / clubs play period music and your home base , a strip club called ‘ The Belle , ’ is populated by dozens of topless and similarly clad women of ill repute .
Although you ’ll need to purchase and redeem the ‘ Midnight Show ’ DLC for if you want the strippers to bare all–otherwise they ’ll be forever wearing lingerie .
Those who buy the game before the end of the year will be given a free ticket to the ‘ Midnight Show . ’
In the end , The Saboteur has little to stand on .
The atmosphere of oppression and the feeling of resistance is certainly unique and it ’s always fun to kill Nazis , but gameplay - wise , there ’s a better alternative for every aspect .
Fans of film noir , World War II films , or 1940 ’s French culture in general might want to rent it , but at the current price of $ 59.99 , a purchase would be ill - advised considering what came out in November and what ’s coming out in January .
Noranside prison , near Forfar , which currently has about 100 prisoners , will be mothballed for a week .
Any inmates not eligible for release will be moved to nearby Castle Huntly .
A Scottish Prison Service spokesman said today : “ That ’s the plan at the moment .
We did that last year .
The numbers in the open estate are quite low , but if you have prisoners in the open estate and they ’ve been risk assessed , it makes sense that gets tested .
“ That ’s part of the parole process .
If the prisoners misbehave or breach their conditions they ’re back in closed conditions . ”
Noranside and Castle Huntly have a combined capacity of about 500 .
The larger Castle Huntly , near Dundee , would be able to accommodate the reduced open population over the festive period on its own .
Serious offenders , including killers , could be among those released .
The SPS spokesman said that no final decision had been taken on the numbers to be allowed home on leave at Christmas .
But Tory community safety spokesman John Lamont branded the plans quite incredible .
He said : “ Many victims of these criminals , and families of those killed , are still bearing emotional or physical scars and they will have to watch in horror as they are sent home to enjoy a week with their families .
“ Where is the justice in that ?
What will Alex Salmond say to anyone who becomes a victim if any of these inmates commits a crime whilst let loose for Christmas ?
“ It is all part of the SNP ’s agenda to empty our prisons , whatever the cost . ”
The open estate has been at the centre of political rows in recent years .
Sex offender Robert Foye absconded from Castle Huntly in 2007 after being let out to attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting and raped a 16 - year - old girl before being recaptured .
This led to a tightening of controls over who is sent to open jails .
But this year murderer John Brown and armed robber Brian Martin - dubbed The Hawk - both absconded in quick succession from Castle Huntly .
Washington ( CNN ) -- A Washington - based imam told CNN on Monday that alleged Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan approached him for help finding a wife .
Imam Yahya Hendi , the Muslim chaplain at Georgetown University , said Hasan came to him at least two years ago as the cleric conducted services at Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland .
" He said he wanted someone to help him serve , deploy and be understandable and understanding of his own military career , " Hendi said .
" He saw himself as someone ... continuing his service with the U.S. military till the end of his career . "
The imam said he spoke with Hasan on at least two occasions about his search for a spouse .
" It 's not easy to find , in general , someone who will be willing to travel with you and deploy with you every two years , " Hendi said .
" But he did want a wife who would stand by him , is [ a ] loyal American , who will help him do his work and his service for the U.S. military . "
The imam's comments about Hasan 's search for someone who would remain with him throughout his military career were at odds with some statements by Hasan 's family .
Relatives have said Hasan tried unsuccessfully to leave the military early -- requests that may have come after Hasan contacted Hendi .
The cleric said he did try to help Hasan in his search , thinking of women he knew to whom he could introduce the Army psychiatrist , but he never heard from Hasan again .
Authorities say Hasan opened fire at a military processing center at Fort Hood Army Post on November 5 , killing 13 people .
Hasan , who was seriously wounded in the incident , was charged with 13 counts of premeditated murder -- charges that make him eligible for the death penalty .
Two other imams have told CNN similar stories about Hasan 's search for a wife , and about his conservatism and apparent devotion to Islam -- but those accounts seem to be inconsistent with behavior Hasan exhibited in the last few months .
The manager of a strip club near Fort Hood has told reporters that Hasan visited the club a handful of times , staying for several hours each time .
" You know , for me , everything that he did is against the teachings of Islam .
Killing fellow soldiers , fellow citizen men and women , the shooting , the bloodshed , speaks of someone who did not understand his faith very well .
Islam is against going to strip clubs , but it's also against killing fellow citizens , " Hendi told CNN .
When taken as a whole , Hasan 's actions in the weeks before the attack at Fort Hood -- the giving away of his possessions , his sometimes conservative dress in white Muslim clothing , and his previous defense of suicide bombings during presentations to classmates -- seem to be those of someone who was preparing for his own death , said CNN terrorism analyst Peter Bergen .
" I think what he was doing was sort of a jihadist ' death - by - cop , ' " said Bergen , who based his observations on news reports about Hasan .
" Here 's a guy who obviously had personal problems .
He 's a loner , he avoids women basically , has few friends , and then grafted onto that , he finds sort of a jihadist ideology as a way of making sense of everything , and he decides to martyr himself . "
Bergen and other experts say Hasan could be someone who engaged in what they call " self - radicalization " : the idea that militant religion might provide an answer to psychological problems that someone already has .
Hasan remained hospitalized in Texas , paralyzed from the waist down , his lawyer said .
He was shot by a civilian police officer , who was also wounded in the attack .
Everett , Washington ( CNN ) --
After more than two years of delays , Boeing 's 787 Dreamliner made its maiden flight Tuesday in a three - hour trip that the maker described as a success .
" Today is truly a proud and historic day for the global team who has worked tirelessly to design and build the 787 Dreamliner -- the first all - new jet airplane of the 21st century , " said Scott Fancher , vice president and general manager of the 787 program , in a news release .
" We look forward to the upcoming flight test program and soon bringing groundbreaking levels of efficiency , technology and passenger comfort to airlines and the flying public . "
More than 12,000 employees and guests watched as the plane took off at 10:27 a.m. from Paine Field in Everett , Washington .
It landed more than three hours later and about 40 miles away at Seattle , Washington 's Boeing Field after having flown at a speed of 207 mph at 15,000 feet -- typical for a maiden flight , the company said .
During their time aloft , the chief pilot and captain tested some of the airplane 's systems and structures while flight data were transmitted electronically to engineers at Boeing Field .
" The flight marks the beginning of a flight test program that will see six airplanes flying nearly around the clock and around the globe , with the airplane 's first delivery scheduled for fourth quarter 2010 , " Boeing 's news release said .
Boeing promises passengers " a better flying experience " that includes bigger windows , more luggage space and better lighting .
It promises airline operators greater efficiency by burning 20 percent less fuel than current models of comparable size and by providing as much as 45 percent more space for cargo .
So far , 55 customers have ordered 840 of the planes .
The official price of one is $ 150 million .
" We think this is going to be a very efficient airplane , " Jim Albaugh , Boeing executive vice president and CEO , told CNN .
" It 's going to change the way people travel . "
Despite the delays , Boeing 's first new commercial airliner in more than a decade will still be relevant , Albaugh said Monday .
" It 's more environmentally friendly , it 's more efficient , uses less fuel , it 's going to cost the operator less to fly , it 's going to allow the passengers to pay less and feel better when they land , " he said .
Boeing 's fuel claims are linked to its design .
It is the first major airliner to be made mostly of composite materials and , as a result , is lighter .
Depending on the configuration , the plane can seat 200 to 300 passengers and can travel more than 2,500 nautical miles .
But production delays and technical problems have stolen some of the Dreamliner 's luster .
Many of the snags in the supply line have been blamed on the army of partners Boeing brought in to help with the construction .
" They did too much outsourcing , too soon , with too little oversight , " said Scott Hamilton of the aviation consulting firm Leeham Co .
" The customers have been mightily [ upset ] over the creeping delays . "
Albaugh acknowledged that , " in hindsight , " the level of outsourcing may not have been the best strategy .
" There a few things we might have kept inside , yes , " he said .
With 10 months of flight tests ahead , the 787s wo n't start flying commercially until at least 2011 , the company said .
" There 's a lot of work to do , " Albaugh said .
" The several states composing the United States of America are not united on the principle of unlimited submission to their general government ; but by a compact under the style and title of a Constitution for the United States , and of amendments thereto , they constituted a general government for special purposes [ and ] delegated to that government certain definite powers and whensoever the general government assumes undelegated powers , its acts are unauthoritative , void , and of no force .
To this compact each state acceded as a state , and is an integral party , its co-states forming , as to itself , the other party .
The government created by this compact was not made the exclusive or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated to itself , since that would have made its discretion , and not the Constitution the measure of its powers . "

Mankind United by Arthur Bell [ 1936 ]
20th century California was a prolific hotbed of new religions .
One of the lesser - known of these was the ' Mankind United ' cult .
The primary reason this group is of interest is because of a sociological study by a scholar from Harvard , California Cult , The Story of ' Mankind United ' by H.T. Dohrman , ( Beacon Press , Boston , 1958 ) , which was one of the first such studies to examine a new religion .
Founded by Arthur Bell in the depths of the Great Depression , Mankind United claimed that a huge malevolent conspiracy ran the world , ( the " Hidden Rulers " and " Money Changers " ) responsible for war , poverty and injustice .
Opposing them were the " Sponsors " , founded in 1875 .
The Sponsors were shortly going to announce their presence , and put in place a world - wide utopia , based on universal employment , a financial system of credits , and an artificial language .
The work day would be four hours a day , four days a week .
However , in order to do so , they had to get massive support for their plan , promoted by the ' Pacific Coast Division of North America , International Registration Bureau . '
When 200 million people accepted the Mankind United plan , the Sponsors would make their move , and within 30 days utopia would ensue .
Of course , there were no Sponsors , no International Bureau : the group was founded by Arthur Bell , never got much further than the Oregon border and never numbered more than a few thousand adherents , if that .
The only true beneficiary of the group was Bell , who had several luxurious apartments and mansions , including a swinging pad in Hollywood on the Sunset Strip with an indoor swimming pool , a pipe organ and a secret cocktail bar ( alcohol was forbidden to the rank and file ) [ Dohrman , pp. 89-90 ] .
Bell was seen in the swankest nightclubs and was a good tipper .
He received $ 50,000 a year in tax - free income , which adjusted for inflation would be the equivalent of nearly a million today .
His devotees , on the other hand , worked in various cult businesses full time , including hotels , ranches and shops .
They were paid less than $ 40 a month , and worked up to 16 hours a day , seven days a week , year round [ Dorhman p. 59 ] -- quite a bit more than four hours a day , four days a week as promised in this book .
The group came under surveillance during World War II .
They incorporated as a church ( ' The Church of the Golden Rule ' ) to obtain tax exemption .
Bell made bizarre claims , including that he could be in several different places at once , and that the Sponsors had advanced technology which would allow the dead to be resurrected on a distant planet [ Dohrman p. 72 ] .
In 1951 Bell abdicated and the cult withered away completely .
Unlike other groups of that time such as ' I AM ' there were no successors .

MUMBAI : The Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) may have sold US Treasuries to fund its gold purchase from the International Monetary Fund .
Last week , RBI purchased 200 tonnes of IMF gold for $ 6.7 billion , increasing the share of gold in its reserves by 250 basis points .��
� This purchase suggests that the Indian monetary authorities are seeking to change the composition of their foreign reserve holdings , most likely diversifying away from US Treasury securities , ��� said Nikhilesh Bhattacharya , an economist with the research arm of ratings firm Moody���s in a report .
He added that the move was prudent as India needed liquid assets as a buffer against sudden , destabilising capital outflows .
The central bank has , however , refrained from disclosing the details of the transaction in its weekly statistical supplement released on Friday .
According to the RBI release , total foreign exchange reserves including gold and SDR ( special drawing rights �� �the reserve currency with IMF ) dipped $ 1.129 billion to $ 284.4 billion during the week ended October 30 .
While foreign currency assets dipped $ 1.580 billion , the value of SDR dipped $ 25 million .
The value of gold in reserves rose $ 484 million to $ 10.8 billion .
Going by the current composition of reserves comprising various foreign currency assets , SDR , gold and reserves with the IMF , gold which is valued at the month - end bullion prices at the London bullion exchange has for long hovered around $ 10 billion and roughly accounts for 4 % of the total reserves .
Had last week���s purchase been reflected in the latest reserves figures , the value of gold would have gone up by at least 50 % .
One would also know how the central bank has funded this purchase .
According to an RBI official , the purchase was out of the foreign currency assets and not SDR .
Using CPUID for SIMD Detection
CPUID cpuid is an instruction added to Intel Pentiums ( and some later 80486's ) that enables programmers to determine what kind of features the current CPU supports , who made it , various extensions and abilities , and cache information .
This article will show you how to get information using cpuid , and how to interpret that information to detect support for MMX and its extensions , 3DNow !
and its extensions , SSE and its extensions , and some other useful features .
Using CPUID
There are many ways to use cpuid , depending on where you are working .
There is inline assembly for GCC and MSVC ( both different ) , as well as using it in plain assembly files ( for NASM et.al . )
cpuid uses the value in eax , and returns data into eax , ebx , ecx , and edx .
The eax input is known as the " Function " input .
It can have values from 0x00000000 to 0x00000001 , and 0x80000000 to 0x80000008 .
To use cpuid in GCC , it is normally easiest to just define a macro , like this :
# define cpuid ( func , ax , bx , cx , dx ) \ __asm__ __volatile__ ( " cpuid " : \ " =a " ( ax ) , " =b " ( bx ) , " =c " ( cx ) , " =d " ( dx ) : " a " ( func ) ) ;
In the above , you simply put whatever function number you want in for func , and put in 4 variables that will get the output values of eax , ebx , ecx , and edx , respectively .
int a , b , c , d ; ... cpuid ( 0 , a , b , c , d ) ; ...
In NASM , you simply use the instruction cpuid , and handle the outputs as desired .
In MSVC , it 's a bit longer , but still not too crazy .
( Please keep in mind that I do n't use MSVC much at all anymore , so this is n't tested ) .
# define cpuid ( func , a , b , c , d ) \ asm {\ mov eax , func\ cpuid\ mov a , eax\ mov b , ebx\ mov c , ecx\ mov d , edx\ }
And then you can call it with the same above snippet .

And then you can call it with the same above snippet .
CPUID — Functions
As mentioned above , cpuid has many functions , depending on the microprocessor it is on .
We 'll start from the beginning .
Function 0x00000000 :
Function 0 is used to get the Vendor String from the CPU .
It also tells us the maximum function supported by cpuid .
Every cpuid - supporting CPU will allow at least this function .
I 'll describe as many functions as I find information about , but please keep in mind that not all CPUs will handle all function values .
When called , eax gets the maximum function call value .
ebx gets the first 4 bytes of the Vendor String .
edx gets the second 4 bytes of the Vendor String .
ecx gets the last 4 bytes of the Vendor String .
When all the Vendor String bytes are lined up , they 'll spell a clever phrase depending on who manufactured it .
AMD uses " AuthenticAMD " , and
There were other players back in the day , but they seem to have gone out of business or left the CPU market .
They were UMC ( violated Intel patents , so they were never sold Stateside .
Seemed to only produce some 486's ) , and Rise ( IP sold to SiS in 1999 ) .
Function 0x0000001 :
Function 0x1 returns the Processor Family , Model , and Stepping information in eax .
edx gets the Standard Feature Flags .
bits ( eax ) field 0 - 3 Stepping number 4 - 7 Model number 8 - 11 Family number 12 - 13 Processor Type 16 - 19 Extended Model Number 20 - 27 Extended Family Number
What we 're really interested in is what 's in edx , the Standard Feature Flags .
This register holds a bitmask of all the features needed to determine which SIMD extensions our CPU supports .
If we 're trying to detect ecx .
bit ( edx ) feature 18 PN 19 CLFlush 23 MMX 25 SSE 26 SSE2 28 HTT
bit ( ecx ) feature 0 SSE3
Please note that these features are very abridged .
There are many other features in the other bits of this register .
Function 0x00000002 :
Function 0x2 tells us some information about the processor 's cache and TLB configuration .
Function 0x00000003 :
Function 0x3 gets us the bottom 64 bits of the processor 's 96 it serial number in edx : ecx ( if PN is enabled .
This was only used on Pentium III processors .
The top 32 bits are the Processor Signature , which is the value of eax after executing cpuid with eax =1 ( Function 1 ) .
Function 0x00000004 :
Function 0x4 returns some more detailed information about the cache as well as information regarding how many cores the processor has .
It looks like Function 0x4 can be used multiplt times to get more information about the various caches the CPU is aware of ( ? ) .
Function 0x00000005 :
Function 0x5 is used for the monitor and mwait
Function 0x00000006 :
Function 0x6 provides us with some information on Power Management and Temperature Control .
Again , these are perating System features , and we wo n't bother with them much here .
While Intel was off making cpuid early on , they did n't mention how they planned to use the bits .
So when other vendors started making extensions of their own , they needed a way to use cpuid to indicate their features without stepping on any toes .
To perform this , they use the second function range ( 0x80000000 + ) .
These functions act just like their lower - valued counterparts .
Function 0x80000000 :
Function 0x80000000 is just like Function 0 , except it returns the highest Extended function supported .
This is probably something like 0x80000008 ( at least , for Athlons ) .
The other registers are kept the same ( the Vendor String ) .
Function 0x80000001 :
Function 0x80000001 returns values into the same registers as Function 1 , but some of the meanings have changed .
eax gets the Extended Stepping / Mode / Family Numbers .
edx gets the Extended Feature Flags .
bit ( edx ) feature 22 AMD MMX Extensions 30 3DNow!2 31 3DNow !
Please Note that this is abridged .
There are many other features in the other bits of this register .
SSE3 :
With later revisions of Intel 's Pentium 4 line , they extended SSE2 a bit further .
AMD Athlon64's are supposed to support these instructions as well .
These new instructions are known as SSE3 or Prescott New Instructions ( PNI ) .
Please note that SSE extends the way the cpu operates , so not only does the CPU have to support it , but the OS also needs to support it .
The way to detect this varies from system to system .
Windows98 and up support SSE
Linux 2.4 supports SSE ( patches for 2.2 , if it 's not native by now )
Various BSD flavors have support for SSE as well .
With the above information in hand , detecting available SIMD extensions should be simple .

CPUID — Detecting Cache Line Sizes Finding a processor 's Cache Line Size is helpful if you want to aggressively flush and prefetch data into the cache using instructions like prefetch and clflush .

STOCKHOLM Nov. 13 , 2009  --
The founder of Ikea , the international Swedish home furnishing chain , is one of the richest men in the world .
Yet Ingvar Kamprad is widely considered to be something of an average guy who lives a modest life .
He 's just like his furniture ; simple , honest and a little wooden .
Anecdotes that support that image abound .
The Swede from Smaland reportedly still has a 30 - year - old " Klippan " sofa in his living room , along with another early classic developed by the furniture giant , the " Billy " bookshelf .
These sorts of stories not only illustrate Kamprad 's modesty , they also testify to the long - lasting quality of his modestly - priced furniture .
The man who wants to turn this pleasant image on its head is Johan Stenebo .
Stenebo , who comes from Stockholm , started working at Ikea more than 20 years ago as a trainee in the Kaltenkirchen warehouse just north of the German city of Hamburg .
His career trajectory took him right to Ikea 's highest management level .
He was managing director of Ikea 's subsidiary GreenTech and he even worked as Kamprad 's personal assistant .
Stenebo left the company nine months ago after disputes with the management .
Now he has written a tell - all book , " Sanningen om Ikea " ( " The Truth About Ikea " ) , that has attracted much attention in Sweden .
It is the first time in the more than 60 - year history of Ikea that negative comments have been made by a senior staff member in public .
It 's clear that the book is some sort of payback : a mountain of dirty laundry divided into 14 chapters .
Many Swedes are now wondering why he wrote the book .
What on earth could 83 - year - old Ingvar Kamprad have done that would make a senior staffer like Stenebo swap sides after so many years on the Ikea owner 's team ?
Stenebo claims that it was a moral issue for him .
" I did n't want to go along with it any more and I also could not stay silent , " he told SPIEGEL ONLINE .
In a dedication to his mother Christina at the beginning of the book , Stenebo thanks her for teaching him about the " power of a clean conscience . "
The book claims that common preconceptions about Ikea and Kamprad are false .
In fact , the author asserts , the entire firm is a tightly woven web of well - hidden , calculated lies .
Take the anecdote about the old sofa , for example .
These sorts of stories were simply made up by Kamprad and then spread by a willing media , Stenebo writes .
Driving Down Prices
" The company was easier to run when Kamprad played the role of an ascetic , slightly dim geriatric , " Stenebo says .
" Apart from that , the petit bourgeois façade helped to push down prices with suppliers . "
At which point the reader might be tempted to ask if the company would really push for lower prices just to -- in Stenebo 's words -- " fatten up " one of the richest men in the world and his sons .
The sons are Mathias and Peter , who were promoted to top management five years ago .
The elder son , Peter , in particular has been positioned since then as Ikea 's heir apparent .
Stenebo , however , calls him an " incompetent racist . "
And anyone that criticized Peter for his chauvinistic attitude was silenced by the patriarch Ingvar , he says .
These are harsh -- and somehow very un -Swedish -- words .
Could the book be a personal revenge of some sort ?
Stenebo strongly refutes this .
He says he is the one who has to worry about revenge -- Kamprad's .
According to Stenebo , Ikea is no normal multi-national business .
The company , with its 135,000 employees across 44 countries , is run by the family and the family alone .
And the all - powerful Kamprad runs the business like a sect , he claims .
" There was an unwritten law for Ikea 's upper management -- loyalty to Ingvar until death , " Stenebo notes .
Is Ikea Really Different From Any Other Big Company ?
This is one of the reasons criticism directed at Kamprad and at Ikea has rarely surfaced , the author claims .
Stenebo calls Ikea " one of the most secretive companies in the world . "
Much to the chagrin of the Swedish press , Kamprad hardly ever gives interviews .
And when he does , it is only to selected journalists who , according to Stenebo , are duty bound to angle their stories the way that Kamprad demands .
According to Stenebo , this is how the public image of the furniture billionaire was propagated , with the touching stories of his alleged problems with literacy and periodic lapses into alcoholism .
But is all this really so bad ?
And is Ikea really any different from other big companies run by one strong personality ?
If this is really the " truth about Ikea , " then the Kamprad family seems to have somewhat eccentric ideas , to say the least , about what constitutes a good public image .
After all , the mega - rich are usually known more for their expensive cars , beautiful lovers or charitable activities than a penchant for schnapps and bouts of dyslexia .
But Stenebo's alleged revelations make more sense when considered from the perspective of a prodigal son .
" I love Ingvar and admire his unique genius , " Stenebo says .
The former employee says he is motivated by concerns about the future of the company .
Stenebo accuses Ikea of employing methods akin to those used by the East German secret police , the Stasi .
He details an alleged tight - knit network of informers who were able to contact Kamprad directly at his private home in Switzerland via telephone and fax .
They were expected to regularly update Kamprad on the atmosphere in the company and to pass on personal gossip .
According to Stenebo , the Swedish headquarters of Ikea was apparently shaken by a power battle in the late 1990s , during which time " the spies actively took action to get employees onto Kamprad 's side . "
The conflict went so far that at times there was the feeling that the whole company was " split into factions for and against Ingvar , " Stenebo claims .
None of which goes down very well in Sweden , where the locals would rather seek consensus .
On the executive floor , Stenebo claims , foreigners were repeatly denigrated as " niggers . "
They apparently had no chance of promotion within the company -- something Stenebo blames on Kamprad 's increasing paranoia .
Ikea , in spite of being the world 's largest furniture company , is run exclusively by people from Älmhult in the Swedish region of Smaland -- the small town where Kamprad himself grew up .
" Born on the farm " is how the Swedish describe it .
The importance of blood and place of birth within Ikea is no coincidence , Stenebo claims -- blatant racism exists within the company .
The Teflon Giant
Around the world , Ikea is heralded as a model global corporation .
In a 2001 article , the US newsmagazine Newsweek described the firm as " the prototypical Teflon multinational " because " no charge ever sticks for long . "
However , Stenebo insists that this has more to do with the company 's cynical and underhanded tactics than its supposedly sustainable business model .
Stenebo makes accusations regarding the company 's purchasing practices .
He claims that , while Ikea wants to be seen as a shining example of an eco-friendly company , it also wants guaranteed access to a regular supply of wood .
" The key to Ikea 's low prices is the supply of cheap raw materials , " Stenebo says .
" And Ikea 's furniture is mostly made of wood . "
In politically correct times , collaborating with environmental groups is not just a question of good publicity .
Many wood - producing nations are under constant pressure from the international community .
Nowadays Ikea sources a significant portion of its wood products from China , Stenebo claims .
" I know that even in China you can't buy legal wood for the price that we paid there , " Stenebo says .
However large corporations are often accused of not checking their suppliers ' practices thoroughly enough and of trying to influence environmental activists .
Clothing manufacturers , in particular , are regularly the targets of criticism .
Even if the allegations are true , Ikea would not be an exception in this respect .
Cheaper than a Clean Conscience
Stenebo gives further examples of commonly made allegations against Ikea , from the feathers allegedly plucked from live geese that go to fill the " Gosa " pillows and " Mysa " blankets ( the products ' names are both Swedish words for " cuddle " ) to the carpets in the " Barnslig " ( " child - like " ) range apparently made by Pakistani children .
Here , too , Ikea allegedly makes use of skillfully promoted sponsorships of children 's aid organizations to effectively defend its image .
" The fact of the matter is that a company like Ikea , with its enormous resources , is free to use whichever suppliers they want , " Stenebo says .
" But instead of using the best , they use the cheapest . "
Charitable gestures are cheaper than a clean conscience and have the added advantage of being tax - deductible , Stenebo notes .
But why did Stenebo decide to write the book now ?
Stenebo says that months ago he had a serious argument with Peter Kamprad , the Ikea heir apparent .
It became clear to him , he says , that he had a conscience and that he could no longer ignore it .
" Economic power means a responsibility towards people and the environment , " Stenebo explains .
" Peter does not understand that .
Women and foreigners were excluded and the environment was consciously abused . "
When approached by SPIEGEL ONLINE for a statement regarding Stenebo 's book , Ikea 's press department described the publication as " the views of a private individual . "
They declined to comment on the details of the book .
What about Kamprad himself ?
Also no comment .
Stenebo , on the other hand , is confident that his book has long been on Kamprad 's bedside table .
" Ingvar will be reading the book with his chameleon eyes , " he says .
" He hates me and he loves me . "
The pride in Stenebo 's voice is hard to miss .

Retraction On Nov.12 SPIEGEL
Online ( International ) published a story headlined " Spies and Racism at Ikea ?
Former Executive Writes Shocking Tell - All . "
The original story contained the following claims :
-- " According to Stenebo , since the mid-1990s , Ikea has " muzzled " a number of non-governmental organizations by paying them money .
The author gives the example of Greenpeace . "
-- " Greenpeace then got " a lot of money " for a media project that made other multinationals -- like the giant Finnish paper manufacturer Stora Enso -- look bad . "
-- " When shortly afterward Ikea was apparently responsible for the felling of huge segments of rain forest in the Malaysian part of the island of Borneo , Greenpeace kept their side of the perfidious deal and publicly defended the Swedes , Stenebo says . "
-- " Other well - known NGOs have also benefited from generous donations from Ikea , he claims . "
These statements are untrue and are hereby retracted .

The dollar fell particularly sharply last week , though , as traders were reminded of the patently obvious – that the White House actually wants the dollar to fall .

Treasury officials have lately taken to staring into the TV cameras , puffing out their chests , then stating : " We are committed to a strong dollar . "
That 's nonsense , of course , because a weaker currency boosts US exports and lowers the value of America 's external debt .

Part
One of a series
Barack Obama wo n’t be on the ballot in November of 2010 , but thousands of other candidates will — and he ’ll be very much on their minds .
His public image will shape the American political environment , of course , but plenty of politicians and political professionals on all sides will also look to his ground - breaking online campaign as an inspiration , seeking to replicate his success at using the internet to raise money , find supporters and put people to work in the real world .
But running for state legislature , a congressional seat , a governorship or even the U.S. Senate is different than running for president , and relatively few down - ballot candidates have done much more than dip their toes in the digital waters so far .
That ’s likely to change soon : despite the vast gap between a national race and one for dog-catcher , many of the same online political rules apply and most of the same technologies are available .
Here ’s why state - and local - level campaigns should pay attention to the potential of internet - based politics in 2010 .
1. The Internet is ( Just About ) Everywhere
Regardless of local demographics , the internet can be a factor in almost any election in the U.S.
In wealthier urban and suburban areas , most voters will be online and a majority will have broadband access , but even in far - flung rural areas or poorer parts of cities email at least is usually available .
Not every segment of U.S. society is well - represented online , but the politically active are much more likely to use the internet for news and information than their tuned - out neighbors .
And despite stereotypes , the days of the computer as a young person ’s preserve are long gone — the majority of people 65 and up now connect electronically at least on occasion .
2. Online Fundraising Works
If the 2008 presidential race taught us anything , it ’s that the internet is one hell of a cash machine —
Obama ’s ability to raise as much money as his campaign could reasonably absorb , in part by returning to the small donors who stuck with him again and again through the worst , was decisive .
State and local campaigns are getting more expensive every cycle , a trend that will probably accelerate as campaign finance limits dissolve , and candidates at all levels will likely find themselves turning to online donations to keep up .
But online fundraising does n’t happen by magic — it ’s usually the result of a concerted strategy to make it happen .
Fortunately for us …
3 . The Tools and Techniques are Available to ( Almost ) All
As vendors have developed software suites that scale to match campaigns of different sizes , internet - based fundraising and supporter - management packages are now within reach of almost any political operation .
Best practices for using them are no secret , either , since plenty of strategy guides supplement the clear example of the Obama campaign itself .
The essential tools usually include a website , an email - based Constituent Relations Management system and an online fundraising module , which campaigns can then promote through online social networks , video , blogger outreach , Google Ads and other channels .
4. Targeted Online Outreach + Down - Ballot Candidates = a Perfect Match
Top - level presidential candidates seem to get media attention every time they open their mouths , but the problem for state and local campaigns is more often to get noticed at all .
In races with limited resources and little press coverage , the inherent ability to target most online outreach at low cost can help stretch a tight budget .
In a densely populated urban or suburban area , for instance , broadcast TV advertising is impractical for many campaigns because too many spots will be wasted on viewers outside district lines .
In that case , cheap Google and Facebook ads could work alongside targeted cable TV spots to spread messages and help find supporters , donors and volunteers in a defined geographic area .
Blog outreach may also be more of a priority for a local candidate , since state and regional political blogs ( and Twitter ! ) provide convenient gathering places for political activists .
Like many other forms of social media outreach , blogging and blogger relations are usually cheap financially but expensive in time , a good fit for scrappy campaigns with more enthusiasm than cash .
Regardless of their size , though , just about any campaign can also benefit from having a body of clear , topical and targeted content on the web in a variety of outlets , since voters , bloggers and journalists alike will be turning to Mr. Google for basic information about local races .
5. You May Not Be Online , But Your Opponents Probably Are
Bringing up Google illustrates why modern campaigns ignore the internet at their peril , because their rivals probably are n’t following the same script .
For instance , if you ’re a candidate and your opponents AREN ’T raising money online , they ’re at least posting content that criticizes you , which is going unanswered if you ’re not responding .
Candidates can’t control the online political debate , but they can influence it — in the world of blogs , YouTube , Google and social forwarding , a robust online presence is n’t just an offensive weapon , it ’s also a powerful defense .
The best response to an online attack ?
An established foundation of good content , plus aggressive outreach and a lot of trusted voices speaking on your behalf .
Turnout is Key in Off - Year Elections
With no presidential candidates on the ballot , 2010 voter turnout is likely to plummet from the heights it reached in 2008 .
In an election in which relatively few people vote , identifying your supporters and motivating them to actually show up at the polls is absolutely key .
As we ’ll see in the chapters ahead , online technologies turn out to be perfect for maintaining communications with many people at once and in an affordable way , helping to build the connections that yield donations , volunteer time and ( ultimately ) votes .
Begin at the Very Beginning
Okay , we ’re convinced — so where do state - and local - level candidates start ?
Let ’s look next at the essentials of online political campaigning , including the basic tools and activities involved and the resources needed .
After that , we ’ll talk about using the internet as an outreach tool in competent and creative ways , followed by a special chapter on everyone ’s favorite topic , online fundraising and mobilization .
We ’ll wrap up the series with a sample campaign online outreach plan , plus some resources for further study .
So , on to the tools .

Your Personal Bank 's Right to Set - Off
​
For “ consumers , ” e.g. people whose debt is primarily personal debt accumulated due to the purchase of consumer goods rather than business debt , there are two types of bankruptcy relief available : Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 .
​
A Chapter 7 bankruptcy can be thought of as the “ classic ” or “ traditional ” form of bankruptcy where an individual or a married couple filing jointly , asks the federal bankruptcy court to issue a final court order permanently enjoining his / her / their creditors from attempting to collect the debt owed ; forever .
The “ Order of Discharge ” is the ultimate goal in both a Chapter 7 and a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case ; terminating lawsuits , wage garnishments , accruing interest , late fees and over limit fees .
In just ninety days after filing a petition in bankruptcy , the net result is a Discharge of your unsecured debt , allowing you to move forward without the pressure and disruption of collection efforts , permitting you to save for the future and EARN A FRESH START .
​
A Chapter 7 bankruptcy is usually completed in 90 to 100 days .
A series of documents collectively referred to as a “ petition ” that contain sworn statements and schedules of assets , income , expenses and debt is filed with the court .
You are allowed to keep a generous but limited amount of your assets in order to facilitate your “ fresh start . ”
In most cases , you can keep your home , your cars , your personal belongings , your retirement accounts , the clothes on your back and the food in your refrigerator .
If the value of your assets exceed the statutory limit you may be required to surrender some of those assets to earn a discharge of your debt , or at your option , pay an equivalent value into a Chapter 13 bankruptcy Plan .
​
A Chapter 13 bankruptcy can be thought of as a “ customized ” or “ adjustment of debts for an individual with regular income ” bankruptcy .
In a Chapter 13 bankruptcy , a “ Plan ” is proposed to pay money into a general pot over 36 - 60 months to be distributed by a managing “ Trustee ” .
The Trustee is charged with the responsibility of distributing money from the general pot to priority creditors in full ( past due income taxes , property taxes , past - due house payments , etc. ) and the remainder , on a pro-rata basis , to one ’s unsecured creditors .
When all the payments have been made and all the money is distributed according to the Plan , the bankruptcy court issues a final court order permanently enjoining the unsecured creditors who received less than 100 % of what they were owed from attempting to collect the difference .
​
While making payments into the Plan , the unsecured creditors are prohibited from charging interest , late fees and over limit fees .
The payments they receive through the Trustee ’s distribution are applied 100 % toward principal .
​
In a very real and legal sense , Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcies are identical in their net result : a Discharge of your unsecured debt , allowing you to move forward without the pressure and disruption of collection efforts , permitting you to save for the future and EARN A FRESH START .
The two chapters of bankruptcy available to consumers are identical because the net result is that each of your unsecured creditors end up being treated the same way in either instance .
​
On its face there appears to be two options available to consumers under bankruptcy : Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 .
However , the choice you may end up making will depend on your particular set of circumstances and needs .
For obvious reasons , the majority of people contemplating bankruptcy will logically choose the shortest or quickest path to a Discharge of Debt ; Chapter 7 .
​
While a thorough analysis of your financial status is necessary to come to any final conclusions about which Chapter will benefit you the most , here are some common reasons why you might choose a Chapter 13 payment Plan rather than the more immediate Discharge of Debt available under a Chapter 7 :
​
Appearance of the Ability to Pay ( §707 ( b ) ) Chapter 13
Even if you qualify to file under Chapter 7 you may choose ( or be forced into ) a Chapter 13 if , after balancing your take home pay against your actual , allowed living expenses , you have sufficient net disposable income to pay at least 25 % of your unsecured debt over a 5 year Plan .
Over Median Chapter 13
On October 17 , 2005 Congress enacted the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection
Act which , among other things , implemented an income threshold and means test to create a presumption that people seeking relief under bankruptcy law were abusing their right to do so if they earn gross wages in excess of IRS and Census Bureau standards .
Prior Chapter 7 in Past 8 Years
If you received a discharge of your debt in a Chapter 7 case filed ( not discharged ) less than 8 years ago , you may not file another and must choose a Chapter 13 if you are seeking protection again ( certain other restrictions also apply ) .
Over Exempt Asset Chapter 13
As mentioned above , you are allowed to keep a generous but limited amount of your assets in order to facilitate your “ fresh start . ”
Sometimes the value of one ’s assets exceeds those limits .
If this happens , one of three options is available .
First , you can choose not to file a case in bankruptcy at all .
Try to sell or borrow against your assets and use the money to settle your other debt .
Second ( assuming you qualify ) you can file a Chapter 7 case and surrender the over exempt assets to the Trustee for distribution to you unsecured creditors on a pro rata basis .
Finally , if you would rather not surrender your over exempt assets , you can file a Chapter 13 payment Plan case and , treating your unsecured creditors the same way they would have been treated had you chosen to file a Chapter 7 , pay into the Chapter 13 pot , the same amount that would have been paid for the creditors ’ benefit – the over exempt asset amount – but over time , and in an amount your budget can afford .
“ Save the Home ” Chapter 13
One of the most useful types of Chapter 13 bankruptcy case is the ability to pay back past due house payments over enough time and at a monthly payment amount that your budget can afford and prevent the foreclosure and sale of your home .

Milan President Silvio Berlusconi Punched In The Face
The Italian Prime Minister was knocked to the ground after being attacked at a rally …
AC Milan ’s miserable day has continued after their president Silvio Berlusconi was punched in the face during a political rally this evening .
Berlusconi , who is also Prime Minister of Italy was knocked to the floor during the attack and had blood on his face and lips before he was lifted to his feet by his aides and driven away in his car .
The incident took place outside the Piazza del Duomo , and according to the Ansa News agency a man was arrested at the scene .
There are conflicting reports currently as to whether Berlusconi was punched in the face or had an object thrown at him from point - blank range .
Berlusconi was delivering a speech to his conservative supporters .
Umberto Bossi , head of the far - right Northern League , told Ansa : " What they 've done to Berlusconi is an act of terrorism . ”
Berlusconi ’s popularity in Italian politics has been dwindling recently , and he has also been facing mounting legal problems .
Furthermore , Berlusconi has also lost support among AC Milan fans – many of whom have been pleading with him to sell the club due to lack of investment recently .
The Rossoneri lost 2 - 0 this afternoon to Palermo .

Security pork in Michigan
A long - running preoccupation of mine is the way in which states use " homeland security " grants .
I spent a lot of time looking into this in New York back in 2004 and found that the state had spread the money around to small local police agencies far from any potential terror attack , many of which used it to fight meth or buy pickup trucks for their officers — laudable goals not exactly connected to the mission .
( The pickup trucks were , in theory , to haul trailers full of decontamination equipment to actual terror targets . )
The topic remains a fun one .
A 2008 Michigan inspector general 's report found , among other things , " unauthorized use of an emergency tow vehicle for personal commuting , " and the state 's conservative Mackinac Center for Public Policy filed a freedom - of - information request for more detail .
The state police , clearly eager to turn over the information , is trying to bill the center an eye - popping $ 6,876,303.90 for the documents .
The 2007 - 2008 Global Cooling Event : Evidence for Clouds as the Cause
September 26th , 2009 by Roy W. Spencer , Ph. D .
As I work on finishing our forcing / feedback paper for re-submission to Journal of Geophysical Research – a process that has been going on for months now – I keep finding new pieces of evidence in the data that keep changing the paper ’s focus in small ways .
For instance , yesterday I realized that NASA Langley has recently updated their CERES global radiative budget measurement dataset through 2008 ( it had previously ran from March 2000 through August 2007 ) .
I ’ve been anxiously awaiting this update because of the major global cooling event we saw during late 2007 and early 2008 .
A plot of daily running 91 - day global averages in UAH lower tropospheric ( LT ) temperature anomalies is shown below , which reveals the dramatic 2007 - 08 cool event .
I was especially interested to see if this was caused by a natural increase in low clouds reducing the amount of sunlight absorbed by the climate system .
As readers of my blog know , I believe that most climate change – including “ global warming ” – in the last 100 years or more has been caused by natural changes in low cloud cover , which in turn have been caused by natural , chaotic fluctuations in global circulation patterns in the atmosphere - ocean system .
The leading candidate for this , in my opinion , is the Pacific Decadal Oscillation … possibly augmented by more frequent El Nino activity in the last 30 years .
Now that we have 9 years of CERES data from the Terra satellite , we can more closely examine a possible low cloud connection to climate change .
The next figure shows the changes in the Earth ’s net radiative balance as measured by the Terra CERES system .
By “ net ” I mean the sum of reflected shortwave energy ( sunlight ) , or “ SW ” , and emitted longwave energy ( infrared ) or “ LW ” .
The changes in the radiative balance of the Earth seen above can be thought of conceptually in terms of forcing and feedback , which are combined together in some unknown proportion that varies over time .
Making the interpretation even more uncertain is that some proportion of the feedback is due not only to radiative forcing , but also to non-radiative forcing of temperature change .
So the variations we see in the above chart is the combined result of three processes : ( 1 ) radiative forcing ( both internal and external ) , which can be expected to cause a temperature change ; ( 2 ) radiative feedback upon any radiatively forced temperature changes ; and ( 3 ) radiative feedback upon any NON - radiatively forced temperature changes ( e.g. , from tropical intraseasonal oscillations in rainfall ) .
It turns out that feedback can only be uniquely measured in response to NON - radiatively forced temperature changes , but that ’s a different discussion .
The SW component of the total flux measured by CERES looks like this …note the large spike upward in reflected sunlight coinciding with the late 2007 cooling :
And here ’s the LW ( infrared ) component … note the very low emission late in 2007 , a portion of which must be from the colder atmosphere emitting less infrared radiation .
As I discuss at length in the paper I am preparing , the physical interpretation of which of these 3 processes is dominant is helped by drawing a phase space diagram of the Net ( LW +SW ) radiative flux anomalies versus temperature anomalies ( now shown as monthly running 3 - month averages ) , which shows that the 2007 - 08 cooling event has a classic radiative forcing signature :
The spiral ( or loop ) pattern is the result of the fact that the temperature response of the ocean lags the forcing .
This is in contrast to feedback , a process for which there is no time lag .
The dashed line represents the feedback I believe to be operating in the climate system on these interannual ( year - to - year ) time scales , around 6 W m - 2 K - 1 as we published in 2007 … and as Lindzen and Choi ( 2009 ) recently published from the older Earth Radiation Budget Satellite data .
The ability to separate forcing from feedback is crucial in the global warming debate .
While this signature of internal radiative forcing of the 2007 - 08 event is clear , it is not possible to determine the feedback in response to that temperature change – it ’s signature is overwhelmed by the radiative forcing .
Since the fluctuations in Net ( LW+SW ) radiative flux are a combination of forcing and feedback , we can use the tropospheric temperature variations to remove an estimate of the feedback component in order to isolate the forcing .
[ While experts will questions this step , it is entirely consistent with the procedures of Forster and Gregory ( 2006 J. Climate ) and Forster and Taylor ( 2006 J. of Climate ) , who subtracted known radiative forcings from the total flux to isolate the feedback ] .
The method is simple :
The forcing equals the Net flux minus the feedback parameter ( 6 W m - 2 K - 1 ) times the LT temperature variations shown in the first figure above .
The result looks like this :
What we see are 3 major peaks in radiant energy loss forcing the system : in 2000 , 2004 , and late 2007 .
If you look at the features in the separate SW and LW plots above , it is obvious the main signature is in the SW … probably due to natural increases in cloud cover , mostly low clouds , causing internal radiative forcing of the system
If we instead assume a much smaller feedback parameter , say in the mid-range of what the IPCC models exhibit , 1.5 W m - 2 K - 1 , then the estimate of the radiative forcing looks like this :
Note the trend lines in either case show a net increase of at least 1 W m - 2 in the radiant energy entering the climate system .
The anthropogenic greenhouse gas component of this would be ( I believe ) about 0.4 W m - 2 , or a little less that half .
I ’ll update this if someone gives me a better estimate .
So , what might all of this mean in the climate debate ?
First , nature can cause some pretty substantial forcings … what if these occur on the time scales associated with global warming ( decades to centuries ) ?
But what is really curious is that the 9 - year change in radiative forcing ( warming influence ) of the system seen in the last two figures is at least TWICE that expected from the carbon dioxide component alone , and yet essentially no warming has occurred over that period ( see first illustration above ) .
How could this be , if the climate system is as sensitive as the IPCC claims it to be ?

New York Times and Automobile contributor Ezra Dyer may have found the perfect German exotic for New England winters : the Audi R8 .
True , the R8 is pretty low to the ground , but it also makes good use of Audi 's superb Quattro all - wheel drive system and thanks to its mid-engine layout much of the weight sits over the rear wheels .
But even the best AWD is useless when providing spin for four summer tires , so the snow white model Dyer was piloting around the northeast winter wonderland also had four of the widest winter tires you can find .
Hit the jump to watch Dyer as he plows through his snowy driveway in pursuit of some " important " shopping .
We 're pretty impressed with how the four - ringed , mid-engine thoroughbred handled the white stuff even when the pedal hit metal .
We 're just wondering what Dyer needed so badly from Bed Bath and Beyond .

Mr Putin has criticised the original US missile shield plans US plans for a missile defence shield are holding up a new nuclear disarmament treaty , Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said .
Russia and the US are yet to find a successor to the Cold War-era Start I treaty , which expired on 5 December .
Analysts say Moscow wants a clause in the new treaty that would limit the scale of any US defence shield .
The US has shelved plans for missile defence stations in Central Europe , but intends to use a sea - based system .
Asked by a reporter what was the biggest problem blocking a new treaty , Mr Putin said : " What is the problem ?
The problem is that our American partners are building an anti-missile shield and we are not building one . "
" By building such an umbrella over themselves , our [ US ] partners could feel themselves fully secure and will do whatever they want , which upsets the balance , " the Russian premier added .
ANALYSIS Rupert Wingfield - Hayes , BBC Moscow correspondent Russia 's government said until just a few days ago that these strategic arms reduction treaty talks were in their final stages , that they were perhaps just a couple of weeks away from signing a new document .
And now suddenly Mr Putin has come out with this statement , which really does put a spanner in the works .
It shows just how nervous Russia is about the idea of a US missile defence shield , despite the fact President Obama in September said they were going to scrap land - based missile defence in Europe .
The US plans to build another system ; the Russians do n't know exactly how that 's going to affect them and how it may neutralise their nuclear deterrent .
I think Mr Putin is voicing a concern that is held by many experts in this country .
He said that " to preserve the balance , we must develop offensive weapons systems " , but did not specify what kinds he had in mind .
Earlier this month , President Dmitry Medvedev said Russia would continue to develop new warheads , delivery vehicles and launchers despite the disarmament talks , describing this as " routine practice " .
Russia and the US are negotiating in Geneva on the details of a new treaty .
Last week , the Russian foreign minister said a deal was very close .
The 1991 Start I treaty led to deep cuts in nuclear arsenals by Washington and Moscow .
Both sides have agreed to continue observing Start I until they reach a new agreement .
Under a joint understanding signed in July , deployed nuclear warheads should be cut to fewer than 1,700 on each side within seven years of a new treaty - a huge cut on Soviet - era levels .
Nonetheless , between them the two countries will retain enough firepower to destroy the world several times over .
The BBC's Rupert Wingfield - Hayes in Moscow says that Russia 's nuclear arsenal is the only part of its military that remains world - class , and therefore it fears that it could be disadvantaged by cuts to nuclear capability .
Mr Putin 's comments could be a negotiating ploy , rather than a reversal of Russia 's commitment to a treaty , our correspondent says .
Analysts in Moscow think what Mr Putin really wants is a commitment from Washington to only deploy a small scale missile defence system , that would be effective against Iran and North Korea but would not neutralise Russia 's nuclear missile force , he adds .

People caught with “ legal highs ” like mephedrone face being arrested and having their homes searched .
Senior officers say the chemicals will be treated as illegal until tests show otherwise as they try to protect young people from using dangerous drugs which have not been banned .
The warning comes after health scares over a legal high drug craze in which mephedrone and other substances available over the counter or on the internet have soared in popularity .
The Argus reported claims last month that children as young as 12 or 13 are using mephedrone , some on school buses .
In Brighton and Hove officers are working with the NHS and city council to teach children about mephedrone as part of drugs education in schools and encourage young people with a problem to seek help .
Where people are found with drugs , police say they will be arrested on suspicion of possession controlled drugs until tests show the substances are not illegal .
Legal highs like mephedrone are not prohibited under the Misuse of Drugs Act - but it is illegal to sell them for human consumption .
Shops get around this by labelling them for other uses .
Mephedrone is sold as a plant food , costing as little as £ 7 a gram .
The Home Office said mephedrone is being reviewed by the independent Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs .
If experts recommend it should be banned , they could be made illegal by the end of next year .
Harmonix who are the makers of The Beatles : Rock Band and of course the original Rock Band are soon be releasing the new Rock Band 3 .
So far there has been a lot of talk that users are slowly getting a little bit bored of the games , because they cant see how Harmonix can beat The Beatles Rock Band game .
Dhani Harrison , son of Beatles ‘ George Harrison has let a little secret slip out as most musicians do during interviews , whether it ’s on purpose or not .
According to an interview with the Chicago Tribune , Harrison ( who also helped develop The Beatles : Rock Band ) shared the fact that Rock Band 3 may be more than just a game to scratch the surface of the brain .
Rock Band 3 may actually teach non-musicians how to play real instruments !
We ’ve all played Guitar Hero before .
They ’re just a bunch of buttons you have to click in synchronization with what you see on the screen .
Rock Band 3 will somehow go beyond that since Harrison states :
“ I ’m workin on [ … ] making the controllers more real so people can actually learn how to play music while playing the game . [… ]
Give me a couple years , it ’s going to happen . ”
This may also explain why Scott Guthrie told IGN that the Rock Band empire was in for some drastic changes :
“ We are n’t standing still – we will keep moving into new areas and look at new technologies that our platform holder partners are also developing , such as Project Natal from Microsoft . ”
Do n’t expect a new tracklist to be your final news for Rock Band 3 .
If they actually pull this off , it might take a lot longer and be a lot harder .

Lysol douche ad from March 1948
In an earlier era , officially , only married people were supposed to practice sex , and thus be concerned with the effects of genital odor ( although it , good and bad , is detectable in public ) , except for menstrual odor , which was everybody 's concern - and still is ( read what causes it ) .
Squirting Lysol up the vagina made it a bacteria - poor container , all set to let the stronger , surviving organisms multiply and cause problems worse than odor , and eliminating the healthy bacteria that are inhabitants of the vagina .
And , of course , the odor in the first place may have indicated serious problems , problems for the doctor , not Lysol .
Women also used Lysol as a birth - control device , douching with it to kill sperm .
Andrea Tone , in Devices & Desires ( 2001 , Hill & Wang ) , writes of the vaginas that the liquid burned , as does the book Facts and Frauds in Woman 's Hygiene , from 1936 .
See another Lysol douche liquid ad , from 1928 .
But see a letter from an 89 - year - old Canadian woman who started douching with Lysol at 17 , in the February 2005 MUM News .

Thanks to a new , wired undersea observatory , when it comes to exploring the deep blue sea , there will be no more of this tethered buoy business or taking ships out to upload data from brief time snapshots taken by instruments .
The NEPTUNE network set to go online Tuesday will stream data from hundreds of undersea instruments and sensors direct from the Pacific Ocean floor to the Internet 24/ 7 , year - round .
The network is expected to produce 50 terabytes of data annually , all of which will inform scientists about everything from earthquake dynamics to the effects of climate change on the water column , and from deep - sea ecosystems to salmon migration .
" It 's revolutionary in that it brings two new components into the ocean environment , which are power and high - bandwidth Internet , " says Project Director Chris Barnes , from the project 's offices at the University of Victoria in British Columbia .
" We 're really on the verge of wiring the oceans . "
After the Hubble Space Telescope was lofted into orbit , astronomers gained their clearest view of space yet , one freed from the murky atmosphere .
" That has transformed how astronomers do their science in the same way that we believe the cabled networks will be changing the way ocean scientists do their science , " Barnes explains .
" We happen to have on our coast here just a wealth of processes that characterize many many parts of the world 's oceans , " Barnes says .
NEPTUNE has several larger scientific themes .
Its sensors will monitor earthquake dynamics in greater detail , including tsunamis and crustal processes .
( Recently NEPTUNE 's deep - sea instrument array detected a tsunami generated from the magnitude 8.0 Samoan earthquake on September 29 . )
NEPTUNE will also study the extensive gas hydrate deposits that lie along the continental margin .
No one knows yet whether these gas hydrates represent either a potential energy source or a source of greenhouse gas emissions that could exacerbate global warming , Barnes says .
" There 's a real need to understand those processes . "
NEPTUNE 's network will also examine the effect of deep - sea fishing on benthic communities .
Humans fish down to about 1,200 meters but the tendency has been to keep fishing deeper and deeper , Barnes says .
" We know so little about how life exists down there . "
The " fire hose of information , " as Barnes calls it , will be tailored for public and academic consumption , and its initiation marks the culmination of an $ 8 - million , eight - year undertaking .

FORWARD OPERATING BASE MAREZ , Iraq 
When the 101st Airborne Division captured this base back in 2003 , an American tank blasted the turret off a T - 72 tank , catapulting it into the side of St. Elijah ’s Monastery .
The force buckled a wall of mortar and stone that had stood for more than 1,000 years here in one of the earliest redoubts of Christianity .
Such is the tragedy of war .
The division then made the site a garrison and painted its emblem on the stucco above the low door to the monastery ’s chapel .
The insignia remained there until a chaplain contemplated the righteousness of having “ Screaming Eagles ” adorn a house of God .
Image Maj. Jeffrey Whorton , a Roman Catholic chaplain , celebrating Mass at St. Elijah ’s Monastery near Mosul in northern Iraq .

“ That ’s not right , ” the chaplain said , as the story goes .
Thus began the accidental American stewardship of St. Elijah ’s , an ancient site of Christian worship and martyrdom now stuck in the middle of a sprawling military base just south of Mosul , in northern Iraq .
Consider the cruel plight of model Lara Stone .
Although she wears , at most , a U.S. size 4 , the fact that she has breasts means that — well , nobody in fashion calls her ' fat ' exactly , but ...
Advertisement
The way Stone is talked about in this Vogue story — cover line " When Size 4 Is Too Big : A Curvy Model 's Struggle To Fit In " — you 'd almost think she was a plus - size model instead of a girl with the highly typical ( for a straight - size model ) measurements 33 " - 24 " - 35 " .
Writes Rebecca Johnson :
' What they say is ' curvy , ' but you know they mean fat , " says Lara Stone , who is Dutch and so soft - spoken , you have to lean forward to hear what she 's saying .
However , she enunciates that word — fat — clearly and forcefully , as if it were caught at the back of her throat .
The word hovers over the din of the hotel lobby where we are seated in downtown Manhattan , laced with irony and just a tinge of bitterness .
Advertisement
So that 's 11 rather straightforward words from Stone , and 59 words from Vogue about what Stone said .
( I guess when a word , having at last dislodged itself from the subject 's throat , literally flies out of her mouth and floats in the air of a hotel lobby , it requires special treatment .
Did she fling her arms in the air , too , Vogue ?
Because limb amputation sounds almost as painful as reading that sentence ! )
Anyway :
Worse than being called fat is a gaggle of stylists whispering in a corner after you 've been trying on clothes for ten minutes .
" That , " she says , " is when I know I 'm about to be canceled . "

And even now that her position in fashion 's firmament ought to be secure , given she has earned Karl Lagerfeld 's favor , worked with the world 's top photographers , and been on multiple covers of British , French , and American Vogue , she still encounters narrow - minded folks who make her feel like " the odd one out . "
" I was on a shoot just last week , " Stone told Johnson , " and the stylist took out this tight corset dress and said , ' Here , put it on , ' and I was like , ' Who are you kidding ? '
There was no way , so that was very rude of her .
It 's like , come on , she 's a woman ; whether you 're buying jeans at the mall or wearing couture , you know what it 's like for clothes not to fit .
It 's not an easy kind of rejection , because it 's very personal .
It 's you , your body .
You take it to heart . "
What I guess a lot of people do n't realize is that modeling is just manual labor with fancier clothes .
The work is deeply bodily , and therefore the division between you and your work dissolves : everything you wear , how you present yourself , how you walk , every product you put on your face , every haircut , and , mostly , everything you put in your mouth , impacts your career .
It is automatically a professional choice , not a personal one .
There is no meaningful work / life balance , because your body is your work .
Of course , women outside of the modeling industry have long been told that their bodies need to be their " work , " too : that we all need to obsess over our arms and abs and thighs and do 30 squats on our lunch breaks and always take the stairs and use the Shake Weight and join gyms and buy athleticwear and Lose 12 lbs Before Sunday .
It 's just that for models , these imperatives are professional .
Living is work .
And that can kinda mess with your head .

Stone herself , being unable to budge from what must be her set point weight range with diet and exercise , began taking pills to lose inches .
" But they made my heart race , " she reports .
So she started drinking .
Nobody noticed , and her work did n't suffer , but soon she was waking up with the shakes .
Stone did a month of rehab in January — the longest she 'd spent in one place at a stretch in the two years since her career kicked into hyperdrive , she told British Vogue — and has not had a drink since .

What is elided in these kinds of stories that trumpet Lara Stone 's " curves " and proclaim her to be a size 4 — because we all know clothing sizes are meaningful and consistent nation - wide standards , oh wait — is that Stone differs so barely , so incredibly tinily merely , so very little , from the accepted size standard for fashion models .
She is slightly shorter , at 5 ' 7 " , than most runway models , and her measurements are well within fashion 's preferred range .
While it 's undeniable that she has a slightly different body shape than most models , her size is entirely typical of the industry .
( Technically , her stated hip measurement , 35 " , is about 1 " larger than the 34 " it " should " be for her to model , but there are dozens of other models who have worked , and done the show circuit , with hips of Stone 's size . )
It 's all well and good to call her the " curvy " model , and it is obvious from her runway work and every nude shoot she 's ever done that Stone has breasts .
When she slings one hip out , like for the photo accompanying this Vogue story , sure , she can indeed look kind of voluptuous .
( When she does n't , she does n't : Would you call her the " curvy " one in this Givenchy campaign ? )
These stories never make clear that Stone veers from the accepted modeling standards only every so slightly , and that booking her for a shoot or a campaign is not some revolutionary act of body diversity .
If anything , the fact that she is seen as a different kind of model for her size is the ultimate indictment of the fashion industry 's standards .
But Vogue would never make that point .

An item on Fashionista this morning points to two actual plus - size models , Crystal Renn and Amy Lemons , who are both busy working in Europe .
Renn — whose struggle with anorexia and exercise bulimia is documented in her recently released memoir , Hungry — apparently went blonde for a shoot for Italian Vanity Fair , and Lemons , who also began her career as a straight - size model , is working for French Elle with the photographer Tesh .
Her spread is apparently over 30 pages , and includes cover tries .
Lara Stone is a fantastic model .
I love a lot of her work .
But seeing a plus - size model on the cover of a major fashion magazine , now that would be a real sign of change .
Yes , plus - size models are still models , and the fashion industry still makes its money presenting women with images to aspire to that are , for most , unattainable and unrealistic .
But if we can change the parameters of the beauty standard even just enough to accommodate tall , enviably proportioned young women who do n't have 23 " waists , then I 'd still call that progress of a kind .

Fittingly , Fashionista asks : Italian Vanity Fair and French Elle are great , but where are the U.S. magazines ?
Aside from Glamour 's admirable commitment to using plus - size models consistently in fashion spreads from issue to issue , and V's forthcoming January special issue , what is going at American Vogue , Elle , and Harper 's Bazaar ?
Will we see a plus - size model in a fashion spread in an American magazine that is n't trudging through the clichés of its obligatory annual Love Your Shape issue ?
I have a feeling — call it blogger 's intuition — that it might happen sooner than you think .

PARIS , France —
The last chunk of Iron Curtain — Ceausescu ’s Romania — suddenly teetered in December 1989 .
By Christmas , it was a blood - spattered , rusted relic .
On the morning of Dec. 21 , from a balcony above a massive crowd , Nicolae Ceausescu droned on about his own glory .
Muttering below erupted into an angry roar .
Days earlier , troops had brutally quelled an uprising near the Yugoslav border .
Rumors of massacre turned many against the megalomaniac who had ruled them for decades .
The crowd surged forward , and the durable dictator took half a step backward .
Watching on television in Paris , I felt the electricity .
The balance of fear had shifted .
I ran to the Associated Press photo desk .
Within an hour , we organized a charter flight to Bucharest .
The French military cleared us .
We did not ask the Romanians .
As our aircraft approached the pitch - dark Bucharest airport , landing lights switched on .
At the immigration desk , an officer stared at me without saying a word .
“ How are things going ? ” I asked .
“ Better now , ” he replied , and he stamped my passport .
Our little band from Paris and another from Rome commandeered a bus to the outskirts of the city .
Several of us flagged down a battered little Dacia .
We asked the driver what was happening .
“ Oh , ” he replied with a wide grin , “ a small revolution in a small place . ”
We found our way to the 13 - story state television tower , freshly renamed Free Romania Television , under heavy siege by Ceausescu ’s holdout militia , the Securitate .
A National Salvation Committee had claimed power and was holed up on the third floor as rocket - propelled grenades blew away entire rooms above them .
For days , Securitate snipers picked off Romanians , who dashed across downtown streets and dove for cover .
Scared kids who had never held a rifle manned roadblocks .
At the hospitals we counted corpses and interviewed survivors .
“ Democracy , freedom , ” one teenager said to me .
“ I just want to savor those words in my mouth . ”
We toured Ceausescu ’s palace , the largest building in Europe , and the publishing house that translated his silly thoughts , in mountains of books , into a dozen languages .
At the secret room where people believed police bugged every conversation in Romania we found six open - reel tape recorders , some broken , and a bank of old Soviet phones .
The television station was heart of it all .
It broke from Stalinist propaganda on that first day , when army units joined protesters to send Ceausescu fleeing for his life .
" We 've won .
We 've won , " poet Murica Dinescu shouted into the camera .
Early the next morning , news editor Victor Ionescu announced on the air : " We are under attack . "
He urged people to rally outside the TV tower in a human shield .
Immediately , a crowd formed .
People chanted , " Freedom ! Freedom ! " until gunfire broke out .
They scattered and regrouped .
They shouted , " We wo n't go ! " and they did n't .
A ragtag platoon of defenders drove back the assault .
Later that weekend , Securitate remnants struck again .
Infiltrators stabbed people in the hallways , killing three .
For a few hours , TV screens went blank .
But that was only a technical glitch .
Romania was governed from a hectic studio littered with empty bottles , cracked mugs and half - eaten sandwiches , run by people who did not sleep for days .
“ It is madness here , madness , " said Gratiela Ripeanu , whose external relations job under the old regime had consisted mainly of shaking hands with fraternal Bulgarians .
She shepherded countless foreign TV crews through an obstacle course of gun barrels , roiling crowds and skittish guards who looked for explosives in ballpoint pen refills .
Six body searches separated the street from the studio .
" We do n't know what we are doing anymore , but we 're doing it , " she said .
Elena Maria Ionescu , a news writer and Victor 's wife , helped out in the studio , partly because her office was a gaping hole in the eighth floor .
Section chiefs and janitors alike beamed with pride at the unflickering image they broadcast across the fearful nation .
In the face of rumors and threats , the reassuring voices on television maintained momentum .
Unlikely heroes emerged .
Marin Constantin , who edited youth programs , took it upon himself to make sure the eighth - floor occupants made it through the night .
When the shooting started , he herded everyone into a hallway protected from ricochet .
Finding no way to douse the ceiling lights , he deftly smashed them with a chair .
When heavy fighting began , his grin broadened .
To buck up spirits , he sang an old national hymn that was almost forgotten during Ceausescu 's reign :
" Wake up , Romania , from the mortal sleep into which you have been lulled by the evil tyrant . "
By Christmas morning , Bucharest bristled with Ceausescu reports .
He and his wife were captured on the way to the Soviet border .
But were they ?
Would he fight back ?
Then Free Romanian Television delivered the coup de grace , a last look at Ceausescu , pierced with executioners ’ bullets in an upcountry courtyard .
Of the old Evil Empire , only the Soviet Union remained .

Yahoo , the internet corporation notorious for helping China implement totalitarian censorship of the web , has instructed its lawyers to go after Cryptome , a site that functions as a repository for information about freedom of speech , cryptography , spying , and surveillance .
Yahoo , Google , MSN and other large commercial web search engines routinely collect IP addresses .
Michael T. Gershberg of the law firm Steptoe & Johnson sent a DMCA takedown notice to John Young , Cryptome webmaster , on December 3 .
The law firm claims that Cryptome has violated Yahoo ’s intellectual property rights and copyright by posting Yahoo ’s Compliance Guide for Law Enforcement .
Young has refused to remove the document from his website .
The takedown order is posted on the Cryptome website .
The 17 page guide describes Yahoo ’s data retention policies and the surveillance capabilities it offers law enforcement .
The guide reveals how Yahoo retains the IP addresses from users who login to its site for a year .
Yahoo instant message logs are retained for 45 to 60 days and include an account holder ’s friends list and the date and times the user communicated with them , according to Kim Zetter of Wired .
Yahoo charges the government about $ 30 to $ 40 for the contents , including e-mail , of a subscriber ’s account , and charges $ 40 to $ 80 for the contents of a Yahoo group , according to a price list included in the leaked document .
“ I cannot find at the Copyright Office a grant of copyright for the Yahoo spying document hosted on Cryptome , ” Young responded defiantly to the takedown order .
To assure readers Yahoo ’s copyright claim is valid and not another hoary bluff without substantiation so common under DMCA bombast please send a copy of the copyright grant for publication on Cryptome .
Until Yahoo provides proof of copyright , the document will remain available to the public for it provides information that is in the public interest about Yahoo ’s contradictory privacy policy and should remain a topic of public debate on ISP unacknowledged spying complicity with officials for lucrative fees .
“ Yahoo ’s exclamation point is surely trademarked so omitted here , ” he sarcastically concluded .
[ efoods ]
Yahoo ’s law firm demanded the guide be removed by 12:00 pm Eastern time on December 3 .
Indiana University graduate student Christopher Soghoian had earlier asked all agencies within the Department of Justice , under a Freedom of Information Act ( FOIA ) request , to provide him with a copy of the pricing list supplied by telecoms and internet service providers for the surveillance services they offer government agencies , according to Wired .
Verizon and Yahoo filed an objection to the FOIA request on the grounds the information was proprietary and that the companies would be ridiculed and publicly shamed were their surveillance price sheets made public .
Yahoo , Google , MSN and other large commercial web search engines routinely collect IP addresses along with search query analysis and use persistent cookies which do not expire for a long period of time .
Cookies are small text files stored on a user ’s computer and contain information such as user preferences , shopping cart contents , the identifier for a server - based session , or other data used by websites .

With all rallies canceled , the antiflu measures were expected to have an immediate impact on the campaign for Ukraine ’s presidency .
The election is on Jan. 17 , and Ms. Tymoshenko formally registered as a candidate on Saturday .
The virus is spreading across Eastern Europe , but it was not clear why Ms. Tymoshenko chose to undertake stronger moves , like closing schools nationwide , than her counterparts in Russia and Poland .
There were indications , however , that the government ’s response was being influenced by electoral politics .
Ms. Tymoshenko , one of the leading candidates , and her bitter rival , President Viktor A. Yushchenko , who is far behind in polls in his bid for re-election , both sought to make clear that they were aggressively addressing the outbreak .
On Friday , Mr. Yushchenko criticized Ms. Tymoshenko , saying he had ordered an inquiry into why the country was not , in his opinion , prepared .

WASHINGTON 
The international security company formerly called Blackwater Worldwide is facing large government fines for unlicensed arms shipments to Iraq , as a key Congressional committee is asking for a separate investigation into whether the company bribed Iraqi officials .
In talks likely to result in millions of dollars in penalties , executives from the company , now known as Xe Services , are negotiating with government regulators over years of violations of export laws .
According to government officials and former company employees , many of the violations involve arms shipments to Iraq , to outfit company security guards operating inside the country .
In addition , former company officials say that other penalties could result from violations of licensing requirements for the transfer of other forms of military technology and training expertise to foreign countries .
Senator John Kerry , the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , wrote in a letter on Wednesday that his committee was told by a top State Department official that the company had engaged in “ broad violations ” of export laws and that the unlicensed shipments “ went beyond weapons for personal use . ”

Tony Blair was urged by a senior British officer two days before the invasion of Iraq to delay the military offensive because preparations for dealing with the aftermath were not ready , it was revealed at the Chilcot inquiry today .
Concern about the legality of the invasion and its cost , combined with a complete lack of focus in Whitehall , prevented the Blair government from preparing adequately for the consequences in Iraq , the inquiry heard .
Major General Tim Cross , the only UK military official appointed to help plan the invasion aftermath , delivered a severe indictment of Whitehall 's failures .
" There were serious concerns about legality and over money , " he said .
The Blair government was reluctant to sign up to the US body responsible for postwar planning for fear of being " liable under international law " , he added .
Cross , who was attached to the Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance , set up by the US to manage the aftermath , described the preparations as " woefully thin " .
In a written statement , he said he had briefed Tony Blair at No 10 on 18 March 2003 , two days before the invasion .
" We talked for about 30 minutes or so .
I was as honest about the positions as I could be , essentially briefing that I did not believe postwar planning was anywhere near ready , " said Cross .
" I told him that there was no clarity on what was going to be needed after the military phase of the operation , nor who would provide it .
" Although I was confident that we would secure a military victory , I offered my view that we should not begin that campaign until we had a much more coherent postwar plan . "
Describing his meeting with Blair in oral evidence , Cross said : " He was engaged .
I gave him the background of what we had been doing .
We had a very sensible conversation .
At the end of it I remember saying , in so many words , I had no doubt we will win in the military .
I do not believe we are ready for postwar Iraq .
" He nodded and did n't say anything particular .
I did n't expect him to look me in the eye and say , ' This is terrible , we are going to pull the whole thing off . '
I was just one of a number of people briefing him . "
Cross added : " I hesitate to say I used the word ' disaster ' .
I may well have used the word ' chaotic ' . "
Cross confirmed what the inquiry was told by Lord Boyce , then chief of the defence staff – that the government also delayed military preparations because it did not want the public to know it was planning for war .
Cross described how in the weeks before the invasion there was " no minister of cabinet rank driving this from day to day " .
He continued : " I felt very isolated .
There was no sense diaries were being cleared even for war fighting . "
Cross told the inquiry in his written statement : " Not everyone believed that there would actually be a war ; if there was to be one , then there was certainly no consensus that we ( the UK ) should be involved ; there was no coherent UK … view of what postwar Iraq should look like ; there was a serious reluctance to take on the US over their views … there was therefore some seriously wishful and woolly and ' unjoined ' up thinking going on . "
Cross referred to concern about the costs of rebuilding Iraq in the Treasury and in the international development department , under Clare Short , where officials were also worried about the legality of the invasion .
Short resigned shortly after the invasion .
" I am starting to get into rough times financially .
My
mortgage is going up an extra 900 a month leaving my
mortgage to $ 3400 a month .
My bills monthly with
everything food , gas , utilities , etc. total to almost
6800 a month .
credit card bills are 800 a month .
My
husband and my income total together is only 4500 a
month .
We made bad decisions by refinancing alot in
the last two years and the closing cost , prepayment
penalty fees ate up alot of our equity .
I paid off our
cards and unfortunately have run them up again to get
cash to pay bills and stuff .
We will now just be
concentrating on paying our mortgage and some bills
and I have been trying to get an extra job with no
success .
So my credit card bills will be behind in a
couple of months and unless a miracle happens , it will
be delinquent .
I want to know what I should do .
If I
should just pay what I can monthly or claim
bankruptcy ?
Total CC bills is 30,000 .
Please advice . "
